That&#8217;s especially the case for lower budgeted, direct-to-video action fare that can&#8217;t afford stunning locales, big stars, and killer production design. <strong><em>Jiu-Jitsu</em></strong> is the latest entry into the DTV action landscape, and while it neglects to include any jiu-jitsu (more on that later) it does give viewers plenty of action beats and a few fun thrills.</p>\n<p>A comet heads towards Earth, but don&#8217;t worry about that. Down on the surface, a man named Jake (<strong>Alain Moussi</strong>) is running through a jungle in Myanmar with an invisible-ish, <em>Predator</em>-cosplayer in hot pursuit. Knocked unconscious in a fall, he awakes in military custody before being rescued by Kueng (<strong>Tony Jaa</strong>) and reintroduced to the fighter squad he can&#8217;t remember including Harrigan (<strong>Frank Grillo</strong>), Sand (<strong>Rick Yune</strong>), and Carmen (<strong>JuJu Chan</strong>). He soon discovers &#8212; well, maybe not soon as it actually takes several conversations, geographical jumps, and the introduction of Wylie (<strong>Nicolas Cage</strong>), but he eventually discovers &#8212; that he&#8217;s part of a defense force chosen to save Earth from destruction. Every six years an alien fighter named Brax arrives demanding a &#8220;fair&#8221; fight, and if he&#8217;s satisfied or beaten, the Earth is safe for another six years.</p>\n<p><em>Jiu Jitsu</em>, from director/co-writer <strong>Dimitri Logothetis</strong> and co-writer <strong>Jim McGrath</strong>, is the kind of silly action/sci-fi fare the late 80s/early 90s used to deliver on a regular basis &#8212; a goofy but engaging plot grounded with affordable settings and performers but made memorable through a steady flow of competent action sequences. Logothetis manages just that here with the added bonus of some truly talented fighters in Moussi, Jaa, and Chan. None of it is enough to raise the film above the level of a <em>Cyborg</em> (1989) or a <em>Project Metalbeast</em> (1995), but it&#8217;s an entertaining enough diversion for action fans. What it isn&#8217;t, though, is even slightly related to jiu-Jitsu.</p>\n<p>This is admittedly a point that others won&#8217;t be as stuck on, but if you&#8217;re going to call your film <em>Jiu Jitsu</em> and talk about how an alien brought the fighting style to Earth &#8212; maybe let some of your characters actually use jiu-jitsu? The martial arts style, particularly in its Brazilian form, isn&#8217;t interested in hitting or kicking (and definitely isn&#8217;t keen on automatic weapons) as it&#8217;s instead a grappling-heavy technique used to disarm and disable opponents through leverage and physical manipulation. We get none of that here, and that&#8217;s despite someone saying &#8220;Just remember the one thing you always have with jiu-Jitsu&#8230; leverage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To be fair, the action we do get is thrilling enough to warrant a watch with its combination of fights and gunplay. As mentioned, at least three of the cast members here are talented, entertaining fighters busting loose in well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat, and Logothetis does a solid job capturing much of it with clarity. There are some missteps including a brief but weird diversion into first-person POV at one point &#8212; that temporarily shifts back to normal before returning to the character&#8217;s POV again &#8212; that&#8217;s more distracting than successful, as well as the overuse of speed-ramping during some moves. Jaa gets a fun enough &#8220;single take&#8221; assault through an enemy-heavy compound, though, and Cage&#8217;s fighting double is entertaining too.</p>\n<p>If the action and cast are the reasons to watch <em>Jiu Jitsu</em>, then the script, editing, and reliance on CG (gunfire, smoke, dust, fire, etc) are the reasons why it ultimately fails to impress. A silly story is one thing, but it takes its premise so seriously that it stumbles beneath attempts to explain and justify itself. Brax travels thousands of light-years to get here&#8230; every six years? He fights nine people with his super-advanced armory, but if they bring in soldiers it&#8217;s cheating? He cares about fairness? &#8220;Who the hell are those Jedi Knights who just took out my unit?&#8221; says one character, but none of them have seen <em>Predator</em>? &#8220;You are right this minute where he wants you to be, and it is over,&#8221; says Wylie. &#8220;Ball in net. Game match set. Checkmate.&#8221; Did no one realize that Cage messed up &#8220;game set match?!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Editing is wonky with characters appearing and disappearing during scenes or suddenly arriving in seemingly distant locales despite traveling on foot. Some of that is presumably due to not having all of the name actors on set at the same time at all times, but it makes for some clunky sequences. Inconsistent use of comic panels and some terribly unfunny comic relief (sorry <strong>Eddie Steeples</strong>) add to the wobbly tone where things are deadly serious until they&#8217;re not.</p>\n<p><em>Jiu Jitsu</em> is nonsense &#8212; and I wish them luck having already declared this as the start of a new franchise &#8212; but action fans will be satiated by a talented cast kicking butt across fairly nondescript landscapes. The plot is more convoluted than it needs to be, and budget limitations are evident, but hey, Cage makes the <em>Face/Off</em> (1997) gesture while wearing a mad smile, so that&#8217;s gotta count for something.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/KYXlIIIdSIE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 22:19:53 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b9275fc7b0aad5df85b8251b5496ccce","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/KYXlIIIdSIE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn39@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-49-298_3a70c199c7a90c0d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591520041},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:40","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:40","title":"‘Jurassic Park’ and the Narrative Power of Scale","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359664","description":"\n<p id=\"block-6f00726e-27c0-4c3f-977d-0d878230e87b\"><em>Welcome to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video sharing what Jurassic Park can teach us about scale and composition.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>There is so much to admire about the original <strong><em>Jurassic Park</em> </strong>that identifying what, exactly, makes it so damn good feels like a bit of a fool&#8217;s errand. The temptation to gesticulate wildly at the whole thing is very strong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, this is one of those rare films where every single lighting queue, performance, and detail of set design feels like it&#8217;s working in service of the story. Is there a more paralyzing moment of sound design than the roar of the <em>T-rex</em>? A more appropriately gargantuan score than that of John Williams? I know I&#8217;m not breaking any new ground with my &#8220;<em>Jurassic Park</em>? Good movie.&#8221; take, but holy smokes what a picture!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that spirit, the video essay below zeros in on two elements that really capture what makes <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>&#8216;s film such a densely efficient piece of visual storytelling: scale and framing. After all, <em>Jurassic Park </em>is a film about the equal enormity of ancient beasts and human hubris. Director of photography <strong>Dean Cundey</strong> captures all this awe, fear, and arrogance with (among other things) clever blocking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essay concludes with the proposal that this is one of the essential ingredients lacking from the sequels. Namely: an appreciation for what Blockbuster cinematography is capable of: not only telling a story but making us feel something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-e541a95a-199d-4122-b78b-2c914720e5df\">Watch &#8220;<strong>Why Jurassic Park Looks Better Than Its Sequels&#8221;</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Why Jurassic Park Looks Better Than Its Sequels\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BKALxKbjOaE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-2db4b785-6b87-4022-8b34-6427a91b3c9c\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-179f886d-6774-4450-838c-e8ce21d0a808\">This video is by <strong>Films&#38;Stuff</strong>, a channel that specializes in dissecting blockbusters.

Created under uniquely restrictive circumstances and committing to a daunting cinematic language, I doubt we&#8217;ll ever see anything quite like it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the film begins, we assume the hovering perspective of an unnamed Russian man (voiced by director <strong>Alexander Sokurov</strong>). He finds himself in the frigid courtyard of the Hermitage, one of the most famous museums in the world, once the seat of Russian imperial power. Unseen and unheard, he drifts between celebrant nobles who dust the snow off their collars and make their way towards the Winter Palace, where they will partake in what will prove to be the last extravagant ball in the history of the Russian Empire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surmising that this must be the afterlife, our narrator soon meets the man who will become his (and our) companion: a slinking French Marquis from the Romantic era (played by experienced theatre actor <strong>Sergey Dreyden</strong>). Together, the pair will wander the grounds of the Hermitage for the next eighty-seven minutes, passing in, out, and between three centuries of Russian history. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-bal-walking-out.gif\" alt=\"Russian Ark Bal Walking Out\" class=\"wp-image-359647\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-bal-walking-out.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-bal-walking-out-768x433.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In their journey, time moves freely through the rooms and the camera moves with it. After a while, it almost seems natural that time should flow like this. That czars, foreign emissaries, and museum curators should occupy the same space. That, in this place of all places, Russian history would unfold before our eyes like a waking dream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather famously, the entirety of <em>Russian Ark </em>takes place in a single, uninterrupted shot. Indeed, it takes as long to watch the film as it did to shoot it. Unfortunately, the audacity of this approach tends to overshadow <em>Russian Ark</em>&#8216;s artistic merits. And look, I get it. Russsian history isn&#8217;t everybody&#8217;s thing. Slow burns with no cuts aren&#8217;t everybody&#8217;s thing. But I think it is bad form to celebrate the film&#8217;s technical achievement in isolation of its artistry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to be clear: <em>Russian Ark</em>&#8216;s feature-length take is no gimmick. You simply could not tell this story any other way. And this is what makes <em>Russian Ark</em> so remarkable: not that its story justifies its format or vice versa, but that together, the result is mesmerizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-girls-hallway.gif\" alt=\"Russian Ark Girls Hallway\" class=\"wp-image-359648\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-girls-hallway.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-girls-hallway-768x433.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So this was Sokurov&#8217;s task: to make a film, of this scale, without cuts. And to do so in one of the most prestigious museums in the world, he would only have one day to shoot it. There was absolutely no room for error. The fact that they succeeded is nothing short of a miracle. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-d-they-do-that\">How’d they do that?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-long-story-short\">Long story short:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of planning, luck, and core strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-long-story-long\">Long story long:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aptly named making-of documentary <em><strong>In One Breath</strong></em>, producer<strong> Jens Meurer</strong> describes how, upon hearing Sokurov&#8217;s initial pitch, the consensus was that a film shot in one day on video that required no editing was &#8220;going to be easy.&#8221; In the end, the film took four years to develop. And during that time the project mutated from a small documentary to a full-blown narrative feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A film comprised of a single, continuous take had always been a dream for Sokurov. A new digital recording process made the dream possible. The film was recorded with a custom-designed high definition Sony video camera nicknamed the &#8220;Director&#8217;s Friend,&#8221; which recorded uncompressed images to a hard disk that could hold 100 minutes of footage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoot took place on December 23, 2001, the shortest day of the year. Ahead of time, there had been, per an <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2002/11/interview-achieving-the-cinematic-impossible-russian-ark-dp-tilman-buttner-discusses-what-its-l-80105/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>IndieWire </em>interview with Büttner</a>, no complete dress rehearsal. Because the Hermitage would only stay closed to allow for one day of filming. Their job was to add the fixtures necessary to tell the story and to remove or hide anything that could distract. Likewise, items from the museum&#8217;s collection (like Catherine the Great&#8217;s dinnerware) were pulled and staged, to be seen but never touched during the shoot, per museum rules. A small army of electricians arranged supplementary lighting according to a detailed system pre-arranged by the film&#8217;s cinematographer <strong>Tilman Büttner</strong>, a man widely regarded as one of the best Steadicam operators in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some spatial context: comprised of five palaces totaling 700,000 square feet, the Hermitage is the second-largest art museum in the world after the Louvre. And even though the film only takes place in a small fraction of the Hermitage&#8217;s 365 rooms, the path the camera takes is nearly a mile (1.6 km) long.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-opera.gif\" alt=\"Russian Ark Opera\" class=\"wp-image-359650\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-opera.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-opera-768x433.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During this pre-shoot prep period, nearly two thousand actors and three orchestras arrived at the Hermitage. Büttner attempted (and failed) to eat what he jokingly refers to as his &#8220;final meal.&#8221; After napping eluded him, he headed over to the Hermitage to assist with the lighting prep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shooting began at 12:30 pm with four hours of precious natural light remaining. After three false starts, at 2:00 pm, things finally kicked off in earnest.&#8221;Because we had to stop filming three times&#8230;some of the batteries were used up,&#8221; Büttner explains. &#8220;We had to get it in the can the fourth time, no matter what happened.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure everything ran smoothly during the shoot, twenty-two assistant directors dotted the edifice like a relay race team. In the interest of not overwhelming the already crowded ten-person camera team (including Büttner, Sokurov, the focus pullers, and translators), an &#8220;advance team&#8221; led the charge to make sure everyone was ready. A separate sweep team followed to &#8220;make sure everyone had survived.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example of the importance of these separate teams is the moment in the film where the Marquis and our narrator backtrack towards a familiar corridor to find a different<em> </em>period of history has materialized behind them. This moment required the team to re-build the set while the Steadicam&#8217;s &#8220;back&#8221; was turned. Another remarkable instance is when the camera follows the aging Catherine The Great across a frigid -11 °F (-24 °C) courtyard and re-enters the warmth of the palace without the lens fogging up. Camera tests in the fridge only provided so much solace. Ultimately Sokurov lit a candle in a church and hoped for the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-courtyard-snow.gif\" alt=\"Russian Ark Courtyard Snow\" class=\"wp-image-359649\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-courtyard-snow.gif 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-courtyard-snow-768x433.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Russian Ark </em>functions because it is one of the most impressive displays of project management in the history of cinema. But all of that group effort was ultimately the responsibility of one man:<strong> </strong>Büttner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight of the film was riding on the backs of every crewmember. But it was quite literally riding on Büttner&#8217;s. &#8220;It was only because of all this special equipment, which was specially made for the film, that we were able to pull the whole thing off technically,&#8221; he explains. Of great importance were the batteries which weighed approximately seventy-seven pounds (thirty-five kilograms) total. Which is, I should stress, <em>very heavy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Büttner had to carry and operate a camera rig roughly the weight of two four-year-olds, all while remembering the intricacies of the mile-long route. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a diagram on the camera, nobody could tell me where we were going or what was happening. I really did commit the whole thing to memory.&#8221; Keep in mind, Büttner had never seen any of the prior rehearsals. &#8220;I had to be flexible, but the film was not supposed to show any kind of distraction.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Büttner was more than experienced, having operated Steadicams since 1988, but by the time he reached the climactic imperial ball scene, he was exhausted. &#8220;I had pains around my groin,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;And I thought before I cause myself serious problems which could result in my never being able to work again, I&#8217;m going to put the Steadicam down, and say, &#8216;I can&#8217;t do it.'&#8221; Thankfully, Büttner experienced a burst of adrenaline after seeing all the actors in their costumes for the first time. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for that, I would&#8217;ve stopped filming.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all, I think producer Meurer sums the making of <em>Russian Ark</em> up best: &#8220;In hindsight, it couldn&#8217;t have worked. But it did.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-s-the-precedent\">What’s the precedent?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things we need to talk about. The first is <strong>Sergei Eisenstein</strong> and <strong>Grigori Aleksandrov</strong>&#8216;s 1927 propaganda film <em><strong>October (Ten Days that Shook the World)</strong></em>. And the second has to do with differentiating the &#8220;one-cut&#8221; films that are feats of editing and those that are feats of endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin with <em>October</em>. Like <em>Russian Ark</em>, <em>October </em>uses the Winter Palace as an imposing and meaningful stage to celebrate Russian history. The film dramatizes the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War. And much of the film reenacts the storming of the Winter Palace, the official residence of the Russian emperors, wherein much of <em>Russian Ark </em>takes place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World.jpg\" alt=\"October Ten Days That Shook The World\" class=\"wp-image-359651\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>October</em> also shares common ground with <em>Russian Ark </em>in terms of its scale. Reportedly, filming the assault on the Winter Palace required eleven-thousand extras. And, supposedly, the lighting needs for the shoot blacked out the rest of St. Petersburg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, <em>Russian Ark </em>and <em>October </em>adopt very different film languages to tell, ultimately, very different stories about Russian history. <em>October</em> employs an editing technique championed by Eisenstein himself, called &#8220;intellectual montage.&#8221; The technique relies heavily on quick, meaningful cuts between disparate subjects. The altogether new meaning created by splicing together two different shots was, for Eisnensetin, revolutionary in nature. Montage (which is just the French word for &#8220;editing&#8221;), is the most common approach to editing in narrative fiction films to this day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the intellectual montage we see in <em>October</em> represents a kind of assertive approach to celebrating Russian history, what we see in <em>Russian Ark </em>is far more gentle. Without any intrusive cuts, the discussion of our two interlocutors becomes less of a debate than a passing encounter between two different souls. The end result, I think, is a kind of melancholic yearning for the appreciation of a specific cultural history. A dedication not to assert dominance over history, but to let it play out on its own terms, however complicated and tragic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope.jpg\" alt=\"Alfred Hitchcock Rope\" class=\"wp-image-359652\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we must launch ourselves into the present, to put <em>Russian Ark </em>in context as a <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/one-shot-films/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;one-take&#8221; film</a>. Cinematic history is full of legendary, immersive long shots, from the eight-minute opening sequence of Robert Altman&#8217;s<strong> <em>The Player</em></strong> to Brain de Palma&#8217;s nearly 13-minute tracking shot in <em><strong>Snake Eyes</strong></em>. Beyond the logistics, shooting a feature-length film in one shot was simply beyond the capabilities of celluloid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there was a film before <em>Russian Ark </em>that gave <em>the appearance</em> of taking place in a single shot. Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s 1948 thriler <em><strong>Rope</strong></em> stitches together ten different tracking shots to give the illusion of one, eighty-minute, continuous take. Cuts take place in clever pans, smuggled behind the character&#8217;s backs and pieces of furniture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique would later be replicated in films like <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/review-silent-house-is-gripping-and-suspenseful-until-the-ending-ruins-it-a0eb94d38f5b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Silent House</a></strong></em>,<em> <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/birdman-cuts-9c98345f850e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Birdman</a></strong></em>,<em> </em>and <em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/1917-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1917</a></strong></em>, which all hide their cuts with everything from black screens to push zooms, to whip pans, to wipes, to opening doors, to state of the art motion-controlled cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that <em>Russian Ark </em>is devoid of visual effects. But there&#8217;s a big difference between color grading and creating a CGI dummy of George MacKay to blend two shots together.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"How &#039;1917&#039; Was Filmed To Look Like One Shot | Movies Insider\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMBnvz-dEXw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those seemingly one-shot films are impressive, but for a different reason than <em>Russian Ark</em>. They are feats of editing, camera-work, and unnoticed computer-generated witchcraft. But <em>Russian Ark </em>is different. Not better, just different. It&#8217;s an endurance test and a distinctly physical feat that conjures a very specific kind of awe in me. It&#8217;s the same kind of awe I feel when I watch a play. There is an understood degree of risk that I just don&#8217;t feel when I watch something like <em>1917. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heck, I don&#8217;t even feel it when I watch <em><strong>Timecode</strong></em>, which pre-dates Russian Ark by two years. Mike Figgis&#8217; film consists of four continuous ninety-three-minute takes that were filmed simultaneously by four separate cameras. However, because <em>Timecode</em> is improvised, it doesn&#8217;t quite achieve the same effect. It&#8217;s the difference between an opera and a long-form improv show. Neither is intrinsically &#8220;better,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t feel right to compare the two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think anyone would be crazy enough to make something like <em>Russian Ark </em>ever again. It represents a huge risk most filmmakers can no longer justify. And it is a small miracle that it exists at all. So, for that, I&#8217;m grateful.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/vLrXBpm44Ig\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 21:16:56 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-bal-walking-out.gif","linkMd5":"bed096e289cebd0df2509806c40d1951","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-46-783_3156e9684c3a9d70.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":451,"sourceBytes":23982865,"destBytes":2077066,"author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-bal-walking-out.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-46-783_3156e9684c3a9d70.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-girls-hallway.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn18@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-55-114_2203ffb3a858d2e1.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-opera.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn35@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-59-296_280c5dfd84f23d43.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Russian-Ark-courtyard-snow.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn10@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-12-236_8e01702712ef51ba.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-Ten-Days-that-Shook-the-World.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn19@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-49-380_167be52f31e0f44f.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alfred-Hitchcock-Rope.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-39-05-403_74339e2bb72c00ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/vLrXBpm44Ig":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn13@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-57-072_3c8e0e08bdbe4fb7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591520041},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:40","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:40","title":"What Critics Said About ‘Speed Racer’ in 2008","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359580","description":"<p><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/they-said-what/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">They Said What?!</a> is a biweekly column in which we explore the highs and lows of film criticism through history. How did critics feel about it at the time, and do we see it differently now? In this entry, Chris Coffel explores the original critical reception of the Wachowskis&#8217; Speed Racer.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Five years after wrapping up their groundbreaking <em>Matrix</em> trilogy, <strong>Lana Wachowski</strong> and <strong>Lilly Wachowski</strong> traded in their sunglasses and trench coats for fast cars and driving scarves as they sped to the raceway to adapt the popular 1960s anime series <em><strong>Speed Racer</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Armed with a budget of $120 million, the directors set out to do something ambitious: take a story about a young race car driver, named Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch), with aspirations of becoming the best driver in the world, and make it something uniquely their own. To do so the directors ditched the rather bland and muted color palette of the original series and replaced it with a world of loud, lucid colors all strung together by a rapid succession of quick edits.</p>\n<p>This peculiar style caught critics of the day off guard, leaving them turned off by the film&#8217;s assault on the senses. Rather than impressed by the Wachowskis’ efforts to expand the boundaries of cinema, many critics wrote it off as merely a kids movie, too reliant on flashy effects and lacking any real substance.</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Compton</strong> of the <em>Bowling Green Daily News</em> <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/they-said-what/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described the film</a> as &#8220;an overbearing mix of candy-coated visuals and an incoherent plot.&#8221; It&#8217;s the type of film, Compton wrote, &#8220;that makes you question the sanity of the people involved.&#8221; Despite a capable cast, Compton blamed the film&#8217;s screenplay for trying too hard &#8220;to play to the five-and-under crowd.&#8221; And apparently, that didn&#8217;t work because Compton&#8217;s son was disinterested in seeing the film, saying, &#8220;<em>Speed Racer</em> stinks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have to be twelve to like it,&#8221; <strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/may/09/actionandadventure.family\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote in his review</a> for <em>The Guardian</em>. Bradshaw did credit the film for being &#8220;occasionally intriguing in an exotic and bizarre way,&#8221; but that wasn&#8217;t enough to overcome the &#8220;deafeningly loud and stroboscopically flashy&#8221; aspects. The film&#8217;s unique visuals didn&#8217;t work for Bradshaw, who compared them to &#8220;an old-fashioned television with the contrast dial turned up too high.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Much like Bradshaw, CNN&#8217;s <strong>Tom Charity</strong> felt the film would only appeal to a younger audience. &#8220;Twelve-year-old boys should be wowed,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/09/review.speedracer/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charity wrote</a>, &#8220;but for the rest of us, it will depend on your appetite for eye candy.&#8221; Charity was impressed by the film&#8217;s &#8220;visual panache,&#8221; crediting the Wachowskis for translating the &#8220;splashy, wide-eyed innocence of the anime universe&#8221; to the big screen. The visuals, however, weren&#8217;t enough in Charity&#8217;s eyes to make up for the film&#8217;s lack of laughs and suspense and characters that are &#8220;as synthetic as everything else in this virtual entertainment.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Davis</strong> of <em>Paste Magazine</em> joined in, saying the film was targeting a younger audience but felt the long run-time would be a hindrance, writing that its &#8220;slow middle may lose the seven-year-olds that it clearly covets.&#8221; A short version of the film &#8220;might have been a retro-futuristic hoot, but at 129 [minutes] it requires five times too much hooting,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/john-goodman/speed-racer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Davis wrote</a>. &#8220;It’s a sugar cereal served for six meals straight. Enough, <em>Speed Racer</em>, enough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In her review for Slate, <strong>Dana Stevens</strong> <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2008/05/speed-racer-reviewed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">declared the film to be</a> a &#8220;high-tech failure.&#8221; Stevens wasn&#8217;t a fan of the film&#8217;s nonlinear storytelling and editing choices. The transitional wipes were a particularly sore point for Stevens, and in her defense, the film does go back to them often. &#8220;The overuse of this trick evokes the following responses,&#8221; Stevens wrote. &#8220;First time: Cool! Second time: So? The next seventy-eight times: Why, God, why?&#8221; The Wachowskis may have set out to make a distinctive big-screen summer classic, but for Stevens, it was nothing more than the &#8220;summer’s loudest, brightest, and most expensive opportunity for a nap.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> critic <strong>Peter Travers</strong> also wasn&#8217;t sure the preteen target audience would make it through the &#8220;punishing 135 minutes as the Wachowski brothers projectile-vomit their cotton-candy dreams all over the big screen.&#8221; Travers credited the film for its style and vision, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/speed-racer-111254/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calling it</a> the &#8220;trippiest stoner fest since Stanley Kubrick took his space odyssey,&#8221; but ultimately felt &#8220;nothing sticks to the memory.&#8221; The film may be a digital marvel, but it&#8217;s one that &#8220;feels untouched by human hands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the film&#8217;s overwhelmingly negative response when it was first released, some critics at the time did praise it. <strong>Julie Washington</strong> of the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em> <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/movies/2008/05/wachowski_brothers_score_with.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote that</a> the Wachowskis scored a winner with &#8220;a speed-demon of a movie that whisks us to a candy-colored world where everything is go, go, go.&#8221; And writing for <em>Newsweek</em>, <strong>David Ansen</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ansen-review-speed-racer-fun-abstraction-89837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called the film</a> &#8220;sweet and flashy and often fun.&#8221; Former <em>Oregonian</em> film critic <strong>Shawn Levy</strong> <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/madaboutmovies/2008/05/review_an_eyepopping_speed_rac.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote that</a> <em>Speed Racer</em> was &#8220;filled with energy and visual pizzazz and at least strives for something more than dumb entertainment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those latter critics could not have been more correct. <em>Speed Racer</em> is a dazzling display of visual ingenuity. Is it eye candy? Yes, but eye candy isn&#8217;t inherently negative, especially when you&#8217;re working with a visual medium. The Wachowskis were shooting on high-definition video for the first time and they took the opportunity to test the format&#8217;s full capabilities. The result is a pop-art fantasy set in a retro-future world.</p>\n<p>To match the chaotic energy radiating from the film&#8217;s bold, vivid aesthetic, the Wachowskis incorporated a herky-jerky approach to editing. While there is a fairly straightforward narrative, <em>Speed Racer</em> does whip viewers back and forth on the timeline, alternating the past and the present and occasionally having the two blend into one. This helps to add another layer to the film&#8217;s frenetic unpredictability.</p>\n<p>Because the film relies so heavily on the gaudy design of the world it creates, some of the finer plot points can get lost. As Speed Racer dazzles spectators with his flashy driving, the larger racing community begins to take notice. E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allman), owner and CEO of Royalton Industries, presents Speed with an offer to race for his giant, multibillion-dollar racing team. Speed is grateful for the opportunity, but turns it down because he races for his family and doesn&#8217;t want to be soiled by corporate sponsorship.</p>\n<p>The decision doesn&#8217;t sit well with Royalton and he vows to run the Racer family out of professional motorsports. This introduces Speed Racer to the seedy underbelly of a corrupt sports world controlled by the greed of consumerism. Granted the film isn&#8217;t making any huge declarations, but this small tidbit does suggest the film is more than just a big, dumb popcorn blockbuster.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, back in 2008, <em>Speed Racer</em> <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl947095041/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suffered a blowout at the box office</a>, bringing in just over $90 million worldwide. The negative review pile-up seemed to be justified. More than a decade later, however, <em>Speed Racer</em> has become a cult classic, and even critical opinion has begun to shift. The film&#8217;s visual style that was dismissed as too digital and too in-your-face is now viewed by many as ahead of the curve and a one-of-a-kind experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The directors were overdosing on digital effects, no doubt, but the garish ultrachromatics feel ahead of their time,&#8221; <strong>Darren Franich</strong> <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2018/05/09/speed-racer-wachowski-tenth-anniversary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote in a 2018 piece</a> for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, &#8220;halfway to <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, door-knocking against the Froot Loops-y excess of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>.&#8221; Franich suggests that it&#8217;s unfair to attack <em>Speed Racer</em> for its heavy use of green screen while praising modern films like <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, which relies on green screen effects just as much. Yes, the film looks like &#8220;a cheap Coke bottle covered in leftover spray paint,&#8221; but that&#8217;s the whole point.</p>\n<p>In a 2020 edition of his <em>The UnPopular Opinion</em> video column for JoBlo, <strong>Alex Maidy</strong> <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/the-unpopular-opinion-speed-racer-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compares the film</a> to <em>Star Wars</em> as &#8220;one of those special film experiences that can alter the way you see cinema moving forward.&#8221; Maidy contends that while <em>Speed Racer</em> isn&#8217;t without its flaws and isn&#8217;t a game-changer, it is a &#8220;near-perfect moviegoing experience.&#8221; Maidy&#8217;s point is that <em>Speed Racer</em> is exactly what you want when you go to the theater to see an action-adventure movie. &#8220;The fundamental difference between <em>Speed Racer</em> and most other movies is that it superbly illustrates the ultimate child-like experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://fullcirclecinema.com/2019/12/01/full-circle-flashback-speed-racer-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a flashback review</a> for <em>Full Circle Cinema</em> in 2019, <strong>Daniel Hrncir</strong> revisited the film for the first time since 2008. Having first seen the film while in the fifth grade, Hrncir was afraid of how he would view it now but was pleased to be able to put those worries to bed. &#8220;The Wachowskis have directed something truly timeless, a movie that reminds us of one simple fact: childhood is never lost with age.&#8221; Hrncir also reminds us that &#8220;CGI does not always have to be the bad guy&#8221; and praised the Wachowskis for their ability to use it to their benefit in creating a &#8220;futuristic world&#8221; that &#8220;is too bedazzled in chrome for puppets and reality checks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In celebrating <em>Speed Racer</em>&#8216;s tenth anniversary for the <em>Observer</em>, <strong>Film Crit Hulk</strong> <a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/05/looking-back-at-the-wachowskis-2008-masterpiece-speed-racer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">declared the film to be</a> &#8220;one of the most criminally overlooked films in recent memory and also one of the most oddly inspiring.&#8221; Film Crit Hulk argues that fans expected the &#8220;leather-clad adult fare&#8221; the Wachowskis had become known for and had no idea what to make of the &#8220;fluffy, neon-soaked bit of confection&#8221; that is <em>Speed Racer</em>. As a result, it was a major flop, and &#8220;many came to dismiss the film without ever seeing it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watching <em>Speed Racer</em> now, I can understand why it may not be liked by everyone, but for the life of me, I cannot understand why anyone would dismiss the experience. Few films are capable of reaching the level of spectacle that <em>Speed Racer</em> achieves in its opening scene. And what follows is two hours of equally aggressive, glitzy, drift-driving action. We should cherish that. Fortunately, the tide is changing and the cult is growing. Eventually, the rest of the world will catch up with <em>Speed Racer</em>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/7u0p97CRGkc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"
