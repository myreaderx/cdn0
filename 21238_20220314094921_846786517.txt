I was sitting in Cusco because in a moment of spontaneity (and perhaps a few cocktails) last March, Cameron and I had <a href=\"http://www.theclymb.com/adventures\">booked ourselves on an Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu</a>. It seemed like a good idea at the timeâ€¦ something to motivate us to get out and exercise over the summer, and a nice little break before the big push that always happens for Cam around the holidays at <a href=\"http://www.theclymb.com/\">The Clymb</a>. A couple of months later, I studied the itinerary, had a mild panic attack at the size of the climbs, and started getting serious about training.</p>\n<p>I told Anita Iâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />d be happy to contribute. It was good to have a little push to get me to blog againâ€¦ it has been too long. But, as I was sitting there, reading Anitaâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s mail, the holidays werenâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t really on my mind. What was on my mind was how the heck I was going to make it up the terrifying â€œDay 2â€ of our itinerary: 10 miles of trekking, hiking over two passes that reached almost 14,000 feet. Especially because within hours of landing in Cusco at itâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s 11,000+ feet above sea level, I was stuck in the bathroom losing what little lunch I was able to eat. Sorry for the TMI. High altitude and I no longer seem to get along. Thoughts raced through my mind of how I was going to not ruin Camâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s trip. The first <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6753/diamox-oral/details\">Diamox</a> tablet didnâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t stay down. I curled up in bed, and Cam brought me chicken soup and toast. I looked at it and ran back to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>The second Diamox managed to stay put, and a few hours later, my stomach began to settle. My second day in Cusco, I managed to go outside and read my book while sitting in the sun for a few hours. I even managed eat a few bites at dinner. The third day, we took a tour of the Sacred Valley, and I hiked up a few Inca steps. With more hope than confidence, I boarded the bus the next day to being the trek. It was certainly not what I had planned or been training all summer for.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://laraferroni.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/incatrail-972.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"479\" alt=\"incatrail-972.jpg\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://laraferroni.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/incatrail-1066.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"479\" alt=\"incatrail-1066.jpg\" />\n</div>\n<p>Four days later, I looked down at Machu Picchu drenched in gorgeous light. I might been the slowest hiker on our trek (go Team Tortuga!), but each step was totally worth it.

And I realized exactly what makes a memorable moment for me at the holidays, or really, anytime. Itâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s the story that comes from the unexpected: When things donâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t necessarily go as planned; when I push myself to do things Iâ€<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />m not sure I can do; when I take a risk to see what happens.</p>\n<p>Most of my best holiday memories were entirely unanticipated. An impromptu shopping spree resulting in my favorite boots when our luggage didn&#8217;t arrive. A turkey in a tent while trekking up Kilimanjaro. Skiing down our street during a rare Seattle snowpocalypse that delayed most of our holiday festivities. I love a happy accident.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://laraferroni.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/makesthemoment-028.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"479\" alt=\"makesthemoment-028.jpg\" />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  \n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  To celebrate, how about a cocktail that is the epitome of unexpected.
