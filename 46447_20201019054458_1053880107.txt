Alfred responded by plotting the expenditures data in the second part of the contest with parallel coordinates plots. Figure 1 shows his figure, which adds another visualization to the eight different ways to plot the table of consumer expenditures that are described in <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/naomirobbins/2012/12/21/visualizing-the-table-of-the-graph-makeover-contest-2/\">Visualizing the Table of the Graph Makeover Contest. </a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1256\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/AI_exp_black.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1256\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/AI_exp_black-300x175.png\" alt=\"Alfred Inselberg's parallel coordinates plot\" width=\"300\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/AI_exp_black-300x175.png 300w, https://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/AI_exp_black.png 866w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 1.

Some sample values are shown.  The Owners data is in GREEN while the Renters data is in BLUE. Note that there were greater changes for the renters in some variables on the left but this reversed for variables shown on the right. For the most part trends/proportions were the same for renters and owners for both years.  Note that owners and renters spent more for <em>Housing</em> in 2010, for <em>Food-away</em> and <em>Apparel</em> than in 1986.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">For the percentage changes the same <em>twelve variables axes</em> are shown as in previous plot but only <strong>one categorical axis on the right </strong>with <em>Owners – 1 and Renters 0</em> is needed.
