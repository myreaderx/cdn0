Since the application is mostly a set of static files, it scales more easily, and it is also easier to deploy.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bR--bXsuiMIDz-D_V4BfLw.png\" /><figcaption>JupyterLite running in the browser as a static website on ReadTheDocs</figcaption></figure><h3>A full JupyterLab distribution running in the browser</h3><p>JupyterLite is built from the ground up, reusing many JupyterLab plugins and components as is.</p><p>In addition to JupyterLab, JupyterLite also includes the <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab\">RetroLab</a> interface by default:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B1Se7Fe1JXBt2a1NjwRmxg.png\" /><figcaption>JupyterLite with the RetroLab interface</figcaption></figure><p>By reusing JupyterLab components, JupyterLite benefits from many of the upstream improvements such as new features, accessibility fixes, and upkeep improvements. The <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/how-we-made-jupyter-notebooks-collaborative-with-yjs-b8dff6a9d8af?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------\">recent work on real time collaboration</a> coming in JupyterLab 3.1 and championed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin_jahns\">Kevin Jahns</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlosHerreroB/\">Carlos Herrero</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/echarles\">Eric Charles</a> can be enabled in JupyterLite too!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HwMx3Fd6iICkWjjvUCtvwA.gif\" /><figcaption>Real Time Collaboration with JupyterLite on ReadTheDocs</figcaption></figure><h3>Pyolite, a Python kernel backed by Pyodide</h3><p><a href=\"https://pyodide.org\">Pyodide</a> consists of the CPython 3.8 interpreter compiled to WebAssembly which allows Python to run in the browser. Many popular scientific Python packages have also been compiled and made available. In addition, Pyodide can install any Python package with a pure Python wheel from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Pyodide also includes a comprehensive foreign function interface that exposes the ecosystem of Python packages to JavaScript and the browser user interface, including the DOM, to Python.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*usFUmvzRo6v8TuRFQhK0uw.png\" /><figcaption>Pyodide: Python with the scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly</figcaption></figure><p>Currently at version <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/04/pyodide-spin-out-and-0-17-release/\">0.17</a>, Pyodide has benefited from many improvements over the past years: smaller binary size, support for asyncio, and better type translations between Python and JavaScript.</p><p>JupyterLite ships by default with Pyolite, a Python kernel backed by Pyodide. Pyolite runs in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\">Web Worker</a> and thus doesn’t block the main UI thread when intensive computations are executed.</p><h3>IPython in the browser</h3><p>Thanks to the work by Madhur Tandon in this <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/pull/171\">pull request</a>, Pyolite is now powered by IPython. This provides access to magics, code completion, rich display, interactive widgets, and many other features.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2WBnuwRGkASGVNYUGjyPHg.gif\" /><figcaption>Using IPython in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><h3>Interactive Visualization</h3><p>Many visualizations libraries such as <a href=\"https://altair-viz.github.io/\">Altair</a> and <a href=\"https://plotly.com/\">Plotly</a> are also supported in JupyterLite, allowing for quick and convenient figures and plots right in the browser:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SRr162bkckWsmoSMxVd2uQ.gif\" /><figcaption>Using Altair in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w7Y4wRz9h2OFMgm5MfdD0A.gif\" /><figcaption>Creating Plotly figures in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><h3>Support for Jupyter Widgets</h3><p>Jupyter Widgets rely on the <a href=\"https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html#custom-messages\">Custom Messages specification of the Jupyter Protocol</a> to send messages back and forth between the kernel and the frontend. This <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/pull/145\">pull request</a> by Martin Renou added support for Comms in the Pyolite kernel, which enabled many of the existing core and third-party Jupyter Widgets to work out of the box in JupyterLite such as <a href=\"https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot\">bqplot</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet\">ipyleaflet</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/martinRenou/ipycanvas\">ipycanvas</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c1DIbxS6bZ7bHDcOTEIJfg.gif\" /><figcaption>JupyterLite comes with support for Jupyter Widgets</figcaption></figure><h3>More than just Python</h3><p>JupyterLite makes it possible to have plenty of other kernels also running in the browser. For now, the default distribution includes a JavaScript and a <a href=\"https://p5js.org/\">p5</a> kernel:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/1*5XFdmBdQWeONbRD3nuQe0A.png\" /><figcaption>Multiple kernels are available in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><p>Both the JavaScript and the p5 kernels run in an IFrame as the code execution sandbox. With the Jupyter display protocol, users can easily render custom animations in the browser:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kPYtSDP3aE5_M5AmDT-Uvw.gif\" /><figcaption>The p5.js kernel in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><h3>Highly Customizable</h3><p>Just like many existing Jupyter tools, JupyterLite can easily be configured for custom needs.</p><p>It supports the new <a href=\"https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_dev.html#prebuilt-extensions\">JupyterLab prebuilt extension system</a> added to the 3.0 release. Existing JupyterLab extensions can then easily be reused in JupyterLite too!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*69CnccBrufVEEU0wqE_f7Q.gif\" /><figcaption>The JupyterLab Drawio extension running in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><p>The in-browser server part of JupyterLite also follows a plugin-based approach. The server is a <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino\">Lumino</a> application without a shell and registers multiple plugins such as kernels, the contents manager or the sessions service. This plugin-based approach makes it very convenient for deployers and site administrators to swap a plugin for another one. For instance, they might want to swap the default contents manager that stores notebooks and files in the browser local storage with another plugin that would save them on AWS S3 instead.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f7viaaS4SYTBpjA6DTPsDQ.png\" /><figcaption>Overview of the plugin-based architecture of JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><p>The modularity and flexibility of JupyterLite make it possible to easily add new kernels. For example, the Basthon kernel uses a slightly different execution model than Pyolite. It runs in the main UI thread so users can manipulate the main window DOM from within Python directly, while Pyolite runs in a Web Worker as a background thread. Both approaches have pros and cons, and the JupyterLite plugin system lets extension authors have full control over their kernels.</p><p>A prototype for running Basthon in JupyterLite is being developed in the following repository: <a href=\"https://framagit.org/casatir/basthon-jupyterlab/\">https://framagit.org/casatir/basthon-jupyterlab/</a></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mMmSo4GPx7rpxbMpyf-VAA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Basthon in JupyterLite</figcaption></figure><h3>Deploying JupyterLite</h3><p>JupyterLite can easily be deployed as a static website. That’s it, no server, no complicated setup, no scalability issue. Just a plain HTTP server to serve static files to users.</p><p>This simple approach makes it possible to use a variety of options: nginx, <a href=\"https://mybinder.org\">Binder,</a> GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages, Vercel, Netlify, and more. It can even be deployed to ReadTheDocs, which is where the default JupyterLite demo site is hosted and continuously updated.</p><p>Many of the deployment scenarios are already documented in <a href=\"https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html\">https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html</a>. There is also a demo template to easily deploy a custom JupyterLite website on GitHub Pages with a single click: <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo\">https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo</a></p><p>Thanks to the work by Nicholas Bollweg in this <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/pull/147\">pull request</a>, JupyterLite now offers a jupyterlite <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlite/\">command line tool</a> to make custom deployments much more convenient.</p><p>One of the goals of JupyterLite is to let anyone build their custom distribution with the set of plugins and extensions they would like to use. For now, it requires using the jupyterlite CLI, but we can imagine having a more user-friendly way of exporting a custom JupyterLite website.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LL_UkItjshAzsEEDB4cI2A.png\" /><figcaption>A mock-up for the JupyterLite Exporter</figcaption></figure><h3>A wide range of use cases</h3><p>With the ease of deployment and the low barrier to entry, JupyterLite is an excellent fit for a wide range of use cases.</p><p>In the educational space, it simplifies access to teaching materials and computing environments. Teachers and students can focus on the content of their classes without worrying about server deployments and monitoring.</p><p>With JupyterLite we also hope to enable the next wave of Jupyter users and make the whole ecosystem even more accessible to newcomers and the wider community.</p><p>For simpler and smaller-scale projects, it could even help reduce the load on <a href=\"https://mybinder.org\">mybinder.org</a> by having a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fperez_org/status/1385825172230262794\">“binderlite” version of JupyterLite</a> deployed on a CDN.</p><h3>Try it online</h3><p>JupyterLite can easily be tested in a web browser using the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo\">https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo</a></p><figure><a href=\"https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*CMvcTaLSAD5A-WHCtnIFwA.png\" /></a></figure><h3>Try it locally</h3><p>JupyterLite can also be used locally.
