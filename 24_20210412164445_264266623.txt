This time, we explain the ending of the Netflix superhero comedy Thunder Force.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When fighting bad guys, one of the most important things you can do is stick close to your friends. It’s a lesson we learn in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardians of the Galaxy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">X-Men</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> franchise, and now <strong>Ben Falcone</strong>’s </span><strong><i>Thunder Force</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Netflix Original</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is set in a world where supervillains called Miscreants reign over Chicago. This is a reality that is particularly troubling for Emily Stanton (<strong>Octavia Spencer</strong>), as her parents were killed by a couple of particularly evil ones when she was a little girl. From that moment on, she vowed to make it her life’s mission to finish her parents&#8217; work and build a genetic modifier that gives regular humans superpowers and allows them to defeat the Miscreants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the movie&#8217;s prologue, we meet the young, mega-smart Emily (Bria Danielle) following her tragic loss as she forms an unlikely best friendship with class-clown Lydia (Vivian Falcone, daughter of the director and actress <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong>). The two remain joined at the hip until Emily realizes that Lydia’s slacker mentality is holding her back from her dream of defeating the world&#8217;s evils. So, they part ways.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> picks up again with Lydia and Emily as estranged adults, now played respectively by McCarthy and Spencer. The two arrange to meet at Emily&#8217;s office, but when </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lydia stumbles into a lab and accidentally subjects herself to Emily&#8217;s new experiment she discovers she&#8217;s now capable of superhuman strength. Emily takes the intended second half of the formula, one that grants her the power of invisibility, and the pair begrudgingly team up to fight the Miscreants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their targets include a sadistic woman with electric bolts named Laser (<strong>Pom Klementieff</strong>), a half-man, half-crab mutant suitably called The Crab (<strong>Jason Bateman</strong>), and the man running to be the city&#8217;s next mayor (<strong>Bobby Cannavale</strong>) &#8212; who goes by the name The King and who is harboring the fact that he&#8217;s also a Miscreat himself. They all butt heads a few times, and it builds to a face-off at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the headquarters of The King&#8217;s mayoral rival where Lydia ultimately makes a heroic sacrifice to save everyone from a deadly bomb.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lydia leaps out a window and into the water below where the bomb goes off, but she survives as her superhuman strength and super suit absorb the blast. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ends with Chicago&#8217;s new mayor &#8212; not The King &#8212; hiring Thunder Force as protectors of the city, and as our heroes walk away from the scene crowds of people chant their names in praise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a lot of superhero movies, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the good guys versus the bad guys. The real conflict of the film is the estranged friendship between two people who deeply care about one another but who don’t know if their lifestyles can truly coexist. Just as the viewer might wonder if the good (Thunder Force) will prevail over the bad (the Miscreants), so does the film ask if true friendship can conquer adversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, in the end, it does. But this only happens when Lydia and Emily are able to confront their </span>own demons by fighting both with and between themselves. For Emily, her inner struggle is her need for perfection as a way to live up to her murdered parents. When she finally learns to get over her preconceived notions and to accept Lydia for who she is, though, it allows her to let someone else do the heavy lifting instead of insisting she do everything alone. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lydia also experiences inner turmoil. Ever since she and Emily stopped being friends, Lydia hasn’t believed that she is good enough for greatness, and she has lived her life accordingly. But when she allows herself to actually strive for greatness, well, she becomes the film’s real hero. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn&#8217;t just teach us the importance of friendship but also reinforces the fact that no one can defeat evil &#8212; inner or outer &#8212; alone. It takes a village to beat a bomb, defeat mutated villains, and overcome insecurity and fear of failure. So yes, it turns out the real super power is the friends we make along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are no real unanswered questions at the end of the film, it does </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">set us up pretty well for a sequel as Laser is on the lam and there are still a ton of Miscreants out there. There&#8217;s also a budding relationship between Lydia and The Crab, that in addition to bringing more laughs in a sequel will also answer whether or not a hero and a Miscreant can find love (and maybe make little super shrimp together). Emily&#8217;s daughter also reveals that she&#8217;s worked up a super formula of her own giving her super speed, so more heroes are potentially on the horizon as well. Given the fact that the dynamic duo now has the budget of Chicago on their side, they are probably going to come back more powerful than ever to face even more intimidating villains, but at least we know they&#8217;ll face them together.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Thunder Force is now available to stream <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81079259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Netflix</a>. </em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/xiur25pu7B4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 19:39:52 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f06d8b4707f33d81c3449f106755148b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Aurora Amidon","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/xiur25pu7B4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn25@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-06-951_a3e1028b28115857.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245791764},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","title":"All That Glitters: Style as Substance in John Boorman’s ‘Excalibur’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364629","description":"<p>When <strong><em>Excalibur</em></strong> (1981) begins, Uther Pendragon (<strong>Gabriel Byrne</strong>) lies dying in the mud. The magician Merlin warned him that granting his wish would have consequences; that one night with Igrayne, the wife of his newly-won ally, would come at a price. As promised, Merlin arrives to collect Igrayne and Uther’s child: an infant of infinite promise, a future king who will succeed where his petulant father failed. With Igrayne’s shrieks ringing in his ears, Uther follows Merlin into the woods, begging for his son and blind to the ambush lying in wait.</p>\n<p>Torn off his horse, Uther lands face-first in a polluted creek; the legendary preface of Arthurian legend dragged quite literally into the mud. The imposing spikes of Uther’s armor lock him firmly into the earth. Blood pools from the crease in his shoulder plate, flowing freely like a crimson tributary into the muck. It is a beautiful and brutal image: a deep red plume streaming out from a once-glimmering suit of armor. The whole scene is bathed in an emerald glow, an otherworldly colored gel that casts this upsetting moment firmly into the realm of myth.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-364641 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excalibur-John-Boorman-uther-death.jpg\" alt=\"Excalibur John Boorman Uther Death\" width=\"800\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excalibur-John-Boorman-uther-death.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excalibur-John-Boorman-uther-death-768x424.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>This contrast — of fantasy and ferocity — is the beating heart of <em>Excalibur</em>. It’s a tension that not only defines the film’s production design but the narrative journey of Arthur himself: a feature-length give and take between a gilded legendary past and the harsh realities of the very history it mythologizes.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <em>Excalibur</em> is the favorite child of sword and sorcery movies, a genre that lived, and ultimately died, in the thrall of its own spectacle. These films envision medieval legend, myth, and heroes through a gold-flecked prism. From <em>Dragonslayer </em>(1981) to <em>Ladyhawke</em> (1985), the genre boasts living prog-rock album covers less concerned with historical accuracy than the look and feel of fantasy itself. <em>Excalibur</em> was not the first of its kind. But it is, at least to me, one of the genre’s essential and most influential texts. And reckoning <i>Excalibur&#8217;</i>s central thematic tension — this stylistic and narrative cacophony of grit and glamor — is key to understanding what makes the film so magical.</p>\n<p>One of the expressions of this tension is in the film’s music. At times, <strong>Trevor Jones</strong>’ original score indulges in the expected medieval pan flutes, hurdy-gurdies, and monkish drones. At others, it is knowingly Wagnerian, unsubtle, grandiose, and, in a word, epic. Indeed, many of the film’s most memorable musical moments are outright samples of Wagner’s work. The title credits announce themselves with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2h22nk58qHskiX3eGjvq0I?si=PkkwnNixSqiUhVKP04ouTQ\">Siegfried&#8217;s explosive dirge from <em>Die Götterdämmerung</em></a>, which bookends the film as the dying Arthur is shepherded to Avalon. The <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4WjEY877D3AgyMLqMKrUsV?si=Q7qyXDYjTB6WuYs-N04mnw\">prelude to <em>Parsifal</em></a> appropriately accompanies the conclusion of Percival’s (Paul Geoffrey) quest for the Holy Grail: a transcendent sequence that uses Wagner’s ethereal strings to underscore Percival’s political epiphany that the land and its king are one. Another prelude, from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/59gpDDaxxRhcpQAgnrHp1U?si=1Z002Iq-R1m25mIfR8d1mA\"><em>Tristan und Isolde,</em></a> fittingly serves as the leitmotif for a doomed tryst: the love affair between Guenevere and Arthur’s most trusted knight, Lancelot.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364645\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/excalibur-split-diopter.jpeg\" alt=\"Excalibur Split Diopter\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/excalibur-split-diopter.jpeg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/excalibur-split-diopter-768x430.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>And yet, for all its sound and fury, <em>Excalibur</em>’s soundtrack falls silent during scenes of violence. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0DHIkKybRhYScZkGQU8XTL?si=pWDPhC6iQLCBjRH9aH-LFQ\">Carl Orff’s <em>Carmina Burana</em></a> blasts as Arthur and his knights ride through a blossoming apple orchard to their climactic face-off with the incestuous abomination Mordred. But the soundscape of the fight itself is far more honest about the barefaced realities of battle. Instead of triumphant horns and exalting choirs, we hear the rattle of cumbersome armor, the anguished cries of wounded soldiers, and the constant clanging of metal weaponry. In these moments of genuine brutality, from the storming of Leondegrance’s castle to Lancelot’s honor-bound duel with Gawain, the score falls back, and the horror of medieval conflict comes into clear and distressing focus: legends are, as Uther&#8217;s death reminds us, built on rivers of blood.</p>\n<p><em>Excalibur</em> stretches across a lifetime, from Arthur’s adolescence to his final moments as an old man. And while it is initially jarring to see 35-year old <strong>Nigel Terry</strong> play a teenager, by keeping the actors consistent as the characters age, the film can create a startling visual contrast between eager, idealistic youths and their calloused older selves. Arthur’s bright eyes dull as the weight of his legendary purpose ravages his body. Lancelot’s festering guilt twists his cherubic curls into a madman’s mane. And, perhaps most jarringly, Perceval’s bright, clear face grows gaunt and world-weary after fruitless decades of search for a fabled relic that may not exist.</p>\n<p>This visual shift playing out before our eyes on the countenance of our heroes&#8217; faces extends to the film’s color palette. The lush, earthy hues of Arthur’s youth are marked with verdancy and promise. The moss entombing <em>Excalibur</em>’s hilt seems almost iridescent, as though it too were benefiting from the uncanny emerald that endlessly glimmers in the mythical blade. Likewise, the formation of Camelot and the fabled round table is vibrant, like a living stained glass window. Everything (and I do mean everything) glitters an almost dream-like effervescence that dances in suits of armor, cups of wine, and bridal veils.</p>\n<p>Then Arthur’s reign begins to rot. The film&#8217;s Eden-like forests become dark and oppressive, and slowly, the color drains from Arthur’s court. In the final frame of Camelot’s prosperity, Arthur lies unconscious in a chapel, bathed in magenta, steam rising where the mystical bolt of lightning struck his chest. We fade to black, and when we return, the world is saturated, stricken too, it would seem, by the sickness that now grips the land.</p>\n<p>The first act&#8217;s saturation now appears solely in the sorceress Morgana&#8217;s (Helen Mirren) domain, who wields visual splendor like a venomous serpent hoping to hypnotize her prey. Here, color takes on a corrupted aspect, from Percival’s feverish visions of the false Grail to Mordred&#8217;s unsettling, statue-like suit of golden armor. It is only when the day is won that warmth returns in the visage of an enormous, blood-red setting sun: a symbol of the end of Arthur&#8217;s rule and the coming of yet another cycle of generation and decay.</p>\n<p>It is difficult not to get lost in <em>Excalibur</em>’s details, bedazzled, as it were, by its overwhelming sense of visual surety. But after one has recovered, it is rewarding to view the film&#8217;s undeniable style for what it is: substance. <em>Excalibur</em> literally tells the story of a legend. But it is equally preoccupied with the shape and purpose of legend itself. The film is genuinely enamored with the idealism and spectacle of myth, with hyper-reflective suits of armor, mystical light sources, and loads (and loads) of glitter. But <em>Excalibur</em> also reminds us that the rise and fall of kings, however vaulted, has its nasty bits. And that there is a brutal beauty in occasionally dragging the mythical past, like Uther off his horse, down into the muck.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/CKv5JSb0Tss\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 15:56:03 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excalibur-John-Boorman-uther-death.jpg","linkMd5":"2d217664cdcd39ab639cf20bde4570df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-06-048_d360d129e79c9e81.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":442,"sourceBytes":38071,"destBytes":28614,"author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excalibur-John-Boorman-uther-death.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-06-048_d360d129e79c9e81.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/excalibur-split-diopter.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-44-106_569331c45a510f4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/CKv5JSb0Tss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-06-671_5a3636cf2d459db1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245791789},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","title":"‘The Nevers’ is the Worst of Joss Whedon","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364642","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/up-next\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Up Next</strong></a>, a column that gives you the rundown on the latest TV. This week, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a> reviews The Nevers, the ambitious HBO series created by Joss Whedon.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Pop culture lovers have spent a lot of time over the past few years discussing the dearth of original stories on our screens. Regurgitated content is bad. We want big! We want bold! We want a story that’s not a remake, reboot, prequel, sequel, or adaptation, damn it! The HBO series <strong><em>The Nevers</em></strong>, which was created by <strong>Joss Whedon</strong> before his exit as showrunner last November, is a flashy, wholly original failure that reminds us to be careful what we wish for.</p>\n<p>In some ways, small-screen stories don’t get much bigger and bolder than this one. <em>The Nevers</em> is a steampunk sci-fi Victorian ensemble period piece. In its spare time, it’s also a crime drama, an <em>X-Men</em>-like superhero saga, and &#8212; with all the subtlety of a hammer over the head &#8212; a story about women. Every few scenes, someone in <em>The Nevers</em> talks with importance about women as a collective: the strong, the downtrodden, the underestimated, the dangerous.</p>\n<p>Years before Whedon was accused of serious workplace misconduct by <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/ray-fisher-opens-up-about-justice-league-joss-whedon-and-warners-i-dont-believe-some-of-these-people-are-fit-for-leadership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several</a> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/charisma-carpenter-joss-whedon-abuse-of-power-allegations-1234904995/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actors</a>, he made the ambitious and beloved woman-led series <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>. Though the series had its flaws, it was, at its best, an ass-kicking take on <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-helpless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the evils of patriarchy</a>. Any <em>Buffy</em> fans who held out hope that the creator would have a more evolved take on female empowerment more than twenty years later &#8212; or who would even settle for a rehashing of the classic series’ thematic greatest hits &#8212; will be sorely disappointed by <em>The Nevers</em>. The series is a crude caricature of a feminist work, if that. It’s the sort of cartoonish series in which a round table of white men appears in the very first episode to make their mustache-twirling, villainous opinions of powerful women abundantly clear.</p>\n<p>With the exception of its ultra-basic ideology, <em>The Nevers</em> is overstuffed on every level. Aside from the veritable genre Mad Libs mentioned above, the series also includes a myriad of unremarkable and at times indistinguishable characters. Amalia True (<strong>Laura Donnelly</strong>) and Penance Adair (<strong>Ann Skelly</strong>) are introduced as our two heroes. Amalia is “touched,” meaning she suddenly developed superpowers three years ago, along with countless other women across England. Penance has a penchant for mechanics, while other touched women have abilities, ranging from the talent to sing magic songs to the admittedly rather useless power to tell anyone the time without a clock.</p>\n<p>True and Adair live at a place called The Orphanage, where other touched women gather. They sometimes rescue touched women who are misunderstood by their families and hunted by others, but they also keep finding themselves face to face with a serial killer named Maladie (<strong>Amy Manson</strong>, sporting a look that hilariously calls to mind Sheila the She-Wolf from <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/glow-end/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>GLOW</em></a>).</p>\n<p><em>The Nevers</em> is muddled, overcrowded, and less-than-engaging despite its complex lore and flashy special effects. Nearly every emotional beat in the first four episodes misses the mark, in part because characters aren’t given the scene-time needed for viewers to form any substantial opinion of them. As a long-time <em>Buffy</em> fan, I’ve often found myself rationalizing that classic series’ questionable sexual politics, but <em>The Nevers</em> makes Whedon’s narrative preoccupation with sex and punishment impossible to ignore.</p>\n<p>Amalia is the series’ would-be protagonist and most fleshed-out character, yet her personality hinges on past trauma that’s led her down a specific self-destructive path. When she lists her unhealthy coping mechanisms, she adds sex with strangers, and she’s later seen trading “a kiss for a pint” at a local pub. Similarly, Maladie is described as a woman who mixes violence and pleasure and is quickly revealed as a trauma victim herself. Essentially, these are both underwritten depictions of PTSD, ones that attempt to tie together sexuality and emotional “brokenness” in a clumsy, unconvincing way.</p>\n<p>“How are we ever going to see justice if we aren’t a part of justice?” a character says in a later episode, and it’s a line that would mean something if it weren’t thrown into a series that’s crammed with things like goofy-looking CGI laser guns and superpowered brothels. There is an effortless balance to some of Whedon’s earlier works, including <em>Buffy</em>,<em> Firefly</em>, and even <em>Dr. Horrible’s-Sing-A-Long Blog</em>, that made it possible for high-concept genre elements to coexist naturally with human stories. That balance has evaporated, leaving an insubstantial, silly story in its place.</p>\n<p>Some of <em>The Nevers</em>’ first season was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and <strong>Philippa Goslett</strong> was announced as Whedon’s replacement in January, two full months after he stepped down. Either of these behind-the-scenes interruptions could be responsible for the series’ choppier elements, but neither fully explains away its many confounding choices.</p>\n<p>There’s always a unique disappointment that comes with realizing that an artist we once considered great is actually quite the opposite, but it’d be a mistake to dwell on this single narrative failure when the TV landscape is ripe with truly empowering and complex female stories in a way that it wasn’t when Whedon first came into power. Try Alena Smith’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/dickinson-season-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Dickinson</em></a>, or Michaela Coel’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/i-may-destroy-you-hbo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>I May Destroy You</em></a>, or Noelle Stevenson’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</em></a>, or Pamela Adlon’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/better-things-maternal-serendipity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Better Things</em></a>.

They share cast members who sometimes carry over as characters, sometimes not, and they mix genres with both action and comedy vying for viewer attention. The first three remain the most popular as all three of them star &#8212; and are directed by &#8212; <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/sammo-hung-hong-kong-cinema/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Sammo Hung</strong></a>, who&#8217;s joined in supporting fashion by<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/jackie-chan-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> Jackie Chan</strong></a> and <strong>Yuen Biao</strong>. Eureka Entertainment has recently released a collection of those first three complete with beautiful 4K/2K restorations, and we check out the set below. Keep reading for a look at <strong>The <em>Lucky Stars</em> 3-Film Collection</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Winners and Sinners (1983)</h2>\n<p>Teapot (Hung) is a gentle thief who just wants to be left alone as he steals his way through life, but bad luck and poor choices &#8212; he&#8217;s a thief, remember &#8212; land him in jail. He meets four other criminally minded souls, and the five become fast friends. Upon their release, they decide to go straight and form a cleaning service, but it&#8217;s not long before their attempts at legitimacy land them in trouble with some serious gangsters hoping to corner the market on counterfeit US dollars.</p>\n<p>Fans of Hung, Biao, and Chan will probably find this first <em>Lucky Stars</em> feature to be a disappointment as their action antics are kept somewhat to a minimum. Chan plays a cop who crosses paths with the guys, and Biao appears briefly as another officer, but neither has a lot of time here. Instead, the comedy takes center stage &#8212; which wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if it was actually funny. Tastes differ to be sure, but the intended laughs here come from generic hijinks and their inept horniness. Women are manhandled and leered at, and it&#8217;s all a bit icky. The brief bits of action we do get are still thrilling, of course, as Chan and Hung are masters at the craft of fighting, but there&#8217;s definitely not enough of it to carry the running time.</p>\n<p>Eureka Video&#8217;s new Blu-ray release makes it a winner, though, as the brand new 4K restoration delivers a beautiful picture. The Blu-ray also includes several archival extras. The interviews are focused exclusively on Hung and are from different stages of his career, but there are some interesting insights within.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sammo Hung on Winners and Sinners [5:49]</li>\n<li>Teapot Tango: Interview with Sammo Hung [13:30]</li>\n<li>The Man Behind the Legend: Sammo Hung [20:00]</li>\n<li>Lucky Stars live performance [8:02]</li>\n<li>Outtakes [4:57]</li>\n<li>Alternate Japanese end credits</li>\n<li>Trailers</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>My Lucky Stars (1985)</h2>\n<p>Muscles (Chan) and Ricky (Biao) are cops on the trail of a dirty cop, but when they chase the man to Japan they find themselves facing off against yakuza members too. Ricky&#8217;s abducted, and seeing no other option, Muscles calls in the Lucky Stars to help. They&#8217;re in no rush to help the police, of course, but after applying a little blackmail pressure &#8212; and adding a female police officer into the mix for them to lust after &#8212; the guys agree to help crack the case and rescue Ricky.</p>\n<p>The film once again remains led mostly by the comedic hijinks and pervy antics of the five guys, but the action gets a boost this time out with more fights along the way. The addition of <strong>Sibelle Hu</strong> into the mix as the policewoman is a nice touch despite throwing her initially to the wolves, and she gets to partake in the third-act action delivering some solid beat downs. <strong>Michiko Nishiwaki</strong> joins, too, as a female villain and gets in some mighty licks of her own. That said, the film belongs action-wise to Hung and Chan whose fighting skills dominate the big end set-piece in the villain&#8217;s hideout beneath an amusement park. It&#8217;s worth noting that Hung takes over somewhat as the group&#8217;s lead character here too, and it&#8217;s to the benefit of the film. He&#8217;s once again the most kind-hearted and &#8220;normal&#8221; of the bunch, and seeing him eat up some of their screentime is a positive.</p>\n<p>Eureka&#8217;s new disc offers up a sharp 2K restoration of the film and has never looked better. The extras are once again all of the archival variety, but in addition to an interesting interview with Nishiwaki, the other highlight is an export version of the film with a handful of changes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Export Version [1:28:29]</li>\n<li>Interview with Michiko Nishiwaki [20:44]</li>\n<li>Clown Prince: Interview with Sammo Hung [18:00]</li>\n<li>Alternate Japanese end credits</li>\n<li>Music video &#8220;Anachronism&#8221; [2:02]</li>\n<li>Outtakes [9:42]</li>\n<li>Trailers</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Twinkle, Twinkle, Lucky Stars (1985)</h2>\n<p>Muscles and Ricky are once again on a case that requires outside assistance, and against all logic and semblance of good taste, they call in the Lucky Stars to help. The guys are tasked with protecting a young woman who has information damaging to a criminal enterprise, and while they harass her and take any opportunity to press their bodies against her the cops pursue the baddies. Eventually, everyone comes together for one last blowout.</p>\n<p>The final film in the <em>Lucky Stars</em> trilogy follows the others&#8217; pattern of blending a little bit of action with a lot of squirmy sexual harassment continues here. Happily, we also get a young <strong>Andy Lau</strong> and <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong> in early roles too. While silliness remains &#8212; an absurd assassination via men on parasails stands out &#8212; the film goes a little harder too as we get more than a few deaths along the way. The cops shoot and kill a few bad guys, some witnesses are burned alive in a car, and it&#8217;s all unfolding while one of the perverts tries using a voodoo doll to seduce a woman. So yeah, they&#8217;re still at it. Chan and Hung both get in some solid action beats en route to the ending, and as with <em>My Lucky Stars</em>, Hung once again takes the lead of the gang.</p>\n<p>As with the other two films, Eureka gives this third in the trilogy a restoration &#8212; 4K this time, an upgrade also applied to the included Taiwanese cut of the film. The extras include two interviews including one with the great movie villain, Richard Norton.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended Taiwanese version [1:47:09]</li>\n<li>A Life of Laughter: Interview with Richard Ng [21:02]</li>\n<li>Gentleman Warrior: Interview with Richard Norton [32:48]</li>\n<li>Outtakes [3:46]</li>\n<li>Trailers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fans of the films, of any of the three, will absolutely want to pick up The <em>Lucky Stars</em> 3-Film Collection <a href=\"https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/the-lucky-stars-3-film-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from Eureka</a>. The extras may not add anything new to past releases, but the new restorations are massive upgrades and are alone worth the price of admission. The films themselves remain the same mixed bags they&#8217;ve always been &#8212; a little bit of fighting, a whole lot of cringe &#8212; but if that&#8217;s a bag you&#8217;re already comfortable with this is a must-own release.</p>\n<p><em>The review copy of The Lucky Stars Collection provided discs only, but the official release also includes a limited variant for the first 2000 copies featuring a slipcover and booklet.</em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/tiG-11XgYcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 04:33:02 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f049e35ba071eaa8f2ceedbf269d6e4a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/tiG-11XgYcg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-994_7bb8f4bd9aecb6b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245791714},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:11","title":"A Brief (and Bloody) History of Italian Horror","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364614","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video essay about the history of Italian horror movies.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Terrible lip-synching? <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/eyeball-horror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Extra-goopy eye gougings</a>? Disembodied black leather gloves? Mama mia!</p>\n<p>Italian horror boasts a bloody and indelibly stylish reputation. And yet, like most hyper-specific subgenres, Italy&#8217;s horror output might not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. A back-to-back marathon of <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/lucio-fulci-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Lucio Fulci&#8217;</strong>s greatest hits</a> isn&#8217;t universally considered a cozy night in. But for some people, the bugbears of Italian horror movies are exactly what makes the genre so endearing: the melodrama, the candy-red gore, the garish interior design, the social criticism couched in extravagant sleaze.</p>\n<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t help but hoot and holler every time <strong>Goblin</strong> plays over an opening credits sequence. I lean forward when a film&#8217;s title is longer than eight words (god bless you 1972&#8217;s <strong><em>Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key</em></strong>). And I feel like I&#8217;ve won the lottery every time I spot a cameo appearance from <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/dario-argento-the-king-of-giallo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Dario Argento</strong></a><strong>&#8216;</strong>s protégé, <strong>Michele Soavi</strong>, the <em>Where&#8217;s Waldo? </em>of Italian horror. It is a niche territory, to be sure. But it is rich and referential; rewarding dedicated viewers by endlessly reinventing itself, challenging its own rules, and finding new ways to raise the ghoulish stakes.</p>\n<p>The video essay below offers a brief yet surprisingly thorough breakdown of the main movements of the genre: from the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-italian-supernatural-horror-films/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gothic revelation</a> of <strong>Mario Bava&#8217;</strong>s <strong><em>Black Sunday </em></strong>(1977) to the rise and fall of <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/10-giallo-films-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the giallo film</a> and the endless hoards of cheaply-made <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/goriest-italian-horror-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">zombie films</a>. Fair warning: Italian horror movies are not known for holding back on upsetting imagery. And during the genre&#8217;s foray into docu-fiction, some of that visual shock careened dangerously into animal abuse. It goes without saying that any foray into the genre is not for the faint of heart, but if you (understandably) draw the line at fare like <strong><em>Cannibal Holocaust</em></strong>, I recommend pausing at 12:04 and resuming at 14:00.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Watch &#8220;<strong>A Short History of Italian Horror</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">&#8220;:</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A Short History of Italian Horror\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJCo35gX7j0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p id=\"block-19294f9d-99fc-4cee-8ca7-135f7eaf7b45\">This video is by <strong>One Hundred Years of Cinema</strong><em><strong>, </strong></em>a video essay channel producing thoughtful deep dives on just that: a century of cinema.

(Here&#8217;s my <a href=\"http://So yes, it turns out the real super power is the friends we make along the way.\">original review</a>.) One of the best films of 2017, <em>Thelma</em> is a coming of age tale with a dark twist as a teenager with &#8212; abilities &#8212; tries to make her way in the world by leaving home and heading off to college. The film captures the struggles familiar to anyone who&#8217;s left home at an early age while also adding in fundamentalism, unnatural powers, and an amorphous moral identity. Did I mention it&#8217;s also a stunningly shot film with some truly gorgeous shots?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>A Denzel Double!</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364664\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/devil-in-a-blue-dress.jpg\" alt=\"Devil In A Blue Dress\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/devil-in-a-blue-dress.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/devil-in-a-blue-dress-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/devil-in-a-blue-dress-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s never less than disappointing to remember that only a single one of Walter Mosley&#8217;s mystery novels has been adapted for the screen, but at least it managed to snag Denzel Washington in the lead role. <strong><em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em></strong> (1995) should have been a franchise starter with Washington&#8217;s Easy Rawlins skirting racist authorities and solving murders in mid 20th century Los Angeles, but even as a one-off it&#8217;s a fantastically moody and atmospheric experience worth watching. Carl Franklin directs, and Washington is joined by Don Cheadle, Tom Sizemore, and Jennifer Beals for this terrific mystery.</p>\n<p>Washington&#8217;s other box-office flop that year was <strong><em>Virtuosity</em></strong> (1995), an action/thriller riding the short-lived &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; wave of the mid-&#8217;90s. It&#8217;s far from great, but there&#8217;s fun to be had with the dated effects &#8212; cutting edge at the time! &#8212; and the antics of a particularly nasty villain brought to life by Russell Crowe. It&#8217;s silly even if it takes itself seriously, and as the last of director Brett Leonard&#8217;s theatrical outings before heading to direct-to-video fare, it&#8217;s an interesting watch. As a bonus, adventurous viewers with time to spare can make it a Crowe double feature by chasing it with another new arrival to Hulu: <strong><em>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</em></strong> (2004).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Hulu Docs</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-364663 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/we-work.jpg\" alt=\"We Work hulu april 2021\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/we-work.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/we-work-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/we-work-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve heard the name WeWork and thought nothing more about it outside of &#8220;hey isn&#8217;t that the shared office company?&#8221; <strong><em>WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn</em></strong> is a new documentary revealing that there&#8217;s a hell of a lot more to the story. From simple beginnings to the manipulation, fraud, huckstering, greed, and madness that followed, the doc uses archival footage and new interviews to tell the pretty fascinating story of what amounts to a cult hiding in plain sight. People will never cease to amaze me.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sasquatch</em></strong> (premieres April 20th) is a different beast altogether &#8212; it&#8217;s a series rather than a feature, and it&#8217;s investigating a past crime that just might have been committed by a Bigfoot. Yeah, you read that right. A vicious triple homicide from twenty years ago is the focus here as &#8220;evidence&#8221; suggests it might have been the work of a sasquatch, and did I mention this is a documentary series? Bonkers stuff, and as a big-time <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/bigfoot-horror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bigfoot movie</a> nerd of course I&#8217;ll be tuning in for the premiere.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Two Movies Better Than Their Reputation Suggests!</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-359351\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Vanilla-Sky.jpeg\" alt=\"Vanilla Sky\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Vanilla-Sky.jpeg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Vanilla-Sky-320x240.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Zach Braff&#8217;s feature debut as writer/director was beloved upon its initial festival and theatrical release, but over the years <strong><em>Garden State</em></strong> (2004) turned into a punching bag of sorts. Some find it too emo, others too twee, and some just hate Braff &#8212; but the movie is still a wonderfully open look at coming of age and moving on from the damage caused by others. Braff, Peter Sarsgaard, and Natalie Portman are terrific, the film is impeccably crafted on the visual front, and the soundtrack (one of Braff&#8217;s real strengths) is a beautiful blast of aural memories. If you haven&#8217;t seen it in a while, maybe give it another spin with an open mind and heart.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Cameron Crowe&#8217;s <strong><em>Vanilla Sky</em></strong> (2001) was pretty much dismissed by most on its release despite being arguably better than Crowe&#8217;s other Tom Cruise collaboration, <em>Jerry Maguire</em> (1996). A remake of 1997&#8217;s <em>Open Your Eyes</em>, the film had the gall to leave Cruise beneath a distorted face for a good chunk of its running time, and that combined with its mindfuck of a premise left audiences cold. Hopefully, they&#8217;ve matured since then and are willing to give the film another shot as it&#8217;s a beautiful, haunting, wonderfully acted exploration of life and mortality. Kurt Russell is also aces in a small but pivotal role, and like the film above, its soundtrack is a great one.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Complete Hulu List for April 2021</h2>\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-59\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-59\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Release Date</th><th class=\"column-2\">Title</th><th class=\"column-3\">Note</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">4/1</td><td class=\"column-2\">2012 (2009)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">28 Days Later (2003)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Abyss (1989)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Before We Go (2015)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Bug (2007)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Bulworth (1998)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-10 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Changing Lanes (2002)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-11 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Chappaquiddick (2017)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-12 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Chato’s Land (1972)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-13 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Cheech &#38; Chong’s Still Smokin’ (1983)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-14 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Cohen and Tate (1989)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-15 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Color Purple (1985)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-16 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Dead Zone (1983)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-17 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">The Devil’s Double (2011)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-18 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-19 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Die Hard (1988)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-20 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-21 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988)</td><td class=\"column-3\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-22 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"></td><td class=\"column-2\">Dude, Where’s My Car?
