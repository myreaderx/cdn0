Brands, wannabe influencers, and mommy bloggers are all riding the wave of video obsession that has infected society.</p> \n<p>So how do you stand out? Should you buy YouTube views or likes to <em>“jump the queue”</em> and get noticed?<br><br>It’s a conundrum that many people have, so I thought I’d address the most pressing questions related to buying YouTube views. Plus, if you keep reading, you’ll find <strong>10 of the best sites for buying real YouTube views safely and securely.</strong></br></br></p> \n<p>Let’s get started.</p> \n<h3>Contents</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#matter\">Why do views matter on YouTube?</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#illegal\">Is it illegal to buy YouTube views?</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#real\">Where can I buy real YouTube views? </a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#bestsites\">The 10 best sites to buy YouTube views</a> </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#cost\">How much does it cost to purchase views for YouTube?</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/?p=81083#1000\">How do you get 1000 views on YouTube for free?</a></p> \n<h2 id=\"matter\">Why do views matter on YouTube?</h2> \n<p>Views are a key component to growing a brand and reputation on YouTube. The more views you have on a video, the more likely people will choose to watch it when it pops up in their feed.</p> \n<p>Views act as social proof to persuade users to take a moment and check out your content. They’re a credibility booster. They result in likes, subscribers, better search performance, and organic traffic to your channel. It’s a compounding effect that builds momentum and helps you grow your YouTube channel.</p> \n<h2 id=\"illegal\">Is it illegal to buy YouTube views?</h2> \n<p>Put simply, no it’s not illegal to buy YouTube views.</p> \n<p>But there’s a caveat…</p> \n<p>It’s against YouTube’s Terms of Service to buy bot views or to trick people into watching a video.</p> \n<p>However, if you choose the right service for buying views you shouldn’t have an issue. The best YouTube promotion services work with a network of REAL users who view and interact with videos. How could it possibly be illegal for someone to watch a video? It’s not.</p> \n<p>There are also rumours that you could get your account banned, a video deleted, or lose your view count if you buy YouTube views. While this isn’t impossible, it’s very very rare. If you work with reputable providers, ten of which I’m about to mention in this article, and follow best practices for drip-feeding views over a reasonable amount of time, your account and videos will all be safe.</p> \n<h2 id=\"real\">Where can I buy real YouTube views?</h2> \n<p>If it’s so important to buy real YouTube views and avoid bots, where can you find them?</p> \n<p>There are thousands of services that sell YouTube views. Many of which are 100% safe to use and some that are dodgy bot farms.</p> \n<p>To find the right service provider, look out for these signs of credibility:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Secure website.</strong> Make sure the site you’re buying views from has an SSL certificate installed, signalled by the “lock” sign in the browser bar.</li>\n <li><strong>Reputable payment gateway.</strong> Be confident when buying YouTube views by ensuring they use reputable payment providers, such as Apple Pay, and accept the major credit cards.</li>\n</ul> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stormviews-Buy-Real-Youtube-Views-And-Boost-Your-Profile-Instantly.png\" alt=\"Stormviews-Buy-Real-Youtube-Views-And-Boost-Your-Profile-Instantly\" class=\"wp-image-81091\" srcset=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stormviews-Buy-Real-Youtube-Views-And-Boost-Your-Profile-Instantly.png 810w, https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stormviews-Buy-Real-Youtube-Views-And-Boost-Your-Profile-Instantly-768x420.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Real testimonials. </strong>Read through their customer testimonials, if they have any, to ensure they look real and genuine.</li>\n <li><strong>Customer service.</strong> Ideally the service you choose will have responsive support available 24/7 so you can get the help you need if anything goes awry.</li>\n <li><strong>Genuine users.</strong> Make sure you are buying views from real YouTube users, not bots.

Here are the 10 best sites to get you started.</p> \n<h3>1.

You can also buy YouTube likes and followers, too.</p> \n<p>Some other positive things about Stormviews is that they have numerous customer testimonials, 24/7 customer support, and you won’t need to compromise your account by handing over a password. Unlike the other services on this list they focus exclusively on YouTube – which talks to the quality of its services.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.stormviews.net/buy-youtube-views?ref=5f474661da6b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Get started with Stormviews here.</a></p> \n<h3>2.

They’ve got a range of social media promotion services including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Spotify, and more.</p> \n<p>One thing I like about Viralyft is its live chat – you can get in touch with their team in real-time and answer any questions you have before making a purchase.

Much like Viralyft, Getviral provides a range of social media promotion services to help boost your profiles.</p> \n<p>Its starting price is a little higher than the first two services on the list, but it’s still affordable. They also have 24/7 support, via email and live chat, and don’t require your password. However, I couldn’t find any notes on whether or not the views would be from real users or not.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.getviral.io/buy-youtube-views\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Find out more at Getviral.io.</a></p> \n<h3>4.

Also, it will look more organic and not raise any alarms with YouTube if you take things slowly.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1000\">How do you get 1000 views on YouTube for free?</h2> \n<p>Buying YouTube views can accelerate the growth of your channel, but you also need to follow organic best practices too. Views are worthless if people aren’t compelled to subscribe and watch again next time you post a video!</p> \n<p>Here are some tips you can follow to get more YouTube views without just paying for them:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Target a niche.</strong> Due to the enormous number of creators trying to make a splash on YouTube, it’s super crowded. If you try to compete for attention in generic categories it will be extremely hard to gain traction. By targeting a smaller niche, you can get noticed more quickly.</li>\n <li><strong>Create entertaining or informative content. </strong>It may sound simple, but you need to create interesting content! Viewers on YouTube want to be entertained or informed about a topic, don’t create boring content and expect to grow interest in your brand.</li>\n <li><strong>Follow best practice video search optimization.</strong> YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world and also features in Google search results. To feature in searches, be sure to optimize your videos for keywords, use relevant tags, and create keyword optimized “chapters” in the video progress bar.</li>\n</ul> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Youtube-1.png\" alt=\"Youtube\" class=\"wp-image-81109\" srcset=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Youtube-1.png 810w, https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Youtube-1-768x517.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Use cards and end screens. </strong>You can add cards and end screens to your videos after they are published to direct viewers to other videos, branded pages, or encourage them to subscribe to your channel. They’re essential for increasing views organically.</li>\n <li><strong>Design custom thumbnails.</strong> YouTube automatically generates a thumbnail for your video, but you can upload a custom image. This allows you to optimize the thumbnail with text, relevant graphics, and on-brand colors. Custom thumbnails get higher click-throughs. Nick Nimmin’s channel below shows what custom thumbnails look like:</li>\n</ul> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nick-Nimmin-1.png\" alt=\"Nick-Nimmin\" class=\"wp-image-81103\" srcset=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nick-Nimmin-1.png 810w, https://www.jeffbullas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nick-Nimmin-1-768x292.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Create playlists. </strong>YouTube playlists allow you to group videos based on a series or category.
