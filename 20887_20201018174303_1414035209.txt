An anomalous eutectic formed\r\nat the bottom of the molten pool when the sample was remelted thoroughly. 3D morphologies of the α\r\n-Ni and Ni 3 Sn phases in the anomalous eutectic region were obtained and investigated using serial\r\nsectioning reconstruction technology. It is found that the Ni 3 Sn phase has a continuous\r\ninterconnected network structure and the α -Ni phase is distributed as separate particles in the\r\nanomalous eutectic, which is consistent with the electron backscatter diffraction pattern\r\nexaminations. The α -Ni particles in the anomalous eutectic are supersaturated with Sn element as\r\ncompared with the equilibrium phase diagram. Meanwhile, small wavy lamella eutectics coexist with\r\nanomalous eutectics. The Trivedi–Magnin–Kurz model was used to estimate undercooling with lamellar\r\nspacing. The results suggest that the critical undercooling found in undercooling soli...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":20887,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"571d8040501696f703a60018d69c365a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yong-Qing Cao, Xin Lin, Zhi-Tai Wang, Li-Lin Wang, Meng-Hua Song, Hai-Ou Yang and Wei-Dong Huang","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603042983834}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:43:03","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:43:03","feedId":20887,"fetchDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 17:43:03 +0000","fetchMs":49043,"handleMs":22,"totalMs":49071,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"2f7dd87c47b0002d57f426ee800b43f1","hostName":"us-034*","requestId":"566dc5f12e9d4bdab3fbb0b6ab4c2e19_20887","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:23:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:11:41","id":20887,"name":"Science and Technology of Advanced Materials - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1468-6996/?rss=1","subscriber":159,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/06/20-11-41-263_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Science and Technology of Advanced Materials","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603042934768,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":49044,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":22,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
