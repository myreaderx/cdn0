These three\nwords begin a headline in a recent experiment, “Engage X for.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s\nanalyze them, but before we do that ask yourself a question. What are the first\nthree words you are using right now on an important headline? An important\nheadline in your email, or in your landing page. Because it is not enough to\nhear me teach, you have to think of how you can apply this immediately to your\nown circumstances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, three words\n“Engage X for,” these words were built by the brand in their best-performing\npage. Notice however, that the first word is “Engage,” that is a sales word.\nAnd it actually tells you to do something the company wants you to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Engage X” (“X”\nstands for their brand) “Engage X for.” Indeed, the Marketer writing this may\nbe a superb communicator, but right now, they are communicating the wrong\nmessage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I am not\nsaying that as a matter of opinion. But in our lab we ran 20,000+ treatments\nand experiments, and tests like this. And we tested this, the new headline said\n“X gives you.” Those are the first three words we used. They could be improved.\nBut even still, this approach, which began not with what the company wants you\nto do, but with what you can get from the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That shift in\norientation, that shift in messaging strategy, was part of the new email that\nwe sent. And the new email outperformed the old email by 104%. To be clear, the\nnew email more than doubled the amount of leads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we\nlearn? There are three keys. In the next three minutes I am going to unpack\nthem. I want this to be as helpful and as dense as possible. Let’s learn them\ntogether now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power in\nthis approach comes from an implied value proposition. It begins with the first\nkey. A “reason-centric copy.” What does that mean? It means that you should\nfocus the email not on what you want them to do for you, but the reason that\nthey should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s compare\nthe two headlines in full, “Engage X for your physician’s social media\nstrategy”– eight words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at\nthe next one, “X gives you immediate access to over 120,000 doctors,” that is\neight words and one number. And the difference is profound. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second\napproach gives you a reason, not just any reason, but a specific value-proposition-focused\nreason. It helps to answer this question, “Why should I select your\norganization over XYZ?” – that is my other options – why should I choose you\nover the other options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings me\nto the second critical concept, the second principle. Don’t just uses reason-centric\ncopy, but use quantitative copy. Now, the second principle ties tightly into\nthe first. Because it’s not enough to give them a reason, it’s not enough\nunless they believe the reason you give.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s compare\nthe two approaches in these two emails. The first one says “need to engage,” by\nthe way, terrible. We are saying the same thing we said in the headline. We are\nsaying it in a different way and we are saying it in a confusing way. “Need to\nengage practicing physicians?” ”learn how.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to\nlearn, I don’t want to work. But you are now asking me to work. How to use “X”\nphysician-only social media tools to conduct research and create product\nawareness. Long, drab, painful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look\nat the opening line of the second email, “X is the largest social network of\nverified US physicians, representing 68 specialties. Physicians spend 35,000\nhours per month on ‘X,’ discussing drugs, medical products, and procedures.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you see how\ndifferent the second approach is? It is giving you quantitative information.\nStudies have shown over and over again, studies in our own research program, that\nwhen we quantify, we help people believe. Now instead of hammering them again\nwith vague words, and a notion of what we want them to do, we are giving them\nfurther reasons why they at least ought to put us in the consideration set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they believe\nthese reasons, they will also be believing the essence of the value\nproposition. So these first two principles are critical, but let me share a\nthird and final principle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sequenced copy.\nNotice how the call-to-action for the first email is “get started.” Get is a\nword we often use in a call-to-action. But they use it in exactly the wrong\nway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Get started\nwith a free 30-minute demo.” Well that sounds like a value to them. But that’s\nnot what I hear as a prospective customer. I have to start by obligating myself\nto giving you information so that I have to get on a phone call and listen to\nyou people try to sell me. Every aspect of that call-to-action has implied\nnegatives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we’ve done\nin a sequenced copy is we have matched the ask to the exact place they are in\nthe sequence of thought. We don’t optimize for web pages or emails, we optimize\nfor the sequence of thought. So the call the action for the second approach is\n“see how X works.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now if you are\na marketer and this is turning a light on for you, bear this in mind. We didn’t\nlearn these things without making horrific mistakes on our own. I am\nembarrassed at the things I have done wrong over the years. But I continue to\nlearn the essence of marketing is the message, the essence of the message is\nthe value proposition. And all of this comes down to psychology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two\nways we can frustrate our best efforts. There are two flawed asks. These asks\nwill mitigate the power of our message. An ask to the wrong person or an ask at\nthe wrong time. Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing\nright. The marketer must deliver the right message, to the right prospect, at\nthe same time, or it is no longer the right message.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com/value-proposition/the-implied-value-proposition-three-ways-to-transform-your-sales-copy\">The Implied Value Proposition: Three ways to transform your sales copy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marketingexperiments.com\">MarketingExperiments</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Jun 2021 18:56:31 +0000","feedId":15987,"bgimg":"https://marketingexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/maxresdefault-10.jpg","linkMd5":"47ee6a3a5af5cbfbc7c6e654222f28ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_1/2022/03/14/09-38-42-064_ad1f964246e9a43e.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":134754,"destBytes":77996,"author":"Daniel Burstein","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://marketingexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/maxresdefault-10.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_1/2022/03/14/09-38-42-064_ad1f964246e9a43e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647250660759}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 17:37:40","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 17:37:40","feedId":15987,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 09:37:40 +0000","fetchMs":102,"handleMs":12,"totalMs":61959,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":6,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"79b59b7ab14b8d981e3d8a220e20848a","hostName":"us-003*","requestId":"bd5da8b70db54a5db5604b16dfad8722_15987","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":77996,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx21":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:11:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:37:27","id":15987,"name":"MarketingExperiments","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/MktgExperimentsBlog","subscriber":209,"website":null,"icon":"https://marketingexperiments.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/06/18-37-24-166_0596f8abd190dd5d.jpg","description":"Research-driven optimization, testing, and marketing ideas","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":77996,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1647250660631,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":116,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":12,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://marketingexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/maxresdefault-10.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_1/2022/03/14/09-38-42-064_ad1f964246e9a43e.webp","sourceBytes":134754,"destBytes":77996,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":15987,"totalSpendMs":1568,"convertSpendMs":29,"createdTime":"2022-03-14 17:38:40","host":"europe21*","referer":"https://marketingexperiments.com/?p=29764","linkMd5ListStr":"47ee6a3a5af5cbfbc7c6e654222f28ff,47ee6a3a5af5cbfbc7c6e654222f28ff","githubUser":"myreaderx21","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"131.6 KB","destSize":"76.2 KB","compressRate":"57.9%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx21":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
