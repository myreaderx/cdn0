Cats and dogs never seem to stop shedding, which makes cleaning up a bit of a hassle. The best way to keep your home clean is with a reliable robot vacuum like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNPDMRP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">iRobot Roomba i7+</a> that takes care of the furry mess every day. We've done our research and gathered a list of the best robot vacuums for pet hair, which varies from our picks for <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best robot vacuum</a> overall. See which one fits your needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bestoverall\" class=\"separator\">Best Overall: <em>iRobot Roomba i7+</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/irobot-roomba-i7-lifestyle.jpg?itok=8R-N5VXQ\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is most definitely an expensive choice for your home, but it's also one of the only robot vacuums on the market that can dump its dustbin load and continue working. When you spring for the i7+, you get the vacuum and the Clean Base where dustbin loads are stored. You can also purchase a less expensive <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNRGDKP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">i7 vacuum on its own</a>, but it won't be compatible with the Clean Base. iRobot designed the Clean Base's bags to hold up to 30 bins worth of debris before needing a replacement, so you can go for long stretches without cleaning up after your vacuum. One thing to note is that while the process of dumping debris into the Clean Base is super convenient, it's also very loud.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this such a big pull for pet owners? Bundles of poofy fur tend to clog dustbins up faster than other debris, which forces the vacuum to stop working. But if the device can empty itself, then it can go on cleaning up after your fluffy friends. The included filter also traps 99% of pet allergens to keep your home clean. If that wasn't enough, the recharge and resume feature makes it so that if the vacuum runs out of juice, it will head to the charger. Once back to a full charge, it will continue the job where it left off.</p>\n\n<p>This device uses advanced mapping skills, which allow it to survey your home and distinguish one room from another. If you want it to clean a specific room or you want it to avoid a particular area, you simply give the command on the iRobot HOME app. You can also control it using Alexa or Google Assistant. What's more, once it has mapped your home, you can place the vacuum in any room, and it will be able to tell where it is by detecting landmarks.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Empties its dustbin</li>\n<li>Traps 99% of pet allergens</li>\n<li>Works with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>\n<li>Control with iRobot HOME app</li>\n<li>Floor mapping and room skipping</li>\n<li>Recharge and resume</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Super expensive</li>\n<li>Clean Base is loud</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Overall</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">iRobot Roomba i7+</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/irobot-roomba-i7.jpg?itok=FDwGjhZ-\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNPDMRP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$800 at Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Firobot-roomba-i7-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-with-automatic-dirt-disposal-charcoal%252F6280529.p%253FskuId%253D6280529&amp;token=1q4r0q1D\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$800 at Best Buy</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A vacuum that empties its own dustbin</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">With this setup, you won't need to interact with your vacuum nearly as much since it empties its dustbin into the Clean Base and continues working.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 id=\"bestbudget\" class=\"separator\">Best Budget: <em>iLife V3s Pro</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/ilife-v3s-pro-lifestyle.jpg?itok=z9hRa9UC\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a reliable robot vacuum that consistently and reliably takes care of pet hair, then the iLife V3s Pro is the perfect choice for you. It's the least expensive option on our list by a decent amount, and yet it has a decent battery life - up to 100 minutes on one charge. It isn't as fancy as more expensive units, for example, it can't map rooms, it doesn't work with smart home assistants, and it doesn't have an app to control it. To make it operate, there are physical buttons on the vacuum, or you can use the included remote control.</p>\n\n<p>Since it specializes in hardwood and low pile carpet floors, this vacuum doesn't have any brushes. Being brush-less allows it to pick up plenty of fur without the individual hairs getting stuck in the bristles. When it runs out of power, it automatically returns to the dock and charges itself. However, if it runs out of power while it's in the middle of a cleaning job, it won't pick up where it left off once it's gotten some juice.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to get rid of fur bunnies is to schedule cleaning times for when there's little to no foot traffic. Use the spot clean feature to have the vacuum attack areas that tend to get extra messy. As with any robot vacuum, you'll need to clean out the dustbin and filter regularly to keep it in proper working order.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Runs up to 100 minutes</li>\n<li>Schedule cleaning times</li>\n<li>Comes with remote</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No recharge and resume feature</li>\n<li>Doesn't map rooms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Budget</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">iLife V3s Pro</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/ilife-v3s-pro.jpg?itok=HfwTNb4h\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ILIFE-Robotic-Powerful-Tangle-free-Planning/dp/B06Y56NDF4?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$160 at Amazon</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A cheap vacuum for pet hair</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">It runs for up to 140 minutes before needing a recharge, and you can schedule it to clean at specific times.

It has a large dustbin capacity of 1100mL, which is more than double the average size. It will be able to store more fur, dirt, and crumbs than others on the market. As far as robot vacuums go, it's also on the cheaper side of the spectrum, while still providing a quality product. For instance, it can run up to 140 minutes before needing to recharge and also features a HEPA filter to trap 99.7% of pet allergens, which will help reduce sneezing in your home.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike some other devices, this one doesn't map rooms, and a smartphone cannot control it. It comes with a round remote control, which you can use to set the vacuum to a 7-day schedule. You can also use this remote to steer the device to a specific section if you want a spot cleaned. When you flip the device over, you'll find a place where you can attach a microfiber mop. Set the bObsweep to wet/dry mop mode, and it will dispense water to clean your floors more thoroughly. Don't worry. It will leave your floors plenty dry.</p>\n\n<p>The vacuum's impressive LCD screen notifies you if the device is having a problem and lets you see the current battery life. When the battery gets low, this vacuum automatically returns to its base to recharge. This purchase also includes blOck Plus, which you can use to deter Bob from entering certain areas. It comes in five different colors so you can choose the look you like best: champagne, charcoal, rouge, cobalt, or midnight.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Runs 120 - 140 minutes</li>\n<li>Wet/dry mop</li>\n<li>Five color options</li>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n<li>Can schedule</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No smartphone app</li>\n<li>Doesn't map rooms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best for Large Capacity</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">bObsweep PetHair Plus</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/bobsweep-pethair-plus.jpg?itok=xMGT7t2X\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JSSGSRI?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$294 at Amazon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FbObsweep-PetHair-Plus-Robotic-Vacuum-Cleaner-and-Mop-Charcoal%252F333294456&amp;token=gv8hWH92\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$432 at Walmart</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252F0ER-008W-00001%253FDescription%253Dbobsweep%252Bpethair%2526cm_re%253Dbobsweep_pethair-_-0ER-008W-00001-_-Product%2526quicklink%253Dtrue&amp;token=8AaWCZJ8\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$390 at Newegg</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">An inexpensive vacuum for pet owners</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">This vacuum features long 11-inch brushes and has an extra-large dustbin to store more dirt and fur when cleaning.

That means it will keep cleaning for long periods and can tackle large areas. However, it also has a relatively small dustbin, so you'll need to empty it often (especially if you have a long-haired animal in your home) for it to clean effectively. This unit can be controlled in a few different ways, either by using Amazon Alexa, the Roborock app or by pressing the physical buttons on top of the device.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to vacuuming, you can use the Roborock S6 to mop your hard floors. Simply attach the mop to the bottom side. It leaves your floors relatively dry, so you don't have to worry about water damage. The thing you'll need to be wary about is that this unit cannot detect when it comes across a carpet in mop mode. You might need to move it for it to clean the proper areas. Altogether, this unit has five different modes to help you clean effectively: carpet, quiet, mopping, turbo, and max. As with most robot vacuums, it's ideal for hard floors and low-pile to medium-pile carpet.</p>\n\n<p>This unit is smarter than others. It has sensors to detect ledges and obstacles, which will prevent it from falling down stairs or damaging things in your home. It also maps your house for a more thorough cleaning. It will zigzag back and forth to cover every inch of flooring instead of randomly wandering. Plus, it comes in either black or white so you can choose the look you like best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Runs up to 180 minutes</li>\n<li>Works with Alexa</li>\n<li>Controlled with app</li>\n<li>Has mop mode</li>\n<li>Smart mapping</li>\n<li>Tackles large areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Small dustbin</li>\n<li>Mop mode doesn't detect carpets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Battery Life</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roborock S6</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/roborock-s6.jpg?itok=0lN4-66E\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Multi-Floor-Navigation-Selective-Connected/dp/B084Z5P2BX?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$600 at Amazon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FRoborock-S6-Pure-Robot-Vacuum-Mop-Cleaner-Black%252F822314432%253Fwmlspartner%253Dwlpa%2526selectedSellerId%253D0&amp;token=srAwLJL-\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$550 at Walmart</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Froborock-rsd0108us-s6-pure-robot-vacuum-mop-cleaner-white%252Fp%252FN82E16896493003%253FDescription%253Droborock%252Bs6%2526cm_re%253Droborock_s6-_-96-493-003-_-Product%2526quicklink%253Dtrue&amp;token=KnDFB9cy\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$550 at Newegg</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A long-lasting robot vacuum</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">With a battery life of up to 180 minutes, this vacuum can work for long stretches and cover large areas of your home before needing a recharge.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 id=\"bestcorners\" class=\"separator\">Best for Corners: <em>Neato Botvac D6</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/neato-botvac-d6-lifestyle.jpg?itok=zsPKQwG1\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you own pets, then you know that fur somehow manages to ball up in the corners of your home. You'll notice by looking around that most robot vacuums are circular, whereas the Neato Botvac D6 has a flat edge on one side. This allows it to dive into baseboard corners to more effectively pick up balls of fur and other litter that collect in these penned areas. It can hold up to 700mL in its dustbin, which is a little higher than average. You'll need to keep an eye on that dustbin since this unit doesn't let you know when it gets full.</p>\n\n<p>It features an extra-large brush to help pick up pet hair and other litter. It also runs longer than many other devices. This device can clean for up to 120 minutes before needing a recharge. It's one of the more intelligent models as it features Wi-Fi connectivity, laser sensors, and floor mapping. The sensors allow it to detect obstacles in its path, so it's less likely to get snagged on random items along the way.</p>\n\n<p>It can be controlled using Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Watch, or the Neato app. It's definitely on the more expensive side of robot vacuums.

However, some have been designed with a quiet mode so they won't be as noisy. If your children are sleeping or you're trying not to frighten your poor four-legged friend too much, then the RoboVac 11S Max is a great option to consider. Its quiet mode is one of the best while still having the power to suck up all that pet hair.</p>\n\n<p>It runs up to 100 minutes at a time, so it can tackle large sections in one cleaning. The tradeoff here is that the device doesn't have any mapping abilities. That means that it might wander around a little instead of being as thorough as other vacuums. It still does a great job of cleaning, though, and it features 10 infrared sensors to detect obstacles and ledges. This will prevent it from falling down stairs or bulldozing into your belongings.</p>\n\n<p>Since it doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi, it won't work with an app, Alexa, or Google Assistant. However, it can be controlled with the included remote. To help you better clean your home, there are four different cleaning modes: Auto Mode, Edge Clean, Spot Clean, and Quick Clean. Finally, this vacuum has one of the sleekest designs of any robot vacuum we've seen.

You'll be able to control it using the EufyHome app, or by giving voice commands to Alexa or Google Assistant. There's even a remote control included in the box if you'd prefer that method.</p>\n\n<p>It has a good battery life of up to 100 minutes, which means it will be able to tackle large sections of your home in each go.

This way, it can avoid falling to its doom or ramming into your belongings.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most convenient feature is the ability to set up cleaning schedules. This way, you can have the unit cleaning your home while you're away or doing other tasks. I also love the look of this vacuum. It will clean your home without being an eyesore.

For this reason, being able to empty the dustbin and filter on your robot vacuum quickly makes it more convenient to keep your device running effectively. Unlike many other companies that hide the dustbin, Samsung's robot vacuum has a top-loading dustbin that pops out at the press of a button. This makes it so you can easily see how full of pet hair the container is without having to stop the device or open any lids.</p>\n\n<p>Price-wise, this is a mid-range option due to its advanced Wi-Fi abilities. It will map your home, making it easier to cover every inch of your floor. You'll be able to control it or monitor its progress using the SmartThings app. Cleaning sessions can also be started by giving voice commands to Alexa or Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the battery life of this device isn't the best. It will only run for up to 90 minutes. However, it does have a recharge and resume feature, which means that it will return to its dock when the battery is low and then return cleaning where it left off once it's recharged. Admittedly, this isn't the prettiest vacuum you'll find, but the top-load dustbin and Wi-Fi capabilities make it a great option for pet owners.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Easy dustbin access</li>\n<li>Mapping</li>\n<li>Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>\n<li>Works with SmartThings app</li>\n<li>Recharge and resume cleaning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not as pretty as other vacuums</li>\n<li>Pricey</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Dustbin Removal</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Samsung POWERbot R7065</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/samsung-powerbot-r7065.jpg?itok=rxLINoLU\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-POWERbot-R7065-Vacuum-Amazon/dp/B073WZ42XD?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$573 at Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fsamsung-powerbot-r7065-app-controlled-self-charging-robot-vacuum-satin-titanium%252F6190501.p%253FskuId%253D6190501%2526cmp%253DRMX&amp;token=pvy_RpkL\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop cta-auto-inserted cta-auto-inserted--bestbuy norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$600 at Best Buy</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fsamsung-vr2am7065ws-aa-powerbot-r7065-robot-vacuum%252Fp%252F0UH-001C-00023%253FDescription%253Dsamsung%252Bpowerbot%252Br7065%2526cm_re%253Dsamsung_powerbot%252Br7065-_-9SIA8X586A1562-_-Product&amp;token=Sjo6EPih\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$596 at Newegg</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Easily remove this vacuum's dustbin</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Unlike other robot vacuums, this one has a top-load dustbin, which is easily removed.

Keeping the area around your cat's litter box clean is also a daunting task since they can track it everywhere. This can leave high-traffic areas like your entryway or kitchen pretty filthy. If you want something that can hone in on these messes for a more thorough cleaning, you should consider the iRobot Roomba 960. It uses Dirt Detect Technology and powerful suction to find and focus in on dirty areas.</p>\n\n<p>This device is definitely on the pricey side, but it has several advanced features to warrant the cost. For one thing, it has built-in Wi-Fi so you can control it using the app or by giving a voice command to a smart home aid like Alexa or Google Assistant. It also maps out your home so it will vacuum in orderly lines rather than just zooming from one random location to another. Using the app, you can set the device to clean at times that are most convenient for your household.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't the quietest device out there, but it's also not the loudest. Just note that it will make a decent amount of noise when running, especially when on its highest settings. Additionally, it doesn't come with a remote. You'll need to rely on your smartphone to control it. Whether or not that's an issue will vary depending on your personal preference. All in all, this is a mighty vacuum that can help zone in on dirty areas.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dirt Detect technology</li>\n<li>Powerful suction</li>\n<li>Works with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>\n<li>Mapping</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n<li>No remote</li>\n<li>Loud</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Dirt Detection</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">iRobot Roomba 980</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/irobot-roomba-980.jpg?itok=ZGzxTRvF\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FiRobot-Roomba-980-Wi-Fi-Connected-Robot-Vacuum-Manufacturer-s-Warranty%252F47449537&amp;token=vrfuwDHB\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop cta-auto-inserted cta-auto-inserted--walmart norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$723 at Walmart</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU77500YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fblack-irobot-r980020-roomba-980-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum%252Fp%252F0UH-0001-00041%253FDescription%253Dirobot%252Broomba%252B980%2526cm_re%253Dirobot_roomba%252B980-_-0UH-0001-00041-_-Product%2526quicklink%253Dtrue&amp;token=g--wUHy6\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$895 at Newegg</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Focuses in on dirt for better cleaning</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">This Roomba has advanced Dirt Detect Technology, so it can clean a messy area more thoroughly.

When making your choice, you'll want to consider cost, how large the vacuum's dustbin is, how long the battery life lasts, how well it sucks up pet hair, and any additional convenience features.</p>\n\n<p>We highly recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNPDMRP?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77500YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">iRobot Roomba i7+</a> since it can dump its dustbin into the included Clean Base and continue working without you needing to do anything. That means that when it fills up with Fluffy's fur, it can dump the load and go back to cleaning your house instead of waiting for you to clean it out. It's Wi-Fi-connected and can be controlled using the iRobot HOME app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. Since it has such an advanced mapping ability, you can explicitly tell the vacuum which rooms to clean and which ones to avoid for a tailored cleaning experience.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">How to choose the best robot vacuum</h2>\n\n<p>Finding a robot vacuum that efficiently sucks up pet hair and offers additional conveniences can be a difficult chore. If you have a dog, you'll want something that can handle in-depth dirt removal, and if you have a cat, you'll likely want something that can pick up kitty litter as well. Here are some things to help you find the best robot vacuum for your furry needs.</p>\n\n<h3>Battery Life</h3>\n\n<p>Chances are if you have a pet that you probably have a ton of fur scattered through your home. It tends to gather along baseboards, in your carpet, and especially in corners. Having a vacuum with long battery life ensures that more of your house gets cleaned in one stretch. The best vacuums also have a charge and resume feature to get every section.</p>\n\n<p>The Roborock S6 is a great option for anyone with a large home. It can clean for up to 180 minutes at a time. If the unit runs out of juice, it will head back to its dock. Once recharged, it will finish up its cleaning schedule. Since it maps your house, it does a more thorough cleaning than many other vacuums.</p>\n\n<p>The bObsweep PetHair Plus has an impressive run time of up to 140 minutes. It's one of the rare vacuums that has a display on the top of the unit. If it's nearby, you can glance down and easily see how much battery life it has left.</p>\n\n<p>If you're having issues keeping the corners of your home cleaned and you have a lot of floor to cover, you should look into the Neato Botvac D6. It runs up to 120 minutes at a time, and it's \"D\"-shaped design allows it to more easily suck up dust and debris from the corners of your home.</p>\n\n<h3>Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Battery Life</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Roborock S6 - 180 mins</li>\n<li>bObsweep PetHair Plus - 140 mins</li>\n<li>Neato Botvac D6 - 120 mins</li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba i7+ - 120 mins</li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba 980 - 120 mins</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Dustbin Capacity</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to long battery life, you want a vacuum with a decent sized dustbin. The average dustbin capacity is 0.5 liters, so anything above that is really nice.</p>\n\n<p>The bObsweep PetHair Plus blows all other devices out of the water with its 1.1-liter dustbin. This makes it ideal for homes with multiple pets or pets with long fur. As we saw before, it also has an impressive battery life. That means it will be able to run for long stretches and pick up more fur before needing to be emptied.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Neato Botvac D6's impressive 0.7-liter container, this vacuum's shape allows it to clean corners better than many of its competitors. That way, all of those fur piles gathering at the edges of your room will actually get sucked up.</p>\n\n<p>There's a three-way tie for the third-best dustbin capacity, with the iRobot Roomba i7+, Eufy RoboVac 15C Max, and Eufy RoboVac 11S Max all being able to hold 0.6 liters. However, the iRobot Roomba i7+ has the edge over Eufy's vacuums. This self-emptying vacuum dumps its loads into the included cleaning base and then continues vacuuming. The cleaning base holds up to 30 dustbin loads, so you won't have to take the rubbish to the trash nearly as frequently.</p>\n\n<h3>Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Dustbin Capacity</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>bObsweep PetHair Plus - 1.1 L</li>\n<li>Neato Botvac D6 - 0.7 L</li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba i7+ - 0.6 L</li>\n<li>Eufy RoboVac 15C Max - 0.6 L</li>\n<li>Eufy RoboVac 11S Max - 0.6 L</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Smarts and Conveniences</h3>\n\n<p>Having a smart vacuum can seriously make your cleaning experience easier, but there are additional conveniences that can make a vacuum more appealing.</p>\n\n<p>The iRobot Roomba i7+ is by far the most convenient device on this list. Its unique self-emptying ability allows it to dump up to 30 dustbin loads into the cleaning base without you having to do anything. Additionally, this vacuum maps your house to cover every possible inch of floor. Should the device run out of juice, it will recharge at the dock and then resume cleaning. You can control and monitor it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<p>The Roborock S6 is also a device with extra conveniences. It maps your home for a thorough cleaning, and you can set virtual boundaries if you don't want it to go somewhere. When it reaches 19%, it returns to its dock and charges up before resuming its cleaning schedule. You can control it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. You can even have it mop your floors by attaching the proper accessories.</p>\n\n<p>When your pets track in dirt or litter, it helps to have a robot vacuum that can narrow in on the debris. That's where the iRobot Roomba 980 comes in handy. It employs Dirt Detect Technology, so it knows when to focus in on specific messy areas of your floors instead of simply passing over them once. It also maps your home and can be controlled using the app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<h3>Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Smarts and Conveniences</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>iRobot Roomba i7+</li>\n<li>Roborock S6 </li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba 980 </li>\n<li>Neato Botvac D6 </li>\n<li>Shark Ion R85 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Price (lowest to highest)</h3>\n\n<p>If you're simply looking for a frugal option to help you clean up after your beloved pets, then it helps to know which vacuums can suck up fur without costing too much. Just be aware that you typically pass up certain conveniences by choosing less expensive units.</p>\n\n<p>The iLife V3s Pro is the least expensive device that still works well in pet homes. It doesn't come with an app, but you'll still be able to control it using the included remote. Additionally, since it doesn't map your home, it will bounce around randomly, but it will do a good job cleaning the ground it covers. Just note that this device is specifically meant for hard floors and low-pile carpets.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being the second most inexpensive vacuum, you can start the Shark ION R85 using the included app. You can also set cleaning schedules or control the unit using Alexa or Google Assistant. This is a powerful device that can suck up fur and debris like dry pet food or cat litter. The tradeoff is that it doesn't map your home.</p>\n\n<p>Eufy's RoboVac 11S Max is a great little device for the money. It doesn't have an app, but it comes with a remote so you can control it from a distance. It features four cleaning modes to clean your floors better and has a sleek design. Just note that it doesn't map your home, so it won't clean every inch of floor like some other options.</p>\n\n<h3>Best robot vacuums for pet hair, ranked by Price (lowest to highest)</h3>\n\n<p>These prices tend to fluctuate, but this how they compared when this article was last updated.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>iLife V3s Pro - $160</li>\n<li>Eufy RoboVac 15C Max - $200</li>\n<li>Eufy RoboVac 11S Max - $250</li>\n<li>bObsweep PetHair Plus - $294</li>\n<li>Shark ION R85 - $400</li>\n<li>Neato Botvac D6 - $500</li>\n<li>Roborock S6 - $550</li>\n<li>Samsung POWERbot R7065 - $573</li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba 980 - $723</li>\n<li>iRobot Roomba i7+ - $800</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"no-amazon\">Credits</h2>\n\n<p class=\"credit\"><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-robot-vacuums-pet-hair\" title=\"Best Robot Vacuums for Pet Hair in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/04/reviewers-2017-rebecca-spear-015.jpg?itok=3l5NoRMr\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\"><strong>Rebecca Spear</strong> loves keeping up-to-date with the latest and greatest electronics.

No matter how many excellent gimmicks or new features they have, though, I always end up back in the loving arms of the original Gmail app thanks to its consistency, familiarity, and overall simplicity. Generally speaking, it has everything I need and nothing that I don't want. Well, that is, until Google went and stuffed a giant Google Meet tab at the bottom of my inbox. If this annoys you as much as it does me, I'll show you how you can get rid of that Google Meet tab and return your Gmail inbox to the simple space it once was (just don't worry about the unread count; those will go away, I promise!).</p>\n\n<h2>How to disable the Google Meet tab in Gmail on Android</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <strong>Gmail app</strong> on your Android phone.</li>\n<li>Tap on the <strong>hamburger menu</strong> at the top left corner (3 lines).</li>\n<li>When the navigation bar slides over from the left side of the screen, scroll down and tap on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li><p>If you have a unified mailbox, choose an account and <strong>tap on the Gmail address</strong>.

The music pack includes iconic songs from the band, including \"Bleed it Out,\" \"In The End,\" and \"What I've Done.\" The music pack is available on Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift, SteamVR-compatible headsets, and PSVR for $14. You can also purchase individual songs for $2 each.

As a result, it no longer works on Android as of August 1, with fans having to find replacements. Now, one <em>XDA</em> community developer has re-created the Dark Sky experience — literally.</p>\n\n<p>Dubbed Darker Sky, it's essentially the Dark Sky app itself back from the dead. It was built by reverse-engineering the Dark Sky APK and pairing with an iOS API key for the data.  Everything works but \"weather report submissions, weather notifications/alerts, and widgets.\"</p>\n\n<p>The folks over at <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/dark-sky-android-bring-back/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><em>XDA Developers</em></a> provide some additional context, noting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Darker Sky was made by a prolific developer and reverse engineer who wishes to remain anonymous since this modification was done on shaky grounds. The developer in question is well-known by us for their work on reverse engineering other popular applications, but they decided a low-profile release was more appropriate this time around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As this app is on shaky ground, it'll be a surprise if it lasts too long.  Don't expect it to be submitted to the Google Play Store because for the same reasons. You can grab the apk from <a href=\"https://t.me/darkerskyandroid\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Telegram</a> if you're interested in keeping the Dark Sky dream alive a bit longer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alternatives-dark-sky\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Dark Sky App Alternatives for Android in 2020</a></p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:15:16 +0000","feedId":210,"bgimg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/03/dark-sky-s20-blackmat.jpg","linkMd5":"a32cb7db5b5abcd55a05b8e23b7b7c11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/17/16-43-26-511_385278374c2f81c8.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"author":"Michael Allison","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/03/dark-sky-s20-blackmat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/17/16-43-26-511_385278374c2f81c8.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:43:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:43:25","title":"Foldable wallpapers are here to don your Surface Duo","link":"https://www.androidcentral.com/don-these-dual-screen-wallpapers-your-surface-duo","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p class=\"intro\">Finding wallpapers to fill both screens of the Surface Duo just got easier.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/don-these-dual-screen-wallpapers-your-surface-duo\" title=\"Don these dual-screen wallpapers on your Surface Duo\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-press-upright1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"aside news-summary\">What you need to know</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li>Wallpaper Hub has several backgrounds ready for the launch of the Surface Duo.</li>\n<li>The designs fill both screens of the device and are built to be folded on the Surface Duo's hinge.</li>\n<li>The Surface Duo is available for preorder now.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Microsoft's <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Surface Duo</a> is less than one month from shipping and you can grab some beautiful wallpapers to use on the dual screens of the device.

It's a third-person platformer that sees players take on the role of either Ratchet — a Lombax who knows how to fight and repair — and Clank, his robotic sidekick.</p> \n   <p>It's unknown exactly how Rift Apart will follow the 2016 title, but from the looks of the trailer, rifts have begun popping up across the world, and it'll be up to Ratchet and Clank to get to the bottom of just what's causing the rifts and how to stop them.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"trailers\">Can I check out any Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart <em>trailers</em>?</h2> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ai3o0XtrnM8?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-ai3o0xtrnm8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>So far we've only received one trailer for Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, which is its reveal trailer from The Future of Gaming PS5 event. In addition to this trailer, Insomniac also showed off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiImwSE2RuQ\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">a couple minutes of gameplay footage</a>.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"story\">What's the <em>story</em> so far in Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date-gameplay-trailers-and-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart for PS5 — Release date, gameplay, trailers, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/06/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-girl.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart seems to feature the duo once again getting into trouble. In the brief trailer shown off, we're told that various dimensions have begun collapsing on one another in the form of rifts, which transport the two to different locations. At the end of the trailer, the two are split up, with Clank meeting up with a female Lombax in another dimension. Earlier this week, Insomniac Games confirmed the female Lombax would be playable, although not too much else is known about her.</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Play as Ratchet AND a mysterious new female Lombax from another dimension. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RatchetPS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">#RatchetPS5</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RiftApart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">#RiftApart</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aMDSAB77iG\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">pic.twitter.com/aMDSAB77iG</a></p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1272998779948580864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">June 16, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Gameplay in Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart will almost undoubtedly follow along with how the series normally plays. This means players can expect a ton of platforming, third-person shooting action, and rail grinding through different areas. Of course, we'll also be getting a ton of new features, as well, as Rift Apart will also feature new characters, enemies, weapons, and more.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"ps4\">Is Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart coming to <em>PS4</em>?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date-gameplay-trailers-and-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart for PS5 — Release date, gameplay, trailers, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/06/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-enforcer.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Nope. At the moment, it seems like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is being developed exclusively for the PS5. With the game looking to use the PlayStation 5's real-time ray-tracing and Insomniac Games having said that they will be taking advantage of the PS5's high-speed SSD in order to transport players seamlessly throughout the world, a PlayStation 4 version would just hold back too many of the ideas that Insomniac is trying to accomplish.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"release\">What's the <em>release date</em>?</h2> \n   <p>Like most PS5 games at The Future of Gaming showcase, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart was not announced with a release date or even a release window. We don't know when it'll be out, but we we'll likely be hearing more as we get closer to the holiday launch of the PlayStation 5.</p> \n   <!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK --> \n   <h3 class=\"category

href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/marvels-avengers-playstation-4\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Marvel's Avengers</a> has made the lofty claim of offerint to let you control numerous Marvel heroes and all their respective powers, and impresses with its <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/marvel-avengers-beta-impressions\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">sheer potential in our beta hands-on</a>. However, the roster at launch will be a little on the light side, with fan favorites like Captain American, Thor, and Iron Man all making an appearance, but many other heroes being left by the wayside.</p>\n\n<p>We already know of one hero coming in a future release, with <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/spider-man-marvels-avengers-exclusive-ps4-ps5-2021\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Spider-Man being a Playstation exclusive</a>, coming at some point in 2021. Other than that, details are scarce. However, a recent leak reported by <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-avengers-15-unannounced-characters-datamine-black-panther-dr-strange-captain-marvel-war-machine?sf126900800=1\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">IGN</a> reveals up to 15 additional heroes that are present in the game's code, and were found by some crafty dataminers.</p>\n\n<p>According to the leak, the following Marvel heroes are potential future add-ons for the Marvel's Avengers game:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ant Man</li>\n<li>The Wasp</li>\n<li>Vision</li>\n<li>Black Panther</li>\n<li>Dr. Strange</li>\n<li>Falcon</li>\n<li>Mar-Vell</li>\n<li>Mockingbird</li>\n<li>Quake</li>\n<li>Winter Soldier</li>\n<li>Scarlet Witch</li>\n<li>Captain Marvel</li>\n<li>Kate Bishop</li>\n<li>She-Hulk</li>\n<li>War Machine</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a solid list, and adds a lot of the heros some fans felt were missing from the base game, like Dr. Strange, Ant Man, and Captain Marvel. There's no word on when any of these heroes will make their appearance, or even if they'll actually show up at all. After all, this is a leak, so take everything here with a hefty pinch of salt. Hopefully all of these heroes will eventually find their way to the game, however, so everyone has a chance to play as their favorite hero.</p>\n\n<p>Marvel's Avengers will release on September 4, 2020, so set your calendars for this ambitious adventure title.

A VPN takes your Internet connection and makes it more secure, by cloaking your internet activity in anonymity and stops you from being tracked across the web for advertising, having your traffic intercepted, or running into malicious sites. They are also great if you want to access content that is blocked in your region as you can use one to appear as if you are in another country.</p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-vpn\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">VPN 101: What is it?</a></p> \n            <p>You can run a VPN on everything from your computer or phone, to devices like your smart TV, Wi-Fi router, games console, and more. They come in at all different price points, so you're likely going to want to find a great VPN deal or discount to take advantage of when signing up.</p> \n            <h2 class=\"separator\">How do you pick the best VPN provider?</h2> \n            <p>There's so much to consider when deciding which VPN provider is right for you. Of course, you want to ensure it is available on all of the devices you wish to run it on, but you should also think about things like the service's server variety (both in number and physical location) to ensure you have a reliable connection and speed, what data (if any) may be logged, strength of the encryption used, ease-of-use, and the quality of customer support. On top of all of that, price may be a huge factor in your decision-making.</p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/why-vpn-important-use\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Why is it important to use a VPN?</a></p> \n            <p>As with many things in life, you tend to get what you pay for with VPNs. That being said, most providers will have a free trial or a money-back guarantee so you can try them out without risking your money. We've gathered up the best VPN deals above with the most pertinent information to help you make an informed choice.</p> \n            <h2 class=\"separator\">How to get the Best VPN Deals</h2> \n            <p>VPN providers generally offer better discounts the longer you subscribe for, so opting for a 3-year or 2-year plan is usually going to save you the most money. The majority of services have money-back guarantees so you can try out the apps on your devices and cancel your subscription if it's doesn't work out for you. Be sure to read the terms when signing up.</p> \n            <p>A few VPN services have free plans but these are usually restricted in terms of bandwidth. However, it can serve as a useful way to dip your toe into the VPN waters with no financial commitment. That being said, there are sometimes privacy implications with totally free services. If you're not paying for their product, they have to make their money back somewhere so make sure you take an in-depth look at the privacy policy for such services so you know what you're getting yourself in for.</p> \n            <p>We keep this list updated with the latest offers from the most reputable VPN providers, so bookmark it and check back in whenever you're in the market for a new VPN service. If you're unsure of which to choose, we have also put together <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">a comprehensive guide</a> on the best VPN services in 2020. We've also got a separate roundup highlighting the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-free-vpn\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Best Free VPN Deals</a> that you might want to check out.</p> \n            <h2 class=\"separator\">Are there any free VPNs?</h2> \n            <p>The short answer here is yes. You can find some free VPN providers, but they may not be the best option for everyone. Often times you are trading off speed, reliability, data limits, and more to get a <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-free-vpn\" title=\"\" class=\"proj-anchor norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">free VPN</a>, which makes it ultimately more of a pain to actually use the service. With the costs mentioned above, you are better off spending a few bucks each month on your privacy instead of trying to make a free one work for you.</p> \n            <p>Some providers offer free trials, and some have money-back guarantees. If you aren't sure whether or not a VPN is right for you, this is a great way to test the waters.</p> \n            <h2 class=\"separator\">Can you use a VPN on your phone and PC?</h2> \n            <p>Most VPN providers allow you to have simultaneous connections, which means that you can connect up to a set amount of devices to the VPN service at the same time. Most companies offer up to five devices at once, though some are slightly lower or higher than that number. This allows you to keep it running on your phone, tablet, PC, and even streaming hardware without worrying about whether you need to disconnect another device to connect the new one or not. A neat way around this, if your provider of choice supports it, is running your VPN on your router so any device connected to your Wi-Fi network is automatically on the VPN while only using up 1 device slot!</p>\n           </hr>\n          </hr>\n         </hr>\n        </hr>\n       </hr>\n      </hr>\n     </hr>\n    </hr>\n   </hr>\n  </div>\n

Anything and everything that falls under the Disney umbrella — and make no mistake, it is a <em>huge</em> umbrella — will eventually go through the Disney+ app, on whatever platform you wish to watch it on. If that sounds impossibly big, well, you're right. But Disney has done well to pave this road with the also extremely successful ESPN+, which also is owned by Disney and runs on the same technology. (In fact, Disney bought the company that built the streaming side of ESPN+ in order to jumpstart Disney+'s development.)</p> \n   <p>The best part of Disney+ is that it is ridiculously easy to sign up for the service whether you're at your desktop computer or on the go with your phone.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">How to sign up for Disney+</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <h2 id=\"availability\">What countries is Disney Plus available in?</h2> \n   <ul class=\"col3\"> \n    <li>Australia</li> \n    <li>Austria</li> \n    <li>Canada</li> \n    <li>France</li> \n    <li>Germany</li> \n    <li>India</li> \n    <li>Ireland</li> \n    <li>Italy</li> \n    <li>Japan</li> \n    <li>Monaco</li> \n    <li>Netherlands</li> \n    <li>New Zealand </li> \n    <li>Spain</li> \n    <li>Switzerland</li> \n    <li>United Kingdom</li> \n    <li>United States</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>The above countries have Disney+ right now and the next batch of countries getting it on <strong>September 15, 2020</strong> includes Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Disney plans to launch Disney+ globally in dozens of countries <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-available-countries\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">over the next two years</a>, but like anything involving international law, it's going to take a while.

Keep an eye here for more information as it's made available.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"platforms\">What <em>devices</em> support Disney Plus?</h2> \n   <p>Disney+ is available on <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-devices-can-you-watch-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">quite a few devices</a> at launch, but it's not as universally available as Netflix — yet. Whether you're on a phone, laptop, TV or gaming console built in the last 3 years, chances are Disney+ is available right now or will be available soon.</p> \n   <h3>iPhone and Android devices</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/04/disney-plus-platform-screenshot-investor-day-1vc8-1vc8.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Disney+ is available on <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-phone\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Android phones</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-tablet\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">and tablets</a>, as well as Apple <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-iphone-and-ipad\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">iPhones and iPads</a>. The benefit of using Disney+ on a phone or tablet rather than watching on a smart TV is that on these devices you <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-allow-you-watch-movies-offline\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">can download videos</a> for offline playback, which is something you can do on up to 10 devices per Disney+ account, meaning everyone on the plan can keep a few videos downloaded in case of emergencies like being trapped on a Wi-Fi-less flight.</p> \n   <h3>Desktop and laptop computers</h3> \n   <p>Like all modern streaming services, Disney+ allows you to stream directly from <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU74016YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=glAx8Ozz\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">DisneyPlus.com</a> on <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-desktop\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Windows, MacOS, and Chrome OS computers</a> (sorry, Linux). You can't download videos for offline playback when streaming through the browser, but you do have some handy keyboard controls.</p> \n   <p>If you're on a Chromebook, just keep in mind you'll probably have it <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-chromebook\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">error out the first time you try to watch</a> but after a quick refresh it should work just fine. Chromebooks are also the only laptops that can download videos for offline playback because Chromebooks also use they can use the Android app via Google Play.</p> \n   <p>It's rather unfortunate that Disney didn't release a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, especially since in order to release an Xbox One app, they've already done most of the work needed to make one. Since 4K streaming isn't currently supported when streaming through the website, a UWP would be a great way to allow Windows 10 media PCs to stream Disney+ in UHD.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/disney-needs-release-its-app-windows10\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Why Disney needs to release its Disney+ Xbox app for Windows 10 PCs</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <h3>Xbox, PlayStation &amp; Streaming Hardware</h3> \n   <p>Most people want to stream on a bigger screen so that they can enjoy Disney+ with their friends and family, and that means that supporting the gaming and entertainment consoles that we use now more than ever. Support for <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-android-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Android TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-roku\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Roku devices</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-chromecast\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Google Chromecast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-apple-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-amazon-fire-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Fire TV devices</a> has been here since launch day.</p> \n   <p>On the gaming console side, both the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-playstation\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">PlayStation 4 series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-xbox\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Xbox One series</a> are supported right now, and the upcoming PS5 and Xbox Series X are expected to be supported when they launch at the end of the year. I honestly believe that gaming consoles are the best for watching Disney+ because you can use your <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/one-feature-every-streaming-service-needs-steal-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">controller triggers</a> to fast forward and rewind more easily than using the on-screen controls.</p> \n   <p>On the mobile console side of the equation, no mobile consoles are currently supported, although Disney has hinted at bringing Disney+ to <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-plus-nintendo-switch\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Nintendo Switch</a> in the future. We have no concrete timeline on when it could launch on Switch, though.</p> \n   <h3>Smart TVs</h3> \n   <p>Smart TVs is one area where Disney+ has somewhat limited support at the moment. Only a handful of Smart TVs have Disney+ apps at the moment:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-plus-work-lg-tvs\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">LG TVs running Web OS 3.0 produced in or after 2016</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-plus-work-samsung-tvs\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Samsung TVs running Tizen OS produced in or after 2016</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-plus-work-sony-tvs\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Sony TVs running Android TV</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>Beyond these brands, there's support for TVs that run <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-android-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Android TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-amazon-fire-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Amazon Fire TV</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/can-you-watch-disney-roku\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Roku TV</a> through their respective app stores. This is great news because you can't stream Disney+ through browsers on Smart TVs. <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-plus-work-vizio-tvs\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Vizio TVs</a> don't have a built-in app for Disney+, but can use Chromecast built-in and Apple AirPlay.</p> \n   <h3>Which devices support Disney+ in 4K?</h3> \n   <p>There's more UHD content on Disney+ right now than I thought there'd be, but unfortunately playing it will require a 4K Smart TV that supports UHD playback — or an 4K supported entertainment console connected to a 4K TV that supports HDCP 2.2 — so even if you have a 4K screen hooked up to your gaming PC, you won't be streaming 4K that way. There are <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/which-devices-does-disney-plus-support-4k\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">plenty of 4K devices supported</a>, such as the NVIDIA Shield TV 2019, as well as a whole host of <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-4k-tvs-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">excellent 4K TVs</a> at every price point from $300 to $3000.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"catalog\">What shows and movies are on Disney Plus?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/disney-plus-marvel-section-briefcase.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Disney has prided itself on its Vault of extensive content for decades. While the Disney Vault strategy was starting to decay in the digital age, Disney+ will reap most of its rewards by hosting most of the Disney Vault as well as an impressive array of content from Marvel, Lucasfilm, Fox, and National Geographic. Right now, Disney+ has about 500 films and over 7,500 TV episodes, including most of films in the Marvel Infinity Saga and Star Wars Skywalker Saga.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-disney-plus-have\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Every movie available on Disney+ in the US</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-tv-shows-does-disney-plus-have\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Every TV series available on Disney+ in the US</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>There's tons to watch, but unfortunately Disney didn't see fit to put all of its films in ordered playlists for easy marathoning. This would be especially handy for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but since Disney doesn't have a handy playlist, we went ahead and made one so you can focus on prepping snacks for your Marvel movie marathon!</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-marvel-mcu-marathon\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Watch the MCU in chronological order with our trusty list!</a></li> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-watch-all-star-wars-movies-right-order\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Watch the Star Wars movies in the best order</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>Speaking of tons to watch, I waited a long time to get all of my favorite shows and movies in one easy-to-use place, and as such that meant that I had a long list of things I needed to watch, rewatch, and rewatch again because it's been so long since I've seen them.

It's the largest, for sure. But it's also just one part of the puzzle.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-disney-plus-bundle-ad-free-hulu\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Want to keep your ad-free Hulu with the Disney+ bundle?

It runs on the same underlying platform as Disney+, so you'll be pretty familiar with how things work.</p> \n   <p>And as for the content, well. If you thought there was a lot of sports of TV, wait until you get a look at ESPN+. Yes, it's got live sports. All kinds of live sports. It's got <a href=\"https://www.cordcutters.com/espn-plus-college-football\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">college football games that you can't find on TV</a>. It's got a <a href=\"https://www.cordcutters.com/how-watch-ncaa-college-basketball-games-online-espn\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><em>huge</em> amount of college basketball</a>. It's got a <a href=\"https://www.cordcutters.com/espn-plus-nhl\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">smattering of NHL</a>. It's got boxing and UFC — in fact, you <em>have</em> to have ESPN+ if you want to watch <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.web.plus.espn.com%2Fc%2F159229%2F566982%2F9070&amp;token=ClcM-BKR\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">pay-per-view UFC events</a> — and rugby and cricket and ... you name it.</p> \n   <p>And then there's the matter of original content. Think Peyton Manning was resting in his retirement? Not quite. <em>Peyton's Places</em> is keeping him plenty busy. Plus football coach <em>Les Miles</em> has a show, you can find the irreplaceable duo of Boomer and TJ — and so much more, right there on ESPN+.</p> \n   <p>And, yes, you can <a href=\"https://www.cordcutters.com/how-watch-espn-your-tv\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">watch ESPN+ on your TV</a>, too.</p> \n   <h3 class=\"category reco-block\">More sports!</h3> \n   <h4 class=\"product\">ESPN+</h4> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/espn-plus-logo-newer.png\" /></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.web.plus.espn.com%2Fc%2F221109%2F555830%2F9070%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU74016YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fplus.espn.com%252F&amp;token=O_xqgzET\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$5/month at ESPN+</a></p> \n   <p class=\"subtitle\">Watch it all</p> \n   <p class=\"end\">ESPN+ is the perfect companion to Disney+ if you're a sports fan. There simply is no limit to the off-TV games you'll be able to watch, plus tons of original content.</p> \n   <h3>And don't forget Hulu</h3> \n   <p>The third arm of the trifecta is Hulu, which also is controlled by Disney. It's where you'll find all the on-demand content you've come to know from that service, as well as original shows like <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>. Hulu is where much content originally planned for Disney+ is ending up as Disney tries to keep Disney+ to more family-friendly fare, so the bundle will de the only way to ensure that you can see <strong>all</strong> of the content that's coming down the pipeline.</p> \n   <p>And perhaps more important for Disney's purposes is Hulu with Live TV which, as the name implies, gets you <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.flexlinkspro.com%2Fa.ashx%3Ffoid%3D1146973.142192125%26foc%3D2%26fot%3D9999%26fos%3D1&amp;token=bqA8H8g5\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">live (and local) television</a> alongside all that other content.

Still to come is how much extra Live TV might cost under that plan.</p> \n   <h3>How does the Disney Plus library compare outside the US?</h3> \n   <p>There are differences in available content between countries — for instance, French law forbids theatrically released films from being put on a streaming service in that country for three years, so don't expect to see <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> on Disney+ in France until 2021 unless Disney manages some true shenanigans or gets that law changed somehow.</p> \n   <p>So far, however, the differences between the available content in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands has been small, mainly that a few more of the recent Marvel and Disney films are currently unavailable.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/what-disney-plus-content-missing-canada\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">What Disney+ content is missing in Canada?</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <h3>How long will it take for new movies to be added to Disney Plus?</h3> \n   <p>The newest films in Disney's repertoire aren't available on Disney+ right now, but for most of them we won't be waiting too long. Movies will launch on Disney+ after the full theatrical and home video release, which will vary between individual films but should be 5-8 months after the theatrical release.</p> \n   <p>It's worth noting this general timeline has shifted a bit in 2020, as Onward, Frozen II and Hamilton all came to Disney+ significantly earlier than expected.</p> \n   <ul class=\"cta\"> \n    <li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-long-will-it-take-movies-arrive-disney-plus-after-blu-ray-release\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">How long you'll have to wait for new movies to reach Disney+</a></li> \n   </ul> \n   <h2 id=\"premier\">What is Disney+ Premier Access?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/08/mulan-premier-access-china-pavilion.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>As the pandemic continues to keep theaters closed and push back big blockbuster releases, Disney has decided to do something new on Disney+ with the live-action remake: releasing it through Premier Access of Disney+. While the movie is still slated to release in theaters where Disney+ isn't available yet, in Disney+ markets, Disney will allow subscribers to unlock the movie early through Premier Access.</p> \n   <p>Premier Access is an upcharge feature inside Disney+: you buy the movie for $30 and unlock it for however long you continue to subscribe to Disney+. You can download the movie for offline playback on Android, iOS, and Chromebooks (through the Android app) and you can watch the movie as many times as you want, a significant change from other \"home premiere\" movies, which have been 48-hour rentals through one of the major digital retailers.</p> \n   <p>Films offered through Premier Access will eventually be available to all Disney+ subscribers, so if you don't want to pony up to watch it early, you'll probably be waiting 3-6 months to watch it through the main Disney+ catalog.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"features\">Parental controls, profiles, and account limits</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/disney-plus-princess-collection-pixel-4.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Since Disney+ allows up to <strong>7 user profiles</strong> on a single account — and up to <strong>four users streams</strong> at a time — it's only natural that Disney+ accounts are meant to be shared amongst family. However, when the kids are misbehaving or when a friend isn't chipping in the way they promised they would when you let them have your login, it's time to <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-disney-plus-password\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">change the password</a> and lock them out!</p> \n   <p>It's very easy to get sucked in while watching your favorite shows on Disney+ — I put on an episode of Kim Possible to watch during lunch and then POW, it's dinnertime! — but if you want to give yourself a leg up against being sucked in by the siren song of the binge watch, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-disable-autoplay-and-background-video-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">turn off Autoplay</a>. Having to hit play every 20 or 40 minutes can help you break the cycle and get back to work, and since Autoplay is profile-based, you can turn it off for your kids account while leaving it on for yours.</p> \n   <p>As a streaming service that is geared so much towards towards families and kids, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-disney-plus-have-parental-settings\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">parental controls on Disney+</a> are pretty simplistic at the moment: you can <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-childs-profile-disney-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">set up a child's profile</a> and set it to only allow content with a certain rating. Rather than giving age-based restrictions, Disney's content filter works based on the MPAA and US television content ratings systems, meaning that you'll have to decide if you want your child to see only G/TV-G content or allow in TV-Y7 and TV-Y7/FV.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"tipstricks\">How to get the most out of Disney Plus: Tips, tricks &amp; more</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\" title=\"Disney Plus: How to sign up, exclusive 2020 content guide, movies &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/disney-plus-app-settings-contrast.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Like any new, popular online service, Disney+ is not all smooth sailing, as magical as it may seem at first glance.

If you switch to the bundle, you lose whatever time was left on your gift subscription and immediately switch to monthly billing.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>This means that you can't give someone currently loving their subscription a free year to redeem on their account right now, but we hope Disney expands it to function as normal account credits in the future the way that you can give gift cards for Netflix and Spotify.

class=\"norewrite\">Surface Duo</a> is already set to be a pretty unique addition to the Android world, but it looks like developers will get a chance to make it even moreso. Microsoft recently confirmed to <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-surface-duo-3-years-os-security-updates-unlockable-bootloader/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">XDA Developers</a> that Surface Duo will ship with an unlockable bootloader. That opens the door to a modding scene that could spawn some pretty interesting customizations.</p>\n\n<p>An unlockable bootloader means that it's easier for developers to unlock and root a device, allowing them to make customizations to the core software experience. It also allows for whole custom ROMs to be flashed to the device, though that will require a ton of work on the developer side.</p>\n\n<p>Already, XDA has highlighted one area that's ripe for modding — turning the earpiece into another speaker for stereo sound. Given its dual-screen setup, the community could come up with some pretty unique mods and custom ROMs for the Surface Duo.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the possibility that we could see some even more exotic modifications. Should one want to put forth the effort, it may be possible to put something like <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Windows 10X</a> on Surface Duo, making it like a miniature <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-neo\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Surface Neo</a>. It would take a lot of work, and it's not clear if this is even possible, but I wouldn't rule it out.</p>\n\n<p>Surface Duo is set for a September 10 release.

It can also be used for (legal) P2P sharing and streaming for times when you're out of the country and still want to watch your favorite TV show.</p>\n\n<p>The company has confirmed in a blog post that its low price is coming to an end in the near future, though:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"For the longest time, tech experts have been praising Surfshark for a packed set of features which users get for a fraction of other VPNs' price. However, as a premium VPN that has grown tremendously over the last two years, Surfshark will increase the cost to match the quality of the product.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The price rise doesn't have to be bad news, though. Surfshark has stated that the low price on offer in today's deal will remain rest of the subscription, even after the price rise. That means if you take advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fget.surfshark.net%2Faff_c%3Foffer_id%3D61%26aff_id%3D1691%26aff_sub%3DUUacUdUnU92654YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com&amp;token=yAPOzI-D\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$2 per month deal</a> now, you'll continue paying at that rate for as long as your subscription is active.</p>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/surfshark-vpn-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">reviewed Surfshark</a> and complimented its superb affordability, great speeds, Netflix unblocking capabilities, and more.</p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:58:34 +0000","feedId":210,"bgimg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/05/surfshark-app-hero.jpg","linkMd5":"a29db91965360e148e8b6d0cdbc75aa2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/17/16-43-29-662_1b5390ac47a62b28.webp","metaImg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/05/surfshark-app-hero.jpg","author":"Adam Oram"},{"createdTime":"2020-08-18 00:43:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-18 00:43:25","title":"Google slams Australia’s proposed media law with an open letter to users","link":"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-slams-australias-proposed-media-law-with-open-letter-users","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p class=\"intro\">Google says the regulation will 'force' it to give an unfair advantage to large news media companies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-slams-australias-proposed-media-law-with-open-letter-users\" title=\"Google slams Australia's proposed media law with an open letter to users\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/10/google-logo-black-white.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"aside news-summary\">What you need to know</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li>Google Australia has published an open letter on its homepage, telling users that the proposed News Media Bargaining Code could 'hurt' their search experience.</li>\n<li>The proposed law will require tech giants such as Google and Facebook to pay media outlets for news and inform them in advance of any major algorithm changes that could affect their rankings. </li>\n<li>Google says the law will encourage large media companies to make \"enormous and unreasonable\" demands that could potentially put its free services at risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Google Australia today published an <a href=\"https://about.google/intl/ALL_au/google-in-australia/an-open-letter/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">open letter</a> about the proposed News Media Bargaining Code on its homepage, telling users that the law could \"force\" it to provide them with a \"dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube.\"</p>\n\n<p>The open letter claims the proposed law will require Google to provide an unfair advantage to news media businesses over everyone else. Large news media businesses will be able to use the information from Google to improve their search rankings over competitors, even if someone else provides a better result. Google says search data of its Australian users may also be at risk, as the law will force the search giant to tell news media businesses \"how they can gain access\" to its users' data.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful to you. We could no longer guarantee that under this law. The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses - news media businesses - over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. News media businesses alone would be given information that would help them artificially inflate their ranking over everyone else, even when someone else provides a better result. We've always treated all website owners fairly when it comes to information we share about ranking. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google Search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Responding to Google's open letter, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) released a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/response-to-google-open-letter\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">statement</a> saying the letter contains misinformation about the draft News Media Bargaining Code.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so.</p>\n  \n  <p>Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so.</p>\n  \n  <p>The draft code will allow Australian news businesses to negotiate for fair payment for their journalists' work that is included on Google services.</p>\n  \n  <p>This will address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As part of its news licensing program, which was <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/licensing-program-support-news-industry-/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">announced</a> in June, Google had planned to team up with news publishers in Germany, Australia, and Brazil and pay them for their content.

With content from Disney, Pixar, Fox, National Geographic, and Lucasfilm, Disney+ has been getting a lot of praise. Reviews <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">have been positive</a> and there are a lot of reasons to sign up for the service. Especially with a Verizon unlimited plan.</p> \n   <p>You can watch on more than your phone as well. With support for most major platforms, you can watch Disney+ on your TV, computer, tablet, and current generation game consoles. Quality is up to 4K with HDR with a compatible device. Video quality looks great on a smartphone display, especially OLED displays.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"wireless\">Which wireless plans include Disney Plus?</h2> \n   <p>For the original Disney+ on Us, all current and new Verizon Unlimited plans were eligible for a free year of Disney+. Now with Verizon and Disney's new agreement, the plans that get Disney + or the Disney Bundle are limited to the Play More Unlimited and Get More Unlimited plans, though the Start Unlimited and Do More Unlimited plans are eligible for six months of Disney+ for free.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/08/verizon-disney-plans-breakdown.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>If you have an eligible account, all you need to do is <a href=\"https://login.verizonwireless.com/vzauth/UI/Login?realm=vzw&amp;goto=https%3A%2F%2Fmyvpostpay.verizonwireless.com%3A443%2Fmyv%2Fproductsapps%2F\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">add your Disney+ account to your Verizon account</a> in order to get that Disney movie magic back in your life.

If you don't need hotspot capabilities, cloud storage, or free music streaming with Apple Music, this plan can be a good fit. Keep in mind that video only streams at 480p on this plan. This is a pretty barebones unlimited plan and doesn't come with any premium data, and it only comes with a 6-month trial of Disney+.</p> \n   <p>Premium data is what Verizon calls data that isn't deprioritized. This means that your data speeds will remain high even when a tower is crowded. Deprioritized data will have to wait in line a bit longer for its connection if the tower is at or above capacity. For most people, this won't be a huge issue and often will be unnoticeable, but for someone living in a dense area with congested networks, stepping up to the next plan can help your connection's consistency.</p> \n   <table class=\"spec-table\"> \n    <thead> \n     <tr> \n      <th></th> \n      <th>Start</th> \n      <th>Play More</th> \n      <th>Do More</th> \n      <th>Get More</th> \n     </tr> \n    </thead> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Price per month</td> \n      <td>$35</td> \n      <td>$45</td> \n      <td>$45</td> \n      <td>$55</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>5G included</td> \n      <td>No</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>LTE Premium data</td> \n      <td>N/A</td> \n      <td>25GB</td> \n      <td>50GB</td> \n      <td>75GB</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>LTE Video quality</td> \n      <td>480p</td> \n      <td>720p</td> \n      <td>480p</td> \n      <td>720p</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>LTE Hotspot</td> \n      <td>N/A</td> \n      <td>15GB</td> \n      <td>15GB</td> \n      <td>30GB</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Disney+ included</td> \n      <td>6 months</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n      <td>6 months</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>ESPN+ included</td> \n      <td>No</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n      <td>No</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Hulu included</td> \n      <td>No</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n      <td>No</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Apple Music included</td> \n      <td>6 months</td> \n      <td>6 months</td> \n      <td>6 months</td> \n      <td>Yes</td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <blockquote class=\"pull\"> \n    <p>If you want to have Disney+ included beyond six months, your two choices are the $45/month Play More Unlimited or the $55/month Get More Unlimited.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Like the base plan, Do More Unlimited only streams video at 480p but comes with a massive 50GB of premium data, you're free to stream much longer before you'll get slowed down. You get 15GB of LTE hotspot data so you can watch on some of your other devices if you're on the road. This plan only comes with a 6-month trial of Disney+.</p> \n   <p>If you want the highest quality video on the go, you'll need to grab the Play More Unlimited or Get More Unlimited plan. Both plans come with 720p video streaming and have Apple Music included. Play More Unlimited has 25GB of premium data with 15GB of LTE hotspot data. Get More Unlimited knocks it up another notch with 75GB of premium data and a 30GB LTE hotspot.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"datausage\">How much data does Disney Plus use?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/disney-plus-screenshot-download-quality.jpg?itok=PlU3V0xz\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/disney-plus-screenshot-streaming-quality.jpg?itok=UR4UY5t8\" /></a></p> \n   <h3>Downloads</h3> \n   <p>The most consistent way to know how much data Disney+ will use in the app is to use the download feature. This saves the video file to your phone's storage so you can play it back without using your data connection. This can be a great way to save data by taking advantage of Wi-Fi and can be a lifesaver on long flights. It's also a good option for someone without premium data that wants a consistent video experience.</p> \n   <p>Downloads come in three flavors: standard, medium, and high. High actually uses significantly more data than standard or even medium. A 39 minute episode of The Mandalorian came in at 270Mb, 424MB, and 1.5GB across the three quality settings. Something shorter like the three minute Pixar short Forky Asks a Question: What is Money, comes in at 20MB, 31MB, 112MB. Both videos come in around 7MB, 10MB, and 38MB per minute of video.</p> \n   <div class=\"media-gallery-wrap\">\n    <div class=\"media-gallery\"> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download-low-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=yGJ2EY1j\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download-low-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=yGJ2EY1j\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download-medium-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=lBPbTPj0\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download-medium-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=lBPbTPj0\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download-high-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=9sESZC47\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download-high-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=9sESZC47\" /></a>\n    </div> \n    <!--/media-gallery-->\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"media-gallery-wrap\">\n    <div class=\"media-gallery\"> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-low-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=yhjiO2O2\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-low-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=yhjiO2O2\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-medium-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=QPkIChlV\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-medium-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=QPkIChlV\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-high-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=LmvZzGeO\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a>\n     <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article_images/2019/11/download2-high-disney-plus-android.jpg?itok=LmvZzGeO\" /></a>\n    </div> \n    <!--/media-gallery-->\n   </div> \n   <h3>Streaming</h3> \n   <p>Streaming video is always going to be less predictable and consistent that downloading. Streaming over cellular data comes in with the settings automatic and save data. On a strong LTE connection around 50Mbps down and set to automatic, I used about as much data as I would have downloading the video on high. Set to save data, I used closer to the medium setting. Both of these settings will drop the quality to avoid pauses if your connection quality is lower than it needs to be for the higher qualities.</p> \n   <p>For now, it's safe to assume you'll be operating around medium to high settings on streaming. To be honest, I couldn't see much of a difference on the smaller OLED screen on my phone.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"home\">Fios and 5G Home internet plans</h2> \n   <p>New customers on Verizon's home internet plans also got one year of Disney+ for free. Unlike the wireless plans, this only applied to new customers. There is no mention of a continued Disney+ bundle for FiOS at this time, but these plans may be expanded in the future.</p> \n   <table class=\"spec-table\"> \n    <thead> \n     <tr> \n      <th></th> \n      <th>Better Browsing</th> \n      <th>Better Streaming</th> \n      <th>Better Everything</th> \n      <th>5G Home</th> \n     </tr> \n    </thead> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Delivery</td> \n      <td>Fiber optic</td> \n      <td>Fiber optic</td> \n      <td>Fiber optic</td> \n      <td>5G UltraWideband</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Speed</td> \n      <td>100Mbps</td> \n      <td>300Mbps</td> \n      <td>940Mbps (880Mbps up)</td> \n      <td>N/A</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Price</td> \n      <td>$39.99</td> \n      <td>$59.99</td> \n      <td>$79.99</td> \n      <td>$70</td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU82324YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fhome%2Ffios-fastest-internet%2F&amp;token=ZmllIDlm\" title=\"\" class=\"cta large norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Check Fios availability</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU82324YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2F5g%2Fhome%2F&amp;token=yLkjz7Qx\" title=\"\" class=\"cta large norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Check 5G Home Internet availability</a></p> \n   <h2 id=\"details\">What's the fine print?</h2> \n   <p>There are a few things to remember with this promotion but it's straight forward.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/free-disney-plus-verizon-what-you-need-know\" title=\"Free Disney Plus on Verizon: All the Details and How-to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_blb/public/field/image/2019/11/disney-plus-hero-surface-prox-71sf.jpg?itok=Kmy1ImxU\" /></a></p> \n   <h3>How much does it cost?</h3> \n   <p>Disney+ costs $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year in the United States normally. After your free one year of Disney+ on Us, if you're not on the Play More Unlimited or Get More Unlimited plans, your Disney+ plan will automatically renew at the monthly price on your Verizon bill.</p> \n   <h3>What if I already bought a year?</h3> \n   <p>If you already bought a year of Disney+, don't worry. Your one-year subscription will pause until the Verizon promotion is over. You won't lose the service you paid for.</p> \n   <h3>How many devices can stream at once?</h3> \n   <p>Disney+ can be used on 10 unique devices but only four can stream at once.

This is going to be Walmart's answer to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU91420YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Amazon Prime</a>, a service with so many perks there has been little to compete against it for so long. Walmart does still have a few advantages over Amazon, though, and plans to push those leads through this new program. In particular, Walmart+ is going match Prime with free two-day shipping and add same-day grocery delivery on top of that. There will be a lot of other perks as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-plus\" title=\"Walmart Plus: Launch date, pricing information &amp; more\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2017/11/walmart-store-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-launching-amazon-prime-competitor-later-month\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Rumors had Walmart+ originally launching in the spring</a>, but the spread of COVID-19 led to a delay. Of course, everyone staying at home and shopping at home led to a spike in Walmart's sales, so it makes sense the company would want to capitalize off that momentum. Plus, Amazon has struggled to meet demand in a similar shopping spike thanks to the pandemic, so Walmart could definitely slip in and gain some ground there.</p>\n\n<p>As Walmart plans to roll out this exciting new service, we're going to be on top of all the newest information. We've got it all right here, and we'll continue to update this page as we find out more.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Walmart+?</h2>\n\n<p>Simply put, Walmart+ is Walmart's new upcoming membership. You pay an annual fee, you get perks. If you do most of your shopping at Walmart, or you used to and would like to go back to doing so, then Walmart+ is going to be of interest to you. Similar to Amazon Prime or a Costco membership, Walmart+ is going to give you some amazing perks just for using Walmart the way you always do.</p>\n\n<p>While it will cost you something, the benefits you get will pay for themselves. For example, if you order online at Walmart you know there is a shipping fee unless you order at least $35 worth of stuff. Amazon has a similar fee but Amazon Prime members don't have to worry about it. If you can get around that shipping cost, you're saving that money every time you order from Walmart. (It is unclear still if that threshold will go away for Walmart+ members, but it would make sense.)</p>\n\n<h2>When does Walmart+ launch?</h2>\n\n<p>As of right now, August 17, there is no clear indication of when the service is going to launch. There is a <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU91420YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fplus&amp;token=ppNFsgSx\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">website for it</a>, but all that says is \"Coming Soon.\" The rumor was that it was supposed to launch sometime in July after being delayed from its original launch in March or April. Unfortunately July passed with no clear indication of that happening. And now it looks like more of the same for August. Keep an eye out on this page and at Walmart for more information.</p>\n\n<h2>How much will Walmart+ cost?</h2>\n\n<p>That's the big question right? Similar to Amazon Prime, Walmart+ will be a subscription service requiring an annual payment. It looks like it will cost $98 a year, but it will also come with a lot of perks to justify that price. At this time it is still unknown whether Walmart will allow customers to pay for the service on a monthly basis, or if you will need to prepay for the whole year in order to sign up.</p>\n\n<h2>How does Walmart+ pricing compare to Amazon Prime?</h2>\n\n<p>Amazon Prime is currently $119, which means that Walmart+ comes in at $21 less. Prime does have a lot of ways to lower that price, though. Students can get many Prime benefits for half the cost. People on government assistance can get a discount. And you can always pay for it monthly instead of yearly if you don't need it the entire time. It's still unclear how many benefits like that will be offered by Walmart+ (if any).</p>\n\n<h2>What are the perks of Walmart+?</h2>\n\n<p>The three biggest perks include free two-day shipping when you order from Walmart, unlimited same-day grocery delivery from Walmart Supercenters, and a discount on fuel when using Walmart gas stations. Other perks will include early access to deals, reserved delivery slots, and access to Walmart Express, a new two-hour delivery offering similar to Amazon's Prime Now. It looks like Walmart might also bring back for Walmart+ members its Scan &amp; Go service that was discontinued a couple years back. This service allows you to check out in a Walmart store without waiting in line.</p>\n\n<p>Other potential perks that are probably still a ways off from actually happening include a Walmart+ credit card and a Walmart+ entertainment service. The latter would be a rival to Amazon Prime, the streaming service offered to Prime members, but Walmart is a long ways from bringing that to life. In the meantime, keep an eye on Camp by Walmart, which is a free service to any Walmart customer with the Walmart app. It is Walmart's first foray into digital entertainment and probably the precursor of bigger things to come.</p>\n\n<h2>What else should I know?</h2>\n\n<p>Walmart wants this to be a success. Amazon Prime has been around for 15 years at this point, and Amazon's online shopping has managed to surpass and dwarf Walmart in that time, despite Walmart being the next largest retailer in the U.S. It's a safe bet that they will continue to add more and more benefits over time to match whatever Amazon is doing.</p>\n\n<p>It also might not be perfect right out of the gate. It's not like people haven't tried to compete with Amazon Prime before. It's just very difficult. Espect a few hiccups along the way, but remember that Walmart has an amazing network of brick and mortar stores that can support this new endeavor in a way Amazon cannot.</p>\n\n<h2>Let Thrifter help you</h2>\n\n<p>Remember one of the key elements to this new Walmart+ benefit will be early access to deals, and with the guaranteed faster shipping times you'll be able to take advantage of all the discounts Walmart has.

So you can get it from either retailer. The mouse normally sells for $80 in either place, and we have never seen it go lower than $70 before. In fact, it's barely ever gone on sale at all since it was introduced earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Basilisk V2 is one of our favorite mice and really just improved on an already successful formula from the now discontinued original Basilisk. Windows Central gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 and a Recommended badge in <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/razer-basilisk-v2-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">the review</a>. Richard Devine said, \"What you end up with is an extremely ergonomic, lightweight mouse that's even more comfortable to use than ever before. Whether you're working or gaming, the Basilisk V2 is a mouse than can do it all. All day, every day.\"</p>\n\n<p>You'll be able to find the perfect sensitivity with this mouse thanks to a sensor with 20,000 DPI that you can adjust on the fly. Use the dedicated DPI button to switch between different settings, even while you're in the middle of a game. Being able to go all the way up to 20,000 or below 1,000 means you can change it based on the game you're playing, too.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanical switches on this mouse are three times faster than traditional switches because they use a light beam actuation. Actual tiny beams of light register your button presses, giving you the fastest possible response times according to physics. More responsiveness means more control.</p>\n\n<p>You can customize the mouse's lighting. And this is Razer Chroma, which means not only do you get the full RGB color palette, but you can also combine this light sync with third parties like Philips Hue or other Razer gear for an all-around lighting experience. You can also program all eleven buttons, reconfigure them, or add advanced macros using the Razer Synapse 3 software.</p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020
