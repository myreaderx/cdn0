(credit: TriStar Pictures)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><em>Back to the Future</em> justly dominated the summer box office in 1985, but it's too bad its massive success overshadowed another nerd-friendly gem, <em>Real Genius,</em> which debuted one month later, on August 9. Now celebrating its 35th anniversary, the film remains one of the most charming, winsome depictions of super-smart science whizzes idealistically hoping to change the world for the better with their work. It also boasts a lot of reasonably accurate science—a rare occurrence at the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Genius\"><em>Real Genius</em></a> came out the same year as the similarly themed films <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Science_(film)\"><em>Weird Science</em></a>—which spawned a <a href=\"http://(That%20year%20that%20saw%20the%20release%20of%20Back%20to%20the%20Future.)\">1990s TV sitcom</a>—and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Science_Project\"><em>My Science Project</em></a>, because 1980s Hollywood tended to do things in threes. But I'd argue that <em>Real Genius</em> has better stood the test of time, despite being so quintessentially an '80s film—right down to the many montages set to electronic/synth-pop chart-toppers. The film only grossed $12.9 million domestically against its $8 million budget, compared to $23.8 million domestically for its fellow cult classic, <em>Weird Science.</em> (<em>My Science Project</em> bombed with a paltry $4.1 million.) Reviews were mostly positive, however, and over time it became a sleeper hit via VHS, and later, DVD and streaming platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 35-year-old film below.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697354#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697354&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 13:30:03 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/genius4-800x526.jpg","linkMd5":"c5118a7736df371a2da5f595404393e5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597031151384_b31550956f99bd77.webp","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/genius4-800x526.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_5/2020-08-10/1597031151384_b31550956f99bd77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn60@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597031208577_9d8b280e545b34c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=a7KXez4gcjc:2H0UUGvCMPo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_6/2020-08-10/1597031169831_18cbcdb1722023c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn88@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597031178579_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_1/2020-08-10/1597031169633_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-10 11:45:30","updatedTime":"2020-08-10 11:45:30","title":"HS that suspended teen who tweeted photo of hallway has 9 COVID-19 cases","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697730","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/north-paulding-photo-800x565.jpeg\" alt=\"A photo of high school students in a hallway between classes, with kids packed closely together and many not wearing masks.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/north-paulding-photo.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1530\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Photo from North Paulding High School, tweeted by student Hannah Watters on Tuesday, August 4.

The Korean automaker first introduced the Ioniq name in 2016 with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/the-2020-hyundai-ioniq-review-a-connected-car-service-saves-the-day/\">subcompact that comes in hybrid</a>, plug-in hybrid, and BEV flavors, but early in 2021 those cars will be joined by the Ioniq 5, a midsize BEV crossover based on a 2019 concept called 45. In 2022, Ioniq will launch the Ioniq 6, an electric sedan based on the stunning <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/who-did-the-future-electric-sedan-best-bmw-or-hyundai/\">Prophecy concept car</a> from earlier this year. Finally, in early 2024, there will be a larger SUV called the Ioniq 7. It's not the first time we've seen this strategy from the automaker, which did the same thing with the creation of Genesis as a standalone luxury brand.</p>\n<p>\"The Ioniq brand will change the paradigm of EV customer experience. With a new emphasis on connected living, we will offer electrified experiences integral to an eco-friendly lifestyle,” said Wonhong Cho, executive vice president and global chief marketing officer at Hyundai Motor Company.</p>\n<p>Ioniq's first three BEVs will be built on a new platform that Hyundai is developing, called the Electric Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP, which it says is highly flexible with regard to body style and interior design. We can probably expect these cars to be built in serious volume; Hyundai Motor Group (which also includes Kia and Genesis) is aiming to sell 1 million BEVs a year by 2025. By that same year it also plans to sell more than half a million hydrogen fuel cell EVs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697704\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697704&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JOTdubpnZi4:CyaCqkmIfk8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 23:30:54 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hyundai-Announces-IONIQ-Brand-Dedicated-to-EVs_3-980x551.jpg","linkMd5":"356f1bb8ca8e754fc29eed06fc87de03","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn48@2020_4/2020-08-10/1597031145277_d8b21c226ee4a4f7.webp","author":"Jonathan M.
