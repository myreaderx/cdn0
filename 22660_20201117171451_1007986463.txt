However, touch isnâ€™t just limited to smaller screensâ€Šâ€”â€Štablets can scale up and beyond the size of desktop monitors, as highlighted by JoshÂ Clark:</p><blockquote><em>â€œWhen any desktop machine </em>could<em> have a touch interface, we have to proceed as if they all do.â€�â€Šâ€”â€ŠJosh Clark,Â </em><a href=\"https://articles.uie.com/finger_friendly/\"><em>uie.com</em></a></blockquote><p>Therefore, even if weâ€™re designing for desktop, itâ€™s still important to consider touch interactions. Hereâ€™s a summary of the main differences between mouse and finger, adapted from JakobÂ Nielson:</p><figure><img alt=\"Table showing differences between mouse and touch gestures.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/695/1*newxJ5vViisZxBLPrSUDlQ.png\" /></figure><p>See the <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mouse-vs-fingers-input-device/\">full table here</a>. The table shows many differences, but depending on the context youâ€™re designing for, some will have more impact thanÂ others.</p><p>In my case of building a drag and drop interaction, these are the main changes I had to consider when adding touchÂ support:</p><h3>Fingers obscure theÂ view</h3><p>As seen above, a mouse cursor easily fits the touchpoint, whereas it canâ€™t be seen under a finger. Thatâ€™s because a finger has a larger surface area than a mouse pointer, and thereâ€™s also no visible mouse pointer with fingers obscuring the view of theÂ screen.</p><p>Touch targets need to be big enough for peopleâ€™s fingers. Appleâ€™s Human Inteface Guidelines suggested a minimum target size of 44 pixels by 44 pixels, and as highlighted by UX Mag the <a href=\"https://uxmag.com/articles/excerpt-from-the-new-book-the-mobile-frontier\">magic number for a touch target isÂ 10mm</a>:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/0*xZaN0N3rk2jgo5_6.jpg\" /><figcaption>The average fingertip is 8â€“10mm, UXÂ Mag</figcaption></figure><p>For this reason, itâ€™s important to consider the size of your touch target, and if it makes sense for the context of your app. You can do this by observing how people use yourÂ app.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/466/0*zJnM6MTKjruPfGul\" /><figcaption>Finger too fat for the dragÂ handle</figcaption></figure><p>After watching someone struggle to drag and drop a component using the drag handle, I tried changing the touchable surface to the entire component. It worked, but also brings more questions:</p><ul><li>How do you disable/enable the touchÂ surface?</li><li>Should the touch surface be the entireÂ element?</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/0*i4arDQTyJqRuW7oh\" /><figcaption>Make the entire surface the draggable touchÂ target</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s also important to give some form of feedback that can indicate a draggable item is selected. Above, the draggable target has been rotated slightly when active, but for smaller elements like buttons, the size can be increased underneath the finger. Sort of like this (but yeah, lessÂ fancy):</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/396/0*S2HMlYdCQ-fQUu4u\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/11386939-Play-with-Magic-Motion\">Play with Magic Motion by EdoardoÂ Mercati</a></figcaption></figure><p>This would not only simulate elevation, but improves usability as the element remains visible around the edge of yourÂ finger.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fE9cGOFQlH_WCqGWIiqf-w.png\" /></figure><h3>Touch vsÂ Click</h3><p>Apart from surface area, it might seem that there isnâ€™t much difference between finger touch events and mouse click events, especially for â€˜one-fingerâ€™ gestures. For instance, a mouse click is comparable to the finger-down, finger-up interaction with a single fingertip:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/365/0*urj9kSIkZd3Uxc0b.png\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html\">One-finger gesture emulating aÂ mouse</a></figcaption></figure><p>However, differences arise with more complex interactions, such as moving items around a page, or performing a drag and drop. This is because multiple interactions can be triggered at the same time when using a touch interface, that wouldnâ€™t normally happen with a mouse. Consider the difference between dragging and scrolling when using aÂ finger:</p><h3>Drag vs.Â Scroll</h3><p>Letâ€™s first consider a scroll event. A key distinction when navigating a page using touch input is that thereâ€™s no scroll wheel, so the finger does all theÂ work:</p><ul><li>Finger down: First, the user has to touch the screen toÂ scroll.</li><li>Finger move: Finger movement is then used to move theÂ page.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/147/0*qGZCOe4QSoMXZhZh.jpg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html\">The panningÂ gesture</a></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, you might think that the same interaction (finger down, finger move) is used to perform a drag and drop. And youâ€™d be rightâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut the subtle difference of having no scroll wheel can become a large obstacle for drag and drop interactions. For instance, upon first contact with the screen, how do you know whether the user intends to scroll the page, or select and pick up a draggable element?</p><p>Both interactions look almost identical:</p><ul><li>ðŸ‘‰ Drag and Drop: Finger down to select element &#62; finger move to drag the element &#62; finger stop and finger up to drop theÂ element</li><li>ðŸ“œ Scroll: Finger down &#62; Finger move to scroll &#62; Finger stop to stop scrolling</li></ul><p>This means both â€˜dragâ€™ and â€˜scrollâ€™ events can occur at the same time, which makes a successful drag and drop impossible. Since the page is always scrolling, the position of the draggable item is prevented from changing on the verticalÂ axis.</p><p>Therefore, we need a way to distinguish between a scroll and a drag. The solution that worked for me is <em>detecting touch</em> <em>andÂ hold</em>:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fE9cGOFQlH_WCqGWIiqf-w.png\" /></figure><h3>Touch + HoldÂ !=Â Scroll</h3><p>A <em>touch and hold</em> <em>gesture</em> can be pictured like this flow diagram from the Safari Web ContentÂ Guide:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/201/0*NDMPiRzOfYXULME3.jpg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html\">The touch and holdÂ gesture</a></figcaption></figure><p>The length of time a finger is held down in one position on the screen can help detect when the intention is to select an element, as opposed to scroll theÂ page.</p><blockquote><em>Another important consideration is that you must distinguish among a tap, a swiping gesture (such as scrolling), and an intentional â€œgrabâ€� by using a timing delay of a few milliseconds, and providing clear feedback that the object has been grabbed.(</em><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/\">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/</a>)</blockquote><p>Letâ€™s see how using touch duration can prevent the page scrolling when we want to perform a drag and drop interaction:</p><h3>Using Touch Duration to Determine Actions</h3><p>When determining if a user wants to scroll or select an element, a key contrast between touch and mouse is that a mouse click immediately makes an element active, whereas a touch oftentimes incurs aÂ delay:</p><blockquote><em>When a user taps on an element in a web page on a mobile device, pages that havenâ€™t been designed for mobile interaction have a delay of at least 300 milliseconds between the touchstart event and the processing of mouse events (mousedown) (</em><a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/touchandmouse/\">https://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/touchandmouse/</a>)</blockquote><p>Therefore, type of interaction a user wants to perform can be determined fairly accurately using <em>touch duration</em>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tap</strong>: If the touch duration is less than 1 second, we can consider it the equivalent of a mouseÂ click</li><li><strong>Selection</strong>: If touch duration is longer than 1 second, and in the same place, we can guess something is beingÂ selected</li><li><strong>Scroll</strong>: If a swipe gesture is detected, we can assume the user intends to scroll an element or theÂ page.</li></ul><p>As an example, if we again consider a drag and drop event on a touch screen, itâ€™s clear that detecting touch duration becomes very useful. A finger-down event can trigger both a scroll, or activate an element at the same time, so adding timing to the equation can add anotherÂ signal.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fE9cGOFQlH_WCqGWIiqf-w.png\" /></figure><h3>Press vs. Click and the WebÂ API</h3><p>If your mind isnâ€™t already boggled enough, read on for the difference between a press, and a click. As weâ€™ve covered, a mouse click and a touch event is differentâ€Šâ€”â€Šand therefore, engineers need a way to distinguish between the 2 when building anÂ app.</p><p>Luckily, browser technology comes to the rescue. A lot of it is taken care of for us if we leverage the right Web API events. Even for non-technical folk, itâ€™s useful to be aware of these to understand different possibilities of touchÂ input:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/697/1*egWNwATWEK33n0fnJEabNg.png\" /></figure><p>In my case of building a drag and drop interface, these â€˜touch detectorsâ€™ helped solve the issue in the previous section: <em>whatâ€™s a swipe and whatâ€™s aÂ press?</em></p><p>I wonâ€™t go into it, but here is an example code to distinguish between touch and mouse events from my app, <a href=\"https://letter.so/\">Letter</a>. You can see there are attributes for <em>onMouse</em> events, and also for <em>onTouch</em>Â events:</p><pre>&#60;div className=&#34;draggable-item&#34;&#62;<br>       &#60;div<br>            onMouseDown={this.mouseDown}<br>            onMouseUp={this.mouseUp}<br>            onTouchEnd={this.touchEnd}<br>            onTouchStart={this.touchStart}<br>          &#62;<br>        {/* Drag and drop element content here */}<br>        &#60;/div&#62;<br>&#60;/div&#62;</pre><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/0*x47F0W1v3ZEbe84f.png\" /></figure><h3>Additional Device Feedback, Voice Interactions, and More InputÂ Devices</h3><p>Above weâ€™ve gone through some of the big differences between touch and mouse interaction across devices, but you can keep going further, such as by leveraging what the device hardware has toÂ offer.</p><p>For example, NNGroup highlight the use of <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3d-touch/\">haptics</a> to provide better feedback for drag and drop interactions. Many phones have haptic feedback for touch interaction, as do some trackpad inputÂ devices:</p><blockquote><em>A haptic â€œbumpâ€� can indicate that an object has been grabbed, and another one can indicate that an object has been dragged over a dropÂ zone.</em></blockquote><p>Furthermore, voice interactions are also making their way to web browsers, with the support for Speech Synthesis already available on the most popularÂ ones:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vxLRJVpJ4NoyS4t3.png\" /><figcaption>Web Speech API speech synthesis support</figcaption></figure><p>Speech Recognition for actual input is a bit further behind synthesis, but itâ€™s coming too. And all of these can be considered, even with drag and drop, as weâ€™ve previously seen:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/946/0*o5he2AsFyZOcZn7f.gif\" /><figcaption>ðŸ§  Mind controlled drag and drop UI, by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie\">CharlieÂ Gerard</a></figcaption></figure><p>So in all, as well designing and building responsively for different screen sizes, we must also be aware of the different methods of user inputs, as well as making interfaces accessible to people of different abilities.</p><h4>Lessons from building a realÂ app</h4><p>The lessons in this article are what I learned while designing and coding a real app, and sharing it with the world.
