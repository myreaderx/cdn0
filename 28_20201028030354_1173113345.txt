That basically means that our next offense will result in a temporary ban from the yard.\" title=\"\" width=\"547\" height=\"379\"/> </div> <h3> 3. </h3> <div> <img class='event-item-lol-image' src='https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9566953472/hB5E43F7F/as-tell-him-material-transport-rules-now-get-out-or-report-superiors-best-moment-satisfaction-ever' id='_r_a_9566953472' alt=\"Text - I was very angry, and I go into full blown petty revenge mode.
