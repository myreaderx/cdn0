The use of technology by people and businesses leapt forward perhaps <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-covid-19-recovery-will-be-digital-a-plan-for-the-first-90-days\">five years over a period of eight weeks</a>, and internet usage increased by 60 percent. Changes in consumer behavior are driving businesses to adapt the way they communicate with customers, while retailers around the world have seen their business models turned upside down.</p><br/><p>Because of this big shift, digital tools and skills will be a vital catalyst to accelerate an economic comeback. Earlier this summer we <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/free-tools-and-training-help-economic-recovery-europe-middle-east-and-africa/\">pledged to help 10 million people</a> and businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Africa find jobs, digitize and grow over the next 18 months. Retail, which accounts for more than 9 percent of jobs in the EU alone, will play a pivotal role in the recovery.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Today we’re kicking off \"Accelerating Retail,\" a month of activities dedicated to helping retailers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa accelerate their business recovery and growth to be ready for what comes next. We’re helping retailers of all sizes across the region be ready for the peak shopping season, and working in close partnership with local commerce and trade associations in many countries. Over the next month, we'll introduce new products, tools, free training, unique real time insights and other resources—what follows is a brief snapshot of some of this.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Consumer needs have changed, and retailers need to respond</h3><p>As the world around us has changed, consumer online shopping has leapt forward and decision-making has become more complex. Our <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/navigating-purchase-behavior-and-decision-making/\">Decoding Decisions study</a> identified a “messy middle,” the space between a consumer starting their research and making a purchase, where they navigate the explosion of choice and information available to them both online and offline. </p><br/><p>The messy middle has become even messier over the course of the pandemic—our needs changed, product and store availability became unpredictable. Shoppers have become more open to new brands and outlets, but they also need more help than ever to find the right product at the right price at the right time and place. This big shift is an opportunity for retail businesses large and small. </p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\"><section class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\"><q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">We’re here to help retailers respond effectively—so they can quickly understand and act on consumer changes while building their brand both in store and online.</q></div></div></section></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Recovery and growth through digital </h3><p>Online retail demand has grown exponentially, and businesses need a great customer experience to be competitive and build brand recognition. That’s why we’re rolling out a new version of <a href=\"https://growmystore.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en_uk?utm_source=keyword-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=keyword-blog-post-emea-retail-month-09-20\">Grow My Store</a> in multiple countries, including Germany, France, Netherlands and Turkey.

Any business can enter their website URL into the tool to receive a customized report, industry benchmarks, digital traffic trends and actionable tips to improve. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Grow my Store.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/ProjectGraffiti_GIF_GrowMyStore_2_zgjzvpl.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’re also making it easier for retailers to reach the right potential customers. We’ll be upgrading Smart Shopping campaigns to help with new customer acquisition and simplify advertiser onboarding. </p><p>Meanwhile, for the first time we’ve released insights for specific fast-rising retail categories around the world via a new <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/category-trends/us/month/en\">interactive tool</a> in Google Search—including the queries associated with them.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>What's next for online shopping</h3><p>As online spend continues to grow, retail success will depend on delivering an integrated online/offline purchase experience. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/marketing-resources/retail/five-year-retail-strategy-trends/\">New research</a> we’ve conducted in collaboration with Euromonitor found that in the next five years, most purchases will still be made in store—but retailers who bring together their digital and in-store offerings will make the biggest gains even if customers eventually choose to buy in store. Since consumers shop both online and offline, multichannel retailers and online marketplaces will drive 86 percent of the sales growth by 2024. The future of retail is not about either physical or online presence but an integrated consumer experience.</p><p>While there might be more change and uncertainty on the horizon, retail is critical to every region’s broader economic recovery. By embracing digital opportunities, retail businesses can drive resilience and growth. </p><p>Look out for our \"Accelerating Retail\" updates through September—we're here to help retailers make the most of digital opportunities and prepare for what's next.</p><p><i><sup>Disclaimer: In Europe, Smart Shopping campaigns can be used with any Comparison Shopping Service (CSS) you work with.

Or maybe your travel remains essential and you are still on the road. Whatever reason is driving you to consider staying in a hotel room, you know you want to take as many precautions as possible. With Google’s new hospitality solution, we are partnering with hotels of every size to bring <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/hospitality\">the best of Google to your hotel</a> while also helping make your stay more contactless.<br/><br/></p><h3>Use your voice to access guest amenities </h3><p>From a Nest Hub smart display set up in each hotel room, hotels can tailor the guest experience with Google to specifically address common service requests from guests through a simple voice command. So you can say things like  “Hey Google, schedule a wake up call,” or “Hey Google, ask my hotel for extra towels,” or “Hey Google, what time does the pool close?” and get answers immediately. </p><p>At some hotels, you can also start a fast check out using Google Assistant when your stay is over so you don’t have to stand in line. For hotels, this ensures fast turnover for the next guest. Google Assistant can even surface a mid-stay survey to gauge satisfaction level, and the hotel is notified if something is going poorly. Hotels can even promote current or upcoming specials by providing a summary when you ask “Hey Google, tell me about the specials.” <br/><br/></p><h3>Enjoy your personal hotel media hub</h3><p>The Nest Hub is also a great device for hands-free, in-room entertainment: Guests can access YouTube to find news, music and exercise videos, all through voice command. You can connect your phone via Bluetooth to play your own music, too. Use Google Assistant to turn the volume up or down, or skip a track, hands-free. The new experience can also be configured by the hotel to let you control and manage devices in the room, like blinds, TVs, lights and more.  <br/><br/></p><h3>Find local answers, easily</h3><p>You can ask for the weather forecast, learn about local sites and  get news updates from Google Assistant. You can even find updated hours for restaurants and shops, as well as other info related to COVID-19 (including symptoms and prevention provided by the CDC) in your area. Depending on where you're visiting, you can use Google Assistant to make restaurant reservations. </p><p>While convenience is important, we’re also dedicated to protecting privacy. You won’t need to sign into the device, and no activity will be linked to your personal account. There is no camera on the Nest Hub, and the physical mic switch can be turned off for additional privacy. No audio is ever stored, and any activities will be immediately wiped from the device when it’s reset for the next guest. </p><p>Today you can experience the best of Google at hotels including <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/scottsdale/\">Fairmont Princess</a> in Scottsdale, <a href=\"https://www.shelborne.com/\">Dr. Wilkinson’s Resort</a>in Calistoga, <a href=\"https://www.galehotel.com/\">Gale</a> and <a href=\"https://www.shelborne.com/\">Shelborne South Beach</a> in Miami, <a href=\"https://www.gansevoorthotelgroup.com/hotels/gansevoort-meatpacking-nyc\">Gansevoort Meatpacking</a> and <a href=\"https://synergy-chelsea-new-york-ny-us.booked.net/\">Synergy Chelsea</a> in New York City, <a href=\"https://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/zena\">Hotel Zena</a> and Viceroy D.C., as well as <a href=\"https://www.village-hotels.co.uk/\">Village Hotels</a> in the U.K. </p><p>Additional hotel partnerships coming soon. To learn more about Google’s new hospitality solution and how to bring it to your guests, we’d love to <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/hospitality/contact/\">hear from you</a>.

Even during a time when people may not be travelling as much, we’re seeing people still use the Saved tab as they shift the types of places they’re saving to Google Maps. <br/><br/><p>What kind of places are people saving?

Here are three tips for the new Saved tab:</p><p><b>1. Remember your most recently saved places</b><br/></p><p>When you’ve saved a place a friend or colleague recommended and a few days or weeks have passed, it can be hard to remember what the name of the place was or what list you even saved it to. Now, your recently saved places are organized at the top of the Saved tab so you can quickly find the place you’re looking for.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Recently saved places in Google Maps.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Frame_-_Recently_Saved.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Easily remember the places you recently saved in Google Maps</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><b>2. Know when you’re close to a place you’ve saved before</b><p>When you have a lot of saved places in your current area, it can be challenging to quickly figure out which is which and where to go. When location permission is enabled, you can see all your nearby saved places sorted by distance and arranged in a carousel for easy browsing to make your next decision a breeze.</p><p><br/></p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Nearby Saved places\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Frame_-_Nearby_Saved.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Discover when you’re close to a place you’ve saved</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><b>3. Remember where you’ve been </b><p>If you’ve chosen to turn on your Location History setting, you can use your Timeline to remember the places you’ve been and routes you’ve taken. You can see how far you’ve biked, walked and ran over the past few days. You can also easily find that amazing hole in the wall restaurant you visited during one of your past vacations, or that cute boutique you popped into a few weeks ago.

It’s become an indispensable tool, one we all use more than we likely would have imagined. But <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/science-why-remote-meetings-dont-feel-same/?_ga=2.19173816.1216755503.1597684288-1154557937.1574352787\">meeting fatigue</a> is probably hitting you hard in the afternoon. Using the right devices can make a big difference in making video calls more enjoyable and engaging. Here are a few new ways to use Google Meet and Duo across a series of new devices to create a better meeting experience. <br/><br/></p><h3>Take your video calls to the big screen</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With Google Meet on Cast, you can turn any room in your house into your own personal conference room, taking advantage of your TV or a Smart Display. Whether you want to step away from the notifications on your laptop or phone to be more present in a meeting or you’re on mute in a larger meeting and want to concentrate on your task at hand, casting to your TV can help you be more productive and stay focused. </p><p>Meet and Cast can also pair up to simplify distance learning. Students can view their classmates and lesson plans on the big screen while working from their laptops, and teachers can get a broader view of their students on a call. </p><p>To get started, you‘ll need to have a Google account, update to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">latest version of Chrome</a> and ensure that your Chromecast device has the latest firmware installed. Google Cast functionality is <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/10023891\">available for all Meet users</a>, and casting works on Chromecast, TVs with built-in Chromecasts and Nest displays.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Duo Cast\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/duo_atv_cropped_WBy1HFM.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The big screen isn’t just for work meetings, though: We also want to make video calling your friends and family better, too. In an effort to bring the video calling experience to more parts of your home, Google Duo is rolling out a Beta on Android TV in the coming weeks. With Google Duo, you can initiate one-on-one and group calls from your TV, and if your TV doesn't have a camera built-in, you can simply plug in a USB camera. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Meet Hub Max Cast\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/meet_hubmax_cropped_gbJyO5x.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Beyond TVs, Duo and Meet also work seamlessly with <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub_max\">Nest Hub Max</a>.

Your Snapshot will adjust based on the time of day and your interactions with Google Assistant. For example, in the morning you will see a card about your commute, weather, to-dos and top headlines. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Find helpful recommendations for dinner, activities and podcasts</h3><p>Beyond that, we’re also adding tailored recommendations based on your preferences for recipes, podcasts and even nearby restaurants that deliver. Want some dinner inspiration? Just tap to check out new recipes you may want to try. You’ll also see recipe recommendations during different times of the day. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Just say “Hey Google, show me my day” to get started</h3><p>Currently, you can view your Snapshot by activating Google Assistant and tapping on the icon in the bottom left corner. Now we’re making it even easier: Just say, “Hey Google, show me my day.” This functionality is live for those using English as their default language and will continue to roll out to additional languages in the coming months.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Snapshot_ShowMeMyDay.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Snapshot_ShowMeMyDay.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Get important notifications from your Google Assistant </h3><p>Snapshot is the best place to see everything you’ve got going on in one place, and for important tasks right around the corner, Google Assistant will send a notification to make sure you don't miss it. Google Assistant can send notifications to your phone with important information like flight and event updates, upcoming bills and due date reminders, and we’re adding even more features to help you stay on top of your day. In English-speaking markets, we’ll be adding upcoming birthdays. When you tap on the notification, you’ll be taken to the related Snapshot card to take action with suggestions like calling, texting or even singing a personalized birthday song. </p><p>This is just the beginning.

Just as someone helms a container ship, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a> makes sure everything gets where it's supposed to be.</p><p>Containers are systems that have everything needed to run a piece of software: the code, the dependencies, and on and on. Companies build their products using containers so they’re standardized, whether it runs in the cloud or in a physical data center. Kubernetes manages the workloads and services associated with containers, so software efficiently uses server space. Kubernetes, which Google donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, is now one of the most active open-source projects ever. Google remains the top contributor for the project, including leadership and committee positions. </p><p>Aug. 26 marks the five-year anniversary of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/\">Google Kubernetes Engine</a> (GKE), our managed version of open-source Kubernetes, becoming available to everyone. GKE engineers contribute beyond Google Cloud to the Kubernetes community at large. Here, three of those engineers—Michelle Au, Janet Kuo and Purvi Desai—explain why Kubernetes is so important, and how it’s used in the real world. <br/><br/></p><b>Google Kubernetes Engine turns five this year. How would you explain Kubernetes to a five-year-old?<br/><br/></b><p><b>Michelle Au:</b>Kubernetes is a tool that helps many of your favorite games and websites run without problems, even when all your friends want to play at the same time. It makes sure that there are enough computers running to support everyone using them, they are restarted if they crash and that they update without problems.</p><p><b>Janet Kuo:</b>Think of containers as plants. To grow a plant, you need to first find some pots, and then fill the pots with seeds and compost. Let’s say you have all the plants in one pot and there’s not enough compost in that pot. Then you need to move them to other pots. Kubernetes is like a gardener that helps you take care of your plants, check the compost levels of each pot, check the health of your plants, remove dead plants or transplant them when needed. Kubernetes can also grow more or less of certain kinds of plants (“I want at least two roses and at most 10 roses at all times”) based on your preferences. </p><p><b>Purvi Desai:</b>Imagine a child wants to build a huge city out of Legos. Deciding which Lego blocks needed would take significant time and hard work. Now imagine instead, the child vaguely describes the idea of the city, along with shapes and colors, to their mom. Mom buys Lego kits and builds them for the child. She also works with them every day to add more buildings, so the child can spend more time playing rather than working. Think of Kuberentes as the mom, applications that you use on your computer or tablet as the Legos and the child as the application developer.<br/><br/></p><b>And how would you describe your role in GKE to a five-year-old?</b><p></p><p><b>Michelle:</b>As a software engineer on the storage team, I write computer programs that make sure your important information is safely stored in Kubernetes.</p><p><b>Janet:</b>I’m the Kubernetes project maintainer. I review code, fix bugs and implement new features. I also build products and tools on top of Kubernetes. You can think of those products as equipment Kubernetes uses to do fancier work. </p><p><b>Purvi:</b> I’m a senior manager in GKE and Kubernetes development team. My teams build the plumbing or roadways, aka the networking, for Kubernetes. We do the heavy lifting for our customers. <br/><br/></p><b>Why is Kubernetes so important?<br/><br/></b><p><b>Janet:</b>In a world where customers need access to software—regardless of their location—Kubernetes allows applications to run at global scale. Another benefit of Kubernetes is that it runs anywhere, so you can move your applications around. Kubernetes also allows you to customize and manage any resources you want, even the ones that live outside of Kubernetes, using the Kubernetes APIs. <br/><b><br/>Michelle:</b>Kubernetes makes it easier for users to adopt good practices for running applications. It provides basic building blocks for scaling workloads, monitoring their health and updating them. This enables teams to develop, roll out and test their applications faster—making those applications more reliable and dynamically scalable. Kubernetes took off because it’s portable across any infrastructure provider and flexible to extend it with custom APIs. <br/></p><p><b>Purvi:</b> Kubenetes enables you to run cloud native applications anywhere consistently on various platforms. It’s become massively popular not only with developers of modern cloud native microservices applications but also with developers looking to move their traditional applications to a platform that isn’t dependent on the underlying infrastructure. It’s enabled developers and operators alike to run their test and production workloads in environments of their choice without needing to rewire the application. This will continue as more businesses become digital. <br/><br/></p><b>What are some real-life applications of GKE? Tell us a story of a favorite customer use case.</b><p></p><p><b>Janet:</b>One of my favorite customer use cases is Shopify. Shopify runs entirely on GKE. They chose GKE and Kubernetes because it allows Shopify to cope with huge spikes in traffic, such as Cyber Monday, Black Friday shopping events or when a celebrity shares a new product on their Shopify store. </p><p><b>Michelle:</b> I love hearing how GKE enables customers to push the limits of computing. My favorite customer story is this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTfp2woVEkA\">Kubecon keynote by CERN</a> that included a live demo on GKE processing 70TB of data in five minutes to rediscover the Higgs boson. This was impressive not only because of the scientific achievement and processing power demonstrated, but also because they highlighted the portability of Kubernetes and the reproducible environment of containers. <br/></p><p><b>Purvi:</b> My favorite use cases are when customers have successful massive-hyper growth in a matter of minutes and GKE helps them scale to those demands. We see amazing graphs during launch of new online games, Black Fridays, flash sales, during live events like the Super Bowl, when customers migrate traffic and during customers’ new product launches. It’s so satisfying to see our customers’ business growth and our platform’s role in seamlessly enabling it.<br/><br/></p><b>What has your experience been like as a woman in software development? What do you think the future will be like for women in the field?</b><p></p><p><b>Janet:</b>A few years ago, I went to a developer meetup with a woman friend of mine who had never been to one before. She was surprised that we were the only two women there, but I didn’t even notice because I was so used to being outnumbered. Luckily, our industry is becoming increasingly diverse over time. <br/></p><p><b>Michelle:</b> In college, I was part of a women’s engineering community where I established many long-lasting friendships. On the GKE team, I’ve been able to work with many great women leaders, and the leadership in general has been very supportive and accommodating to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable on the team. I know that my experience is unfortunately not the norm for a lot of women in the field. I hope that with more women role models and leaders, we can help build inclusive communities and encourage more women to take up a career in software. <br/></p><p><b>Purvi:</b> When I joined a startup straight out of college, I was the only woman in the engineering and product group. But thanks to my upbringing and deep focus on my work, I never felt out of place in the field. I did, however, feel the pinch later at a different startup job when I had my kid and I was the first mother on the team. The company didn’t have support systems like paid leave or a mother’s room. Overall, things are getting better with more women in the field. I think the future for women in software development is bright.  <br/><br/></p><b>What’s your advice for aspiring developers who want to get started?<br/><br/></b><p><b>Michelle:</b>It’s important to spend time learning about computer science concepts rather than deep-diving into specific technologies. The latest frameworks and programming languages will come and go, so it will be easier to adapt and learn if you have a good conceptual background.</p><p><b>Janet:</b> Be hands on. Build something from what you’ve learned, and don’t worry if it’s “good enough.” Write articles about what you’re building or learning. This helps you grow and deepens your understanding of a new technology. </p><p><b>Purvi:</b> Find your passion or interest and explore how computer science can help you realize it. You have to lay the groundwork by learning programming languages, algorithms, data structures and such. This might get boring and tough, but these are fundamental skills just like reading or math. Once the groundwork is laid, the ability to turn your passion into reality will be exhilarating. <br/></p><p><a
