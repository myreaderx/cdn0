We propose heterogeneous plasmonic modeling geometry consisting of\r\nsilver, gold and graphene for functioning plasmonic trapping operating at the near-infrared\r\nspectrum. For our designed model, the vertical potential well is 32 times larger than the Brownian\r\nmotion energy K B T, indicating that the nanosphere can be stably trapped using the graphene covered\r\ngold and silver nano-trench structure. By varying the incident laser wavelength and angle of\r\nillumination, the gold nanosphere can be trapped stably 40 nm above the bottom of the proposed\r\nnano-trench structure. The graphene layer enhances the localized electric field of the nano-trench\r\nin comparison to a pure silver and gold nano-trench structure without a graphene layer on top.","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":18433,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cc55deb9bc51397c6905c3b1476119b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Noor Uddin, Qing Yang, Guangqing Du, Feng Chen, Dayantha Lankanath, Huijing Li and Xun Hou","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599418309833}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:51:49","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:51:49","feedId":18433,"fetchDate":"Sun, 06 Sep 2020 18:51:49 +0000","fetchMs":1243,"handleMs":61022,"totalMs":62271,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af32bc2b950854f7e62e0df470d818c9","hostName":"us-031*","requestId":"55e6397618d24436a3250ba8ed89a441_18433","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:17:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:17:30","id":18433,"name":"Journal of Optics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/2040-8986/?rss=1","subscriber":180,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn20@2020_6/2020/09/06/18-51-48-406_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Journal of Optics","weekly":null,"link":"http://iopscience.iop.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1599418247567,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":1244,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":61022,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
