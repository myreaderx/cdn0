But it can be tricky to use it well if you've got a ton of questions about the platform. That's why I've answered five common WordPress questions so you can get the most out of your cleaning service template:</p>\n<h3>1. Do I Need to Make a WordPress Landing Page?</h3>\n<p>Landing pages can help increase sales, but they're not always necessary. Usually, a landing page is part of a broader marketing campaign. For example, if you have an in-store or online promotion that you're running, making a landing page around it is a good idea. If not, it's better to direct your energy elsewhere.</p>\n<p>For those readers that want to make a landing page, check out this helpful tutorial:</p>\n<ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/elementor-landing-page-for-wordpress--cms-36631\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-desktop\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-tablet\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-mobile\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380px\" height=\"269px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=720/uploads/users/30/posts/36631/preview_image/landing-page-pre.jpg 2x\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-webdesign\">Elementor</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Create an Elementor Landing Page for WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Adi Purdila</div></a></li></ul>\n<h3>2. Should I Put Ads on My Cleaning Services Website?</h3>\n<p>While you can fit ads in WordPress themes for cleaning services, I'd recommend against it. Advertisements are a source of more revenue, but they can distract from your business page. Your visitors' attention should be directed at your services, not potential competitors.</p>\n<h3>3. Can I Change the Font on My Cleaning Website Theme?</h3>\n<p>Your laundry and dry cleaning services WordPress theme is very flexible when it comes to customization. That includes fonts. If you're looking to change up your site's look by adding some fresh typography, you'll want to read this article:</p>\n<ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/customize-your-website-how-to-add-new-fonts-to-wordpress--cms-34577\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-desktop\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-tablet\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-mobile\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380px\" height=\"269px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=720/uploads/users/369/posts/34577/preview_image/add-new-fonts-to-wordpress-website.jpg 2x\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-webdesign\">WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Add New Fonts to WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Jessica Thornsby</div></a></li></ul>\n<h3>4. How Many Pages Should My Website Have?</h3>\n<p>The number of pages you use should depend on how much useful content you have and staying organized. You'll want basic pages like the home page, services page, and contact page. But you can add more pages from here.</p>\n<p>Think about what information you need to have to show consumers. Then decide whether that content needs its own page or whether it can share space with other information. Scan through your premium WordPress cleaning website theme's included pages and decide for yourself which ones work for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Can I Recover My Site?</h3>\n<p>The short answer is yes, but it depends on how well you prepared for this scenario. If you never created a backup for your cleaning services website, you'll have to rely on search engine caches or using <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">The Internet Archive</a>. Unfortunately, neither of these methods is completely reliable.</p>\n<p>Your best bet is to restore your website from a backup. This way you won't get broken pages and links. Reading the below article will make sure you won't have to worry if something happens to the site you worked hard on:</p>\n<ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-backup-your-wordpress-site--cms-34634\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-desktop\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-tablet\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420px\" height=\"297px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg 2x\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image resized-image resized-image-mobile\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380px\" height=\"269px\" srcset=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=720/uploads/users/30/posts/34634/preview_image/download_pre.jpg 2x\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-webdesign\">WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Backup Your WordPress Site</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Adi Purdila</div></a></li></ul>\n<h2>Learn More About WordPress From Envato Tuts+ on YouTube</h2>\n<p>The Envato Tuts+ team is here to help you create the best website possible.
