Their designs pack two for one, like their latest which goes from living room to bedroom in 30 seconds by hitting a button, swiping a finger or a voice command. The <a href=\"https://www.oriliving.com/products/cloud-bed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Cloud Bed Sofa Edition</a>Â hides the bed away above at the ceiling in a built-in frame and when it&#8217;s time for sleep it easily glides down to the floor disguising the sofa.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-1m.gif\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Ceilings are often just wasted space but the Cloud Bed Sofa Edition utilizes it to accommodate a queen or king bed, thereby creating two dedicated spaces within the same footprint. During the day, a three-seater sofa with built-in tables as arms looks streamlined and modern with no signs of the hidden bed. Come nighttime, or whenever you sleep, the bed descends to make a contemporary bedroom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434927\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434927\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434927\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2-600x337.jpg 600w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The launch of the Cloud Bed (sofa edition) comes at a time when people are spending more time in cramped apartments, and multifamily property owners are looking for ways to optimize and improve the utility, usability and flexibility of each square foot.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>-Hasier Larrea, founder and CEO of Ori</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434928\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434928\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434928\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3-800x450.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3-600x337.jpg 600w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434929\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434929\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434929\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4-600x337.jpg 600w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434930\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434930\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434930\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5-800x450.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5-600x337.jpg 600w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/Ori-Cloud-Bed-sofa-5.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Cloud Bed Sofa Edition can easily be retrofitted into existing layouts (with a minimum 8&#8217;6&#8243; ceiling height) or installed into new builds.

The air cleaning appliance utilizes the combination of an integrated fan with an ionizing element and filter to create a negative electrical charge for capturing particles. This design also permits the user to wash and reuse the filtration element for more cost-efficient ownership.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434752\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434752\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434752\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-4-810x541.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-4-810x541.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-4-800x534.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-4.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=434753\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-434753\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-434753\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-5-810x541.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-5-810x541.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-5-800x534.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/11/SWNA-airpurifier-Jaju-5.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>An air purifier of this modest size will unlikely be effective for servicing an entire room unless very small; that process <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-purifier/#what-can-an-air-purifier-do-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">requires a combination of airflow using a large fan and enough surface area</a> using a particle-capturing membrane to optimize efficacy.

For the latter, Hay works to infuse these spaces with a transformative sense of play â the effects of which she was able to witness herself. âIâd come to the hospital to say goodbye to the staff, [but met] a young girl in the space â she was five years old and had just gone through appendix surgery the night before,â Hay says. âShe was very frightened and confused, and I was curious to see how she was going to react. From my point of view it was sort of a miracle â after a few minutes, without any words, she started to react to the environment, and she looked calm and relaxed. It was like she was regaining control of her destiny. For me, it was a living demonstration of the power of a playful environment for children.â</p>\n<p>Hayâs work is now on view as part of <a href=\"https://shanihay.com/exhibitions/510\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Tel Avivâs 2020 Crafts and Design Biennale</a>.
