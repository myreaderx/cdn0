Or rather, will-be famous pets, once the pet talent agency <strong>Pets on Q</strong> is through with them. Netflix&#8217;s newest reality series, <strong><em>Pet Stars</em></strong>, follows talent management agency Pets on Q as they find the next big pet star, from good doggos to weird reptiles and everything in-between. Watch the <em>Pet Stars</em> trailer below.<br />\n<span id=\"more-668027\"></span></p>\n<h2>Pet Stars Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HflZiBzv3xc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Talent management company Pets on Q was founded by <strong>Colleen Wilson</strong> and <strong>Melissa Curtis</strong>, who navigate the surprisingly complex world of animal-based entertainment in the new Netflix documentary series <em>Pet Stars</em>. Not only are there countless cute dogs, there are cats, rabbits, birds, lizards, turtles, rats, pigs, and monkeys vying for a chance to be the next big pet star (or at least, their owners are).</p>\n<p>But as weird as it can feel to watch a bunch of people strategically trying to make their pet famous, there&#8217;s an undeniable joy to be found in watching cute pups and pets in adorable little outfits. And not only are they dressed to impress, a couple have some incredible talents. There&#8217;s a surfing dog! A bunny that can hop down a slide! The latter of which, according to the owner, is &#8220;not a normal bunny,&#8221; but a &#8220;Hollywood bunny.&#8221; Hard to argue with that.</p>\n<p>Wilson and Curtis take one-on-one sessions with clients and also scout for new talent at special events, including the World’s Ugliest Dog Contest, which hosts annually at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in Petaluma, California. Naturally, it features some of the cutest ugly dogs you&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more than just spotlight-chasing to <em>Pet Stars</em>. The series also promises to give a glimpse of Pet on Q&#8217;s humanitarian efforts to help animals in need. Per Netflix’s press release, <em>Pet Stars </em>will let viewers &#8220;see how [Colleen and Melissa] run their business securing partnerships for pets [and] how they work with rescues to highlight animals in need of a better life!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This pair handles Hollywood&#8217;s cutest, most well-known animal clients — top hats, treats and poop to boot,” Netflix said in a statement. &#8220;Their mission centers around making the world a better place, one animal at a time, and throughout the episodes, viewers not only get to see how they run their business securing partnerships for pets, but also how they work with rescues to highlight animals in need of a better life! Whether it’s a business opportunity or a life-changing new home, their first love (and priority) are the animals.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Pet Stars</em> premieres on Netflix on <strong>April 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pet-stars-trailer-netflix/\">Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;Pet Stars&#8217; Trailer is Full of Good Doggos and All Kinds of Talented Pets</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ILkdHXanoqA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:30:24 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pet-stars-e1619185483252-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"8f2175e4aa8f91d6188b4a463967d2bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn25@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-19-126_ea2e871ea99a71c7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":16037,"destBytes":9210,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/pet-stars-e1619185483252-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn25@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-19-126_ea2e871ea99a71c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-389_e44f83622e44bd0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ILkdHXanoqA:j-6LCqgAfPE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn22@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-45-891_9699c1943839ecb7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ILkdHXanoqA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn34@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-175_8febb49bcac6c9ee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317635},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"‘The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee’ Movie Musical in the Works at Disney","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668017","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-668019\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"the 25th annual putnam county spelling bee movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-768x328.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717.jpeg 920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Can you use <strong><em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee </em></strong>in a sentence? Disney can — the studio is developing a live-action feature film adaptation of the hit Tony-winning Broadway musical with the producers of the live-action <em>Aladdin</em> remake set to produce.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-668017\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-tackling-the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-movie-musical-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Disney is closing a deal to acquire the rights to the acclaimed Broadway show <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em> to develop it into a live-action movie adaptation.</p>\n<p>Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich, who produced Disney&#8217;s live-action <em>Aladdin</em> remake to billion-dollar box office success, are producing <em>Spelling Bee</em> via their Rideback banner. Rideback&#8217;s Ryan Halprin, who appeared in a college production of the show and helped chase the rights, will executive produce.</p>\n<p><em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee </em>is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by William Finn and a book by Rachel Sheinkin that follows several spelling bee competitors hailing from diverse backgrounds. The show is renowned for his audience interaction, inviting members of the crowd to compete in the spelling bee alongside the six young characters. And true to its improv roots — it was conceived as an improv play by Rebecca Feldman — the official pronouncer, usually an improv comedian, often provides ridiculous usage-in-a-sentence examples when asked to use words in a sentence.</p>\n<p>Feldman, Jay Reiss, Sarah Saltzberg and Dan Fogler are the credited creators of that show, workshopping it from its improv play origins and moving it to Broadway in 2005, where it earned six Tony nominations and won two, for best book and Fogler for best actor.</p>\n<p><em>Spelling Bee </em>is one of the 100 longest-running Broadway shows, and has been staged in local productions around the country. Though the thing that makes it so flexible to be staged anywhere, and by amateurs and professionals alike, is likely going to prove an issue in translating it to the big screen. The audience interaction and the improv elements are going to be hard to bring over into a scripted feature film adaptation. The most probable outcome is that Disney is going to turn <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee </em>into a sweet coming-of-age comedy, without the edgier elements that have made <em>Spelling Bee</em> a Broadway mainstay.</p>\n<p>Hollywood has long been attempting to bring <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em> to the screen, but this marks the first time it&#8217;s been officially set up at a studio, per THR. Disney is currently searching for filmmakers to adapt the material.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-movie-disney/\">&#8216;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&#8217; Movie Musical in the Works at Disney</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DqtdBPS7_cY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"ae8722fa084310f45e1db28138610e31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-18-043_1a03b7bdd58ce348.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":47850,"destBytes":39810,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-e1619182356717-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn12@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-18-043_1a03b7bdd58ce348.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-342_c36dca0e14fb0a7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DqtdBPS7_cY:ZaIdQGyar7A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn78@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-395_70283072fcba3eaf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DqtdBPS7_cY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-176_13ebbe8f065afc85.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"Superhero Bits: Fan Billboard Asks for Tony Stark’s MCU Return, Animated Justice League Gets a Comic & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667864","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-667972 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thebatman-animated-trailer-700x295.jpg\" alt=\"The Batman Animated Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thebatman-animated-trailer-700x295.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thebatman-animated-trailer-360x152.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thebatman-animated-trailer-768x323.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thebatman-animated-trailer.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>How many times is <strong>The Dark Knight</strong> going to die in the <strong><em>Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point</em></strong> comics?

These are meant to be read after watching, so they will go deep into <strong>spoiler</strong> territory. You have been warned!<span id=\"more-666762\"></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667689\"></span></p>\n<h2>Previously On…</h2>\n<p>In “Truth,” John F. Walker (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>) was stripped of his title and authority as Captain America after taking the last vial of Dr. Nagel&#8217;s Super Soldier Serum and killing an unarmed Flag Smasher (<strong>Noah Mills</strong>). Sam Wilson (<strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>) visited Isaiah Bradley (<strong>Carl Lumbly</strong>) to get the full story behind the world&#8217;s first Black Captain America while Bucky Barnes (<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>) traveled to Sokovia to retrieve Zemo (<strong>Daniel Brühl</strong>) and deliver him to Ayo (<strong>Florence Kasumba</strong>) and the Dora Milaje. The mysterious Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (<strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong>) approached Walker about a job while Karli Morgenthau (<strong>Erin Kellyman</strong>) and the Flag Smashers prepared for an attack on the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) conference in New York City. In a mid-credits scene, Walker builds a new shield from scrap metal and his war medals.</p>\n<h2>Tonight, We Go to Battle</h2>\n<p>Karli Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers assemble to stop the GRC&#8217;s vote on global resettlement. Sam flies overhead while Bucky moves in on foot, joined by Sharon Carter. Karli is alerted to Falcon&#8217;s arrival and gives the go-ahead to start the attack. As Flag Smashers enter the GRC conference and begin rounding up global leaders, Falcon — or should I say, Captain America — smashes through a window and reveals his new red, white, and blue wingsuit. Cap and the gang quickly deduce that Karli&#8217;s not coming in; she&#8217;s trying to force everybody out. &#8220;It&#8217;s a misdirect,&#8221; says Sam, seconds before getting kicked in the chest by Batroc (<strong>Georges St-Pierre</strong>).</p>\n<p>&#8220;You cost me a lot of money,&#8221; says the French pirate. &#8220;I wonder how much I can get for your new bird costume.&#8221; Sam, always quick with a comeback, responds, &#8220;Maybe a baguette and a few French fries.&#8221; The two begin to fight as Flag Smashers continue to evacuate the building. Bucky and Sharon, meanwhile, split up to keep everyone from leaving. One of Karli&#8217;s followers hands Bucky a cell phone, putting him in direct contact with the Flag Smashers&#8217; leader.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you tired of fighting for the wrong side?&#8221; Karli asks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done this before, kid. I know how it ends,&#8221; says Bucky. Karli says it doesn&#8217;t matter if she survives, she&#8217;s fighting for something bigger than herself. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think I ever fought for something bigger than myself?&#8221; Bucky replies. &#8220;That&#8217;s all I ever tried to do. And I failed twice.&#8221; Of course, Bucky is referring to his time as a soldier during World War II, which ended with him falling into the hands of HYDRA and becoming the Winter Soldier, and his failed attempt to stop Thanos during the events of <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>.</p>\n<p>Some of the GRC representatives are escorted to a helicopter on the roof while the rest are evacuated through the basement and packed into two armored trucks. The Flag Smashers&#8217; plan runs so smoothly their targets don&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re hostages. Bucky makes a final plea for Karli to stop the attack before she takes more lives. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this. Don&#8217;t go down this path.&#8221; Karli, however, has no intention of stopping. &#8220;If that&#8217;s how you feel, you should sit this one out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sharon Carter takes out a Flag Smasher using a nifty gadget that emits Mercury Vapor, while Sam, tired of dancing with Batroc, says au revoir and flies out a window to intercept the helicopter taking off. Using a new and improved Redwing (that the United States government doesn&#8217;t control<i>)</i>, Falcon is able to scan the hostages in the chopper for anyone with flight training. Among them, he identifies a diplomat, Ayla Perez (<strong>Jane Rumbaua</strong>), as a former Air Force pilot. The character&#8217;s name is an easter egg for comic fans, combining Hector Ayala (White Tiger, Marvel&#8217;s first superhero of Latino descent) and one of the character&#8217;s creators, <strong>George Pérez</strong>. Using his greatest superpower, his ability to connect and communicate with others, Sam reaches out to Ayla through her phone&#8217;s earbuds and details a plan that will see her take control of the chopper after he takes care of the pilot.</p>\n<p>Karli, meanwhile, is losing control of the situation. &#8220;Worst case scenario&#8230; we kill the hostages,&#8221; she tells her followers. &#8220;We&#8217;re supposed to use them to negotiate,&#8221; one Smasher counters. &#8220;Either way, our message gets out to the world,&#8221; Karli says firmly. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t even matter if we die. The movement is strong enough to continue without us.&#8221; Karli has gone full dark, no stars. There&#8217;s no turning back for her now. Zemo&#8217;s words to Bucky at the Sokovian memorial in the last episode are ringing true: “The girl has been radicalized beyond salvation.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>One World, One People</h2>\n<p>Karli and her crew set up a roadblock and hijack the armored trucks. Before they can get away with their hostages, however, Bucky shows up and engages them. &#8220;We need a diversion. Give him someone to rescue,&#8221; orders Karli. One of her Super Soldiers, Gigi (<strong>Dani Deetté</strong>), pours gas on one of the armored trucks and sets it ablaze. As Bucky rips the doos off to free the hostages, John F. Walker enters the fray.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Morgenthau!&#8221; he screams, &#8220;Let&#8217;s finish this.&#8221; Karli replies, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to kill your friend. I don&#8217;t wanna hurt people that don&#8217;t matter.&#8221; This, of course, sends the enhanced and imbalanced Walker over the edge. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think Lemar&#8217;s life mattered?&#8221; he asks before throwing his homemade Captain America shield at her. Walker takes on the Flag Smashers while Bucky frees the hostages. That is until Dovich (<strong>Desmond Chiam</strong>) rips a parking meter out of the ground and tries to whack-a-mole Bucky into the pavement with it. Bucky and the Flag Smashers fight their way down into a construction site while Captain America and Ayla put their plan into motion and secure the chopper.</p>\n<p>Walker and Karli exchange super-powered strikes, with Karli steering the battle toward the other armored truck full of hostages. Bucky swings a steel beam at Dovich as Karli, having broken free from Walker, attempts to push the remaining truck off the ledge above. Just as it looks like the truck will crash down on Bucky, it&#8217;s pulled back by none other than Walker, who shows that, while he isn&#8217;t Steve Rogers, he isn&#8217;t exactly a villain either. At least, he doesn&#8217;t see himself as a bad guy. Karli and the remaining Flag Smashers descend upon him, sending the truck back over the edge, but this time it&#8217;s caught by Cap, who uses his jet-powered wingsuit to push it back up to safety. Redwing frees the remaining hostages using a laser cutter, but Karli isn&#8217;t giving up the fight just yet.</p>\n<p>Before Cap and his crew can bring Karli in, Batroc shows up with a smoke grenade launcher to help the Flag Smashers escape. The team splits up, with Bucky and Walker chasing after the Flag Smashers while Falcon closes in on Karli. In an interesting twist, however, Sharon Carter gets there first.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know, when you came to Madripoor,&#8221; Sharon begins, &#8220;you reminded me of a young me. I took you in, gave you an opportunity, and you betrayed me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because you wanted to control a world that hurt you,&#8221; replies Karli. &#8220;But I wanted to change it. I&#8217;m not interested in power or an empire. I  have bigger dreams.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What, like this?&#8221; Sharon condescends. &#8220;Come back and work for me again. All of you. We can make a difference together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You just want me because you need your muscle back. Without us Super Soldiers, how much power does the Power Broker really have?&#8221;</p>\n<p>And there we have it. Sharon Carter, the great-niece of legendary S.H.I.E.L.D. founder and Director Peggy Carter, is the Power Broker. And as it turns out, Batroc has been listening in on their conversation. Now two people know her secret. When the pirate attempts to blackmail Sharon for four times the amount he&#8217;s owed, she shoots him dead. Cap shows up and attempts to talk Karli down, but she decides to throw a cinderblock at him instead. Cap doesn&#8217;t want to fight Karli and does everything he can to evade her attacks.</p>\n<h2>We Can Do Better</h2>\n<p>The remaining Flash Smashers are apprehended by Bucky and Walker, who turn them over to the authorities. As they&#8217;re taken into custody, Walker quotes Abraham Lincoln. &#8220;Mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karli knocks the shield out of Cap&#8217;s hand and picks up a gun. Before she can shoot, she&#8217;s capped — pun intended — by Carter, who isn&#8217;t concerned with Sam&#8217;s life as much she is her own secret identity. Cap holds a dying Karli in his arms, squeezing her hand tight. Karli says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; before fading away. Sam carries the young girl out in his arms and places her on a stretcher. He&#8217;s thanked by the GRC representatives, with the Senator (<strong>Alphie Hyorth</strong>) offering, &#8220;You did your part in dealing with those terrorists, now we&#8217;ll do ours.&#8221; But Cap isn&#8217;t having it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stop calling them terrorists,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Your peacekeeping troops carrying weapons are forcing millions of people into settlements around the world. What do you think these people are gonna call you? These labels, &#8216;terrorists,&#8217; &#8216;refugee,&#8217; &#8216;thug,&#8217; they&#8217;re often used to get around the question, why?</p>\n<p>One of the GRC leaders responds, &#8220;Those settlements that happened five years ago, do you think it is fair for governments to have to support them?&#8221; to which Sam replies, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Senator continues their argument, &#8220;And the people who reappeared only to find someone else living in their family home, they just end up homeless? Look, I get it. But you have no idea how complicated this situation is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know what? You&#8217;re right,&#8221; says Sam. &#8220;And that&#8217;s a good thing. We finally have a common struggle now. Think about that. For once, all the people who&#8217;ve been begging, and I mean, literally begging for you to feel how hard any given day is&#8230; Now you know. How did it feel to be helpless? Now if you could remember what it was like to be helpless, and face a force so powerful it could erase half the planet, you would know that you&#8217;re about to have the same exact impact. This isn&#8217;t about easy decisions, Senator.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You just don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; interjects the Senator. But Sam makes it clear that he does. &#8220;I&#8217;m a Black man carrying the stars the stripes. What don&#8217;t I understand? Every time I pick this thing up, I know there are millions of people who are gonna hate me for it. Even now, here, I feel it. The stares, the judgment. And there&#8217;s nothing I can do to change it. Yet I&#8217;m still here. No super serum, no blond hair, or blue eyes. The only power I have is that I believe we can do better.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Captain America and the Winter Soldier</h2>\n<p>The remaining Flag Smashers are to be transported to the Raft, but the armored vehicle carrying them is blown up by Zemo&#8217;s butler, Oeznik (<strong>Nicholas Pryor</strong>). Speaking of Zemo, we see him on the Raft, quite pleased with himself for taking out the remaining Super Soldiers. Well, almost all of them. Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is in Washington D.C. with John F. Walker, who emerges in his new red, white, and black suit as U.S. Agent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Things are about to get weird,&#8221; says Val. &#8220;So, when they do, we&#8217;re not gonna need a Captain America. We&#8217;re gonna need a U.S. Agent. Keep your phone on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So, how are things going to get weird? Is Val alluding to joining The Thunderbolts, or perhaps the upcoming <em>Secret Invasion</em> series in which we discover that the shape-shifting Skrulls have been infiltrating Earth for years? Only time will tell.</p>\n<p>Bucky visits Mr. Yori Nakajima (<strong>Ken Takemoto</strong>) and tells him the truth about his son&#8217;s tragic death. Meanwhile, his therapist, Dr. Raynor (<strong>Amy Aquino</strong>), receives a gift — his notebook with every name crossed off. Bucky has made his amends. He may, finally, have a chance for peace.</p>\n<p>In Baltimore, Cap visits Isaiah Bradley. Later, he surprises Isaiah and his grandson Eli  (<strong>Elijah Richardson</strong>) when they visit the Smithsonian&#8217;s Captain America exhibit to find a statue of Isaiah, recognizing his service to the country as the first Black Captain America. &#8220;Now, they&#8217;ll never forget what you did for this country,&#8221; says Sam as a tearful Isaiah embraces him. It&#8217;s a powerful, cathartic moment that brings Isaiah and Sam together and, symbolically, allows old wounds to start to heal.</p>\n<p>We get a montage of a party back in Delacroix, Louisiana with Sam and Bucky hanging out with family and friends. Together, they stare out at the setting sun and the title card fades in. <em>Captain America and the Winter Soldier.</em> In an after-credits scene, Sharon Carter is offered a full pardon by the United States government. As she leaves the hearing, she makes a phone call to an unknown recipient.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Start lining up our buyers. Super Soldiers might be off the menu, but we&#8217;re about to have full access to government secrets, prototype weapons, you name it. Should be something for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Created by <strong>Malcolm Spellman</strong> and directed by <strong>Kari Skogland</strong>, <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> limited series surpassed my lofty expectations. It&#8217;s been an absolute pleasure to watch Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Daniel Brühl, and Emily VanCamp further develop their characters and build upon their established chemistry while newcomers like Erin Kellyman, Wyatt Russell, and Carl Lumbly make the Marvel Cinematic Universe feel bigger and more complicated post-<em>Endgame</em>.</p>\n<p>This has been a series that&#8217;s been as much about what&#8217;s being said and what&#8217;s being done, hence my heavy usage of quotes in these spoiler-heavy recaps. Mackie and Stan’s performances, coupled with some strong, emotionally charged writing, have pushed the characters of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes to new heights while peeling back layers of subtlety. Seeing Madripoor, a key location from the X-Men universe, was exciting, as was the introduction of Julia Louis-Dreyfus<strong>&#8216; </strong>Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. There are so many storytelling possibilities in the MCU&#8217;s future, and I&#8217;m very excited to see how this series (and future Disney+ series like <em>Loki, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk,</em> and <em>Secret Invasion)</em> reshapes the way we think about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m intrigued to see what happens with Sharon Carter from here. Is she actually a villain, or could she be a Skrull? Will we see U.S. Air Force First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (<strong>Danny Ramirez</strong>) suit up as the new Falcon at some point?

The trailer you&#8217;re about to see is interesting, in that it starts off rather silly, with Grammer&#8217;s zonked-out musician recording an album that&#8217;s nothing more than the sound of a refrigerator door opening and closing. But then, when you least expect it, things get surprisingly serious and dramatic. Watch <em>The Space Between</em> trailer below, and try not to confuse it with the forgotten 2017 sci-fi coming-of-age film <em>The Space Between Us</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667524\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Space Between Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t93lmyT32hk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>This trailer is not what I was expecting. I guess I should say I don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> I was expecting, exactly, but based on Kelsey Grammer&#8217;s physical appearance here, I guess I was expecting something over-the-top and goofy. And indeed, when the trailer begins, it certainly <em>seems</em> goofy. But then, without warning, everything stops and starts to get dramatic. I&#8217;m not sure if that tonal shift will work in the final film, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Space Between</em>, which is described as &#8220;an inspiring coming-of-age story set during the iconic 90s LA music scene,&#8221; &#8220;Micky Adams (Grammer), an eccentric has-been rock musician, loses his grip on reality as his record label looks to drop him and his new &#8216;unique&#8217; albums. In hopes of breaking out of the mailroom, young Charlie Porter (<strong>Jackson White</strong>) is tasked with traveling to the musician’s bizarre home and forcing Micky out of his contract. Micky realizes Charlie could be the key to an artistic breakthrough and the pair’s unlikely friendship grows. The odd but powerful bond helps both gain perspective on the music industry, life, love…and the space between.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The full cast includes Kelsey Grammer, Jackson White, <strong>Julia Goldani Telles</strong>, <strong>Paris Jackson</strong>, <strong>Andy Daly</strong>, and <strong>William Fichtner</strong>. On top of that, the film features original music from Rivers Cuomo, the frontman of Weezer. And let&#8217;s be honest here – none of us ever expected to see a movie where Kelsey Grammer plays a washed-up rock star featuring music from Rivers Cuomo. If you say you did you are <em>lying</em>.</p>\n<p>Will Aldis wrote the script for <em>The Space Between</em>, which Rachel Winter directed. <em>The Space Between </em>is headed to a limited theatrical release on <strong>April 23</strong>. It will then come to video-on-demand and digital on <strong>June 15</strong>, and be available on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, DirecTV, Vudu, Xfinity, and more.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-space-between-trailer/\">&#8216;The Space Between&#8217; Trailer: Kelsey Grammer is a Has-Been Rock Star</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iqIGRH7Ar3U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:30:13 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-space-between-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"9736bc33f83d6a0727915405c75152eb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-20-952_6133e7c1b56fd5c8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":30553,"destBytes":20320,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-space-between-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-20-952_6133e7c1b56fd5c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn70@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-586_1da1d94209fe38b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iqIGRH7Ar3U:8lBTmIAonRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-521_ee1a3ac024f5f7e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iqIGRH7Ar3U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-45-177_f1ff3d42cb65edcf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317636},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"VOTD: Bill Murray Reacts to the Mini-Stay Puft Marshmallow Men in ‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667920","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-667930 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ghostbusters-afterlife-billmurray-reacts-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Murray Reacts to Ghostbusters: Afterlife Clip\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ghostbusters-afterlife-billmurray-reacts.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ghostbusters-afterlife-billmurray-reacts-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, <em><strong>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</strong></em> was forced to reveal one of its secrets because of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mini-pufts-toys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some impending merchandise</a> being released by Hasbro. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ghostbusters-afterlife-clip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A clip from the movie</a> showed <strong>Paul Rudd</strong>&#8216;s character encountering some maniacal and mischievous mini-Stay Puft marshmallow men inside a Walmart after picking up a pint of Baskin-Robbins ice cream (how about that product placement, folks?). Now we get to see what one of the original <em>Ghostbusters</em> thinks of the scene with <strong>Bill Murray</strong> himself watching and reacting to the scene for the first time.<span id=\"more-667920\"></span></p>\n<h2>Bill Murray Reacts to Ghostbusters: Afterlife Clip</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1iretuNB0w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Bill Murray doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;mother pussbucket&#8221; when he sees the tiny versions of the Stay Puft marshmallow man, but he does have a genuine and hearty laugh when the fist little marshmallow monsters pops up, and a smile stays on his face for the duration of the scene. Producer and original <em>Ghostbusters</em> director <strong>Ivan Reitman</strong> certainly enjoys his reaction too, and he&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ghostbusters-afterlife-gave-jason-reitman-the-best-moment-of-his-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apparently very proud</a> of what his son Jason Reitman has done as director of the new movie.</p>\n<p>Normally, if we had only gotten some kind of reaction in an interview, I&#8217;d think Bill Murray was just playing nice and complimenting a movie that he&#8217;s in. But that&#8217;s not exactly the comedian&#8217;s style, and that&#8217;s an authentic reaction to the scene. We&#8217;re not sure if Sony Pictures felt like releasing this video to squash any potential negative reactions after the clip was released, but it probably couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>\n<p>The scene in question feels like it&#8217;s probably from early on in the movie, likely after some other strange things start happening in the neighborhood of Somerville, Oklahoma. Is there a chance that the poltergeists that start terrorizing this rural town have a link to Gozer the Gozerian and the other ghosts that terrorized New York in the original <em>Ghostbusters</em>? There was at least one hint at that possibility in the first trailer for the movie from awhile back, so it&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility.</p>\n<p><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> follows a single mother (<strong>Carrie Coon</strong>) and her two kids (<strong>Finn Wolfhard</strong> and <strong>Mckenna Grace</strong>) move to a small town where they realize their connection to the Ghostbusters and the legacy the kids&#8217; grandfather left behind. So it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if there was another legacy connection with the spooks, specters, and ghosts they find themselves facing.</p>\n<p>As of now, <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> is set to hit theaters on <strong>November 11, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/votd-bill-murray-reacts-to-ghostbusters-afterlife-clip/\">VOTD: Bill Murray Reacts to the Mini-Stay Puft Marshmallow Men in &#8216;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UNTWsyej2iM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 21:00:47 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ghostbusters-afterlife-billmurray-reacts-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c3b44c76d1f4c44e6d10124814d202bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn13@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-44-237_a3394b80ca4a74da.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":23905,"destBytes":15054,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ghostbusters-afterlife-billmurray-reacts-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn13@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-44-237_a3394b80ca4a74da.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn41@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-528_6f6fcb1a9988fc95.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UNTWsyej2iM:3AokPQ7Rjpo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-210_88d0bf628217f059.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UNTWsyej2iM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-181_3a85e0b9059cc27a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317635},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"2021 Oscars Honest Trailer: Not Even a Pandemic Will Stop Hollywood from Rewarding Itself","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667987","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-667989 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-2021-honesttrailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Oscars Honest Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-2021-honesttrailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/oscars-2021-honesttrailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Even though the coronavirus pandemic kept movie theaters closed for most of 2020, nothing can stop Hollywood from rewarding itself with the <strong>93rd Academy Awards</strong>. Initially, it seemed as if the line-up of potential nominees would be on the weaker side. But even though awards season arrived a little later than we&#8217;re used to, that didn&#8217;t stop the heavy hitters from getting limited time in theaters and quicker releases on VOD and streaming, and it hasn&#8217;t stopped the <strong>2021 Oscars Honest Trailer</strong> from making jokes at the expense of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2021-oscar-nominations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all the Best Picture nominees</a>. <span id=\"more-667987\"></span></p>\n<p>2021 Oscars Honest Trailer</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCgUWHvKPg8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The 2021 Oscars Honest Trailer wastes no time pointing out how <strong><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em></strong> is almost shamelessly vying for Academy Awards. C&#8217;mon, the movie even mentions that the protests at the center of the movie are &#8220;the Academy Awards of protests,&#8221; which might be one of the most meta things to come from a Best Picture nominee.</p>\n<p>Screen Junkies also doesn&#8217;t hesitate to call out the total snub of <strong><em>Da 5 Bloods</em></strong>, despite the fact that <strong><em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em></strong> director Shaka King is literally a student of director Spike Lee.

The event&#8217;s organizers have released new information about New York Comic Con 2021, including the fact that it will be in-person with safety measures in place (including a &#8220;no hug&#8221; policy).

We’re working closely with each convention center to determine how many people are permitted in the building every day and at a given time.</li>\n<li><strong>We are requiring approved face coverings </strong>for all individuals attending our events, including our exhibitors and staff. They must be worn at all times within our venues. For more information, you can visit the FAQ pages on each of our show websites.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature screening upon entry </strong>will be required to enter our events<strong>. </strong>Anyone with an elevated temperature will not be permitted to enter the event.</li>\n<li>We will have <strong>increased sanitization and cleaning</strong> with<strong> enforced physical distancing </strong>throughout the event.</li>\n<li>We have also adopted a firm <strong>no handshakes, no high-fives, no hugs</strong> policy. We’re all going to have to get very smooth and cool-looking at either the elbow bump or air high-fives. Please start practicing now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a breakdown of the in-person conventions that the group is organizing this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Florida Supercon</strong>, Miami Beach Convention Center: September 10-12</li>\n<li><strong>New York Comic Con</strong>, Javits Center: October 7-10</li>\n<li><strong>Emerald City Comic Con</strong>, Washington State Convention Center: December 2-5</li>\n<li><strong>C2E2</strong>, McCormick Place: December 10-12</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to those physical events, the company will be &#8220;running a virtual event companion through <a href=\"http://findthemetaverse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FindtheMetaverse.com</a>. So whether or not you join us in person, you can attend each of our shows and have a pretty excellent time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not thrilled with the vagueness of that statement. Will online viewers be allowed to watch every single panel? Will in-person seating be a free-for-all if there is reduced capacity? Expect answers to questions like this &#8220;in the months leading up&#8221; to those shows. But for those who are vaccinated and willing to jump back into big crowds, it will certainly be an option for you in a few months.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-york-comic-con-2021/\">New York Comic Con is Returning With an In-Person Convention This Fall, But Hugs Will Be Banned</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Jm_JIXp8uP8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 22:00:15 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/NYCC-2020-logo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"f0bdd54ff4e4ebadae98bae4883214de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-066_2fd36c800f8d7178.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":35542,"destBytes":22990,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/NYCC-2020-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-30-066_2fd36c800f8d7178.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-385_2fb061be18694b6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Jm_JIXp8uP8:dETc5jkVgkA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn58@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-554_1c43b0aefb7b5910.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Jm_JIXp8uP8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-768_51aa8cd4fbe544b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"James Cameron Really Wants Movie Theaters, and Blockbusters, to Survive","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667847","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-667866\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"james cameron on movie theaters\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/james-cameron-on-movie-theaters.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>James Cameron</strong> has a bunch of <em>Avatar</em> sequels on the way, and he&#8217;d very much like movie theaters to still be around to play them, please and thank you.

And while I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not <em>not</em> true – of course Cameron wants to make money, we all do, that&#8217;s life here in a capitalist society – I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Open up the theaters so <em>Avatar 2</em> can make a billion bucks!&#8221; Sure, Cameron&#8217;s <em>Avatar</em> recently <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/avatar-box-office-surpasses-avengers-endgame/\">reclaimed its crown</a> as the biggest box office hit of all time, but I think what Cameron is saying here is that he hopes movie theaters can thrive again so there can be more big movies to come – be they <em>Avatar</em> sequels, or something else.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let’s pray that movie theaters are still there after this pandemic and after this shift towards streaming, not that I have anything against streaming,&#8221; Cameron added. &#8220;There&#8217;s great writing and great shows in [streaming], but let&#8217;s remember that movie theaters are a sacred experience for all of us. Let&#8217;s get back out there when it&#8217;s safe to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With more and more people being vaccinated, there&#8217;s a real hope in Hollywood that movie theaters can bounce back. And while it&#8217;s still too early to know for sure, there are signs of life – <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> is doing very well at the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/godzilla-vs-kong-box-office-update/\">box office</a>, even though people have the option to watch it at home via HBO Max.

For now, we&#8217;re left to speculate without even knowing anything about when or where the new movie will take place – although Mangold <em>may</em> have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/indiana-jones-5-setting/\">previously hinted</a> that at least part of the movie could take place in 1960s New York City.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong> <strong>Koepp</strong> (<em>Jurassic Park</em>) and <strong>Jonathan Kasdan</strong> (<em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>) wrote earlier drafts of the script, but the director recently confirmed that the latest drafts were written by Mangold and the writing team of <strong>Jez</strong> and <strong>John-Henry</strong> <strong>Butterworth</strong>, with whom he previously collaborated on the Oscar-nominated <em>Ford v Ferrari</em>. <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, who directed every previous entry in the <em>Indiana Jones</em> franchise, vacated the director&#8217;s chair for this final Harrison Ford-led entry but will still serve as a producer alongside <strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong>, <strong>Frank Marshall</strong>, and <strong>Simon Emanuel</strong>.</p>\n<p>Kretschmann played the eyepatch-wearing villain Baron Wolfgang von Strucker in <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> and <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, although I won&#8217;t pretend that he made much of an impact in that role. You may also remember him as the boat captain from Peter Jackson&#8217;s 2005 adaptation of <em>King Kong</em>, as Wassner in the submarine movie <em>U-571</em>, as Damaskinos in <em>Blade II</em>, or from his appearances in <em>24</em>, <em>Resident Evil: Apocalypse</em>, <em>Wanted</em>, <em>Valkyrie</em>, and <em>Westworld</em>. Your kids or younger siblings may know him best from his voice work in Pixar&#8217;s <em>Cars 2</em>, where he played the character of Professor Z.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/indiana-jones-5-cast-thomas-kretschmann/\">&#8216;Indiana Jones 5&#8217; Casts &#8216;Avengers: Age of Ultron&#8217; and &#8216;King Kong&#8217; Actor Thomas Kretschmann</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PCZ-ncecgLM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 21:30:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-cast-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"503d7181887b8fff024c54d258300a98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-29-954_fa09ccb2178e10e7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":18701,"destBytes":9620,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-cast-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-29-954_fa09ccb2178e10e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn37@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-220_a2fbd8f3d8807e86.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCZ-ncecgLM:EsueRozI00E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn2@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-45-756_670ef729104b9ec8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PCZ-ncecgLM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn19@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-45-179_a46d877e088a75c2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"‘Here Today’ Trailer: Tiffany Haddish and Billy Crystal Become Fast Friends","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668044","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-668052 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/heretoday-billycrystal-tiffanyhaddish-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Here Today Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/heretoday-billycrystal-tiffanyhaddish.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/heretoday-billycrystal-tiffanyhaddish-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Billy Crystal</strong> is still kicking around. He&#8217;s been laying pretty low for the most part, starring in small productions like <em>The Comedian</em>, <em>Untogether,</em> and <em>Standing Up, Falling Down</em>, usually playing a funny father figure. Now the comedian is keeping that tradition going strong in a new film, and he&#8217;ll be joined by one of the most popular comedians at the height of their career.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Here Today</em></strong> finds Billy Crystal starring as a veteran comedy writer who forms an unlikely friendship with a New York lounge singer played by <strong>Tiffany Haddish</strong>.

Even Haddish appears to be playing things a little more low-key. Unfortunately, it all feels rather subdued, almost like a CBS series desperately waiting for a laugh track, and that includes the likelihood of it being extremely appealing to your parents and grandparents.</p>\n<p>Billy Crystal directed <em>Here Today</em> as his third feature film outing, and he also wrote the script with Emmy-winning writer <strong>Alan Zweibel</strong>, one of the original writers on <strong><em>Saturday Night Live</em></strong>. The film was actually inspired by a short story Zweibel wrote called &#8220;The Prize, &#8220;which is likely where the inciting incident at the beginning of the trailer came from.</p>\n<p>When Sony Pictures Classics announced the release of the movie in theaters, Crystal said, &#8220;It was a joy to write with my dear friend Alan Zweibel. To get to act with and direct the hilarious Tiffany Haddish and our fantastic cast was a blessing. I haven’t been this excited since I got my second Moderna vaccine.&#8221; He&#8217;s also joined in the movie by <strong>Penn Badgley</strong>, <strong>Laura Benanti</strong>, <strong>Louisa Krause</strong>, <strong>Anna Deavere Smith</strong> and <strong>Nyambi Nyambi</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the official synopsis for the feature film:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When veteran comedy writer Charlie Burnz (Billy Crystal) meets New York singer Emma Payge (Tiffany Haddish), they form an unlikely yet hilarious and touching friendship that kicks the generation gap aside and redefines the meaning of love and trust.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Here Today</em> will arrive in theaters on <strong>May 7, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/here-today-trailer-tiffany-haddish-billy-crystal/\">&#8216;Here Today&#8217; Trailer: Tiffany Haddish and Billy Crystal Become Fast Friends</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KjO7A-169CQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:30:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/heretoday-billycrystal-tiffanyhaddish-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"b10169b480532c765f1bd710b7d6a2b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn49@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-17-811_c2b2f6f7896c9c4e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31880,"destBytes":21286,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/heretoday-billycrystal-tiffanyhaddish-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn49@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-17-811_c2b2f6f7896c9c4e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-556_76851a1d38cdd903.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KjO7A-169CQ:Uc-SnmKGat8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn85@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-45-819_3e7af2192e39ff10.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KjO7A-169CQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn22@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-35-45-179_8383383c98b29c41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"‘No One Will Save You’: Kaitlyn Dever Set to Star in New Movie From ‘Spontaneous’ Director Brian Duffield","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667571","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-667572\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/kaitlyn-dever-e1619008315668-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"no one will save you\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/kaitlyn-dever-e1619008315668-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/kaitlyn-dever-e1619008315668-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/kaitlyn-dever-e1619008315668-768x328.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Kaitlyn Dever</strong> has found her next feature film project. The <em>Booksmart</em> star had a banner year in 2019, breaking out in the Olivia Wilde-directed teen comedy before showing her dramatic chops in the Netflix limited series <em>Unbelievable</em>. Roles lined up for Dever, including a part in the feature film adaptation of hit Broadway musical <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>. Now Dever has found her next movie with <em>Spontaneous</em> writer/director <strong>Brian Duffield</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667571\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Dever is set to star in the feature film <em>No One Will Save You</em>, written and directed by Brian Duffield. 20th Century Studios has acquired the rights to the movie following a &#8220;competitive auction.&#8221; Tim White, Trevor White and Allan Mandelbaum will produce for Star Thrower Entertainment.</p>\n<p>There are currently no plot details available for <em>No One Will Save You</em>, not even information about its genre. Is it a comedy? Drama? Based on Duffield&#8217;s last sleeper hit film <em>Spontaneous</em> — a black comedy starring Katherine Langford about high school students who start to spontaneously combust — it will likely be a teen comedy with a sharp twist, which seems to suit Dever&#8217;s talents.</p>\n<p>Dever has broken out in a big way following the one-two punch of <em>Booksmart</em> and <em>Unbelievable</em>. Playing the best friend of Beanie Feldman&#8217;s protagonist of the teen comedy, Dever immediately established herself as a new teen sweetheart in <em>Booksmart</em>. Then she went on to earn a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in <em>Unbelievable</em>, as a teen who is charged with lying about being raped. Dever has been keeping busy ever since, shooting the Hulu limited series <i>Dopesick</i> alongside Michael Keaton and signing up for Stephen Chbosky&#8217;s feature adaptation of <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> for Universal and Marc Platt Productions.</p>\n<p>I like Dever and think that she could be a new matinee star if she chooses her roles right.

Of course, we know those characters are just cast members in big puffy body suits made to look like animated characters. However, the geniuses at Disney Imagineering have crafted new state-of-the-art bipedal animatronic technology that will make it so a character like Baby Groot from <strong><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></strong> can walk around parks, wave at families, pose for pictures, and even have an impromptu dance party. See Disney&#8217;s animatronic Baby Groot in action below.<span id=\"more-668067\"></span></p>\n<h2>Disney Imagineering&#8217;s Animatronic Groot</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechCrunch</a> learned all about this new animatronic technology that Disney Imagineers have been working on for the past three years. This is the next generation of animatronic technology that Disney has been leading up to after introducing the outstanding but stationary Hondo Ohnaka as part of the Smuggler&#8217;s Run attraction at Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge and the Na&#8217;vi Shaman from the Avatar theme park experience.</p>\n<p>Under the codename Project Kiwi, Imagineers developed this bipedal animatronic platform, and they dressed it up as a real life Baby Groot, complete with textured face, hands and feet, a variety of facial expressions, and incredibly smooth, lifelike body movement. However, this technology won&#8217;t necessarily just take the form of Baby Groot. Project Kiwi can be used to bring a variety of characters to life when all is said and done. R&#38;D Imagineer Principal <strong>Scott LaValley</strong> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry, and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The experience can go beyond the mere physical presence and body language of the character. The robotic body has a speaker installed that will allow for audio to come from the character for a truly immersive interaction. Even if kids are right next to the character, they won&#8217;t hear a bunch of loud robotic sounds of the inner-workings of the tech, because the noise of the animatronic is said to be very low. The only downside is that the battery power only supports roughly 45 minutes of walkaround time, something they&#8217;re hoping to improve upon as they continue to work on the project. And that&#8217;s where some disappointing news comes into play.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is all still a work in progress and there are no immediate plans to bring this animatronic to parks just yet, so don&#8217;t expect to see Groot or any other animatronic characters like this walking around as theme parks start to fill up with families again. But the good news is that Project Kiwi is already improving and planning ahead for park interaction.</p>\n<p>The next step for Project Kiwi will be creating an updated skeleton that is lighter and moves more efficiently. Imagineers are also figuring out how to dynamically apply torque and sensing capabilities to allow for stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. After all, not all surfaces where this animatronic may walk will be perfectly flat, and plenty of kids will undoubtedly want to hug and lean on a character like Groot for pictures. Imagineers want to make sure he isn&#8217;t going to fall over and force parents into an uncomfortable discussion.</p>\n<p>You can learn a lot more about the finer details of Project Kiwi over at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechCrunch</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-imagineering-animatronic-groot/\">VOTD: Unbelievable Animatronic Groot From Disney Imagineering Can Freely Walk Around Theme Parks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_j0PJArW8xA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:00:40 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyimagineering-animatronicgroot-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"fc23c671aeacf21f55b4d35be7f936bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-29-843_ad053b3744ed767f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31282,"destBytes":19106,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyimagineering-animatronicgroot-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-29-843_ad053b3744ed767f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn66@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-45-388_92331a590c8fcd5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_j0PJArW8xA:6_X6q3bZdP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn45@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-49-848_5c5e53bb61f1e06e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_j0PJArW8xA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-271_e41aef60d09040d1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"Cool Stuff: Oliver Rankin’s New ‘Back to the Future’ Posters Have No Problem Hitting 88 Miles Per Hour","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668024","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-668032 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture-oliverrankin-print-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Rankin Back to the Future Posters\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture-oliverrankin-print-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture-oliverrankin-print-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you&#8217;re gonna see some serious shit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A new batch of <strong><em>Back to the Future</em></strong> posters by artist <strong>Oliver Rankin</strong> certainly make good on that promise.

The artwork here is pretty impressive, almost resembling a computer animated model of the scenes in question. My only complaint is that the placement of the &#8220;OUTTATIME&#8221; license plate flying off the car seems odd since that plate comes off the back of the car right after it travels through time, but it&#8217;s a silly nitpick.</p>\n<p>On top of the the three regular giclee prints for each of the <em>Back to the Future</em> movies you see above, there are also foil variants that will be available for $55 each, or $160 for the whole set. Each of the foil variants only has an edition of 85, so you&#8217;ll want to be fast with snagging those. There&#8217;s also an even more limited edition version of the posters that comes printed on a 2mm aluminum panel.

Since then, though, we haven&#8217;t heard much more, and McKay and Lawrence went off to do another movie – <em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em>. Meanwhile, there&#8217;s currently a Hulu limited series about Holmes in the works – <em>The Dropout</em>, which will star Amanda Seyfried. So what of <em>Bad Blood</em>? According to McKay, the film is still in development.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667870\"></span></p>\n<p>In 2003, Elizabeth Holmes – then only 19-years-old – founded Theranos, a health technology. The company rose to fame – and wealth – after claiming to have invented a device that could perform advanced blood testing with just a tiny fingerprick. There was one big problem: none of it was real, and soon everything came crashing down. The Holmes story has been chronicled in multiple forms, including the excellent John Carreyrou book <em>Bad Blood</em>, which has the following synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup “unicorn” promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood testing significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at more than $9 billion, putting Holmes’s worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn’t work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2016, before the book was published, Legendary scooped up the movie rights, with plans for Adam McKay to direct and Jennifer Lawrence to star. So what&#8217;s the status of that project? According to McKay, it&#8217;s still in development. Speaking with the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/adam-mckay-vol-ii/id827905050?i=1000518144012\">Happy Sad Confused</a> podcast (via <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1170486-adam-mckay-jennifer-lawrence-bad-blood-update\">Coming Soon</a>), McKay said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the case of Jen Lawrence, I’ve known Jen for a while&#8230;One of the first meetings she ever did in Los Angeles was after her first movie was with me, and … I think she was 17, she might’ve been 18. She worshipped <em>Step Brothers</em>, so when her agent said, &#8216;Who do you want to meet with?’ I’m sure they weren’t so happy to hear her answer: &#8216;The guy who did <em>Step Brothers</em>.&#8217; So I’ve known Jen for a long time and have always been dying to work with her&#8230;We have been developing the <em>Bad Blood</em> [film]… That is still in development.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the meantime, though, McKay and Lawrence went off to make the upcoming Netflix movie <em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em>. It&#8217;s unclear if the pair will reunite for <em>Bad Blood</em> soon, but for now, the film is still in the works. However, it&#8217;s going to have some competition. Hulu has their own Holmes project – the limited series <em>The Dropout</em>, which will star Amanda Seyfried.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/bad-blood-movie-update/\">Elizabeth Holmes &#8216;Bad Blood&#8217; Movie Starring Jennifer Lawrence and Directed By Adam McKay Still In Development</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HA_R4PwaNn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:24 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-blood-movie-update-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"723e99a23d9a0d05bcd2a1c03afc9860","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn9@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-31-974_76c103a35bc18a95.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23408,"destBytes":11818,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bad-blood-movie-update-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn9@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-31-974_76c103a35bc18a95.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn10@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-212_51085512347808ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HA_R4PwaNn8:OXpy4Ukt0Zk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-45-214_a38717a77c88fc54.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HA_R4PwaNn8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-286_a67f708af5d5ac10.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"The Morning Watch: How Hollywood Creates Fake Crowds, Making a Charitable Event in ‘The Nevers’ & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=667981","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-667985 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tedlasso-greenscreen-crowd-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Making Fake Crowds in Movies\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tedlasso-greenscreen-crowd.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tedlasso-greenscreen-crowd-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, mind you – the silliness is part of the fun, part of the charm of it all. After all, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is ultimately the story of characters punching and kicking each other for the fate of the world. Some of these characters are humans; some are robots; some are giant monsters with four arms; some are immortal ninjas; some are full-blown gods; it&#8217;s a rich, goofy tapestry. To adapt that into a movie requires the right sort of balance, and perhaps even a certain degree of camp. Which makes the new <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie all the more frustrating. Here is a film taking itself so dreadfully serious that it forgets to let us have any fun. Worse than that, it&#8217;s kind of boring.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667563\"></span></p>\n<p>In <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, there&#8217;s a rule written down somewhere that if fighters of an alternate dimension known as Outworld beat fighters from Earth 10 times in a series of tournaments, Outworld has the right to invade and conquer us. I&#8217;m not sure the logistics of this – is it a legal matter that suddenly allows this dimension of monsters and sorcerers to gain access to our world? Can we fight it in court if we lose in battle? In any case, those are the rules, and rules were made to be broken. Rather than sit around waiting for humans to get their shit together, Outworld ruler Shang Tsung (<strong>Chin Han</strong>) decides to cut to the chase and send an assassin – Sub-Zero (<strong>Joe Taslim</strong>), who has the power to conjure up ice like Elsa from <em>Frozen</em> – to bump off the prospective champions of Earth before the tenth tournament even takes place.</p>\n<p>So far, so good, I guess. It&#8217;s all a bit rushed – we get a title card to explain what&#8217;s going on here, and there are a lot of moments where characters give big speeches spelling out their motivations. That&#8217;s to be expected, and as lazy as it may seem, it doesn&#8217;t hurt the movie – at first. Nor does it hurt that director <strong>Simon McQuoid</strong> leans into the horror elements built into the mythology. <em>Mortal Kombat </em>is full of monsters and bodily damage, and the very early moments where Sub-Zero prowls around our world like Michael Myers hunting down Laurie Strode are plenty effective, and even creepy. Taslim&#8217;s Sub-Zero gives off real menace, but it&#8217;s not enough to keep the film on its feet.</p>\n<p>What knocks <em>Mortal Kombat</em> down again and again is its rushed, uninspired, and surprisingly dull script. There&#8217;s a lot of talk here about chosen ones, and the Earth fighters who are meant to be the champions against Outworld all bear a mark that looks like the iconic <em>Mortal Kombat</em> dragon symbol. This mark is somehow both a birthmark <em>and</em> something that can be magically transferred to other people. Only <em>true</em> fighters can bear this mark, though. Or something like that.</p>\n<p>One such person bearing the mark is former MMA fighter Cole Young (<strong>Lewis Tan</strong>), a painfully lifeless character who has been invented specifically for the film. Cole is meant to be our avatar bringing us into the world of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, which means he mostly spends the movie running around asking questions about what&#8217;s going on and then occasionally engaging in fight scenes.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get to those fight scenes, shall we? <em>Mortal Kombat</em> has an R rating, which means it can lean into the gore that made the games so famous. And sure enough, the blood does fly. When people are hit here blood practically explodes from their bodies; more blood than anyone can possibly contain. Limbs are torn off; bodies are frozen; guts are spilled; hearts are ripped out. It&#8217;s brutal stuff, so why does it feel so&#8230;safe? There should be a gnarly aspect to all this carnage, and it isn&#8217;t there. As for the fighting itself, it varies – some fights are staged quite well, where we can see every punch, every kick, every flip. Others are filmed in extreme close-ups that render the action incomprehensible. But the international cast here is clearly adept at fighting, or at least <em>movie</em> fighting.</p>\n<p>Cole joins forces with Special Forces soldiers Sonya Blade (<strong>Jessica McNamee</strong>) and Jax (<strong>Mehcad Brooks</strong>), who both know all about the ancient rules of Mortal Kombat. Sonya even has a corkboard with newspaper clippings and lines of string tying it all together, like a loony conspiracy theorist chasing after the inexplicable. Little details like that are a nice touch, but we need more. We need characterization, for one thing. Who are any of these characters? <em>Mortal Kombat</em> has no interest in fleshing them out, probably because it thinks it doesn&#8217;t have to. The game versions of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> players didn&#8217;t have real character development, so why should the movie? Everyone is just sort of there, standing around, looking admittedly cool while waiting for their individual fight scenes. When they&#8217;re not doing that they&#8217;re fond of showing up and announcing their names, probably so people in the audience can lean over to someone next to them and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s that guy from the games!&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Sonya wants to help save the world, Cole has his doubts about all of this, and he doesn&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s ready to fight. He&#8217;ll have to find some encouragement, be it from the lightning god Lord Raiden (<strong>Tadanobu Asano</strong>), the fireball throwing Liu Kang (<strong>Ludi Lin</strong>), or Kung Lao (<strong>Max Huang</strong>), who wears a hat that can conveniently turn into a buzzsaw. Also along for the ride, reluctantly: criminal Kano (<strong>Josh Lawson</strong>), the one character the film allows to be &#8220;funny.&#8221; Unfortunately, Kano&#8217;s constant stream of passive-aggressive one-liners fizzle, as do moments where he says groan-worthy quips like, &#8220;Put a shirt on, Magic Mike!&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the baddie side, in addition to Sub-Zero, Shang Tsung has a motley crew including the blood-hungry Mileena (<strong>Sisi Stringer</strong>), the four-armed monster Goro (a digital creation voiced by <strong>Angus Sampson</strong>), and the robotically enhanced Kabal, played by <strong>Daniel Nelson</strong> but voiced by <strong>Damon Herriman</strong>. Herriman opts to give Kabal a thick <em>New Yawk</em> wiseguy accent, which often makes him look and sound like drunken robot Bender from the animated series <em>Futurama</em>. It&#8217;s a choice, to say the least. As for fan-favorite Scorpion, well, don&#8217;t expect too much of him. After an eye-catching, head-stabbing prologue, he disappears for most of the movie. Pity, too, because actor <strong>Hiroyuki Sanada</strong> brings a real dignity to the film that most of his costars fail to capture.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If all of this sounds rather silly, that&#8217;s because it is. But <em>Mortal Kombat</em> refuses to admit that. It plays all of this as deadly serious and suffers because of it. Everything feels so mournful, so dour; funereal, even. If a film where a super-powered ninja turns a gush of blood into a frozen blood-knife can&#8217;t even be <em>fun</em>, what&#8217;s the point? It&#8217;s one thing to take this material seriously. It&#8217;s another to make the movie itself so damn serious.</p>\n<p>And to cap it all off, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> commits the sin that so many recent Hollywood adaptations of existing properties make these days – it&#8217;s all set up. Everything that happens here can be written off as exposition laying the groundwork for a <em>sequel</em>, where the <em>real</em> kombat can begin. It&#8217;s a ruse; a come-on; a side-show with a very loud barker out front. &#8220;We can&#8217;t show you <em>that</em> stuff just yet, but come back next time and we might!&#8221; The thing is, we&#8217;re all suckers enough to probably fall for it.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 5 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mortal-kombat-review/\">&#8216;Mortal Kombat&#8217; Review: This Underwhelming Video Game Adaptation is Anything But a Flawless Victory</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-XjPcx8NOh0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:01:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f94dc00a9b72e5cbbbc201a2430f0057","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-17-905_95bb116c1d068e75.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":29215,"destBytes":17532,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mortal-kombat-review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-17-905_95bb116c1d068e75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-35-45-464_e33167c3207a1041.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=-XjPcx8NOh0:qgzfOS-6xn0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-211_3a556fe7a1189ad5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/-XjPcx8NOh0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn86@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-35-50-297_12f79c25f4429ec7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317636},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","title":"‘Nomadland’ Sweeps 2021 Independent Spirit Awards, First TV Awards Handed to ‘I May Destroy You,’ ‘Unorthodox’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668059","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-668060\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nomadland-i-may-destroy-you-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"2021 spirit awards\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nomadland-i-may-destroy-you-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nomadland-i-may-destroy-you-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nomadland-i-may-destroy-you-768x329.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/nomadland-i-may-destroy-you.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>See you down the road at the Oscars, <strong><em>Nomadland</em></strong>. Chloé Zhao&#8217;s Western road drama became the unexpected front-runner during this year&#8217;s awards season, sweeping not only the independent circuit but every single major award.

href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/scariest-scene-ever/\"><b>Scariest Scene Ever</b></a><i>, a column dedicated to the most pulse-pounding moments in horror.</i> <i>In this edition:</i> <b>28 Days Later </b><i>relies on stakes and staging to draw out tension in its most intense scene.)</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The early aughts marked a substantial shift in the zombie subgenre. The back-to-back releases of Danny Boyle’s <i>28 Days Later</i> and Zack Snyder’s <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> remake introduced faster, meaner swarms of zombies that couldn’t be outmaneuvered quite as easily as their predecessors. While the former technically classifies as an outbreak feature rather than a zombie movie, <i>28 Days Later</i> bears all the hallmarks of a post-apocalypse zombie movie made famous by George A. Romero. No matter where you fall on the zombie debate, nearly all agree that Boyle changed the genre landscape with a kinetic horror film that brought poignancy and terror in equal measure.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No scene exemplifies the nail-biting intensity of <i>28 Days Later</i> quite like the stress-inducing flat tire that pushes the limits of a narrow escape. Boyle maximizes the suspense through expert staging, heightened emotions and sound, and already established stakes to deliver one of the most unforgettable moments in modern horror.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-667817\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><b>The Setup</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">A group of animal activists breaks into a lab in Cambridge, unwittingly setting free chimpanzees infected with an incurable “Rage Virus” that rapidly spreads across the country. Those infected lose their humanity and become lethally aggressive, and the epidemic causes societal collapse within a matter of weeks. Twenty-eight days after the initial outbreak, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma and finds himself alone in a deserted hospital. In the Alex Garland penned and Boyle-directed feature, allegory and drama get wrapped up in Jim’s perilous struggle to adapt to a new, post-apocalyptic world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><b>The Story So Far</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">After wandering the desolate streets of a once bustling city, Jim encounters the infected but gets saved by survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). They fill Jim in on the state of the country and accompany him to his parents’ house. He discovers they commit suicide, and infected neighbors bite Mark in an attack that night. Selena kills Mark before he turns, and the remaining pair depart for a safer place to stay. They spot Christmas lights twinkling on the balcony of an apartment building and make a harrowing trek up numerous flights of stairs with infected in tow. They find the apartment inhabited by friendly taxi driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter is Hannah (Megan Burns). The new foursome bond and a radio signal promising sanctuary motivate the group to embark on a road trip.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDbMqG0EObM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><b>The Scene</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Frank must drive the taxi through a dark tunnel filled with abandoned vehicles and dead bodies. Navigating around the macabre obstacles eventually results in a flat tire, forcing a tire change in the worst possible setting. While Frank and Hannah get to work, a nervous Jim keeps vigil. He hears a sound that pauses the maintenance; it quickly crescendos as a horde of screeching rats rush past them. They barely have enough time to pull Hannah out from under the car when Selena spies the first shadow of an infected barreling in their direction. They multiply in numbers and their screams match those by a panicked Jim and Selena. The crowd closes in just as Hannah finishes swapping out tires.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before this intense scene arrives, Boyle established stakes through more minor scaled attacks by the infected and the shocking demise of Mark. It set a precedence that survival isn’t guaranteed for even the most heroic and fit characters. Speed is of the essence against the fast-moving and seemingly tireless aggressors. The introduction to middle-aged Frank and his young teen daughter contradicts everything Jim has been taught about what it takes to survive. They begin their part in the narrative with lower survival odds and the expectation of added weight for Jim and Selena.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The dark, enclosed tunnel instills trepidation before even factoring in the outbreak. Only one way in and out creates claustrophobic dread, but then it’s magnified to a horrific degree with a makeshift graveyard of those that were unable to escape civilization’s ruin. Boyle exploits the natural unease the setting creates with frenetic camera movement and quick edits, cycling through wide shots of the group fumbling in the dark to close-ups of each character as they set about their tasks. The camera’s rapid pans as it follows Jim’s pacing makes his anxiety palpable.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then comes the sound, a soft rushing roar that builds to shrieking terror. The wave of rats heralds a rush of panic, but they serve as a foreboding harbinger of doom. The noise hushes to a lull long enough for the actual threat to emerge. A single silhouette in the distance gives way to dozens—their angry wails signal proximity. As the gap between the enemy and the protagonists shorten, pulse-pounding horror reaches a fever pitch. The tension gets drawn out to an uncomfortable degree.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Boyle toys with erratic pacing to maintain unpredictability. Jim’s journey toggles back and forth between moments of extreme stress and lulls of peaceful calm before the next wave. The lo-fi quality and Boyle’s dynamic direction give <i>28 Days Later</i> a gritty, present feel for this unique dystopia, but it also heightens the fear. The rapid, turbulent camera movements within the tire changing scene exacerbate the unease shaped by its eerie setting. The aural build ties it all together, matching the emotions of both characters and viewers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jim, Selena, Frank, and Hannah barely make it out of the tunnel alive by the skin of their teeth. A reprieve awaits at the other end, this time. Death comes swiftly and frequently in <i>28 Days Later</i>, as do the bursts of stark horror. Yet none of it comes close to shredded your nerves quite like this close call in a dark tunnel.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/scariest-scene-in-28-days-later/\">Danny Boyle&#8217;s &#8217;28 Days Later&#8217; Delivered One of the Most Stressful Scenes in Modern Horror</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/L-6RI4fGMeg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:00:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scariest-Scene-in-28-Days-Later-e1619102568542-700x326.jpeg","linkMd5":"70c774be4d25f753e9be83d36700a2bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-20-067_131a402c6d76da26.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":326,"sourceBytes":33886,"destBytes":18012,"author":"Meagan Navarro","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Scariest-Scene-in-28-Days-Later-e1619102568542-700x326.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-20-067_131a402c6d76da26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-35-45-283_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-207_24d5ed8f6b6f1626.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn17@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-853_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=L-6RI4fGMeg:SBEDBpxBJrU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn87@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-35-45-383_53bb0b0dc4f17e7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/L-6RI4fGMeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-35-45-184_2e8190f923fa037d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199317629}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:17","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:35:17 +0000","fetchMs":60,"handleMs":325,"totalMs":33732,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-032*","requestId":"09870f57362d4e928d48e575b95bf4fa_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":685244,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":85,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":85,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":3,"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx7":2,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx16":4,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx4":3,"myreaderx10":4,"myreaderx32":3,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx11":2,"myreaderx2":4,"myreaderx12":4,"myreaderx1":4,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":3,"myreaderx":4,"myreaderx25":2,"myreaderx27":4,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":3,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
