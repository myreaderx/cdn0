This marks the end of this last demonstration mission, which flew NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station on May 30, where they remained for two months prior to making the return trip on Sunday.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"space-exploration-technologies\">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Crew Dragon appears to have performed exactly as intended throughout the mission, handling the launch, ISS docking, undocking, de-orbit and splashdown in a fully automated process that kept the astronauts safe and secure throughout. This final phase included recovery of Behnken and Hurley at sea in the Gulf of Mexico using SpaceX&#8217;s GO Navigator recovery vessel, which went smoothly, with the capsule loaded onto Navigator around 3:18 PM EDT, and the hatch opened at roughly 4:00 PM EDT, and the crew exiting starting at around 4:06 PM EDT. There were a number of private vessels in the area (you can see them in the gif below), which is a violation of the security conditions, but SpaceX established a perimeter and continued, which is essentially the best they can do under these conditions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026257\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crew-dragon-navigator-load.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" /></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>With the successful completion of this mission, everything should be in place to allow for the full certification of Crew Dragon and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"falcon-19ff\">Falcon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> 9 as rated for human spaceflight according to NASA&#8217;s exactly standards – provided a final, thorough review of the entire mission from start to finish doesn&#8217;t reveal any remaining issues that need tidying up. Again, based on what we&#8217;ve seen, it looks like a more or less picture-perfect mission for Demo-2 from start to finish, so I wouldn&#8217;t expect any major barriers to certification. Note that this is also the first human splashdown in 45 years – when the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/45-years-ago-splashdown-of-third-and-final-skylab-crew\">final Skylab crew did that in 1974</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Jj0mwzMQJ5\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/spacex-makes-history-with-successful-first-human-space-launch/\">SpaceX makes history with successful first human space launch</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;SpaceX makes history with successful first human space launch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/spacex-makes-history-with-successful-first-human-space-launch/embed/#?secret=Jj0mwzMQJ5\" data-secret=\"Jj0mwzMQJ5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>That means that the next step for Crew Dragon is to begin regular service as America&#8217;s primary source of transportation to and from the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-station-6ec2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"space-station-6ec2\">Space Station <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.

The Commercial Crew program was designed to provide just that, but rather than having NASA responsible for the launch and transportation spacecraft as with the Shuttle, it&#8217;s partnering with private companies to offer it commercial service for those flights – SpaceX is now the first to complete the testing and development program, and Boeing is in process of becoming a second commercial ride provider for NASA to rely on.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026263\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg 1922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=1536,844 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-4.07.53-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>NASA wants to ensure continued access to the ISS, and is also hoping to save money long-term and enable the commercial space industry by sharing rides aboard the Crew Dragon and Boeing&#8217;s Starliner with commercial astronauts.

He&#8217;ll be based in London and will work closely with the VC&#8217;s teams in Europe and the U.S. More broadly, Sequoia is expanding its presence in Europe to better support its portfolio companies on the ground here and to build relationships with the most promising founders in the region as early as possible.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as mentioned, Robson adds to Sequoia&#8217;s first European partner recruit. <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/sequoia-welcomes-luciana-lixandru-as-our-first-partner-in-europe-ae9261c72deb\">Lixandru was poached from Accel</a> and is best-known for leading the firm&#8217;s Series A in UiPath, and also worked with Deliveroo, Miro, and Tessian, amongst other successful upstart companies in Europe.</p>\n<p><em>Article updated with Sequoia&#8217;s confirmation and additional details.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/phhKeVbQyKQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 17:21:31 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-18.15.27.png?w=718","linkMd5":"75e820c2a37ea77dae06ceec761938f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432477380_64739ad4b6b52020.webp","author":"Steve O'Hear","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388084_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432476849_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476845_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn50@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432476848_25d6d2541af5e9eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=phhKeVbQyKQ:5bVvzz92eYU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn61@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596432476828_e16fb1e1012dfe51.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn86@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432476838_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/phhKeVbQyKQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn74@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432476805_963919498f2894e0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 13:26:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 05:26:24","title":"The Station: ADA turns 30, Panasonic’s new battery tech and delivery (data) woes","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026072","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters\">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Saturday in your inbox</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>\n<p>Before we get into all the mobility news and analysis of the week I wanted to flag an upcoming event that might be of interest to the budding entrepreneurs out there.

Cities learned a thing or two during that first wave of electric scooters that hit the streets a couple of years ago. This time around, city leaders are placing more restrictions on e-scooters and limiting the number of companies allowed to operate in an urban area. That&#8217;s an important change, and one that raises the stakes for scooter companies.</p>\n<p>First there was Paris, which awarded Dott, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/limebike\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"limebike\">Lime <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Tier permits to operate in the city. Now, Chicago <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/escooter-share-pilot-project.html\">has issued permits</a> to Bird, Lime and Spin for its second pilot program. Chicago is limiting scooter use to 15 mph between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. And there are few areas, like the Lakefront Trail, where scooters are prohibited.</p>\n<p>Each scooter company is limited to no more than 3,333 devices, 50% of which must be deployed with an equity priority area. New to the second pilot is a requirement that all e-scooters must have locks that require riders to secure the scooter to a fixed object to end their trip.</p>\n<p>On a side note, Lyft did not apply for the scooter permit. I asked Lyft, &#8216;why not?&#8217; The company said it&#8217;s focusing on its expansion of Divvy, Chicago&#8217;s bike-sharing system. The city made Lyft the exclusive operator of Divvy last year and now starting to expand. The Divvy system will eventually include 16,500 bikes and 800 stations. Here&#8217;s what Lyft had to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have spent the better part of the last year working with communities in Chicago&#8217;s South and West Sides to prepare for new stations and ebikes. In order to prioritize our work with CDOT to expand Divvy and provide the highest possible experience for Divvy members, Lyft opted out of submitting an application that mirrored requests of this year&#8217;s scooter pilot. We are dedicated to the long-term success of micromobility in Chicago, and we look forward to future opportunities to work with the City to combine the benefits of bikes and scooters into one Divvy membership.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>In other micromobbin&#8217; news &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bird\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bird\">Bird</strong> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> said Friday it is launching its shared e-scooters in Yonkers, New York as an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; operator. The word &#8220;exclusive&#8221; is one of those buzzwords that is tossed around a lot so I asked what this actually means. And Bird says it is the only company that will be issued a permit to operate in Yonkers. So there you have it. The company&#8217;s fleet of next-generation Bird Two scooters will be available to rent starting August 10.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2025869\" style=\"width: 2064px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2025869\" class=\"wp-image-2025869 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg\" alt=\"bird-Yonkers scooters\" width=\"2054\" height=\"1410\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg 2054w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1406 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bird-Yonkers-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2054px) 100vw, 2054px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2025869\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bird</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Revel</strong>, the shared moped startup, has shut down operations in New York City following two deaths within days of each other.

I use the term &#8220;cast&#8221; because it&#8217;s not all sunshine, roses and rainbows for the delivery industry or its users.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in demand for delivery services. It has also helped propel unprecedented consolidation as companies like Uber seek profitability.</p>\n<p>There are challenges though, including an area that perhaps deserves A LOT MORE ATTENTION. I&#8217;m talking about data and privacy. Delivery companies, which includes a growing number of autonomous and teleoperated services, collect a ton of personal data from its customers. The kind of valuable data, like home addresses and credit card numbers, that are sold on the dark web.</p>\n<p>This week, our cybersecurity editor Zack Whittaker reported on two data breaches involving delivery companies. The first was Drizly,<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> </span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/online-liquor-store-drizly-just-landed-34-5-million-in-fresh-funding/\">one of the biggest</a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> online alcohol delivery services in the U.S. and Canada, raising over $68 million to date. Drizly told </span>customers a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/drizly-data-breach/\">hacker &#8220;obtained&#8221; some customer data</a>. The hacker took customer email addresses, date-of-birth, passwords hashed using the stronger bcrypt algorithm and, in some cases, delivery addresses.</p>\n<p>As many as 2.5 million Drizly accounts are believed to have been stolen. Here&#8217;s something to take note of, Drizy told TechCrunch that no financial information was compromised. However, a listing on a dark web marketplace from a well-known seller of stolen data claims otherwise. TechCrunch, of course, didn&#8217;t link to it. But Whittaker did take and share a screenshot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2026061 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1352\" height=\"876\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg 1352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-01-at-10.19.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1352px) 100vw, 1352px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, online shopping and delivery service Instacart is blaming customers who reused passwords for a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/instacart-data-theft-two-factor/\">recent spate of account breaches</a>. The data breach compromised 270,000 Instacart customers. The company published a statement late on Thursday saying its investigation showed that Instacart “was not compromised or breached,” but pointed to credential stuffing, where hackers take lists of usernames and passwords stolen from other breached sites and brute-force their way into other accounts.</p>\n<p>Customers can&#8217;t shoulder all of the responsibility. Instacart, as Whittaker notes, still does not support two-factor authentication, which — if customers had enabled — would have prevented the account hacks to begin with.</p>\n<p><strong>Other delivery news &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flipkart</strong>, which is owned by Walmart, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/indias-flipkart-launch-hyperlocal-delivery-service-flipkart-quick/\">launched a hyperlocal service</a> in suburbs of Bangalore, four years after the e-commerce group abruptly concluded its previous foray into this category.</p>\n<p>The new service called Flipkart Quick uses the company&#8217;s supply chain infrastructure and a new location mapping technology framework to deliver within 90 minutes to customers more than 2,000 products across grocery, perishables, smartphones, electronics accessories and stationary items.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s electric</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1896228 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png\" alt=\"the station electric vehicles1\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Remember the days when electric vehicle news was relegated to Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt? Times have changed and, well, stayed the same. Tesla still dominates the headlines and this week wasn&#8217;t any different. (more on them later). But now, there are dozens of other electric vehicle models coming to market. The upshot: charging infrastructure is becoming more important. (Hey, not everyone has a garage).</p>\n<p>This week, GM and EVgo announced plans to add more than 2,700 new fast chargers. The rollout, which will take five years, will triple the size of the EVgo network. The first of these new EVgo fast charging stations will be available to customers starting early 2021.</p>\n<p>The companies are targeting high-traffic areas like grocery stores, retail outlets, entertainment centers, areas where people typically spend 15 to 30 minutes. The stations, which will be powered by renewable energy, will feature new charging technology with 100 to 350-kilowatt capabilities, the companies said.</p>\n<p>The charging partnership follows a numerous announcements from GM around its electric vehicle strategy. Earlier this week, GM said <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/gm-starts-construction-on-the-cornerstone-of-its-ev-strategy/\">steel construction has started</a> on the nearly 3-million-square-foot factory that will mass produce Ultium battery cells and packs. The Ultium battery, along with a modular propulsion system and electric vehicle platform, is the cornerstone of GM’ strategy to bring 20 electric vehicles to market by 2023.</p>\n<p>GM recently released a video of its upcoming <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/the-hummer-ev-is-shaping-up-to-be-gms-electric-answer-to-the-ford-bronco-and-tesla-cybertruck/\">GMC Hummer EV</a> and next week plans to reveal the Cadillac LYRIQ.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2026064\" style=\"width: 1392px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2026064\" class=\"wp-image-2026064 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg\" alt=\"GM and EVgo charging\" width=\"1382\" height=\"922\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg 1382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GM-and-EVgo4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1382px) 100vw, 1382px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2026064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM/EVgo</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Other electric news this week &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BMW</strong> said it will offer the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/bmw-to-sell-all-electric-versions-of-its-5-series-sedan-and-x1-suv/\">all-electric versions</a> of X1 compact SUV and the 5 Series as part of the German automaker’s plans to have 25 electrified models in its portfolio by 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Electric Brands</strong> is working on a VW Bus-inspired EV called the eBussy, via <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/35104/adorable-ebussy-ev-is-the-best-volkswagen-bus-not-built-by-vw\">The Drive</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Fisker Inc.</strong> revealed in a presentation that was filed with the SEC that a &#8220;cornerstone agreement&#8221; with Volkswagen has been delayed, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan\">the Verge reported</a>.

Lidar, a sensor that gets a lot of attention, will be on the vehicle. But I was struck by the number of radar sensors on the Air. There will be five radars in all, giving the vehicle 360 degrees of radar coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Panasonic</strong> revealed to TechCrunch this week that it developed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/panasonic-boosts-energy-density-trims-cobalt-in-new-2170-battery-cell-for-tesla/\">new battery technology</a> for the &#8220;2170&#8221; lithium-ion cells it produces and supplies to Tesla, a change that improves energy density by 5% and reduces costly cobalt content. The new, higher energy dense 2170 cells will be produced by Panasonic at Tesla&#8217;s factory in Sparks, Nevada. Improvements on the battery tech will continue with a 20% improvement in energy density over the next five years and a goal to be cobalt free.</p>\n<p><strong>Rivian&#8217;s</strong> retail strategy is starting to emerge. The company has said it will try and repurpose existing buildings for its stores, when possible. This week, the company said it is pursuing the purchase of the historic Laguna Beach South Coast Cinema.

All thanks to Tim Hortons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;O<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ur MVP was a chicken nugget. It worked out to be about $3,000 per pound… Which is obviously not a lucrative business model. Given that the aims was to produce something price comparable to meat,&#8221; said Anderon-Brown. &#8220;We shifted to focus on a new medium that would be economically viable. Originally we intended it for something that just we used. We didn’t realize at first the novelty of our product and how beneficial it would be to the industry. About eight months ago we decided to pivot and make that growth medium our product.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Now, as it gets ready to leave the Y Combinator accelerator program, the company has some paid contracts in place and will be rolling out the first couple of pilot product lines of its cell growth material for shipment within the next month.</p>\n<p>The potential demand for the company&#8217;s product is huge. Alpha Meats, Shiok Meat, Finless Foods, Memphis Meats, Meatable, Mosa Meat, Aleph Farms, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/future-meat-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"future-meat-technologies\">Future Meat Technologies, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Lab Farm Foods, and Eaat, are all companies developing lab grown alternatives to meat and fish. All told, these companies have raised well over $200 million. Some of the biggest names in traditional meat production like Tyson Foods are investing in meat alternatives.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2026210\" style=\"width: 713px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2026210\" class=\"wp-image-2026210 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"703\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg 703w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2026210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: Getty Images/<a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?assettype=image&#38;family=creative&#38;license=rf&#38;photographer=VectorMine&#38;sort=best#license\">VectorMine</a></p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;It’s about getting the price at scale. The companies that are using smaller volumes are bringing it down 10 to 100 times cheaper. We can do that. But our superpower is producing the growth medium at scale and doing it 1,000 times cheaper,&#8221; said Matt Anderson-Brown. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re talking about $2 to $3 per liter at scale.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Future Fields&#8217; founders didn&#8217;t say much about the technology that they&#8217;re using, except to say that they&#8217;re genetically modifying a specific organism by inserting the genetic code for specific protein production into their unidentified cell line to produce different growth factors.</p>\n<p>The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-alberta\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"university-of-alberta\">University of Alberta <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> isn&#8217;t unique in its development of a<a href=\"https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/research/innovation/accelerator/accelerator-companies\"> Health Accelerator Program</a>, but its equity-free approach allows startups and would-be bio-engineering entrepreneurs an opportunity to develop their businesses without fear of dilution.</p>\n<p>Future Fields has already raised a small, pre-seed round of $480,000 from a group of undisclosed angel investors and the <a href=\"https://www.gogrow.co/\">Grow Agrifood Tech Accelerator</a> out of Singapore.</p>\n<p>And company has the capacity to produce a few hundred liters of its growth factor, according to Gafour, and is working on plans to scale up production to hit tens of thousands of liters per month over the next year.</p>\n<p>For Gafour and his compatriots, the cellular agriculture industry has already reached an inflection point, and the next steps are less about scientific discovery and radical innovation and more about iteration and commercialization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the inclusion of a growth media solution, the core pieces are in place, and now it&#8217;s a matter of understanding the efficiencies in being able to scale it up,&#8221; said Gafour.</p>\n<p>Still, there are other components that need to be developed for the industry to truly bring down costs to a point where it can compete with traditional meat. Companies still need to develop a scaffolding to support the growth of protein cells into the muscle and fatty tissues that give meat its flavor. Bioreactor design needs to improve as well, according to Matt Anderson-Baron. &#8220;It&#8217;s the wild west. There&#8217;s so many things still to be done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And there are many companies working on these technologies as well. Glycosan, Lyopor and Prellis are all working on building tissue scaffolding that can be used for animal organ development.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The vision oif our company was to accelerate this industry and move the industry along,&#8221; said Jalene Anderson-Baron. &#8220;At first we didn’t realize the potential of our technology. We thought that everyone would overcome that roadblock around the same time. As we were speaking with other companies and speaking with investors who had been in touch with other companies, we realized this was the key piece to move the industry forward.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/rngLKb59CAo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 14:30:34 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-6.40.36-AM.png","linkMd5":"4de90777c21a0076596001e66c155579","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432388409_39f0de342672ad0a.webp","author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-02-at-6.40.36-AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432388409_39f0de342672ad0a.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-857768676.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn98@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432477923_f4b12e93331789a1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388084_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432476849_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476845_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596432476852_dcfe50ff189ad39a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=rngLKb59CAo:EEyTQZsO8Bk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn82@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596432476825_636634b476fd77d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn86@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432476838_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/rngLKb59CAo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476717_a021f8d594204794.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 13:26:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 05:26:24","title":"Microsoft pursuing TikTok purchase by September 15th, may invite U.S. investors to deal","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026272","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/\">posted a statement</a> today on its corporate blog that says it will continue discussions on a potential TikTok purchase in the U.S.. As a part of the statement, it says that it may invite other &#8220;American investors&#8221; to participate on a minority basis.</p>\n<p>The company says that this is a result of conversations between CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/satya-nadella\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"satya-nadella\">Satya Nadella <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and President Trump.

If Satya has engaged Trump directly then there could be light at the end of this possibility tunnel after all.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Following a conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald J. Trump, Microsoft is prepared to continue discussions to explore a purchase of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in the United States,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Microsoft says that in any case their discussions about acquisition from ByteDance would complete no later than September 15th, 2020 and that it is keeping discussion ongoing with the President and the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>The purchase would cover TikTok operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand and would result in Microsoft owning and operating it in those markets. One region not mentioned here is India, which could provide an interesting future opportunity for both companies if this deal goes down. If Microsoft can position itself as a steward of TikTok it removes the data issue (if not the over-arching national tensions between China and India).</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, data and privacy protections ​make an appearance, with Microsoft assuring that &#8220;the operating model for the service would be built to ensure transparency to users as well as appropriate security oversight by governments in these countries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok’s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The historical here (if you can call it that because this whole thing has been the work of but a couple weeks tops) is that Microsoft is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/as-threats-to-the-company-mount-tiktok-pushes-back/\">pursuing TikTok because ByteDance needs to divest it</a> in order to keep it running in the U.S., one of its biggest markets. That need arose when the White House decided that it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/bytedance-and-microsoft-offer-a-deal-to-allow-tiktok-to-remain-in-the-u-s-per-report/\">important to make a stink about data sovereignty</a> with relation to the China-owned network. Even though social services of many kinds including Facebook, Twitter, Google and others offer aggregate data through advertising brokerages that can make deals globally, the opportunity presented itself to run up the anti-China flag and take aim at an easy target &#8212; an app that undoubtedly has access to an enormous amount of behavioral data on U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/is-sarah-cooper-the-reason-donald-trump-wants-to-ban-tik-tok\">fun Twitter theory</a> that Trump just got pissed at a comedian who got very popular making fun of him on the platform.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now we have another tock in the TikTok ticking clock. We&#8217;ll reach out to all parties but this looks like it may be the final result of this weekend&#8217;s flurry of news on this. We&#8217;ll see you Monday morning.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/45yXZypIxuI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 23:47:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tiktok-tic-tacs-color.jpg?w=687","linkMd5":"8ec9d6ed34f201ea2e8da8b3bd31bf3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn33@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432476828_e68958807d8d2c09.webp","author":"Matthew Panzarino","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388084_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432476849_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476845_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596432476839_eb6139dc460d7e8f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=45yXZypIxuI:9qablyv4gfs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn97@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596432476849_c6637f32f4d7334f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn86@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432476838_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/45yXZypIxuI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596432476709_11e49c9fdaff1cde.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 13:26:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 05:26:24","title":"Pompeo says U.S. may take action against TikTok and other Chinese tech companies “shortly”","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026285","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Days after President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> he could use an executive order to ban <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\">TikTok</a> from the United States, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the administration is &#8220;closing in on a solution and I think you’ll see the president’s announcement shortly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an interview on Fox News’ &#8220;Sunday Morning Futures&#8221;

Marc Rubio, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45373b5e-0d7d-4478-9c72-525cfd541ec5\">told the Financial Times </a>last week that TikTok still needs to answer questions about where its data is store and how it is protected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until TikTok’s owners—regardless of who that might be—can answer these basic questions and get its story straight, I remain concerned about the company’s activities and reported ties to China,&#8221; Rubio said.</p>\n<h3>Beyond TikTok</h3>\n<p>The day before Pompeo’s Fox News interview, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/510176-navarro-dont-fall-for-message-from-tiktok-lobbyists-puppet-ceo\">told Fox News</a> that the Trump administration is also reviewing &#8220;any kind of software that sends the information for Americans back to servers in China.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pompeo also suggested that the U.S. government may take action against more Chinese technology companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it’s TikTok or <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/we-chat\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"we-chat\">WeChat—there <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> are countless more, as Peter Navarro said, are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus, could be their facial recognition pattern, information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends,&#8221; he alleged.</p>\n<p>Pompeo added that Trump will &#8220;take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party,&#8221; but did not elaborate on what that will entail or what companies might be affected.</p>\n<p>But one of them may be WeChat, owned by Tencent. The U.S. government <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/\">said last month that it may restrict WeChat in America</a>, even though the version of WeChat available in the U.S. has far less features than the one in China, where it is used for payments, bookings e-commerce and other functions in addition to messaging.</p>\n<p>While WeChat is ubiquitous in China, its user base in the U.S. is much smaller, and it is primarily used by members of the Chinese diaspora and foreign businesses that have operations or a connection in China.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

On a human level, we’ve had to adjust to a new way of living. We’ve started to accept these changes and figure out how to live our lives under these new pandemic rules. While humans settle in, AI is struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>The issue with AI training in 2020 is that, all of a sudden, we’ve changed our social and cultural norms. The truths that we have taught these algorithms are often no longer actually true. With visual AI specifically, we’re asking it to immediately interpret the new way we live with updated context that it doesn’t have yet.</p>\n<p>Algorithms are still adjusting to new visual queues and trying to understand how to accurately identify them. As visual AI catches up, we also need a renewed importance on routine updates in the AI training process so inaccurate training datasets and preexisting open-source models can be corrected.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Computer vision models are struggling to appropriately tag depictions of the new scenes or situations we find ourselves in during the COVID-19 era. Categories have shifted. For example, say there’s an image of a father working at home while his son is playing. AI is still categorizing it as &#8220;leisure&#8221; or &#8220;relaxation.&#8221; It is not identifying this as ‘&#8221;work&#8221; or &#8220;office,&#8221; despite the fact that working with your kids next to you is the very common reality for many families during this time.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2025145\" style=\"width: 520px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2025145\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2025145\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2025145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Westend61/Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>On a more technical level, we physically have different pixel depictions of our world. At Getty Images, we’ve been training AI to &#8220;see.&#8221; This means algorithms can identify images and categorize them based on the pixel makeup of that image and decide what it includes. Rapidly changing how we go about our daily lives means that we’re also shifting what a category or tag (such as &#8220;cleaning&#8221;) entails.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way — cleaning may now include wiping down surfaces that already visually appear clean. Algorithms have been previously taught that to depict cleaning, there needs to be a mess. Now, this looks very different. Our systems have to be retrained to account for these redefined category parameters.</p>\n<p>This relates on a smaller scale as well. Someone could be grabbing a door knob with a small wipe or cleaning their steering wheel while sitting in their car. What was once a trivial detail now holds importance as people try to stay safe. We need to catch these small nuances so it’s tagged appropriately. Then AI can start to understand our world in 2020 and produce accurate outputs.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2025147\" style=\"width: 519px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2025147\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2025147\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2025147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Chee Gin Tan/Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>Another issue for AI right now is that machine learning algorithms are still trying to understand how to identify and categorize faces with masks. Faces are being detected as solely the top half of the face, or as two faces — one with the mask and a second of only the eyes. This creates inconsistencies and inhibits accurate usage of face detection models.</p>\n<p>One path forward is to retrain algorithms to perform better when given solely the top portion of the face (above the mask). The mask problem is similar to classic face detection challenges such as someone wearing sunglasses or detecting the face of someone in profile. Now masks are commonplace as well.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2025148\" style=\"width: 495px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2025148\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2025148\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"485\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2025148\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rodger Shija/EyeEm/Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>What this shows us is that computer vision models still have a long way to go before truly being able to &#8220;see&#8221; in our ever-evolving social landscape. The way to counter this is to build robust datasets. Then, we can train computer vision models to account for the myriad different ways a face may be obstructed or covered.</p>\n<p>At this point, we’re expanding the parameters of what the algorithm sees as a face — be it a person wearing a mask at a grocery store, a nurse wearing a mask as part of their day-to-day job or a person covering their face for religious reasons.</p>\n<p>As we create the content needed to build these robust datasets, we should be aware of potentially increased unintentional bias. While some bias will always exist within AI, we now see imbalanced datasets depicting our new normal. For example, we are seeing more images of white people wearing masks than other ethnicities.</p>\n<p>This may be the result of strict stay-at-home orders where photographers have limited access to communities other than their own and are unable to diversify their subjects. It may be due to the ethnicity of the photographers choosing to shoot this subject matter. Or, due to the level of impact COVID-19 has had on different regions. Regardless of the reason, having this imbalance will lead to algorithms being able to more accurately detect a white person wearing a mask than any other race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p>Data scientists and those who build products with models have an increased responsibility to check for the accuracy of models in light of shifts in social norms. Routine checks and updates to training data and models are key to ensuring quality and robustness of models — now more than ever. If outputs are inaccurate, data scientists can quickly identify them and course correct.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth mentioning that our current way of living is here to stay for the foreseeable future. Because of this, we must be cautious about the open-source datasets we’re leveraging for training purposes. Datasets that can be altered, should. Open-source models that cannot be altered need to have a disclaimer so it’s clear what projects might be negatively impacted from the outdated training data.</p>\n<p>Identifying the new context we’re asking the system to understand is the first step toward moving visual AI forward. Then we need more content. More depictions of the world around us — and the diverse perspectives of it. As we’re amassing this new content, take stock of new potential biases and ways to retrain existing open-source datasets. We all have to monitor for inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Persistence and dedication to retraining computer vision models is how we’ll bring AI into 2020.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yoyiYwuJKtk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 15:00:01 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg","linkMd5":"62c4dbbc847cf102104a58a8302aa242","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388144_63408b831d7c8889.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1134461939-170667a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388144_63408b831d7c8889.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1219727445-170667a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn90@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596432476941_7c51dc1f51c3788f.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gettyimages-1223070989-170667a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476893_7dd651766828a19f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432388084_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596432476849_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476845_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn62@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596432476887_805bf023bdf82f12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yoyiYwuJKtk:0ZcBRHyfuhA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596432476832_51e775d66c861355.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn86@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596432476838_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yoyiYwuJKtk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn65@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596432476687_f52cfdf187de2886.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 13:26:27","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 05:26:27","feedId":26,"fetchDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 05:26:27 +0000","fetchMs":23,"handleMs":3678,"totalMs":100055,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"34.254.8.67","hostName":"europe-016.herokuapp.com","requestId":"c2abb3c8940441d5ab310fc4ddd74811_26","bgimgsTotal":8,"bgimgsGithubTotal":8,"articlesImgsTotal":44,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":44},"extra4":{"start":1596432384027,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":158,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":3678,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":2206,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":3477,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":5233,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":44,"extra6":44,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null]}
