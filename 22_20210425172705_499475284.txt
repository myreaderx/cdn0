He told reporters he had &#34;visceral urges&#34; to leave the cave, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56875801\">according to the BBC.</a></p><p>But other volunteers felt differently, with two-thirds saying they wanted to stay in the cave for longer.</p><p>&#34;For once in our lives, it was as if we could press pause,&#34; Marina LanÃ§on, one of seven women to take part in the experiment, said, according to the Guardian. &#34;For once in our lives, we had time and could stop to live and do our tasks. It was great.&#34;</p><p>However, LanÃ§on did admit to feeling happy to be outdoors and hear birdsong again.</p><p>French and Swiss scientists at the Human Adaption Institute monitored the volunteers closely during their time in the cave. They would regularly check the team&#39;s sleeping patterns, social interactions, and cognitive functions via sensors.</p><p>The volunteers&#39; brain activity was also collected before and after they entered the cave.</p><p>The scientists behind the project say it will help them understand how people can adapt to extreme living conditions and being in complete isolation.</p><p>&#34;Our future as humans on this planet will evolve,&#34; Clot said after emerging from the cave. &#34;We must learn to better understand how our brains are capable of finding new solutions, whatever the situation.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/france-group-spends-40-days-in-cave-with-no-clocks-or-sunlight-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_7pk12RAPNM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 15:40:53 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60858abe3f0560001881be92?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"0d45509d206fa8635238dc1cd5b23693","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-46-931_ef0eaea8089dcd94.webp","destWidth":1278,"destHeight":958,"sourceBytes":80994,"destBytes":80994,"author":"jkossoff@businessinsider.com (Julian Kossoff)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60858abe3f0560001881be92?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-46-931_ef0eaea8089dcd94.webp","https://i.insider.com/60857c380da8f4001803353e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-56-773_f0a1da89a7d2db5a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/25/17-27-03-772_802112876385c107.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-56-220_6cb0597d9491f6b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_7pk12RAPNM:s-qD4Zx8SAs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn63@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-56-832_f232f83c0d42a97e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_7pk12RAPNM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-27-01-949_d4d9244ba26bd108.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596239},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"Here's why a jump in capital gains taxes doesn't spell the end for stock market gains, according to the world's largest wealth manager","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-capital-gains-tax-biden-congress-assets-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb161e11441925c0e5d7bca?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Traders NYSE green\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lucas Jackson/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Stocks are able to show positive returns even with higher capital gains taxes, said UBS Global Wealth Management. </li>\n<li>President Joe Biden may propose nearly doubling the tax rate to 39.6% on profit made from asset sales. </li>\n<li>LPL Financial said stock performance after a capital gains tax hike is a &#34;mixed bag&#34;

That rate would be added to the 3.8% tax on net investment income that&#39;s tied to Obamacare, which would bring the proposed tax rate to 43.4%. The current capital gains tax now stands at 20%. </p><p>If it transpires, the proposal &#34;breaks new ground&#34; in terms of taxation of investment income, which tends to be treated more favorably than ordinary income, said UBS in a Friday note. It said its base case foresees a capital gains tax rate of 28% following negotiations with Congress.</p><p>&#34;While we can&#39;t rule out some additional modest equity market volatility as investors react to this proposal, we think it will be very short-lived,&#34; said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in the research note. </p><p>He said the last time capital gains taxes went up was in 2013 when they rose by nearly 9 percentage points.</p><p>&#34;Yet stocks rose 30% that year. In addition, we find no correlation between capital gains tax rates and equity market valuations,&#34; said Haefele.</p><p>The capital gains tax on top earners was raised to 20% from 15% but including the Obamacare sur-tax, the rate went up to 23.8%.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-buy-amid-us-economic-deceleration-global-boom-gs-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 45 &#39;global-facing&#39; stocks set to benefit from the worldwide growth boom as the pace in the US begins to slow</a></em></p><p>Haefele said price-to-earnings multiples have been as low as 10 times when the capital gains tax rate was 20%, and as high as 18 times when it was 35%. &#34;Ultimately, other factors such as the outlook for economic growth, monetary policy, and interest rates are much more powerful drivers of equity market returns and valuations.&#34;</p><p>There are still questions about the potentially higher tax, including if it&#39;s retroactive or if it would start early in 2022, Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said in a Friday note.</p><p>&#34;If it is in 2022, people have some massive gains they might want to book now instead of later,&#34; he said, adding that the rate doesn&#39;t appear headed to 39.6% &#34;as the Democrats are likely starting high and there will be some back and forth as the sausage is made.&#34; <br><br>Detrick said stocks &#34;did really well&#34; for the next six months after increases in capital gains tax rates in 2013 and 1987. His note displayed a table showing <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&p_500_500\">S&#38;P 500 index</a> returns, and there was a 24% gain in 1987 six months after the tax climbed to 28% from 20%. <br><br>&#34;Of course, stocks did poorly after the hikes of 1969 and 1976, so we have a mixed bag,&#34; said Detrick. In the six months after tax hikes, S&#38;P 500 returns fell 20.4% in 1969 and dropped 5.6% in 1976. <br><br>&#34;But could it be as simple as those times weren&#39;t the best for the economy, while in 1987 and 2013 the economy was healthy?&#34; For now, we&#39;d side with an improving economy and accommodative Fed will take the higher coming taxes in stride,&#34; said Detrick.</p><p>UBS&#39; Hafele said many families will not be subject to the proposed higher levy. He also said deferral of  capital gains taxes to years where taxable income is below the proposed $1 million threshold could allow subjected taxpayers to continue paying the current long-term capital gains tax rate of 23.8%. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-capital-gains-tax-biden-congress-assets-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nXgrR59m2L8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 14:10:51 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f089f9e1918242bd51bf826?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"52de4872df198e8af206bd68a75058c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn87@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-54-552_89855daf3f1dfe9c.webp","destWidth":3847,"destHeight":2885,"sourceBytes":246234,"destBytes":246234,"author":"insider@insider.com (Carla MozÃ©e)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5eb161e11441925c0e5d7bca?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/25/17-26-55-395_7438ff094ce158ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-56-216_0513ecc150a499dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn27@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-55-567_44dfed938c9d2091.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nXgrR59m2L8:3LI0i7Zgy_Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-27-03-005_e5750bd7175463f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nXgrR59m2L8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn59@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-27-03-831_c7509c65d7d39848.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596239},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"China plans to land its Chang'e 6 lunar lander by 2024.

According to a Chinese legend, the mythical god symbolically carries a legacy of defense, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3130918/china-names-its-mars-rover-zhu-rong-after-mythical-god-war\">South China Morning Post reported.</a></p><p>&#34;Zhu Rong is revered as the earliest god of fire in traditional Chinese culture, symbolising the use of fire to illuminate the earth and bring light,&#34; the space administration said in a statement on Saturday. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/china-in-space-asteroid-defence-moon-mission-mars-rover-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/y-_PmDI0tL4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:28:21 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60855a753f0560001881be7a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8f39628a5826b5147a07457b9f2621d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-36-696_b67c412929e80792.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":80198,"destBytes":80198,"author":"ztayeb@businessinsider.com (Zahra Tayeb)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60855a753f0560001881be7a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-36-696_b67c412929e80792.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-02-225_81dda8cef1b71089.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-56-736_9fd48e88b08e9b92.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=y-_PmDI0tL4:vql2JITBcIk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-57-525_ed49bffbd0f47093.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/y-_PmDI0tL4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn53@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-54-917_19f5af1efe9af8ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596220},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"Real-estate agents are finding success by turning to TikTok: 'It doesn't seem to matter if the place is $2,000 or $600,000'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-agents-on-tiktok-advertise-rental-listings-virtual-showings-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6081d1dc1041d50019f2db49?format=jpeg\" alt=\"brooklyn real estate better than manhattan 2x1\" height=\"1250\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Skye Gould/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Real-estate agents and brands alike are leveraging TikTok for sales and rentals amid the pandemic.</li>\n<li>Insider spoke to real-estate agents about how the platform has changed their business.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>In the wake of the pandemic forcing their business online, some real-estate agents took to an unlikely platform - TikTok. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cash.jordan?lang=en\">Cash Jordan</a>, a New York City-based agent, has over 600,000 followers on the platform and 14.2 million likes. In the past year, he&#39;s shown million-dollar townhomes and $2,500 two-bedrooms, and he says his only regret about TikTok is that he didn&#39;t get on the platform sooner. </p><p>As the pandemic pushed realtors into the digital space, some of them adapted into TikTok&#39;s signature short-form video format. Jordan says that the real-estate market, &#34;this dinosaur of an industry,&#34; had to adapt and go online. And TikTok, despite its reputation as an app for teenagers, has been a boon to business.</p><p>After New York City shut down, Jordan began posting videos across platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, and saw a huge response. </p><p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem to matter if the place is $2,000 or $600,000, somebody out there on TikTok is big enough and YouTube is big enough that people see it and are interested,&#34; Jordan said.</p><p>Jordan estimated using TikTok had doubled his number of clients.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cash.jordan/video/6952150810922945798\" data-video-id=\"6952150810922945798\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@cash.jordan\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cash.jordan\">@cash.jordan</a> <p>Cheap Apartment!  <a title=\"nycapartment\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycapartment\">##nycapartment</a> <a title=\"nycapartmentcheck\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycapartmentcheck\">##nycapartmentcheck</a> <a title=\"apartmenttour\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/apartmenttour\">##apartmenttour</a> <a title=\"nycapartmenthunting\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycapartmenthunting\">##nycapartmenthunting</a> <a title=\"mycrib\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mycrib\">##mycrib</a></p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"â¬ original sound - Cash Jordan\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6952150708015745798\">â¬ original sound - Cash Jordan</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script></div><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thenycagent?lang=en\">Madison Sutton</a>, who posts on TikTok as @thenycagent, has 95,700 followers and has amassed 1.5 million total likes across her videos. Sutton, who works for Highline, found herself concerned about the safety and efficiency of in-person showings. So in October of last year, she turned to TikTok. &#34;Where else in New York City can you see ten apartments in ten minutes?&#34; she asked.</p><p>Sutton, like Jordan, focuses primarily on rentals, and she says business is &#34;five or six times heavier&#34; compared to this time last year. Jordan films and edits his videos himself, and Sutton either uses POV shots or enlists her mother for help with filming. The videos are part apartment tour, part conversation. And it&#39;s intentional: agents like Sutton and Jordan are looking to forge a connection with viewers.</p><p>Jordan told Insider about a client who&#39;d been deciding between an apartment listed by his brokerage and another apartment from a competitor - practically identical listings. Her parents got in touch afterwards and said they&#39;d gone with Jordan&#39;s listing because, after watching his videos, it felt like they knew him. </p><p>Sutton agrees. Part of her strategy is giving &#34;general New York tips&#34; - outfit ideas, or tips about different neighborhoods. &#34;It makes the process a lot less scary,&#34; she said.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thenycagent/video/6953014768882011398\" data-video-id=\"6953014768882011398\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@thenycagent\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thenycagent\">@thenycagent</a> <p>Reply to @deceased  I want to move to NYC, when should I look? <a title=\"nyc\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nyc\">##nyc</a> <a title=\"nycfood\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycfood\">##nycfood</a></p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"â¬ original sound - Madison Raye Sutton\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6953014618293897990\">â¬ original sound - Madison Raye Sutton</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script></div><p> </p><p>And it&#39;s not just individual agents amassing major followings. In February, Corcoran partnered with the app for a branded challenge, with agents posting videos of themselves in their homes or properties they were selling, all set to a specific song. The legacy brand then reposted some of the TikTok videos onto <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@corcorangroup?lang=en\">its own account</a>, which just passed 20,000 followers and 200,000 total likes. Sydney Perry, director of digital content at Corcoran, told Insider that the brand is &#34;really trying to go global with our TikTok content&#34; as Corcoran expands globally.</p><p>Perry also said that TikTok is unique among social media platforms for the way content reaches people and potentially goes viral. Due to the site&#39;s algorithmic &#34;For You Page,&#34; she explained, &#34;You don&#39;t need to have a massive following in order for your videos to go viral and to be seen by hundreds of thousands of people.&#34; Instead, content from new accounts appears in users&#39; feeds automatically based on their previous interests.</p><p>Sutton noted TikTok&#39;s unique interface as part of the reason for her success on the platform as well. Since TikTok videos can be posted to other social media platforms and viewed in web browsers, without users having to download the app like they might with an Instagram video, TikTok content is inherently shareable, even for people who don&#39;t spend their days scrolling through it. </p><p>But one of the reasons these agents spend so much time on TikTok, Sutton and Jordan said, is that they enjoy it.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a good thing people want to watch these videos,&#34; Jordan told Insider. &#34;Because I&#39;m addicted to making them.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-agents-on-tiktok-advertise-rental-listings-virtual-showings-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/C5UERc4P_Vc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 14:29:26 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6081d1dc1041d50019f2db49?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"bcc6adb71a4aae4feb4855408c1b6387","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-36-737_8dc8f39af10db586.webp","destWidth":1667,"destHeight":1250,"sourceBytes":211486,"destBytes":211486,"author":"awilliams@insider.com (Annabelle Williams)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6081d1dc1041d50019f2db49?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-36-737_8dc8f39af10db586.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-59-923_72ea3953bf97e00d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-27-00-822_227b02f57db88d57.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=C5UERc4P_Vc:bYCzl_juuAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-00-099_5d32c29d885d1416.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/C5UERc4P_Vc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-27-01-355_10d65722b0ec8401.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596236},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"The top 9 shows on Netflix this week, from 'The Circle' to 'The Baker and the Beauty'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-shows-netflix-this-week-circle-baker-and-the-beauty-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608320874becb800190f6eaf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"the baker and the beauty\" height=\"1266\" width=\"1816\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;The Baker and the Beauty&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">ABC</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Every week, the streaming search engine Reelgood compiles for Insider a list of the TV shows that have been most prominent on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-netflix-tips-and-tricks\" data-site=\"bi\" data-keyword=\"Netflix\" data-analytics-product-module=\"Auto-Linker\" data-analytics-product-area=\"link\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-uri=\"acf4621d45c8a77273dc3fbbf8780b51\">Netflix</a>&#39;s daily top-10 lists.</strong></p>\n<section data-slideshow-intro-content=\"\">\n<section data-slideshow-intro-content=\"\">\n<section data-slideshow-intro-content=\"\"></section>\n</section>\n</section>\n</li>\n<li>The reality series &#34;The Circle&#34;

During MyPillow&#39;s first few years, Lindell&#39;s name popped up often in <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/mypillows-headed-for-the-playboy-mansion/125114744/\">The Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>, usually in <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/c-j-mypillow-employees-got-unrestful-lindell-tirade/248663461/\">gossip columns</a>.</p><p>Nine years ago, Lindell told a reporter at <a href=\"http://chaska.uber.matchbin.net/pages/full_story/push?article-No+rest+for+Carver-s+pillow+czar%20&id=168721822182\">The Chaska Herald</a> that his company was growing at a rate of about 10% per month, with expected annual sales of $10 million.  &#34;Within three years, one-fifth of the world&#39;s population will be sleeping on MyPillow.

He wasn&#39;t sure if his business would survive, and he had two young girls at home.</p><p>The wholesale side, which once comprised just a quarter of the business, now kept the brewery going, along with carryout and delivery operations, as the restaurant dining room remained closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>Once businesses in Ohio were allowed to re-open last year, he had new challenge: operating under COVID-19 restrictions, like social distancing, capacity rules, and mask guidelines put forth by the state.</p><p>At first, customers were supportive, but as the pandemic has continued, they&#39;ve become less enthusiastic -- and more aggressive -- about not wanting to wearing a mask to the bathroom or being unable to get a reservation because the restaurant has met its capacity limit. </p><p>His latest hurdle? Finding workers to fill open positions.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-labor-market-recovery-hiring-unemployment-crisis-stimulus-2021-4\">Businesses across the country have been in a scramble</a> to hire workers as more Americans receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and states begin lifting restrictions on restaurants, stores and other venues. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-subway-struggle-to-find-workers-forcing-changes-2021-4\">Fast-food chains</a>, among other businesses, have said they&#39;re in need of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-food-struggles-to-hire-as-demand-soars-us-economy-roars-2021-4\">thousands of workers</a> to fill open roles.</p><p>The unemployment rate remains elevated from pre-pandemic levels and millions of people are out of work, but still there&#39;s a shortage of applicants. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unemployed-workers-arent-returning-to-the-labor-force-jobless-benefits-2021-4\">That&#39;s in part due to</a> unemployment benefits creating a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-unemployment-benefits-fuel-hiring-struggles-companies-say-2021-4\">disincentive to return to work</a>, a desire for higher wages in the restaurant industry, and the continued fear of getting sick with the virus. Plus, Szuter said, some of his former workers have left the industry after finding new roles during the pandemic.</p><p>For Wolf&#39;s Ridge Brewing, returning to pre-pandemic levels of serving a couple hundred people per night wouldn&#39;t be doable with the current staff, Szuter said. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s almost good that the restrictions are still in place,&#34; he said. &#34;Once those restrictions come off, there&#39;s no way we could do that.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/business-owner-burnout-took-sabbatical-treat-anxiety-exhaustion-2021-4\">How a burned-out business owner took a one-month sabbatical to treat the anxiety and exhaustion of his always-on, entrepreneurial life</a></strong></em></p><p>Szuter started looking for more workers in November of 2020. </p><p>Since then, he&#39;s raised the minimum wage for his employees to at least $15 per hour. That&#39;s up from about $12 per hour that backroom staff, like the cooks, used to make and far more than Ohio&#39;s minimum wage of $8.80 per hour for non-tipped workers. He&#39;s added hiring bonuses of $250 to $300 for open positions like dish washers, too. </p><p>Still applicants for serving, cooking, and dish washing roles are lacking. He used to get half a dozen applications for a job opening, but now there&#39;s hardly a response. His general manager has resorted to scrolling through social media to find anyone reporting looking for work. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s been a struggle,&#34; Szuter said. &#34;Just a lot of difficulty in getting people to even interview, and finding not even necessarily qualified candidates, but just candidates in general.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60831a7d1041d50019f2dff9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wolf brewing\" height=\"1048\" width=\"1397\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Wolf&#39;s Ridge Brewing in Columbus, Ohio. Photo provided courtesy of the company.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Restaurant</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>After operating with a staff of about 45 for most of last year, he&#39;s now up to 68 employees. That includes about 10 new roles he had to fill to keep up with the growth from the wholesale side of the business. </p><p>His staff is working about 60-hour weeks, and they&#39;re feeling burned out, he said. The restaurant has cut back even further on its operations to account for the lack of workers. Pre-pandemic, Wolf&#39;s Ridge Brewing was open six days a week. Now, he&#39;s down to no lunch service and dinner just Thursday through Saturday. </p><p>He&#39;s currently looking for two to three backroom workers and then one or two servers to open up for a few more meals each week.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s still an expectation from most people that things should just go right back to what they were in 2019,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#39;s just not where we are.&#34;</p><p>To get back to pre-pandemic operations, he&#39;d need at least 10 more workers, he said, &#34;and that&#39;s just unfathomable in this situation.&#34; </p><p>Some hospitality industry experts say hiring might be slow right now, but they expect that to change.</p><p>&#34;Unlike the little to no lead time the government gave businesses regarding reopening guidelines, workers planning on returning to hospitality will do so in phases and it won&#39;t happen overnight,&#34; Alice Cheng, the CEO of hospitality hiring company Culinary Agents, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recent-observations-hospitalitys-job-market-alice-cheng?trk=public_profile_article_view\">wrote on Linkedin.</a> &#34;The gravitational pull of the hospitality industry will eventually prevail,&#34; she wrote.</p><p>Szuter is hoping that shift comes soon.</p><p>&#34;The biggest mental stressor for managers and myself is just trying to keep staff morale up and keep things as positive as we can,&#34;

Managers were instructed to get fully vaccinated by April 15. </p><p>&#34;Mandating the vaccine was not a decision we made lightly, but science has proven that the COVID-19 vaccines are very safe and very effective. Like I say to everyone who asks-whether they are reporters, the public, patients or our employees, it is our sacred obligation to do everything possible to keep our patients safe,&#34; Dr. Marc Boom, president and CEO of Houston Methodist, said in an email to employees Friday, which Insider viewed.</p><p>&#34;By choosing to be vaccinated, you are leaders-showing our colleagues in health care what must be done to protect our patients, ourselves, our families and our communities,&#34; he continued.</p><p>Boom also said other hospitals in Texas will follow the lead of Houston Methodist. </p><p>So far, the mandate has been vastly successful, with 89% of all Houston Methodist employees having received the vaccine, Boom said in his email.</p><p>In March, before the mandate was instituted, the hospital system offered employees who got the vaccine a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-houston-hospital-500-dollars/\">$500 incentive</a>. </p><p>Since then and since requiring vaccination, some employees have pushed back. </p><p>After requiring that all employees receive the vaccine, Houston Methodist saw two managers leave. There are about 1,200 employees in management positions there.</p><p>An unnamed person who says they&#39;re an employee at Houston Methodist started a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/houston-methodist-covid-vaccine-should-not-be-mandatory-or-termination?use_react=false\">petition</a> to force the hospital to rescind its vaccine mandate. So far, it has more than 3,800 signatures. </p><p>&#34;Many employees are scared that they will lose their job or be forced to inject the vaccine into their body against their will to keep their jobs and feed their family,&#34; the petition says. &#34;We just want the power to choose for ourselves and not take this basic American right away from us! Please help our cause to fight for all the nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, pharmacy staff, phlebotomists, etc.&#34;</p><p>Employees who do not get the vaccine have been warned they could be fired, Insider&#39;s Grace Dean <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/houston-hospital-covid-19-vaccine-fire-staff-employees-refuse-texas-2021-4\">reported</a>.</p><p>So far, more than 26% of the US population has been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/united-states\">data</a> published by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p><em>Have a news tip?

Startup Professionals, a company that offers services to startup founders.</li>\n<li>These are the nine key bases he recommends all founders cover in their product pitches.</li>\n<li>They include having a clear focus, quantifying value, and showing a cost margin of at least 50%.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>As a long-time adviser to entrepreneurs and an occasional <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/larry-alton/what-are-most-important-considerations-for-angel-investors.html\">angel investor</a>, I often see and hear innovative product <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-to-pitch-18-steps-to-create-and-deliver-a-winn.html\">pitches</a> that sound exciting, but are missing one or more of the key business elements that investors deem critical for funding consideration.</p><p>We all hate to see your <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-things-learn-from-investor-rejection-letters.html\">proposal rejected</a>, when a bit more effort and homework could expedite your startup funding and rollout.</p><p>Of course, you can find these elements embodied in many of the business plan templates and tools out there, such as the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/steve-blank/the-business-model-canvas.html\">Business Model Canvas</a>. But in addition, I&#39;ve always found it helpful to provide a simple checklist for new venture founders and new business owners to make sure they have covered all the key bases correctly, including the following:</p><h2>1. Define and focus on a single customer segment. </h2><p>The business proposals I see often target multiple unrelated segments, such as consumers, enterprises, and government. No new venture can muster the resources and expertise to attack all these opportunities concurrently, so I recommend a clear and quantified focus on one to maintain credibility.</p><h2>2. Quantify your value proposition for customers.</h2><p>&#34;Nice to have&#34; and &#34;improved usability&#34; are not value propositions that people spend money or endure change for. Quantification of value in terms of dollars or time saved is much more attractive. Social value, such as providing the latest fashion trend, are secondary but also important.</p><h2>3. Provide initial and long-term sources of revenue.</h2><p>&#34;Free&#34; is not an exciting business model for investor interest. Every business, including non-profits, need a viable source of revenue to cover the costs of operation and sustainability. The most attractive revenue model today for services is subscriptions; for products, it is sales and support.</p><h2>4. Show a cost margin of at least 50%.</h2><p>Projecting a low cost margin, with a commitment to low overhead and hard work, is not convincing. Investors know that operational and employee expenses are always higher than anticipated, not to mention customer acquisition costs, capital expenses, and ongoing competitive initiatives.</p><h2>5. Identify your intellectual property or &#34;secret sauce.&#34;</h2><p>Unfortunately, startups with an innovative product but no protection are quickly overrun by larger competitors with more resources. Competitor resources include larger cash assets, trained staffs, existing customers, and a known brand in the market. Patents are a good place for you to start.</p><h2>6. Specify a primary customer channel for sales.</h2><p>Today, the most common and successful channel for new ventures is e-commerce. Trying to distribute initially through wholesale and retail, as well as online, is very risky from an investor perspective. Other viable channels would include licensing, contracting, white-labeling, and services.</p><h2>7. Actions for a memorable customer experience.</h2><p>Modern customers are sensitive to the total customer relationship, including shopping, transaction, service, and support. You need to convince investors that you will excel in these areas, as well as attract more new customers, maintain existing customer loyalty, drive repeat business, and grow sales.</p><h2>8. Convince me that you understand your competition.</h2><p>I recommend that you pick your three major competitors and highlight your advantages over each, without degrading any of them. No investor will believe that you have no competition, or that you can succeed in a market already populated with dozens of competitors. Outline your key activities to win.</p><h2>9. Highlight the strengths of the entire team and partners.</h2><p>Most investors admit that they invest in the people as much as the solution. Make sure they understand why you and your team are the right people to make this business a success. The same applies to your advisers, your partner relationships, and your leadership activities in the industry.</p><p>After highlighting all these elements, don&#39;t forget to ask for the order. You need to specify what investment amount you need, how you intend to use it, and what percent of your equity you are willing to give up to get it.</p><p>Everyone needs to feel you are proposing a win-win opportunity. Use your passion and conviction, as well as these specifics, to make my day as well as yours.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-founders-should-include-pitch-business-investors-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/V32X0JZMg-U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 13:25:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6082d8691041d50019f2de23?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"fd64f9726f80ac19d11c7ae8dc12da16","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn21@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-26-36-697_ae5946fe4ff77dd2.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":68412,"destBytes":68412,"author":"insider@insider.com (Martin Zwilling)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6082d8691041d50019f2de23?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn21@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-26-36-697_ae5946fe4ff77dd2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-03-604_0d44bb9ca8a63612.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn76@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-00-182_7a1c8910058c7c7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V32X0JZMg-U:_TgC5WCAuig:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn30@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-02-074_1b6db3f776859f75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/V32X0JZMg-U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_5/2021/04/25/17-26-59-276_f9b4ff7b3bba5427.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596217},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"Pressure is building on Biden to send vaccine doses to India, as the country breaks global records with COVID-19 outbreak","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-pressured-to-donate-covid-19-vaccine-to-india-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608564e73f0560001881be7c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"biden second shot \" height=\"1031\" width=\"2063\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President-elect Joe Biden received his second dose COVID-19 vaccine shot in Newark, Delaware on January 11, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Public-health experts and physicians are urging the US to donate vaccine doses to India.</li>\n<li>India&#39;s COVID-19 surge is shattering world records.

Hospitals are being overrun and medical supplies are in short supply. Vaccinations have also been few and far between in the world&#39;s second-most populous country, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=Hhue1scO\">less than 2% of the population fully immunized</a>.</p><p>India provides the most glaring example of the inequity in vaccine distribution, where rich nations have bought up the vast majority of supply. In the US, 53% of all adults have received at least one dose and 36% are fully vaccinated. The rate of infections and deaths have fallen by about 75% since January peaks, and much of the US has already started to reopen. </p><p>Perhaps the sharpest contrast between the two countries is shown in the latest US vaccination figures. The seven-day average of number of shots being given daily in the US is down 17% from a recent peak of 3.35 million. Evercore ISI analysts attribute the decline to &#34;softening demand,&#34; as experts anticipate the US campaign is now inflecting from a supply to a demand challenge.</p><p>Public-health experts and doctors are now urging the US to do much more in assisting India. In particular, they are urging the Biden administration to relax restrictions on exporting raw materials needed for vaccines and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-has-murky-future-in-us-2021-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-has-murky-future-in-us-2021-3\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">to donate doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine</a>, which is not authorized in the US.</p><p>The US government signed a deal with AstraZeneca last summer to eventually deliver 300 million doses of the shot. The US already has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">at least 30 million of those doses on hand</a>, a supply which experts say would be best used by donating to other nations that need it.</p><p>&#34;We need to get these doses donated to countries where supply is limited. Immediately. They do absolutely no good to anyone just sitting on a shelf,&#34; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_A_Spencer/status/1386168956768108547\">said</a> Dr. Craig Spencer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University&#39;s medical center. &#34;Donating money isn&#39;t enough. Committing to future initiatives isn&#39;t either.&#34;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/24/indias-coronavirus-surge-could-collapse-its-health-system-us-can-help/\">an opinion piece published Saturday in The Washington Post</a>, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, called for the US to help India scale up testing, establish field hospitals, provide more medical supplies like oxygen, and donate vaccine doses. </p><p>&#34;The United States has strategic interests in helping India weather the pandemic; it is also the right thing to do,&#34; Jha wrote. &#34;Only the United States has the capacity, resources and technical know-how to bend the curve of India&#39;s catastrophic second wave of disease. The faster we assist our ally, the more lives will be saved.&#34;</p><h2>Top US officials respond, vow to take action</h2><p>Under the increased pressure, top US officials have vowed to help India, but details have yet to be made public. </p><p>&#34;Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak,&#34; Anthony Blinken, US Secretary of State, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1386148447179493380\">wrote Saturday night on Twitter</a>. &#34;We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India&#39;s health care heroes.&#34;</p><p>Part of the hesitation in donating vaccine doses has been uncertainty over the viral variants that are present in India, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation&#39;s top infectious-disease expert and Biden&#39;s chief medical advisor.</p><p>Certain variants can partially evade the protection given by vaccines. For instance, AstraZeneca&#39;s shot appeared to be particularly less protective against the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa, <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214\">according to a 2,000-person clinical trial</a>. </p><p> &#34;They have a situation there where there are variants that have arisen,&#34; Fauci said Friday at a White House COVID-19 task force briefing. &#34;We have not yet fully characterized the variants and the relationship between the ability of the vaccines to protect. But we&#39;re assuming, clearly, that they need vaccines.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/as-artemis-moves-forward-nasa-picks-spacex-to-land-next-americans-on-moon\">press release</a> from NASA mentioned Mars a few times, positioning the trip to the moon as an important step toward an eventual Mars mission.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s something I hoped I would see,&#34; Hubbard, who is also a SpaceX advisor, said in a phone interview on Thursday. &#34;So that it&#39;s clear ... that they&#39;re keeping their eye on the Mars goal and working toward it in this interim fashion.&#34;</p><p>NASA&#39;s announcement about the moon mission came amid a flood of news about Mars, where the agency landed its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mars-landing-nasa-perseverance-rover-touches-down-in-jezero-crater-2021-2\">Perseverance rover</a> earlier this year.</p><p>On Monday, NASA&#39;s Ingenuity helicopter made history with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-flies-on-mars-2021-4\">the first powered, controlled flight</a> on another planet. The same helicopter later <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-perseverance-rover-moxie-device-turns-carbon-dioxide-into-oxygen-2021-4\">converted</a> carbon dioxide into oxygen for the first time. Both events were seen as small steps toward a crewed trip to the Red Planet. </p><p>Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, has often said he wanted to get people to Mars as soon as possible. He expected to have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1\">1 million people</a> on Mars by 2050, he said last year.</p><p>This year, he said he was confident the first crewed mission would happen in 2026 but <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-starship-humans-mars-mission-2026-experts-question-2021-2\">some experts expressed skepticism</a>. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-starship-land-humans-on-moon-by-2024-2021-4\">At a press briefing</a> on Friday, Musk said the first trip could be in &#34;a couple years.&#34;</p><p>Moving quickly in space exploration brings with it a great risk. Musk seemed to acknowledge this, saying at another event this week that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-mars-announcing-100-million-xprize-carbon-contest-2021-4\">&#34;a bunch of people will probably die&#34;</a> as crews venture toward the Red Planet. This would be similar to any prior danger associated with exploration, he added. </p><p>NASA is taking incremental steps, said Hubbard. First, the agency&#39;s going to learn to live and work on the moon. Setting up a permanent base on the moon will be a learning experience, which will help when crews eventually land on Mars.</p><p>It takes about three days to get to the moon but about seven months to get to the Red Planet. Hubbard said he was enthusiastic about Mars, but also wanted astronauts to be able to return to Earth. </p><p>&#34;There&#39;s been talk about one-way trips,&#34; Hubbard said with a laugh. &#34;I&#39;m not a fan of that, but some people are.&#34; </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/former-nasa-mars-leader-scott-hubbard-crewed-mars-mission-horizon-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XWbIb50kBvQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 14:43:22 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/602930e22edd0f001a8d5bbd?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"826fa385e89e84361521a3d2c647fb9a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-54-469_31aa6a9a771a042a.webp","destWidth":3899,"destHeight":2924,"sourceBytes":52760,"destBytes":52760,"author":"kshalvey@businessinsider.com (Kevin Shalvey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/602930dc2edd0f001a8d5bbc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/25/17-26-56-985_b3982f5e17f0a898.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-59-864_9f36cadf0316812c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn46@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-707_178cf472ecc15304.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=XWbIb50kBvQ:tZQ9eeg1pW8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-26-59-520_0952ca44df92b295.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/XWbIb50kBvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn53@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-27-01-301_99fcc26021dfbad6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596230},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"Sen.

It can become a mental health problem in itself.\"</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60825fcd1041d50019f2dcd2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sweet vinegar aubs copy\" height=\"4999\" width=\"3999\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Sweet vinegar aubergines, or eggplant. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">Craig Robertson via Life Kitchen</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Researchers estimate <a href=\"https://health.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-information/covid-19-long-haulers.html\">about 10% of people</a> who become infected with COVID-19 become long-haulers, meaning they have symptoms that last for months and for some, indefinitely.</p>\n<p>A quarter of people who experience an altered sense of smell or taste improve within a couple of weeks, according to <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19\">John Hopkins Medicine</a>. But for most, the symptoms persist and some have gone more than a year without improvement.</p>\n<p>Riley and Duke, who run a <a href=\"https://lifekitchen.co.uk/\">cooking school for cancer patients</a> experiencing loss of taste, spent months working on the recipes. They consulted with <a href=\"https://london.ac.uk/news-and-opinion/prof-barry-smith-uk-lead-global-group-researching-loss-smell-a-covid-19-symptom#:~:text=The%20research%20will%20focus%20on,and%20its%20impact%20on%20taste.&amp;text=Professor%20Barry%20Smith%20says%2C%20%E2%80%9CThere,how%20much%20changes%20for%20them.hem.\">Barry Smith from the University of London's Centre for the study of the Senses</a>, a leading UK researcher for loss of smell as a COVID-19 symptom.</p>\n<p>Riley said about 80% of taste is actually smell, so the two senses are considerably intertwined. Some COVID-19 long-haulers experience anosmia, a loss of smell or taste, while others experience parosmia, a distorted sense of smell.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082607a4becb800190f6b84?format=jpeg\" alt=\"veggie tacos copy\" height=\"5388\" width=\"4006\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Veggie pineapple tacos. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">Craig Robertson via Life Kitchen</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Creating the recipes for the book involved heightening certain flavors while avoiding others. Coffee, for instance, can smell like sewage to some people with parosmia. Things like onion, garlic, eggs, roasted meat, and nuts can smell \"repulsive, almost like rotting flesh,\" Riley said.</p>\n<p>\"It's quite hard to write a recipe without garlic and onions,\" he said. \"They're the basis of flavor.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, the chefs focused on amplifying the savory flavors and \"adding texture and brightness to make up for the lack of depth.\"</p>\n<p>Riley and Duke tested nearly 300 recipes to narrow them down to the 18 that made it into the book. </p>\n<p>They relied on intense savory flavors like soy sauce, miso, parmesan, and mushrooms, and tried to touch on all five basic tastes - sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami - and stimulate all the senses. They also used ingredients that stimulate the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensations in the face and sinuses and can be felt when eating foods like horseradish and wasabi.</p>\n<p>Riley called the miso butter potatoes with green herb vinegar the \"perfect\" recipe in that sense. The potatoes are umami-rich. The miso and soy sauce are umami and salty. The white pepper and fresh mint stimulate the trigeminal nerve. The green chile adds crunch for texture. The vinegar sets off the sour receptor.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60825f624becb800190f6b82?format=jpeg\" alt=\"miso butter copy\" height=\"5382\" width=\"3996\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Miso butter potatoes with green herb vinegar. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">Craig Robertson via Life Kitchen</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Even though it seems like a simple recipe, Riley said, \"it's actually designed to stimulate all of the senses and a lot of the different taste buds, but also has to taste really nice.\"</p>\n<p>Riley said the reception to the book has been incredible, with people from around the world reaching out to thank them.</p>\n<p>\"Flavor is important. I think that's what we're desperately trying to make people understand,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Riley and Duke started <a href=\"https://lifekitchen.co.uk/\">Life Kitchen</a>, their free, nonprofit cooking school for cancer patients, after both had lost parents to cancer.</p>\n<p>\"I'd seen my mother go through all of the sadness and pain of not being able to eat,\" Riley, who lost his mother to cancer at age 20, said.</p>\n<p>In 2017, he first had the idea to do a one-off cooking class for cancer patients whose taste had been altered by the disease or the treatment. But after a tweet about the class went viral, they launched Life Kitchen as a full-time endeavor.</p>\n<p>\"It's depressing if you can't taste,\" he said. \"It's one of the biggest pleasures that we all take in this world. If you take that away, life really becomes a diminished experience.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

carbon copy</strong></a></h3><p>Hundreds of employees left Travis Kalanick&#39;s ghost-kitchen startup this year - in an exodus that reflects long-simmering tensions about leadership, secrecy, and pay. Inside the organization, people <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanicks-cloudkitchens-repeats-uber-playbook-loses-staff-2021-4\">described an alpha-male society</a> reflective of Kalanick&#39;s first startup:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The Kalanick leading CloudKitchens was not changed, humbled, or reformed. He was the same Kalanick who in just a few roller-coaster years had turned Uber into a global juggernaut - at one point the world&#39;s most valuable tech startup - by barreling full speed ahead and ultimately crashing out.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>In one important way, though, Kalanick has changed. The man leading CloudKitchens is incredibly concerned with secrecy and preventing any challenges to his control, and he has designed the company with that in mind.</em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The result is a business that looks like the old Uber - but without the guardrails. Without a VC-filled board, Kalanick, who reportedly owns about half the company, enjoys free rein to pursue his vision of reinventing the restaurant business.</em></p><p>Read up on Kalanick&#39;s new startup:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanicks-cloudkitchens-repeats-uber-playbook-loses-staff-2021-4\"><strong>Travis Kalanick&#39;s stealth $5 billion startup, CloudKitchens, is Uber all over again, ruled by a &#39;temple of bros,&#39; insiders say</strong></a></li></ul><p>Also read:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-cleaned-uber-toxic-culture-travis-kalanick-2021-4\">Inside Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi&#39;s 4-year quest to root out the toxic culture that nearly sank the world&#39;s most valuable startup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-first-time-founders-got-screwed-by-dirty-term-sheets-2021-4\">Startup founders, VCs, and lawyers open up about the dark world of dirty term sheets, where shrewd investors screw them over</a><br><section></section></li></ul><section></section><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-executive-exodus-vps-other-senior-people-leaving-2021-4\"><strong>Amazon&#39;s executive exodus</strong></a></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-executive-exodus-vps-other-senior-people-leaving-2021-4\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60248d8867d1e300113c5711?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Jeff Bezos\" height=\"2250\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jason Redmond/Redmond</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The company is going through the largest leadership shakeup in its history, with VPs citing better pay, bigger roles, and Amazon&#39;s slowing culture as their reasons for leaving. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-executive-exodus-vps-other-senior-people-leaving-2021-4\">More than 45 top executives have left</a> since the start of 2020:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Given that Amazon has about 350 vice presidents, that&#39;s a turnover rate of more than 10% in the vice-presidential level and above - rare for a company that once prided itself on the loyalty and long employment history of its most valued senior leaders. </em></p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>It&#39;s one of the most dramatic management upheavals in company history.

And one of the real reasons why people have hesitancy is concern about the safety of the vaccine.&#34;</p><p>Some people in the US, particularly Republicans, have expressed hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccines, their effectiveness, and their safety, despite public health officials&#39; repeated assurances they&#39;re safe and necessary to bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_041421.pdf/\">Monmouth poll conducted in April</a> found that 43% of Republicans said they were not likely ever get one of the vaccines. In total, about 1 in 5 American adults said they were unwilling to get one of the shots, according to the poll.</p><p>Fauci noted that out of the more than 140 million people who have received at least one vaccine dose, 8 million people have received the J&#38;J jab. According to the CDC, among those 8 million vaccinations, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-johnson-johnson-blood-clot-case-count-rises-to-15-2021-4\">there are 15 known cases of  clots</a> - all in women under the age of 60. Three of the cases were fatal, the CDC last week said.</p><p>&#34;So if anybody has any doubts about the safety of those other vaccines, and including J&#38;J, we can now say, you know, we take this very seriously; we&#39;ve looked at it; now let&#39;s get back and get people vaccinated,&#34; said Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden.</p><p>&#34;And that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be doing, get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can, as quickly as we can, because we have a very, very effective vaccine for the people here and throughout the world,&#34;

Kroger.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>There&#39;s millions of dollars to be made as a third-party seller on online marketplaces run by Amazon, Walmart, and Target.</p><p>Just ask Ivan Ong, whose international KeaBabies business offers maternity and baby-care products and generated around $20 million in sales last year. KeaBabies&#39; products are also featured on third-party marketplaces like Kroger and Macy&#39;s.</p><p>The brand, founded by Ong and his wife Jane Neo in Singapore in 2016, additionally utilizes Shopify, wholesaling website Faire, along with plenty of advertisements on Google, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, to drive sales from its own website. Ong credited the company&#39;s multi-pronged customer acquisition strategy to wanting to be present wherever customers are.</p><p>&#34;E-commerce really exploded,&#34; Ong said. &#34;Our business doubled last year because COVID accelerated everything. We&#39;re expanding very aggressively. So this year we are aiming for $30 to $35 million in terms of our annual sales.&#34;</p><p>Amazon, where KeaBabies first began selling products in October 2017. is far and away the company&#39;s biggest revenue driving platform. With a full suite of services through Fulfillment by Amazon, offering warehousing and delivery, the e-commerce giant simply has the lowest barriers to entry, Ong said.</p><p>In 2020, Amazon saw <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx?tag=bisafetynet2-20\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\">$386 billion</a> - or 54% of its total net sales - come from third-party sellers.

That exclusivity is a plus, according to Ong, because it allows brands to grow without a ton of competition. </p><p>&#34;There&#39;s a different strategy for Target,&#34; he said. &#34;For us to get in, it was about a year of getting our brand in front of the brand acquisition onboarding team, and then presenting our brand and pitching about why we should be on Target. It has been quite a chase.&#34;</p><p>Meanwhile, Kroger proved to be an entirely different story, thanks to the brand&#39;s recent push to expand its baby category that was seeing growth during the pandemic. The Kroger team ended up contacting KeaBabies directly, to onboard them onto their site. </p><p>&#34;It was a pretty easy process for Kroger because they are trying to open up to more brands,&#34; Ong said, adding that the company&#39;s onboarding process was easy-to-navigate.</p><p>As third-party sales continues to grow, more brands will have to contend with attracting an array of retail partners and developing those relationships. But despite the challenges, Ong said the strategy more than pays off in the end.</p><p>&#34;Our customers are modern moms looking to buy affordable but quality stuff for their babies,&#34; he said. &#34;Being on all these platforms lets you really access customers.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The theory proposes that America sees a &#34;turning&#34; every 20 years as one generation displaces another, and that this dynamic between the two creates a crisis every 80 years.</p><p>Each crisis is marked by four stages: a catalyst event that sets the wheels in motion; a regeneracy in which people stop tolerating weakening institutions and splintering culture; a climax that &#34;shakes society to its roots,&#34; transforms institutions, and redirects purpose; and a resolution that sees the economy entirely restructured for a new set of circumstances. </p><p>It&#39;s an outlandish theory and the book has also been widely criticized for its<a href=\"https://qz.com/970646/the-world-has-already-bought-into-steve-bannons-apocalyptic-ideology/\"> lack of scientific support</a> and<a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/01/26/reviews/970126.26lindlt.html?_r=1\"> vague predictions</a>. But it&#39;s also resonated among conservative and liberal leaders alike, and bears uncanny parallels to American history. </p><p>The last fourth turnings, Howe and Strauss argued, culminated in World War II, the Civil War, and the American Revolution. They wrote that the next crisis-era would involve<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-great-recession-student-debt-affordability-crisis-2020-1\"> millennials</a> and boomers fighting over the shape of the world to come, with the catalyst event beginning around 2005, and the climax around 2020, with a resolution by 2026. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ff72bee6d61c10019cce203?format=jpeg\" alt=\"US Capitol riots aftermath\" height=\"1691\" width=\"2254\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Political riots, social unrest, and a pandemic resemble the climax depicted in &#34;The Fourth Turning.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Leah Millis/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/millennial-generation-gap-great-recession-financial-crisis-money-habits-2019-3\"> 2008 financial crisis</a> can be seen as the catalyst they mentioned, while the pandemic, social unrest, and riots of 2020 and early 2021 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/protests-coronavirus-crisis-fourth-turning-theory-millennials-boomers-2020-6\">sound a lot like the climax</a>. During this climax, they wrote, the economy could &#34;reach a trough that may look to be the start of the depression,&#34; and indeed, the stock-market crash of 2020 was the sharpest and deepest since at least the 1930s. The economy will recover, per the theory, but it will fundamentally change after this period.</p><p>Enter the Biden administration, whose ambitious social programs and big spending have triggered comparisons to FDR&#39;s New Deal. Some leading political experts agree that this era is historic and climactic. For instance, Doug Sosnik, senior adviser to the Brunswick Group, and political director for former President Bill Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20611601-doug-sosnik_brunswick_first-100-days-of-2021_4721-1-3?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&stream=topp;stream=top\">released a presentation in April</a> pronouncing that not only is America going through its biggest transformation since the industrial revolution of the 19th century, but &#34;the current period of turmoil and chaos that began in the early 2000s will likely continue throughout this decade.&#34; </p><p>The challenge, Sosnik wrote, will be the transition from a 20th-century top-down industrial economy to a 21st-century digital and global one. In other words, this period could be a &#34;great gate of history,&#34; just as Strauss and Howe wrote.</p><h2><strong>Forgoing Obama-era rules for a bolder approach</strong></h2><p>The Fourth Turning predicts the agenda of the Next New Deal will center around young adults, with boomers imposing a &#34;new duty of compulsory service&#34; and millennials recognizing this as a path to public achievement. The government&#39;s economic role, per the theory, will shift away from amenities and past promises such as elder care and debt service and toward spending on survival and future promises, such as defense and public works.</p><p>President Joe Biden signaled early on that he wouldn&#39;t bow to the worries over the national debt that dominated much of the last 20 years (ie, the third turning). The president unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus package <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-stimulus-plan-details-checks-congress-direct-payments-unemployment-2021-1\">one week before his inauguration</a>, urging Congress to pass another round of relief checks, extend bolstered unemployment benefits, and fund the distribution of coronavirus vaccines.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6008a6da6d4c620018e4121a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"biden president\" height=\"3614\" width=\"4819\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Joe Biden signs three documents including an Inauguration declaration, cabinet nominations and sub-cabinet nominations on January 20, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">JIM LO SCALZO/POOL/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For the first time in a generation, economists and consumers alike have since become <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-stimulus-debate-economic-growth-spending-federal-reserve-larry-summers-2021-3\">worried about inflation</a>, and whether such a large boost was even needed as vaccines started to reach Americans&#39; arms. </p><p>Where the Obama administration shrank its proposal to appease Republicans and moderate Democrats, Biden stuck with his plan to &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-stimulus-obama-economic-recovery-policy-infrastructure-unemployment-coronavirus-recovery-2021-3\">go big</a>&#34; and, for the time being, ignore its impact on the government debt. </p><p>&#34;A new resolve about urgent public goals crowds out qualms about questionable public means,&#34; Strauss and Howe wrote. &#34;Instead of coaxing people with promises of minimal sacrifice, they summon them with warnings of maximal sacrifice.&#34;</p><p>This could only be the beginning of the Biden-led resolution. For his second act, could we meet the &#34;Gray Champion?&#34;</p><h2><strong>Spending big on a new age of American infrastructure</strong></h2><p>The authors predicted that a key component of the Next New Deal would be a new era for infrastructure: &#34;Fourth Turning America will begin to lay out the next saeculum&#39;s infrastructure grid - some higher-tech facsimile of turnpikes, railroads, or highways. Through the Fourth Turning, the old order will die, but only after having produced the seed containing the new civic order within it.&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s exactly what Biden is proposing, arguing explicitly in the rollout of his <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-roads-bridges-broadband-power-2021-3\">$2.3 trillion package</a> that now is the time to rethink infrastructure for the first time in decades. It includes funds for nationwide broadband and green energy projects as well as more &#34;traditional&#34; infrastructure such as rebuilding roads and bridges. </p><p>&#34;With the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, the federal government made a historic investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and millions of families and our economy reaped the benefits,&#34; reads a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/\">White House fact sheet</a> on the plan. &#34;Broadband internet is the new electricity.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s big, yes. It&#39;s bold, yes. And we can get it done,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-roads-bridges-broadband-power-2021-3\">Biden said as he unveiled the package</a>. &#34;The divisions of the moment shouldn&#39;t stop us from doing the right thing for the future.&#34; He also called it a &#34;once-in-a-generation investment in America.&#34;</p><p>That isn&#39;t all the administration has on the docket. The president is expected to reveal <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-spending-american-families-plan-education-paid-leave-child-care-2021-4\">another $1.5 trillion in spending</a> before he addresses a joint session of Congress on April 28. The plan is set to include funds for child care, universal pre-K, and paid family and medical leave.</p><p>These two packages look a lot like the spending on &#34;public works&#34; and &#34;future promises&#34; that Howe and Strauss predicted would make up the Next New Deal, in some ways they even <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-bidens-stimulus-bigger-than-the-new-deal-fdr-2021-3\">surpass FDR&#39;s New Deal</a> programs. Leonard Burman, a professor of behavioral economics at Syracuse University&#39;s Maxwell School, told Insider&#39;s Juliana Kaplan that compared to FDR, the country has &#34;never done&#34; a package the size of Biden&#39;s proposals. Unlike Biden, he said FDR &#34;spent much less than would have been appropriate for the size of the economic downturn at that point.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606e0df470954f0019195bde?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Biden\" height=\"1334\" width=\"1778\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Biden has framed his American Job Plan as a reimagining of US infrastructure.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Wong/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Taken together, Biden&#39;s proposals place the country on the brink of a new policy regime. The fierce debate over this new regime is where the millennial versus boomer conflict reaches its fever pitch.</p><p>&#34;In the Fourth Turning, boomers are likely to occupy the vortex of a downward economic spiral,&#34; the authors wrote, as &#34;the truth will dawn on old boomers that the money simply won&#39;t be there to support their accustomed consumption.&#34; But it predicted that millennials will come out of this with a brighter future, as they come to embody a &#34;new American mainstream.&#34;</p><p>Helping the millennials along the way will be a particular figure, Howe and Strauss wrote.</p><p>Eight or nine decades after his last appearance in a similar gate of history, the coauthors predicted, America will be visited by &#34;the figure of an ancient man,&#34; one who combines aspects of &#34;the leader and the saint&#34; to lead the way toward resolution.

After seven years in the city, I was thriving with strong friendships, a great job, a beautiful apartment in Williamsburg, and a packed schedule full of activism, exciting nights around town, and taking care of my dog.</p><p>At 28 years old, being a New Yorker felt like a huge part of my identity, and even during the pandemic, I had a difficult time imagining ever leaving.</p><p>But when I stumbled on my dream house in rural southern Vermont, I started imagining the crazy alternative of a life elsewhere. Could anything compare to the buzzing energy of NYC? Though I had always dreamed of owning my own home, I was deeply anxious about the thought of leaving behind my friends, the political causes and networks I had dedicated so much energy to, and the infinite opportunities of the city. NYC was stimulating, challenging, and full of interesting people. </p><p>But believe it or not, so is my new life in Dummerston, Vermont. </p><p>Here&#39;s what it&#39;s like to move from the big city to a tiny, rural hamlet - the main things I was worried about, and how they turned out. </p><h2><strong>Making the leap to Dummerston</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608381011d0b54001913dbb6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"340\" width=\"453\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jessica Frisco in front a cascading waterfall near her home in Dummerston, Vermont.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>I traded in the &#34;rustic chic&#34; aesthetic ubiquitous across Williamsburg (farmhouse decor, hipster lumberjacks) for the real thing. The town I live in now is called Dummerston, a small community of 1,800 filled with dense woods and open farmland.<p>Unfortunately, the Vermont version of &#34;rustic chic&#34; means &#34;needs work,&#34; but my fiancÃ© and I were looking forward to the challenges of getting our property up and running and testing out our handyman skills. It was whether I could make friends and find my purpose in this small town that really had me wondering. </p><h2><strong>Local culture</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e4444becb800190f6d16?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"765\" width=\"1019\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Walking around downtown Brattleboro.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Ten minutes down the road from our house is the main town of Brattleboro, home to a whopping 12,000 people. Despite my initial anxieties, I&#39;ve been impressed by how much there is to do when strolling through the town on a weekend.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e4834becb800190f6d1d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"828\" width=\"1105\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My fiancÃ© and I grabbing craft beers at the local brewery.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The main strip of the historic downtown area overlooks the Connecticut River and is filled with coffee shops, eclectic restaurants, breweries, and thrift stores that even rival those in Brooklyn (except in price.) </p><h2><strong>Home economics</strong></h2><p>While the restaurant scene in Brattleboro and the surrounding area is impressive given the small size of the town, I do miss NYC&#39;s unmatched offerings for takeout and access to literally any cuisine at any time of day. Takeout or a dinner in town has become more of a special occasion than a casual afterthought like it was in the city, especially since most places here close by 9 p.m.</p><p>However, now that I have my own house and lots of kitchen space, I&#39;m cooking much more from my pantry stocked with bulk staples, produce sourced from local farms up the road, and lots of maple syrup.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e4ef1041d50019f2de8f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Stocking up on bulk grocery products.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Friends from NYC or family from my hometown in Connecticut come to visit often, and we love having the space to cook and host. Grocery stores in Vermont aren&#39;t actually that much cheaper than in New York, but I&#39;m saving around $250 a month by cooking nearly every meal from home. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e51a1041d50019f2de93?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>We&#39;ve traded takeout for healthy home cooking.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>With all the cooking comes a lot of composting, something that is mandated by the state of Vermont. While there are options for compost and trash disposal, like burying food waste in our yard or hiring a trash service to come by weekly, we&#39;ve landed on making regular trips to the local dump to save money.</p><p>This has been one of the most challenging errands to adapt to, given the labor intensity of sorting by plastic type and garbage category, and that the dump is only open until the afternoon on weekdays and Saturdays. More than once, I&#39;ve lost track of time and had to hang on to bags of food waste and recycling until the next weekend or rush during my lunch break between work meetings.</p><h2><strong>Building up a social life was easier than expected</strong></h2><p>It took me years of living in NYC to build up a circle of friends. New Yorkers are infamously flaky and hard to schedule with, given their packed schedules and competing options. With all the work I had put into my relationships, I was dreading starting from scratch in Dummerston. Yet it&#39;s been shockingly easy, even in a pandemic.</p><p>The slower pace of life makes it easier to catch someone with a free afternoon, and my fiancÃ© and I chat with our passing neighbors or host new friends regularly. We&#39;ve also relied heavily on Facebook, joining the Brattleboro Facebook group and participating in a &#34;Dog Park Pals&#39;&#39; group to seek playdates for our dog (and ourselves).</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e59c4becb800190f6d29?format=jpeg\" alt=\"dogs Jessica Frisco\" height=\"828\" width=\"1104\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>We&#39;ve made friends through local Facebook groups.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Now, neighbors stop by with a carton of eggs or some homemade maple syrup just to say hi, have a playdate with our dogs, or just to check in on how the New Yorkers are managing. </p><h2><strong>Trading rent for a mortgage</strong></h2><p>Of all the things to worry about, the finances of the move were actually quite attractive. In Williamsburg, I paid $1,400 a month for half of an 800 square foot two-bedroom apartment. In Dummerston, my fiancÃ© and I split basically the same cost for a mortgage on an eight-acre property with a house, barn, and a massive shed. Plus, there are heavy tax incentives to leaving NYC and buying a home. </p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e6931041d50019f2de9e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"711\" width=\"1737\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My apartment in NYC versus my new house in Dummerston.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>That said, home ownership has not come cheap. Without the buffer of a landlord or property manager, we&#39;re on the hook for every maintenance and utility expense. A bitter winter forced us to spend over $1,000 on propane to heat the house, and nearly the same on unexpected plumbing and electrical issues. More space also means more spending on furniture and decorations, and Facebook marketplace is in low supply out here compared with NYC - another thing I miss dearly. </p><p>Overall, in the next five to 10 years, we&#39;ve estimated spending $30,000 or more on home improvement on top of our mortgage. It sounds like a lot, but in New York I was paying $17,000 a year in rent without even getting a fixed-up house to show for it.</p><h2><strong>The politics in rural America aren&#39;t exactly what you think</strong></h2><p>In NYC, I was very politically active and my values were a key factor in deciding where I could live in the future. Though it&#39;s a rural state, Vermont is incredibly liberal and its residents young and old are highly engaged. Yet politics here are hyper-local and more practical than ideological, a change from NYC that I&#39;ve come to appreciate.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e7131041d50019f2dea2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"915\" width=\"1220\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Black Lives Matter signs are everywhere in Vermont.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>While I&#39;ve only been here a few months, I&#39;ve already gotten involved in some work on transitioning the town to renewable energy and improving safe police practices.</p><p>I was sad to give up the excitement of the big city and the sense that anything could happen at any time. Yet Vermont is stimulating in its own ways. I&#39;ve been skiing and hiking more than ever before. I&#39;m regularly chasing porcupines and other wildlife away from my dog, and driving down our dirt road often feels like an off-roading adventure.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e7b81041d50019f2dead?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"514\" width=\"685\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Axe throwing is one of our favorite new pastimes.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I&#39;ve also come to realize that peace and quiet is not all that bad or boring; in fact, my ability to relax and concentrate has increased significantly, something I didn&#39;t realize how badly I was lacking before the move. </p><h2><strong>Life in Vermont is challenging, in a good way</strong></h2><p>One of the things I loved most about NYC was being constantly challenged, whether it was hustling to get ahead at work or figuring out the quickest subway route. I was always trying to get ahead or get somewhere else. Out in the country, my fiancÃ© and I still work hard, but in different ways, like figuring out how to get <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/i-tried-starlink-beta-vermont-compared-hughes-net-elon-musk-2021-3\">internet in the woods</a> or working through an electrical outage.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6082e8481041d50019f2deba?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jessica Frisco\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My fiancÃ© cutting trees from our backyard to burn in the wood stove to heat the house.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jessica Frisco</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>We regularly use more power tools than I can count, and I have become an amateur tradesman who can start a generator, split a log, and replace a condensate neutralizer pump on an HVAC system. Now, with all the work and commitments I&#39;ve put into my new home, it feels like I&#39;m building a foundation for the long-term.</p><h2><strong>I&#39;ve been lucky enough to keep my career, at least for now</strong></h2><p>Like many New Yorkers with an office job, the pandemic forced my company to go fully remote which allowed me to move while keeping my job. I&#39;m able to work as a healthcare director from 9-to-5 remotely in our upstairs office room, across from my fiancÃ©. My job may go back to being in-person a few days a month at some point; while the commute to the city will be long, it will give me a chance to visit and see friends. </p><p>Thinking about the long-term, the opportunities in my field local to Vermont are limited. It would be difficult to find a comparable job that wasn&#39;t remote or based elsewhere in the Northeast. But living here has made me think about alternatives I never previously considered, especially given how friendly the state is to small business. Could I get into a trade, or open a retail store? Maybe one day.</p><h2>A new happy place</h2><p>Looking back on my anxieties prior to leaving the big city for a tiny town, I&#39;m sure I was worried about losing a big piece of the identity I had created for myself in NYC: that of a hard worker with a packed schedule, up on culture and politics and surrounded by fascinating people. The move to Dummerston made me realize it was just as much about what I brought to a place as what the place offered me. My new town has all the foundational elements to make an engaging and excellent life here too, and I&#39;m excited to have taken the leap.</p><p>In April, my fiancÃ© and I went back to NYC for a friend&#39;s birthday. The city seemed the same, but I no longer felt like investing in its endless opportunities. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for work and to visit friends and family, but from now on, my identity is a bit more centered in my happy place in Dummerston. </p><section data-track-content=\"\" data-post-type=\"post\"><p><em>Jessica Frisco is a director at an NYC-based healthcare network.

who are not worthy of respect.&#34;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/tucker-carlson-fox-news/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">pop culture website Outkick,</a> Carlson said mainstream journalists were &#34;small-minded, status-obsessed, insecure, not that bright, and just not impressive.&#34; </p><p>The primetime host also claimed that their work is not &#34;aimed upwards&#34; and that many reporters &#34;suck up to power.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I just can&#39;t overstate how disgusted I am, not simply by the details of the lying of the medium, but disgusted by the emphasis,&#34; he said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/apr/24/tucker-carlson-mainstream-us-journalists\">according to the Guardian</a>. &#34;The media is basically Praetorian Guard for the ruling class, the bodyguards for Jeff Bezos. That&#39;s the opposite of what we should have.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It just makes me sick,&#34; he added. &#34;I really hate them.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/some-ceos-staying-away-from-fox-news-maria-bartiromo-2021-1\" data-e2e-name=\"inline-read-more-link\">CEOs are steering clear of Fox News&#39; Maria Bartiromo and denying her interviews, sources say</a></em></p><p>Carlson went on to criticize journalists for not subjecting <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-net-worth-life-spending-2018-8\">Amazon founder Jeff Bezos</a> to more &#34;intense scrutiny&#34; and said they&#39;re not doing &#34;tough stories&#34; on people with the most power. </p><p>&#34;Jeff Bezos should be subjected to some intense scrutiny since he&#39;s the richest man in the world. He owns the &#39;Washington Post&#39;. He is China&#39;s biggest retailer. I mean, he&#39;s really changed our country,&#34; he said, according to Outkick.</p><p>&#34;And yet, there&#39;s no scrutiny on Jeff Bezos. It&#39;s all, you know, &#39;What a great guy,&#39; and &#39;Jeff Bezos is a genius.&#39; We suck up to power, and we hurt those below us. I can&#39;t think of anything more dishonorable than that,&#34; he added.</p><p>Carlson did not name specific reporters or media outlets.</p><p>The primetime host began his <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-host-tucker-carlson-biography-of-right-wing-superstar-2020-7\">own career in journalism</a> in the early 1990s as a fact-checker for a national conservative journal called &#34;Policy Review.&#34;</p><p>His father, Richard Warner Carlson, was also a journalist who served as the director of the Voice of America during the last years of the Cold War. </p><p>This is not the first time Carlson has attacked journalists.</p><p>Last month, he dedicated two full segments on his show to smearing <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-conservative-media-taylor-lorenz-culture-war-2021-3\">New York Times technology reporter Taylor Lorenz.</a> He called her &#34;privileged&#34; and dismissed her experience of online abuse as &#34;not real harassment.&#34;</p><p>The Times rebuked Carlson&#39;s comments, writing in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYTimesPR/status/1369747504565256193\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">statement</a> at the time: &#34;In a now familiar move, Tucker Carlson opened his show last night by attacking a journalist. It was a calculated and cruel tactic, which he regularly deploys to unleash a wave of harassment and vitriol at his intended target.</p><p>&#34;Taylor Lorenz is a talented New York Times journalist doing timely and essential reporting. Journalists should be able to do their jobs without facing harassment.&#34;</p><p>Fox News did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/tucker-carlson-says-journalists-act-like-bodyguards-for-jeff-bezos-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/2xsbELjE2nE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:12:36 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608544600da8f40018033526?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5615935248e3c9e6fef89428f092b0b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_4/2021/04/25/17-26-54-564_8b865267f3ed6904.webp","destWidth":5973,"destHeight":4480,"sourceBytes":436950,"destBytes":436950,"author":"sankel@businessinsider.com (Sophia Ankel)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb04ba91c741f0019ac9db4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn72@2020_4/2021/04/25/17-26-57-569_abaa5d5be1154453.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_5/2021/04/25/17-27-03-846_7499c2bfd1ab2432.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn99@2020_6/2021/04/25/17-26-57-759_5f379117ee233de1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=2xsbELjE2nE:pbM9yxUCtUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/25/17-26-59-748_dda21ec60691b49b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/2xsbELjE2nE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn33@2020_4/2021/04/25/17-27-01-534_42a40dc12cee6b0d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596281},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"I paid $160 to work from a 4-star luxury hotel in LA for the day, and the free coffee and rooftop pool made me feel surprisingly productive","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-hotel-luxury-los-angeles-california-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60808415c36a8a00185c63fb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Hotel Figueroa.\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Work Perks program at Hotel Figueroa.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brittany Chang/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>I tested the &#34;Work Perks&#34;

For example, currently appointments for H-1B visas are not available in London, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, and Johannesburg, which means an applicant&#39;s job in the US will go unfilled indefinitely. These unprecedented delays are causing severe ramifications for the US economy as many qualified entrepreneurs, business owners, technology industry professionals, and artists cannot begin working.</p><h2>A no-brainer policy fix</h2><p>Fixing this backlog would not only boost our recovery but also requires no legislative effort. President Biden can immediately reform how consulates issue work visas by waiving the in-person interview requirement.</p><p>The contributions foreign workers make to the United States are staggering. Consider just H-1B visa holders. Every year, H-1B visa holders <a href=\"https://www.stilt.com/blog/2020/06/the-true-economic-impact-of-h1b-visa-holders/\">pump</a> $76.7 billion back into the economy, spending three-quarters of that money on businesses in their communities alone. H-1B visa holders also invest more than $12 billion annually in US businesses, which fuels innovation and research.</p><p>H-1B visa holders also contribute $27 billion per year to Social Security and Medicare even though they are ineligible to participate in these programs. That means without these workers, these important programs would suffer, and may sooner face insolvency.</p><p>And even though H-1B visas are capped at a mere 85,000 a year, for every two H-1B visas that are issued, the US government creates four more jobs for US-born workers. By themselves, H-1B visa holders are not just spenders and investors, but job creators as well.</p><p>The proposed US Citizenship Act would increase the cap on H-1B visas. But there is a backlog in issuing already approved worker visas for workers including artist visas, intracompany transfers, and investor visas.</p><p>The simplest and quickest fix would be to allow consulates to issue visas and waive the requirement for in-person interviews altogether. Although the Administration has expanded the ability of consular officers to waive certain in-person interviews, this does not universally apply to everyone. However, it should. Workers should not have to attend consulate interviews during the pandemic, especially considering the visa petitions have already been approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p><p>Likewise, USCIS should expedite work authorizations for those already in the United States. By law, a person with a pending green card application, DACA recipients, and certain derivative visa holders, among other categories, are permitted to work in the United States. However, they cannot work until they receive an employment authorization card. Before the pandemic, it took two to three months for the employment authorizations to arrive. Now, the wait time has doubled to six to nine months.</p><p>It makes no sense that people who are legally allowed to live here should wait that long to work. This delay represents one of the most urgent setbacks affecting immigrants in the US right now, as it effectively prevents people from working at all.

She already owned the Dogecoin. It was just a matter of buying her tickets to the game and booking her return flight to Dallas from Los Angeles. </p><p>&#34;The Mavs have been very forward. Specifically, Mark Cuban has been very forward of like, almost the ease of using Dogecoin to buy Mavs merch and tickets,&#34; Kilbride told Insider. </p><p>&#34;That is where it came from. If people are saying that I can use it, I want to try it.&#34;  </p><p>&#34;I&#39;m not just doing it for the sake of hype&#34;, she said. </p><p>Despite saying just this week he couldn&#39;t make sense of the huge jump in the value of Dogecoin, &#34;Shark Tank&#34; star Cuban has been a cheerleader for the cryptocurrency. The Mavericks, which he owns, started <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mark-cubans-dallas-mavericks-will-accept-dogecoin-for-tickets-2021-3-1030151539\">accepting the coin as a payment method</a> in early March and have <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mark-cuban-dogecoin-dallas-mavericks-largest-merchant-price-prediction-2021-3-1030158472?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">made 122,000 Dogecoins with merchandise</a> sales, he tweeted earlier this month. </p><p>Putting her dogecoin earnings of the week towards a Mavericks game just seemed like the right thing to do, Kilbride <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robinhoodkid/status/1384126603853139968?s=20\">tweeted</a> earlier this week. Once she had decided to try out the process, Kayla booked a flight to Texas for the game - despite not yet having purchased the tickets for it. </p><p>After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to purchase tickets herself, only to find there were none available, she directly tweeted Cuban, who responded almost immediately and connected her to the Mavericks ticketing sales team, enabling her to make the purchase - an amazing experience for her as a creator, she said.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to convey the story that they&#39;re telling as well and confirm their stories, so I&#39;m incredibly grateful and I grew up watching Shark Tank, so that&#39;s obviously a really big deal for me,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m just trying not to &#39;fangirl&#39;.&#34; </p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-ceo-says-bitcoin-could-reach-250k-shares-two-trends-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The CEO of crypto exchange Kraken breaks down why he could &#39;easily&#39; see Bitcoin reach $250,000 next year - and shares 2 emerging trends he&#39;s excited about</a></em></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60852e8f0da8f4001803351d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Kayla Kilbride at the Mavericks game\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3023\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kayla Kilbride</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Dogecoin has gained almost 350% so far in April, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/dogecoin-price-record-high-doge-day-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-ether-2021-4-1030321679?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">rallying to record highs</a>, as celebrities from Cuban himself, to Tesla boss Elon Musk have tweeted about it.</p><p>To Kilbride, who has almost 100,000 followers on her financial TikTok account - a decent following for a niche area beyond the classic lip-syncing and dance routines that tend to feature on the video-sharing app - Dogecoin is more than the joke that led to its creation in 2013.</p><p>&#34;Yes, it is a meme coin, it&#39;s a joke, it started as a joke, but it has been modified in order to provide some sort of, I would almost argue, educational value to the coin itself. Not just to crypto, but also to the currencies, the fiat currencies that we use as well,&#34; she said. </p><p>She invested in it months ago and was in the process of switching to a Dogecoin Core wallet when it exploded in price and so had to buy back in at a higher rate. </p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-investing-arca-cio-shares-10-tokens-special-situations-strategy-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The investing chief of crypto asset manager Arca shares the 3 themes and 10 tokens he&#39;s betting on - and explains how to execute his special-situations investing strategy in digital assets</a></em></p><p>This is not the first time Cuban has taken notice of the likes of Kilbride and her peers on TikTok. &#34;For those of you who would like to learn more about Dogecoin, we strongly encourage you to talk to your teenagers who are on TikTok and ask them about it.

more and tried to use social media to get an interview with him at the game on Thursday this week, when the Mavericks beat the Detroit Pistons 127 to 117. </p><p>&#34;He literally talks about how TikTokers are the ones educating the young and the old, because the young are then educating their parents on how to use Dogecoin and I&#39;m like &#39;If you&#39;re willing to respond to a TikToker,

On its website, it said holders will earn passive rewards through &#34;static reflection.&#34; This means the team behind safemoon plans to make the reward dependent on the volume of the token being traded. Safemoon in fact charges those selling it a 10% exit fee and distributes half that fee to other holders. </p><p>Ian Balina, founder and CEO of Token Metrics, a data-driven investment research platform for crypto, said while there isn&#39;t much to say about safemoon just yet, especially when it comes to its blockchain, its trading volume is getting some attention.</p><p>&#34;It is very popular online,&#34; Balina told Insider. &#34;People are just taking up tokens just like dogecoin based on social media.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-ceo-says-bitcoin-could-reach-250k-shares-two-trends-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The CEO of crypto exchange Kraken breaks down why he could &#39;easily&#39; see Bitcoin reach $250,000 next year - and shares 2 emerging trends he&#39;s excited about</a></em></p><p>The new cryptocurrency has gained traction on social media, TikTok in particular, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/m9tzsm/tiktok_trader_posted_a_video_of_safemoon_with/\">one video</a> promoting the coin garnering nearly half a million views. </p><p>Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip, which provides bitcoin ATMs across the US, said safemoon has social-engineered its way into social media trends and built a community of hype and speculation around it.</p><p>&#34;[Social media] has caused it to rally and people are buying into the hype without much knowledge of safemoon utility or if they don&#39;t want to miss out on the next Dogecoin,&#34; he told Insider. &#34;Since blockchain and cryptocurrencies are still so new and people are seeing crazy price actions around them, it&#39;s no surprise to see similar projects like this that feed on hype.&#34;</p><h4>Here are what five other experts think of the latest craze sweeping the crypto market:</h4><p>&#34;Safemoon is one of a number of new cryptocurrencies appearing on the market which attempt to address some of the problems that Bitcoin and other cryptos have that block mass adoption. For example, Bitcoin is notoriously volatile its valuation can vary wildly from one day to the next and that makes it undesirable for day-to-day commerce or business activity. Safemoon&#39;s exit fee is an attempt to create crypto with less price volatility and therefore more utility in real world applications.&#34; - <strong>Harold Montgomery, managing director at Wirex USA</strong></p><p>&#34;SafeMoon seems like just another meme coin that is driving retail FOMO into it. Safemoon&#39;s built-in functions seek to penalize sellers of its token while rewarding holders. It charges sellers high transaction fees for selling the token and pays a portion of that fee to holders. To sophisticated traders, this concept is not attractive as it artificially inflates the price in the short term without a clear benefit for long-term holders. If the safemoon team comes up with a legitimate innovation, it could potentially benefit from its creative name and its branding.&#34; - <strong>Kapil Rathi, co-founder &#38; CEO at CrossTower </strong></p><p>&#34;With Ethereum transaction fees so high in recent weeks, herds of retail investors have started migrating towards Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a more centralized competitor that&#39;s significantly cheaper to use (for now), albeit with a much less mature developer ecosystem. At the same time, TikTok has really started to take off as a platform for crypto influencers, and several of these influencers have started to direct their followers towards new tokens on the BSC platform. Safemoon is one such example of a new project on BSC with untested tokenomics that relies on Ponzi-like mechanics that penalize sellers for selling the token. It also appears to reward holders in aggregate by giving them half of the sellers&#39; tokens through a shared liquidity pool, thus incentivizing them not to sell as part of a &#34;carrot and stick approach.<strong>- Demetri Kofinas, creator and host of Hidden Forces, a weekly podcast </strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-investing-arca-cio-shares-10-tokens-special-situations-strategy-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The investing chief of crypto asset manager Arca shares the 3 themes and 10 tokens he&#39;s betting on - and explains how to execute his special-situations investing strategy in digital assets</a></em></p><p>&#34;Despite its recent surge, it is important to point out that safemoon is relatively new in the market and investors need to weigh in the potential risks before purchasing safemoon tokens. Personally, I believe it is too soon to pass judgment on its success as its rising value could just be a part of the trend that&#39;s pushing dogecoin prices up ... The company behind safemoon is however planning on launching its own exchange through a $1 million funding, over half of which has already been raised. It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re heading for the big leagues like Coinbase where they&#39;re aiming to list themselves.&#34; - <strong>Peter Jensen, CEO at RocketFuel Blockchain</strong></p><p>&#34;We take great care when thinking about what assets to make available to our millions of customers around the world.

So, is life enjoyable despite the pandemic?</strong></p><p>Henry Kissinger: I wouldn&#39;t say enjoyable, but I came through the period well. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: How has you pandemic experience been so far? How has your life changed over the last 14 months?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Well, my life has changed in that I took for granted seeing people socially or in the office. So I miss that easy contact. I have lost an intangible relationship with people around the world. I have a series of Zooms, but it&#39;s not the same. The immediacy of human relationships has been lost.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: You are living quite isolated in your country home at the moment?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Yes. We have had nobody over for dinner in over a year.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Do you think that we will appreciate personal interaction more once this pandemic is under control and people are vaccinated? Or do you think that, in the long run, it could change social interaction, with people traveling less, meeting less, having less personal conversations? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: Videoconferences are going to replace meetings more than in the pre-pandemic period. Since I have been vaccinated, I am now freer to have an almost normal life. And my wife Nancy and I are planning to spend a month or so seeing friends. I have already had a dinner with old friends in New York. It was about a month of preparation. But things like that will be much more spontaneous from now on. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: What is the pandemic experience going to change in the political context in the long run? Will safety win versus individual freedom? Will autocratic systems gain ground versus democratic centrist systems?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: In this country, the majority of people have had health and safety concerns that they&#39;ve never experienced before. And they have been very occupied with maintaining a lifestyle that they used to take for granted. At the same time, there are groups who are systematically urging a new governmental and national philosophy. And while they are not the majority or even close to a majority, they continue pursuing their convictions - while the rest of the country is focused more on day-to-day life, or on very short-term political issues. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Politicians had to make difficult decisions in the context of the pandemic. For example, legal restrictions concerning border controls and traveling that were considered to be impossible were suddenly possible. You might even say that authoritarian measures had to be implemented in order to save lives. The pandemic has reinforced political authority. And in a couple of countries, at least to a certain degree, people have been very supportive of that. Do you think that democracies are going to be more authoritarian? </strong></p><p>Kissinger:<strong> </strong>A great deal will depend on the impact of vaccinations, where there is already a wide gap between America and Europe. In the US, daily deaths from COVID-19 have been receding; young people are now being vaccinated; businesses and restaurants are beginning to reopen. Much of Europe remains locked down and fearful. Vaccination is beginning to pick up in Europe, but it remains several months behind America. The exception, of course, is the UK. So, to return to the question of political stability, if vaccination successfully reduces the incidence of the disease then the pandemic will be perceived mostly as a health problem that was overcome. The danger is less that emergency measures taken to fight the pandemic will persist than that if infections remain high for a prolonged period, on either side of the Atlantic, we would then witness a crisis of confidence in leaders and institutions. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Talking about Europe, the EU has not been very successful, to put it mildly, in deploying vaccinations. The situation is pretty disastrous, and we are lagging behind America, England, even smaller countries like Israel or Chile. Europe seems to be a dysfunctional player in the crisis. Symbolically, it&#39;s interesting that the Biden administration has restricted European travel to the US even more than Trump did. What impact do you think that will have on the current opportunity to re-establish a strategic transatlantic relationship between America and Europe?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: In America, there has been growth in national consciousness in this period. It was already developing, encouraged by the previous administration. But more in the sense of indifference to foreigners rather than an active hostility towards foreigners. By contrast, in the period immediately following World War II, and for about 30 years afterwards, the idea that America and Europe were fundamentally linked was widespread, certainly in the educated classes. And contact with foreign countries in that period, especially contact with Europe, was a matter of course. This idea is much less prevalent nowadays. You don&#39;t read reports on European elections in American newspapers anymore, and of course they don&#39;t cover them on television. So, in that sense, a certain psychological separation has taken place. <strong> </strong></p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: You once said that, if Europe and America do not re-establish an intense transatlantic relationship, Europe will end up as an appendix of Asia. Do you see a concrete danger at the moment that this might happen?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: On the American side, there may be a temptation - certainly in the immediate post-pandemic period - to believe that we can operate in a more isolated manner on the basis of our reasonably good performance towards the end of the pandemic period. The current administration has been making useful pronouncements - with which I agree - about the importance of relinking America and Europe. That&#39;s important, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve found our way yet to a new practice of the Atlantic relationship. The nature of that linkage is often defined as a return to American leadership. But it may turn out that what Europe seeks is collaborative autonomy, not guidance.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb7fe1f32f2170011f7057a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"biden merkel\" height=\"710\" width=\"1421\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then-Vice President Joe Biden.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: But do you think that we might be facing disappointment ahead because we have naive expectations for the re-establishment of the transatlantic axis?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: At the moment, what we are seeing from the administration is more the expression of an attitude than a detailed policy. There is a general desire to be linked again, and there is an amorphous concept that if we link in dialogue, then some level of operational cohesion will emerge automatically. But the differences between Europe and America did not just appear in the Trump administration. They had been growing already in the previous period, and on both sides. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: In a way you could say that Obama took office at the start of America&#39;s Pacific period?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Yes. In the immediate post-war period, there was a common thread, and there was also the common task of rebuilding Europe and of redefining the American attitude to its foreign policy. These were important national endeavors. But even in the Nixon period, when attempts were made to redefine formal links, it proved relatively easy to do that in the strategic field. But it proved difficult to develop an Atlantic Charter of political objectives. There was no hostility, but there was also a reluctance by Europe to define an organic relationship. Now this problem will reappear in relation to the fact that the challenges of the world have become global. There is no localized threat to European identity. So, in defining our global roles, I could foresee a possible temptation on the part of Europe to pursue a kind of separate policy from the United States.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: What are the consequences?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: In the short run, I can actually see many benefits for both sides. But in the long run, my fear is that an emphasis of both sides on autonomy will do two things. It will reduce Europe to an appendage of Eurasia. And through this, Europe will become preoccupied by the tensions that derive from the competition of Asian and Near Eastern countries with each other. And Europe could become exhausted by these efforts. At the same time, if that happens, America could strategically become an island at the conjunction of the Pacific and the Atlantic. It would then conduct the foreign policies typical for island countries vis-Ã -vis continental land masses, that is to play off the weaker against the stronger, which means there will be more focus on divisions than on the construction of the world. And even if that separation between Europe and America is very friendly, we and Europe should not exhaust our energies in a struggle about how to define common purposes. We don&#39;t have to agree on every economic policy on every local issue, but we should have a common concept of the direction we want the Atlantic regions to go, historically and strategically. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: The EU has not delivered on its promises: no over proportional growth for its economies, weak in managing security challenges, disappointing in its management of the euro crisis. Most importantly, the two big international challenges of the recent past have been very poorly managed by the EU. One is the refugee crisis. And the second one is now the pandemic, particularly vaccination. Could that become an existential threat for the EU?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: The EU has not yet managed to create a political identity and a political consciousness as an organic unit. The decisions are made by balancing political preferences in an essentially administrative manner on a case by case basis. So, at least from my perspective, there is no vision that can be described as a specifically or uniquely European vision.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: What could the European vision be?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: For hundreds of years, Europe has contributed ideas about political structure and political vision. Many of the great ideas about freedom and democracy originated in Europe. At that time on the philosophical level, Europe was largely unified. Now, it seems the EU has a greater ability to concentrate on economic and technical issues than on historic issues. But if Europe is to participate in some unified sense in international affairs, it needs to develop the capacity to generate ideas that are at the same time specifically applicable to European circumstances and also of relevance to the rest of the world. My vision and dream of the European-American relationship has always been that we will manage to establish a unique conceptual relationship within which tactical differences can exist - and should and will exist - but in which they do not become the anchor point of the policy on each side of the Atlantic.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Which America is Europe going to deal with? I am curious to find out how you see the conceptual changes of the current Biden administration, both with regard to domestic and foreign policy.</strong></p><p>Kissinger: The leading groups driving foreign policy within the administration are trying to restore what they consider the traditional pattern of the European-American relationship based on frequent, even constant, consultation with some consensus emerging. They have not yet fully addressed the fact that significant internal changes have taken place in the last 20 years on both sides of the Atlantic. And that these changes emphasize national interest more than is common in American conceptual thinking about foreign policy. Thus the content of the dialogues with America has flattened out while they&#39;re still taking place, and while the institutions remain. The previous administration accentuated differences because of its conviction that America could not be mobilized without an emphasis on national interest. The dilemma with that way of thinking is that in the present technocratic world, the national interest requires a global basis. It&#39;s no longer possible to have a national interest that is confined to the immediate circumference of one&#39;s own country. And that is a task in which America has to engage itself as it pursues the Biden-type policy. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: What are you thinking about?</strong>  </p><p>Kissinger: When I was in office, because of the Vietnam War which we inherited, the divisions were very intense and, for policymakers, occasionally painful. But in a way they were family divisions. The leaders of the liberal Democratic side were personal acquaintances with whom I had gone to Harvard and met regularly. In the present period, there is a systemic questioning of the historic values of America. There is a point of view to the effect that American society has been immoral from its very beginning. Advocates of this view maintain that the American internal challenge derives from the historic structure of American society and history. They believe America&#39;s institutions - the Senate, the Supreme Court, perhaps even the Constitution itself - have to be remade from the ground up. This is a revolutionary frame of mind which is being pursued very systematically and very effectively. It is not a view that is held by close to 50% of the population. But it is a view that is intensely held and is perhaps dominant in the academic and media community. It is therefore becoming extremely influential.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Would you say there is a growing intolerance for different views in those circles?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: With respect to the issues that the adherents consider most important, there is very limited tolerance. It&#39;s a revolutionary view in the sense that it aims for victory, not compromise. And those who hold different views are ejected from participation.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: By the year 2028, the expectation is that China will replace the US as the largest economy. A couple of days before Biden took office, the EU signed an investment and trade protection deal with China. That must have been perceived in Washington as a provocation. What does that tell us about the future of the American-European relationship versus China?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: The administration is trying hard to keep the relationship within traditionally accepted limits. But it faces the situation now where public opinion has become convinced that China is not only a rapidly growing country, which is true, but also that China is an inherent enemy, and that therefore our main task is to confront it and to reduce its capacity to be a major country. But China has been a major country for thousands of years. And in different historical epochs. And so, the recovery of China should be not surprising, and its consequences are that America, for the first time in its history, is facing a country of potentially comparable capacities in economics, and with great historic skill in conducting international affairs. This was not the case with the Soviets. They were actually weaker than the United States in military capacities, and they had no economic position in the international field at all. So, with respect to the current crisis, there is almost a certain nostalgia for the issues of the Cold War.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Nostalgia? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: Yes. The big issue to look upon is not just to prevent Chinese hegemony, but to understand that if we achieve that objective - which we must - the need to coexist with a country of that magnitude remains. Let me say a word about the assumed global domination of China. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6c7691c4049200115cb50f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Xi Jinping\" height=\"997\" width=\"1995\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Noel Celis/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Please.</strong></p><p>Kissinger: There is a big difference between the Chinese perception of history and the Russian perception. Russian leaders have historically been insecure, because they have spent their history defending themselves against potential enemies on all sides. They have therefore, since becoming strong, identified influence with physical domination. China has a more complex view. The Confucian view, which shapes Chinese thinking side by side with Chinese Marxism, implies that if China performs at the maximum level of its capacities, it will generate a majestic conduct which will produce respect in the rest of the world - making it agreeable, at some levels, to Chinese preferences. In the Empire period, foreign countries were graded by the degree of their proximity to Chinese cultural precepts. There existed a department for grading these countries, and it conducted foreign policy. China has historically and recently supported this attitude with military actions to remind adversaries that this is not just a philosophical debate. But if you actually study the Chinese military actions, since the period that the communists took over, they&#39;ve all been for psychological effect. They were often very tough. And we must be prepared to oppose Chinese hegemony. But we, at the same time, should remain open to a policy of coexistence.</p><p>In dealing with China, different schools of thought have to be sorted out. There&#39;s a group who thinks the Chinese capacity for foreign policy must be confronted at all levels from economics to Chinese internal politics. It ascribes current Chinese policies to the current Chinese leadership and strives for bringing about a more accommodating group. I, on the other hand, believe that such an attitude generates a maximum of resistance. Of course, free societies must continue to conduct world affairs compatible with their principles and free of the threat of hegemony. But coexistence in the current world of technology is a necessity, because it is impossible to visualize a war between major countries who have significant AI technology that will not destroy cultural life as we know it. So that will be the debate in America and maybe in the world.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: A truly reliable alliance between the United States and Europe would be essential for America. Do you think a strategic disagreement with regards to China can be a real threat to the transatlantic relationship? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: If Europe pursues a policy of taking advantage of American-Chinese disagreement, it will make confrontations all the sharper and crises all the more overwhelming. I am not in favor of a crusade against China. But I am in favor of developing a common strategic understanding so that the situation will not be inflamed further by constant maneuvering for advantage.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: But if China becomes the globally leading economy, it seems very likely that it will also have a major impact on political values and political systems in countries that are economically dependent on China - which will be almost all of the non-American rest of the world.</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the entire world or even the dominant part of it.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: We can debate about Russia. But Europe, Africa, Australia?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: No, I am assuming that the societies you mention have enough self-discipline and confidence that they will not permit such an outcome.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: You are saying Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has the power to have significant impact on our culture. The new instrument strategically and the new form of warfare is not weapons, it&#39;s basically data. In that regard, China has an unfair advantage. They are collecting tons of personal data as part of their regulative system putting the interest of the Chinese Central State first. The likelihood that China is going to win the race of AI is not small. Are you afraid we might end up with a unilateral AI governance dominated by the Chinese?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Five years ago, I didn&#39;t know anything about AI.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Now you&#39;re writing articles about it, you&#39;re an expert in it. </strong></p><p>Kissinger: I am a student of it. It is fascinating not only economically, but also philosophically, because it will change the nature of human thinking about reality, which will affect all of us. The U.S. needs to maintain a high level of performance in AI. But there are two levels: superior AI can mean you can crush any competitor who operates on market principles. But you&#39;re wrong in saying that the Chinese are bound to be superior to us in the AI field. We have many of the assets of creativity in the AI field. But we have to understand AI in its totality. In the world that you envision, there will inevitably be a competition between AI powers. &#34;High-tech powers&#34; is a better way to say it. And the propensity of high-tech is towards monopoly. That needs to be overcome.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Right!</strong></p><p>Kissinger: And, therefore, there is this propensity to crush the opponent. Now coexistence depends on neither side seeking to destroy the opponent while maintaining its values and objectives, and each side needs to place coexistence ahead of a quest for domination. This requires an understanding between the leaders of high-tech societies. We must learn from history. Europeans in particular know the consequences of wars that can neither be won nor ended.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: But do you think there could be peaceful coexistence?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: I know it is our duty to attempt it. Right now, in the West, high-tech is developed almost for its own sake. People are fascinated by it, and they keep building it. So, given our propensity for and our demonstrated ability in this field, I am confident that we should be able to maintain a competitive position. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: I agree, that that dual competition will remain for the foreseeable near  future. However, it is also a realistic scenario that one day a unilateral system with one force basically dominating, either the US or China, will emerge. In this context two questions raise. First, will AI serve the people, or will people be serving AI? Many people like Elon Musk and others, who know AI extremely well are worried about the latter scenario. Second: Is AI serving the economic well-being of big tech platforms and companies, as in the United States, or is AI serving the well-being of a central state, which basically controls and uses AI for the total surveillance and control of its people? And I think this is a very fundamental difference, and it has a huge impact on the consequences of AI. </strong></p><p>Kissinger: In the competition between China and the West, a key objective has to be to prevent it from becoming an all-out AI conflict. Which means that, while both sides may have the theoretical capability of winning, neither side chooses to exercise it-they should limit it by some kind of understanding. I&#39;m laying out a task, not a detailed program. Strive for it, because the alternative of an all-out conflict strains the imagination. The United States must always have an adequate defense. But in the high-tech world, it must also work for coexistence. We cannot do it as a unilateral act. This is the challenge of our time.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: Europe and particularly Germany play a pretty irrelevant role in that context. A century ago, Germany wanted too much leadership, and today, it doesn&#39;t want enough leadership or doesn&#39;t take enough leadership?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: Well, in the 1930s certainly, Germany wanted too much - it wanted dominance. Since the end of the Second World War, Germany has rebuilt itself by reliance on the Atlantic Alliance, and I had the privilege of participating at the margins of that effort. But it has gone through the process of defining a new identity several times since the end of World War II. First to build the Federal Republic of Germany, then for Reunited Germany, then for a European Germany. And now the issue arises of a global Germany, and there is little historical precedent for that role. Germany has the resources and the history to be a major factor in the future. It needs to make up its mind on how it perceives its global role. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: At the end, a pleasant topic. There has been one constant over the last almost 100 years and that is that your favorite soccer club is Greuther FÃ¼rth. Now, four days before your 98th birthday this year, there is the possibility on the last match day that Greuther FÃ¼rth could move up to the Bundesliga. Your favorite birthday gift? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: A great birthday gift. I haven&#39;t lived in FÃ¼rth in over 80 years. But I follow Greuther FÃ¼rth, and I have already made a tentative plan that, if FÃ¼rth makes it to the Bundesliga, which does not look very likely, but they are not without a chance, I will travel to FÃ¼rth to visit my grandfather&#39;s grave and attend a game if the pandemic permits it.</p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: You should come no matter what happens. If you look back to your childhood, was there a reading experience that was life changing for you? Is there one single book that you could mention that had a particularly strong influence on your way of thinking and your way of living?</strong></p><p>Kissinger: No, in my childhood, the preoccupation of my family was how to survive, how to arrive at a situation where one could plan a normal future. Which is why America was such an important element throughout my life. Later on, when I was in America, Spengler&#39;s &#34;Decline of the West&#34; had a major influence on my thinking. Not because of the prediction of decline, but because of the perception of looking at every civilization as a unit and not in terms of separate individual actions. And because of his analysis that the architecture, science, and every other aspect of our culture have certain basic themes. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: If you had to decide for the politician of the last 100 years who left the most positive impact on the world who would that be? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: Winston Churchill. He saved Europe. </p><p><strong>DÃ¶pfner: You are, a German who had to leave his home country because Germans organized the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews and many members of your family. You made your career in America and became an international political figure of great influence. And throughout the decades, you have kept this very special interest in Germany and the importance of the American-German relationship. More than that, you have kept a deep emotional affection for Germany. Can you explain why and how that was possible? </strong></p><p>Kissinger: I don&#39;t know if I have ever formally addressed this issue. My family suffered more than I did, because I was younger. Despite the losses of close relatives and friends, my father always retained a nostalgic feeling for Germany. In 1965, I received an award from the city of FÃ¼rth, and my father came along. To my amazement, he chose to volunteer an extremely conciliatory speech in German emphasizing the positive things he remembered. I never really explored with him how he reached that decision. And in my own personal life at the end of the war, when I was a very young man in counterintelligence who had been entrusted with great powers, I decided that if it was wrong to treat Jews on the basis of their ethnicity, then it was wrong to do that to Germans too. And, by serving in Germany, I had an opportunity to start to work on a new relationship. And it evolved into an important part of my life.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

There&#39;s also a lockable storage cubby that&#39;s designed to fit a folding bike lock. </p><h2><strong>Looks</strong></h2><p>Looks are subjective of course, but I think the Rush/Cty has the edge here. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60146d22d6c5e60019c6e038?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RadMission 5\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>RadMission 1 e-bike.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Instead of a bulky battery pack mounted to the downtube, Serial 1 models get their power from a battery that slots into the frame between the pedals. That battery pack - which uses the same technology as Harley&#39;s LiveWire electric motorcycle - is removable, so riders can charge up without lugging the whole bike inside. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fdbe159c910a400192e8373?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Serial 1 15\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Serial 1 Rush/Cty Speed.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Whereas the RadMission has a somewhat unsightly nest of cables up front running to the brakes, battery, and controller box, on the Serial 1, there&#39;s barely a cable in sight. That&#39;s because Serial 1 routed the bike&#39;s brake cables and other wiring internally through the frame. That&#39;s not all that functional, but it contributes to the Rush/Cty&#39;s sleek look. </p><h2><strong>The ride</strong></h2><p>Both the RadMission 1 and the Rush/Cty Speed have four levels of pedaling assistance, but that&#39;s where the similarities end when it comes to how these bikes ride. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60146d23d6c5e60019c6e039?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RadMission 10\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>RadMission 1.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The RadMission 1 has a basic setup of a hub motor powering the rear wheel and a sensor that switches the power on when the rider starts pedaling. That&#39;s similar to what&#39;s found on most low-end electric bikes, and it certainly gets you where you need to go. </p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/europe-could-derail-harley-davidsons-post-trump-comeback-2021-4\">A new tariff fight in Europe could derail Harley-Davidson&#39;s triumphant comeback after its war with Trump</a></em></p><p>The Rush/Cty Speed benefits from a much more advanced drivetrain that combines a torque-sensing mid-drive motor with an automatic Enviolo Nuvinci transmission. In plain English, that means the motor registers the effort a rider puts in and helps out accordingly; the harder you pedal, the more assistance you get. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fdbdeabd366e60018098cbf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Serial 1 16\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Serial 1 Rush/Cty Speed.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Business</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>That&#39;s happening while the continuously variable transmission constantly - almost imperceptibly - reacts to keep you in the right gear. </p><p>The combination of those two systems means all you have to do is select a pedal-assist level, and the Rush/Cty smoothly takes care of the rest. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60146d226dfbe10018e00d8f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RadMission 6\" height=\"2015\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>RadMission 1 e-bike.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Speed isn&#39;t purely a factor of cost, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that the RadMission&#39;s claimed 20-mph top speed left me wanting at times. The Rush/Cty Speed tops out at 28 mph, making it easier to keep up with traffic and catch green lights.</p><p>Not to mention, the Rush/Cty&#39;s mid-drive motor and battery placement give it a low center of gravity, making it feel remarkably balanced and planted, even at high speeds. </p><h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s no question - for most people, $5,000 is a lot to spend on a bike. </p><p>But e-bikes have the potential - even more so than regular bikes - to replace car trips altogether for many people in many places. And when you consider that the price of the average new car sold in the US has ballooned to nearly $40,000 - and that a solid used car can run you well over $10,000 - spending a few thousand dollars on a highly capable e-bike starts to sound a lot more reasonable.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6083395b5f61100018270fe2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Serial 1 Rush/Cty Speed.\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Serial 1 Rush/Cty Speed.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tim Levin/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Plus, legislation may be on the way that would <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-bike-tax-credit-proposal-house-democrats-2021-2\">slash the price of e-bikes</a> through a tax credit like the one that currently exists for buyers of electric vehicles. </p><p>In the meantime, if you can&#39;t shell out for the Rush/Cty Speed, Serial 1 has a handful of lower-priced options with many of the same features. And regardless of how it stacks up to Rush/Cty Speed, the RadMission 1 remains one of the best affordable e-bikes on the market. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

attack.</li>\n<li>From an international law perspective, the move is controversial and could potentially come back to bite the US in the future.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Last week, the Biden administration took the bold step of imposing economic sanctions in response to an act of cyber espionage, namely the SolarWinds attack.</p><p>It seems that the new US administration is finally getting serious about standing up to Russian aggression in cyberspace. But from the perspective of international law, the move is controversial and could potentially come back to bite the US in the future, given its own cyber capabilities.</p><p>The release of the Executive Order announcing the sanctions, which also respond to Russian meddling in the 2020 US presidential elections and other actions, coincided with a call between President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in which the two leaders discussed the possibility of a summit on arms control.</p><p>In this context, the sanctions can be understood as a symbolic show of strength amid parallel moves to deescalate tensions and rebuild trust and respect in the wider bilateral relationship.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reprisals represent <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stakes-high-expectations-low-trump-putin-meet-helsinki/story?id=56603366\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a clear break from the Trump administration</a>, during which a serving US president cast doubt on his own intelligence services&#39; assessments regarding Russian disinformation, electoral interference and other cyberattacks.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">measures announced last week</a> include the imposition of economic sanctions barring US financial institutions from purchasing Russian sovereign debt, as well as the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats.</p><p>The SolarWinds compromise, in which hackers introduced malware to a wide range of networks through a security update to SolarWinds&#39; network-monitoring Orion platform, was uncovered in December 2020, after having been in operation for up to nine months.</p><p>It was described at <a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/senators-push-for-changes-in-wake-solarwinds-attack-a-16409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a US Senate intelligence hearing last week</a> as one of the largest and most sophisticated cybersecurity breaches in history. Known victims include the US Department of Homeland Security, NATO, the European Parliament and a handful of UK targets, as well as many private-sector businesses and organizations using the Orion platform.</p><p>The inclusion of the SolarWinds attack as a cause for the announced sanctions is a new and creative attempt to raise the cost of Russia&#39;s brazen and destructive activities in cyberspace, something Western democracies have struggled to do in recent years. Until now, they have resorted to &#34;naming and shaming,&#34; which has yielded mixed results.</p><p>In October 2018, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45746837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the US and its allies coordinated among themselves</a> to publicly denounce Russian attempts to hack into the networks of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and various anti-doping agencies, as well as other cyberattacks they attributed to Russia.</p><p>It was an impressive show of solidarity and combined intelligence capabilities, but whether it had the desired deterrent effect is less than clear. It may have perversely fed the harmful narrative of Russia&#39;s strength at cyber dirty tricks.</p><p>The embarrassing discovery of the SolarWinds breach highlights that for Russia, cyber business continued as usual.</p><p>The Biden administration&#39;s announcements last week are significant for two reasons.</p><p>First, they represent the first official public attribution by US intelligence services of the SolarWinds compromise to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR. That&#39;s in line with a growing trend in which states use such attribution strategically, to make sure bad actors know they are not evading scrutiny.</p><p>Second, the eye-catching inclusion of SolarWinds in the Executive Order is controversial from an international law perspective. The expulsion of diplomats and imposition of sanctions are classic examples of &#34;retorsion,&#34; located at the lower end of the lawful responses reserved by states that are victims of another state&#39;s breach of international law.</p><p>This is significant because despite its audacity and scale, SolarWinds was a classic case of espionage. The attackers did no damage. They just installed themselves in their victims&#39; systems and soaked up information. When discovered, they withdrew. For national security and international lawyers, the invocation of an act of espionage as a breach of international law is unconvincing at best.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd88b3d2069f400194c7c3a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin shakes hands with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during their meeting in Moscow March 10, 2011.\" height=\"747\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Vladimir Putin, then Russia&#39;s prime minister, with Joe Biden, then US vice president, at a meeting in Moscow, March 10, 2011.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Alexander Natruskin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>There is no doubt that Russia&#39;s reckless, almost anarchistic behavior in cyberspace merits a strong response from the US and its allies. But last week&#39;s Executive Order and accompanying documents are light on international law analysis, and that&#39;s probably a deliberate choice.</p><p>In the past, Russia&#39;s other egregious acts - such as the use of the chemical nerve agent Novichok in the attempted assassinations of Alexei Navalny and Sergei Skripal, or its cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine - have clearly crossed the international law threshold for retorsion.</p><p>But the US, alongside the UK and other states that have broad-spectrum capabilities in cyber, has until now been careful to carve out espionage from the scope of the sovereignty principle under international law, although this is often couched in such ambiguous and complex language that one could be forgiven for missing it.</p><p>This explains why Michael Hayden, a former US director of national intelligence, went so far as to describe China&#39;s notorious hacking of a US government personnel database, discovered in 2015, as &#34;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/15/joe-biden-seeks-to-clobber-russia-with-new-economic-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">honorable espionage work</a>.&#34;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1832550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In an article published in October in the Journal of Cyber Policy</a>, which I edit, Chatham House&#39;s Harriet Moynihan explained that while several states, such as the Netherlands, France and Austria, consider that an unauthorized cyber incursion by one state into another could in certain circumstances be a violation of the principle of state sovereignty, that has not been the consensus view.*</p><p>Moynihan told me more recently that, based on the current facts, she is doubtful the SolarWinds hack violated international law.</p><p>Last week&#39;s Executive Order and the papers accompanying it announce that the US will be working to incorporate like-minded allies, including the UK, France, Denmark and Estonia, into joint cyber exercises to reinforce their shared commitment to collective security in cyberspace.</p><p>But in order for these like-minded countries, particularly the US, to shape future norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, they will need to bring nonaligned swing states along with them. To do so, Ciaran Martin, former head of the UK&#39;s National Cyber Security Centre, told me, &#34;The US will have to work harder to convince swing states that it is really committed to achieving fair and balanced rules of the road.&#34;</p><p>Seen in this light, the inclusion of an act of cyber espionage, SolarWinds, as a justification for international law responses may do more harm than good, given Washington&#39;s own cyber intelligence activities.</p><p>Another intriguing aspect of last week&#39;s Executive Order is whether the economic sanctions it imposes will actually hit Russia where it hurts - in the wallet. Lord Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordRickettsP/status/1382962338140205056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">praised the US action</a> as an &#34;asymmetric&#34; approach &#34;to remind Russia of their econ[omic] weakness.&#34;</p><p>But, after causing a &#34;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb555605-1c1e-4144-bc99-d05b58dc61d7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brief wobble</a>,&#34; the sanctions don&#39;t seem to have had much long-term impact on the markets, suggesting that they may be more symbolic in nature, rather than a real attempt to destabilize the Russian economy.</p><p>In the wider context, as the new US administration sets out its Russia policy more clearly, last week brought us <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/13/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-president-vladimir-putin-of-russia-4-13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a show of strength and resolve on cyber, coupled with an olive branch</a> in the area of traditional arms control: a proposed summit between the two leaders to &#34;build a stable and predictable relationship consistent with US interests.&#34;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/29581/will-tense-us-russia-relations-impede-cooperation-on-arms-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In a Trend Lines interview with WPR&#39;s Elliot Waldman last week</a>, Sarah Bidgood, the director of the Eurasia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, described the risks to national and international security of today&#39;s US-Russia relationship, characterized as it is by &#34;real acrimony ... a lack of respect for one another that permeates all aspects of the relationship.&#34;</p><p>The proposed summit is an urgently needed attempt to restabilize the relationship with Russia and prevent the risk of escalation and mutual harm.

the latest hot-ticket item to face tight supply as a result of the pandemic. </p><p>Restaurants across the nation are reporting a scarcity of wings and rising costs per pound, the result of a spike in take-out orders and the unprecedented winter storms in Texas. It&#39;s leading some restaurants to raise prices for customers, and others to worry that they won&#39;t be able to meet demand. </p><p>The tight supply is being felt acutely in Buffalo, New York - the home of the humble chicken wing.</p><p>Duff&#39;s, a wing restaurant known for its extremely hot wings with legions of diehard fans, told <a href=\"https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/buffalo/national-chicken-wing-shortage-continues-to-hurt-restaurants/\">Buffalo&#39;s CBS affiliate WIVB</a> that its seen a spike in take-out orders - about 60% of one location&#39;s business comes from take-out orders, versus 40% prior to the pandemic.</p><p>Jeff Feather, a manager at a Duff&#39;s location, told WIVB that the restaurant is having a difficult time securing enough cases of flats and drumsticks to get through the weekend.</p><p>&#34;Say we order 50 cases of wings to get us through the weekend. We might only get 30 of them delivered. So we&#39;re getting about two-thirds of what we typically order,&#34; he said. &#34;There are some days our food reps will call us and say we might not be able to get you anything.&#34;</p><p>Feather told WIVB that wings cost the restaurant $3 per pound, and each case weighs roughly 40 pounds.</p><p>While a chicken wing shortfall is likely to hit Buffalo hard, other regions nationwide are noticing a wing deficiency as well. Moe Stevenson, Virginia-based restaurant owner, <a href=\"https://www.wivb.com/news/national/theres-a-national-chicken-wing-shortage/\">told WIVB</a> that the cost of drums - a wing shape <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/best-chicken-wing-parts-drums-flats\">some people seem to prefer</a> - has increased threefold since last year to the tune of an extra $1,200 per week. Stevenson called the price increase &#34;outrageous.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I thought it would drop off after the Super Bowl, like it usually does, March Madness, it&#39;s done,&#34; he said. &#34;No, it&#39;s gone up.&#34;</p><p>Dan Ponton, CEO of an Ohio-based wing chain called Roosters, <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer-chicken-wing-shortage-pinches-dining-experiences-local-and-national/7WMAUZ3GTFA33BUDSWW2RE4DDU/\">told the Dayton Daily News</a> that he hasn&#39;t noticed a shortage of other chicken parts, like breasts or tenders - but wings are a different story.</p><p>&#34;The prices are the highest they have ever been in the 33 years I&#39;ve been doing this,&#34; he said. </p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-to-pursue-damages-from-tyson-pilgrims-pride-2021-4\" data-e2e-name=\"inline-read-more-link\">McDonald&#39;s will pursue damages from Tyson and Pilgrim&#39;s Pride in chicken price-fixing scandal</a></em></p><h2>Wings are &#39;pandemic-proof&#39;</h2><p>Tom Super, a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, told Insider by email that while wing supplies are tight, he wouldn&#39;t call the situation a shortage.

Understaffing was a constant issue, as employees who were paid roughly $10 an hour scrambled to clean and chop sufficient ingredients to keep food on the line, he said. </p><p>Drown decided it was time for him to quit his $15-per-hour job after ice storms pummeled West Virginia in February.

Even before the pandemic, many lower-paying jobs were struggling to hire. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;re going to go back to that really competitive marketplace for labor,&#34; said Marc Wulfraat, the president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be a shock to companies that are paying low wages,&#34; Wulfraat added. &#34;They&#39;re going to be the ones that are hit the worst, because all that low-wage labor is going to find a home elsewhere - where there&#39;s more money to be made.&#34;</p><p>People looking for jobs increasingly have options that pay at least $15 an hour at industry giants like Starbucks, Amazon, and Target. They may also be able to find jobs that offer greater flexibility than traditional retail jobs, such as driving for Lyft or delivering food for UberEats. </p><p>Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman told Insider that companies are going to have to improve their pay, benefits, and culture to combat hiring difficulties. Companies&#39; values are increasingly important to workers, Silberman said, making a chain like Starbucks that has invested in building a reputation of social consciousness potentially more attractive to workers than some of its fast-food rivals. </p><p>Employers told Insider they are already looking into offering new benefits and higher pay. Blake Casper, who owns 60 McDonald&#39;s locations in Florida, said that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-pays-50-for-job-interviews-highlighting-hiring-struggles-2021-4\">he is considering raising starting wages from $12 to $13 per hour.</a> Dunkin&#39; franchisee John Motta said that it is already impossible to hire people at minimum wage. </p><p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have anybody at my store if I was paying at $7.25,&#34; Motta said. &#34;The minimum wage is pretty much dictated, in my opinion, by the marketplace.&#34; </p><h2>Some businesses will be forced to close. That&#39;s not a bad thing.</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fce3ec6eadd8400183df70b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Friendly&#39;s restaurant closed\" height=\"1356\" width=\"2712\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Not every store or restaurant is going to survive.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Employers are quick to say that higher wages will create new problems. </p><p>Companies usually offset higher wages by passing costs along to customers. In the restaurant industry, for example, minimum wage regulation typically leads to higher menu prices. This week, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said that a $15 federal minimum wage <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-will-raise-burrito-prices-if-a-15-minimum-wage-passes-2021-4\">would mean a slight increase in burrito prices.</a> (Chipotle did not respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment on Drown&#39;s experience working at the chain.) </p><p>&#34;Ultimately in any business, the customer pays for everything,&#34; Waffle House CEO Walt Ehmer told Insider in November. &#34;We don&#39;t have any other source of revenue other than the customer. So, we have to be careful how we treat our customers and we don&#39;t stick it to them with giant price increases.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/waffle-house-ceo-slams-lockdowns-keeps-dining-rooms-open-2020-11?r=kt-sub\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"1b38071f8ef3d90855f0a78e664d807e\">Waffle House reveals why it will never shut down indoor dining again unless it&#39;s forced to, as the CEO takes a stand against lockdowns</a></em></p><p>Motta and other franchisees expressed concerns that higher prices would drive away customers and hurt business. But, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/15-minimum-wage-higher-menu-prices-waffle-house-potbelly-2020-11\">executives at chains including Kura Sushi, The Cheesecake Factory, and Texas Roadhouse </a>have said that, so far, customers have adjusted to higher menu prices related to higher pay. </p><p>Not every business can afford to raise wages to compete with companies like Amazon and Target that already pay at least $15 per hour.</p><p>Wulfraat said that some companies will try and replace some workers with automation, but that can be an expensive investment. Some will be forced to close, even after surviving the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>&#34;How are businesses that struggled during the pandemic, that were barely able to stay open now, being asked to pay people more money?&#34; said Ryan Alovis, the CEO of LensDirect.</p><p>&#34;Those people don&#39;t even want to show up to work, because they may actually be making more money at home than they will going to work,&#34; Alovis added, referring to enhanced unemployment benefits. &#34;We&#39;re in a scary cycle.&#34; </p><p>Businesses closing because they cannot afford to meet workers&#39; demands is part of a healthy free market system, experts say. </p><p>Analysts have been warning for years that there are too many <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/24/perspectives/retail-2020\">stores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190806/there-are-too-many-restaurants-food-industry-experts-say--poll\">restaurants</a> in the US, with supply outpacing demand. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/newsletters/five-things/latest\">Joe Weisenthal wrote in</a> Bloomberg Markets&#39; newsletter on Thursday that the tight labor market will help roots out &#34;zombie companies&#34; that are doomed in a truly free market. </p><p>&#34;And so now we might find out who the real zombies companies were - the companies that were only able to succeed due to cheap labor caused by a precarious market, and thus bringing the economy down as a whole,&#34; Weisenthal writes. </p><p>Drown said his time at Chipotle helped him come to a similar conclusion. </p><p>&#34;My opinion is that restaurants will only succeed if they are staffed properly and pay enough to meet the stress of it all,&#34; Drown said.</p><p>&#34;Without having both, turnover will keep going up,&#34; he continued. &#34;Slim staffing is really hurting restaurants, and that&#39;s the main reason we are seeing the whole industry struggle to meet demand.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-solution-pay-workers-higher-wages-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oxyxeqWgvqE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:50:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6081bd37354dde0018c06b1f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"286af24865557e78c7cf675dfb1329bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn74@2020_4/2021/04/25/17-26-54-577_1fe46ccdaa190764.webp","destWidth":2442,"destHeight":1832,"sourceBytes":166218,"destBytes":166218,"author":"ktaylor@businessinsider.com (Kate Taylor)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6081bd204becb800190f6991?format=jpeg":null,"https://i.insider.com/607f3fc844f4540019207d42?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn100@2020_1/2021/04/25/17-27-03-286_06739d1a93e70d12.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fce3ec6eadd8400183df70b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn96@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-821_5635f03fb4be99c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-27-01-639_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn49@2020_4/2021/04/25/17-27-03-508_7707f6bc7b835845.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-57-994_2f4bd64d4e739c5c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-58-549_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oxyxeqWgvqE:JDppd__JmJ8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn47@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-55-226_e46eb2f9c7b2c9dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oxyxeqWgvqE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_3/2021/04/25/17-26-55-659_f103bf4a3954a3e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619371596247},{"createdTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","updatedTime":"2021-04-26 01:26:36","title":"Indonesia says missing submarine has been found broken into pieces deep in the ocean","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/missing-indonesia-submarine-found-broken-into-pieces-deep-in-ocean-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60820c004becb800190f6ac9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Indonesia submarine\" height=\"809\" width=\"1619\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An KRI Nanggala-402 submarine owned by Indonesia, the same model as the one that went missing on Wednesday.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alex Widojo/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The missing Indonesian submarine has been found, according to Indonesian military officials.</li>\n<li>The vessel is reportedly deep in the ocean and broken into multiple pieces.</li>\n<li>&#34;It can be stated that the KRI Nanggala has sunk and all of its crew have died,&#34;
