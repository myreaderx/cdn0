The patients were discharged between February 10 and April 10, 2020, from three COVID-19–designated hospitals in Wuhan. Researchers followed their neurological health for a full year afterward.</p>\n<p>Their experiences in that year do not bode well for the rest of the world. The study authors, led by neurologist Yan-Jiang Wang of the Third Military Medical University, found that long-term cognitive decline is common after an infection with the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As such, health care systems around the world need to prepare for what could be a substantial increase in the number of people requiring dementia care.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840123#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840123&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:29:28 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238136391-800x533.jpeg","linkMd5":"16977c990036395bfc235201a40e824f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn54@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-28-191_b2a38ec5df62203b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":79694,"destBytes":40108,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238136391-800x533.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn54@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-28-191_b2a38ec5df62203b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5IyM-UJ5u6w:KLBvKeKvB_8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn92@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-34-860_8bacf6a149a3de90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698300},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Two months after receiving a pig heart, transplant patient dies","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839761","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_4194-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Image of surgeons surrounding a patient.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_4194.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"4016\" data-width=\"6016\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The transplant team with the replacement heart.

His death comes roughly two months after the transplant; the cause of death wasn't specified.</p>\n<p>The university's statement is short on details, and those will be critical for understanding the prospects for future transplants of this sort. Bennett was in very poor health at the time of the transplant, with his heart requiring mechanical assistance to keep him alive, so there are many potential explanations for his death that have nothing to do with the transplant. All the university is revealing is that the organ was not immediately rejected by Bennett's immune system and that his health had started declining several days prior to his death.</p>\n<p>Understanding the causes of his death is critical because Bennett will not be the last human to receive a pig organ. Shortly after his transplant, a different group <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/the-genetic-engineering-behind-pig-to-human-transplants/\">published results</a> from an early clinical trial using hearts from the same genetically engineered pigs. In this case, the hearts were transplanted into brain-dead individuals rather than being used to keep someone alive, but the trial clearly represented a step toward normal transplants.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839761#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839761&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 16:49:14 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_4194-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"440ba936db8044370afa86213e1a8581","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-732_481ab3afcea64402.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":94706,"destBytes":46190,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC_4194-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-732_481ab3afcea64402.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-34-959_d394377c86f47b76.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uMIPtSp4XN8:tPuWxvNm6w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn84@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-34-912_cdb4f8d82425d8f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698298},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"A transistor made using two atomically thin materials sets size record","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840243","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GrapheneSheet-CROPPED-800x441.jpeg\" alt=\"While graphene sheets can be large in length and width, their height is the same as a single carbon atom.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GrapheneSheet-CROPPED.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1103\" data-width=\"2000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> While graphene sheets can be large in length and width, their height is the same as a single carbon atom.

The discovery of atomically thin materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes, however, raised the prospect of replacing our manufacturing needs with the natural properties of these materials. There's no need to etch a 1 nanometer feature into silicon if you could simply use a carbon nanotube that's 1 nanometer wide.</p>\n<p>And there have been some <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/nanotubes-atomically-thin-material-smallest-transistor-ever/\">notable successes</a>, such as a 1 nanometer gate made of a single carbon nanotube. But the work often involves a difficult process of getting the atomically thin materials in the right place to create a functional device. And the rest of the hardware is typically made of bulkier materials that are borrowed from more traditional transistor design.</p>\n<p>A new paper released this week, however, describes a record-setting design that has the smallest transistor gate length yet reported. The record was set by the edge of a graphene sheet, meaning the gate is only a single carbon atom across. And, by using a second atomically thin material for a key component (plus a clever arrangement of parts), the team behind the design has made sure that the whole transistor is easy to make and relatively compact.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840243#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840243&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:20:09 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GrapheneSheet-CROPPED-800x441.jpeg","linkMd5":"193790b22765f1b41fd1b21fc44902d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-58-622_de71285978708827.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":441,"sourceBytes":121102,"destBytes":69692,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GrapheneSheet-CROPPED-800x441.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-58-622_de71285978708827.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn35@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-35-038_7e0e59881ea40f9f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=uZZOwRjeSzs:Im1TNjp5KHc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn52@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-940_e8bbeb9ee5ed7195.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698297},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"This extinct ten-armed fossil may be earliest known ancestor of vampire squid","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1838781","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/squid1ROTATE-800x532.jpg\" alt=\"An artistic reconstruction of the newly described 328-million-year-old vampyropod, &#60;em&#62;Syllipsimopodi bideni&#60;/em&#62;.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/squid1ROTATE.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"798\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> An artistic reconstruction of the newly described 328-million-year-old vampyropod, <em>Syllipsimopodi bideni</em>.

The 328-million-year-old fossil is the earliest known example of a vampyropod (ancient soft-bodied cephalopods) to date, pushing back the earliest evidence by 82 million years, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications. Other paleontologists aren't so sure, believing the specimen might represent a different known species of ancient cephalopods and calling for a full chemical analysis to confirm the species one way or the other.</p>\n<p>The fossil was excavated from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Gulch_Limestone\">Bear Gulch Limestone</a> in Montana. The fossils found there tend to be exceptionally well-preserved—sometimes even showing vascularization—thanks to the impact of seasonal monsoons. That heavy rainfall rapidly deposited sediments and other biological matter into the bay, in turn feeding algal blooms. Those algal blooms resulted in temporary oxygen-deprived zones, while the sudden infusion of fresh water from the rain would have lowered saline levels, according to the authors.</p>\n<p>The fossil was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in 1988, and there it sat, unnoticed for decades, until co-author Christopher Whalen, a postdoc in paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, was perusing the collection and spotted the arms.

In fact, Ithaca has already been used to help resolve an ongoing debate among historians about the correct dates for a group of ancient Athenian decrees. An interactive version of Ithaca is <a href=\"https://ithaca.deepmind.com\">freely available</a>, and the team is making its <a href=\"https://github.com/deepmind/ithaca\">code open source</a>.</p>\n<p>Many ancient sources—whether they be written on scrolls, papyri, stone, metal, or pottery—are so damaged that large chunks of text are often illegible. Determining where the texts originated can also be a challenge, since they have likely been moved multiple times. As for accurately determining when they were produced, radiocarbon dating and similar methods can't be used since they can damage the priceless artifacts. So the daunting and time-consuming task of interpreting these incomplete texts falls to so-called epigraphists who specialize in those skills.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839561#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839561&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:33:12 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ithaca2CROP-800x531.jpg","linkMd5":"863f46edf8db7809abdc7c4cb2d7329e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-58-824_ba4d970ca1ebc8f8.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":531,"sourceBytes":43976,"destBytes":26048,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ithaca2CROP-800x531.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-58-824_ba4d970ca1ebc8f8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-861_69c6661234109df3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=i8IM9l2cHn8:qed3RYPSsAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-34-920_feedc014c569e6c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698306},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Learning physiology by looking at the poisons that shut it down","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840454","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-95011729-800x601.jpg\" alt=\"Image of bottles with warning labels.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-95011729.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1500\" data-width=\"1998\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/bottles-with-toxic-labels-royalty-free-image/95011729?adppopup=true\">Adam Gault</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neil Bradbury is a physiology professor whose first book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3t6KRSf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>A Taste for Poison</em></a>, uses tales of poisons and poisoners as a means to explain physiological processes by describing how each poison disrupts them.

So we learn about how electrical signals are propagated down the length of nerve cells and then transmitted across synapses by neurotransmitters. That shows up in the chapter on atropine, the toxin in deadly nightshade that blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and again in the chapter on strychnine, a popular rat killer that blocks the neurotransmitter glycine. We learn about aerobic respiration in the chapter on cyanide, which prevents the mitochondria in our cells from using oxygen to generate energy. And we read about protein synthesis in the chapter about ricin, which destroys ribosomes, the complexes responsible for protein assembly in every cell.</span></p>\n<h2>A better alternative?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a pedagogical tool to teach physiology, the book is cute, but that’s about all it is.

Ordinary citizens become heroes; leaders become icons. But sometimes—like in the United States right now—a common enemy wins by exploiting divisions.</p>\n<p>As the US faced down a global viral threat two years ago, its people and leaders couldn't seem more factious and impotent against a shared foe. Most Americans seemed to embrace the evolving consensus of public health experts, heeding advice to follow basic and simple measures, like getting a safe and effective vaccine and wearing a mask. These measures might otherwise seem uncontroversial and like minor inconveniences. A vocal minority of Americans, however, leaned hard in the opposite direction, claiming that joining the fight against a deadly enemy infringed on their freedom—as if the US Constitution enshrined the right to freely spread disease and suffering to family, friends, and fellow Americans.</p>\n<p>Two years later, the US has tallied nearly 80 million cases. Nearly 960,000 people—grandparents, parents, siblings, children, infants, precious loved ones all—are dead. Nine hundred and sixty thousand. It's an unfathomable loss—a toll one might at least hope would stir reconsideration in those not fighting for the greater good. Yet, here we are two years and nearly 1 million deaths later, and many have not changed their positions. Some Americans still deny the devastating realities of the pandemic. Some spread dangerous misinformation, twist facts, and squabble over trivial points as lives hang in the balance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839576#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839576&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:15:15 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1372590701-800x527.jpeg","linkMd5":"00a13ebb1f84e64526619630ac68b9e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-04-462_2fd84625ae03ad92.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":527,"sourceBytes":55251,"destBytes":20528,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1372590701-800x527.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-04-462_2fd84625ae03ad92.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-34-872_6fccd546f69dd627.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=WVezx1PdDmo:KJKVRHdJkss:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn64@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-35-034_55359701312d6ee6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698299},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Rocket Report: Ariane 6 workers are “hyperstressed,” SpaceX retort to Rogozin","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1838646","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/va250-lanceur-en-zl_041-e1634199952481-800x566.jpg\" alt=\"A rocket sits on a launch pad at night.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/va250-lanceur-en-zl_041-e1634199952481.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"566\" data-width=\"800\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Only five Ariane 5 rockets remain before Europe will transition to the Ariane 6 vehicle.

Prior to the vote, supporters of the project said the spaceport would create jobs and diversify the county's economy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1838646#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1838646&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 12:00:22 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/va250-lanceur-en-zl_041-e1634199952481-800x566.jpg","linkMd5":"7c94225170205edda23eb33fb217e35a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-58-678_2137390ba8a6ee1b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":566,"sourceBytes":109228,"destBytes":63624,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/va250-lanceur-en-zl_041-e1634199952481-800x566.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-58-678_2137390ba8a6ee1b.webp","https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-34-844_4055b00eacca1e8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XitzLe_1JXQ:2AokkYyZb6I:F7zBnMyn0Lo":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698240},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Russia reportedly strikes Ukraine maternity hospital as health care attacks mount","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839834","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238870366-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"A nurse waits as another staff places sand bags near the window for protection in Kramatorsk City Hospital in eastern Ukraine.\n\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238870366.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"3201\" data-width=\"4802\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A nurse waits as another staff places sand bags near the window for protection in Kramatorsk City Hospital in eastern Ukraine.\n (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nurse-waits-as-another-staff-places-sand-bags-near-the-news-photo/1238870366?adppopup=true\">Getty | SOPA Images</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The World Health Organization has verified 18 Russian attacks on health care resources in Ukraine, including attacks on health care facilities, health workers, and ambulances, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing Wednesday.

By the time they reached the Weddell Sea in January 1915, accumulating pack ice and strong gales slowed progress to a crawl. <em>Endurance</em> became completely icebound on January 24, and by mid-February, Shackleton ordered the boilers to be shut off so that the ship would drift with the ice until the weather warmed sufficiently for the pack to break up.

It consists of an outer circle of vertical sandstone slabs (sarsen stones), connected on top by horizontal lintel stones. There is also an inner ring of smaller bluestones and, within that ring, several free-standing trilithons (larger sarsens joined by one lintel). Radiocarbon dating indicates that the inner ring of bluestones was set in place between 2400 and 2200 BCE. But the standing arrangement of sarsen stones wasn't erected until around 500 years after the bluestones.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1837358#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1837358&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 21:38:33 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stonehenge2-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"b23572ba431102a02a50a385b5f39c11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn63@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-58-786_10ae7b440261e356.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":33382,"destBytes":17894,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stonehenge2-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn63@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-58-786_10ae7b440261e356.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rykm5Qzt_Eg:ybtGF65BW0Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn60@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-35-033_88057f3b22dffd56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698300},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Extensive study finds small drop in brain volume after COVID-19","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839607","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ShowingBrain_CROPPED-800x504.jpeg\" alt=\"Colorful brain scan.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ShowingBrain_CROPPED.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1209\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/\">Getty Images</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Infection by SARS-CoV-2 causes a dizzying array of symptoms beyond the respiratory distress that is its most notable feature.

Due to partisan differences, this is how the budget process has worked for years in the United States.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839704#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1839704&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 13:22:30 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BillNelsonHappy-CROPPED-800x523.jpeg","linkMd5":"cd07ba5cba24a52a37beb6875ae774cb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn44@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-58-789_085d826af4920d4e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":523,"sourceBytes":37965,"destBytes":24390,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BillNelsonHappy-CROPPED-800x523.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn44@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-58-789_085d826af4920d4e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-34-868_303c419d199730e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=l1VbeFv1rEY:HkgAJlri7VY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-35-042_8cdff084412a8194.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698298},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"Amazon rainforest is losing its ability to recover from destruction","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1838923","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amazon-deforestation-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Deforestation in the Amazon to create grazing for cattle.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amazon-deforestation.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2048\" data-width=\"3072\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Deforestation in the Amazon to create grazing for cattle.

Researchers have also reported a smattering of cases in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. So far, epidemiology data on the recombinant's spread does not raise any red flags, and the variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, according to WHO technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove, who addressed the variant in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/multi-media/details/who-press-conference-on-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-and-ukraine---9-march-2022\">a press briefing this week</a>.

Among the most significant seismic disasters recorded, more than 100,000 people lost their lives. The damage—<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191019114704/http:/idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=35074108\">costing billions</a> of dollars—rendered more than a million people homeless and destroyed much of the region’s infrastructure. The earth tore at the relatively shallow depth of about 8 miles, toppling poorly constructed buildings.</p>\n<p>At the time, Haiti had no national seismic network. After the devastating event, scientists installed expensive seismic stations around the country, but that instrumentation requires funding, care, and expertise; today, those stations are no longer functional. In 2019, seismologists opted to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.542654/full#B22\">try something different</a> and far less expensive—citizen seismology via Raspberry Shakes.</p>\n<p>On the morning of August 14, 2021, amidst a summer of COVID-19 lockdowns and political unrest, another earthquake struck, providing the opportunity to test just how useful these Raspberry-pi powered devices could be. In a paper published on Thursday in Science, researchers described using the Raspberry Shake data to demonstrate that this citizen science network successfully monitored both the mainshock and subsequent aftershocks and provided data integral to untangling what turned out to be a less-than-simple rending of the earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840555#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840555&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 13:00:04 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EAG9310-800x532.jpg","linkMd5":"fb01dd0453ac2d12646633706d54c36f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-58-591_9c30eea03f1aa565.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":532,"sourceBytes":67004,"destBytes":30204,"author":"Ars Contributors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EAG9310-800x532.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-58-591_9c30eea03f1aa565.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-893_0c32478f63a4811c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Aebo9zVyhMs:zeV_S9Qm6x4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn44@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-35-042_8cb6cf20a229600f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698176},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"How would an Earth-like planet look in Alpha Centauri?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840304","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.694977622-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's impression of what an Earth-like planet might look like in a nearby star system.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.694977622.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"581\" data-width=\"930\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Artist's impression of what an Earth-like planet might look like in a nearby star system.

From their model and this data, they could estimate possible compositions of a hypothetical rocky planet in the system’s habitable zone. “You get a model of the chemical composition of rocky planets that would be in the habitable zone,” Charley Lineweaver, one of the paper’s authors, told Ars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840304#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840304&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 23:03:35 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.694977622-800x500.jpg","linkMd5":"e585a96afc7cd82e3311daa56adbeca7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn47@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-58-692_e20ecec69518039c.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":28947,"destBytes":16142,"author":"Doug Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image.imageformat.fullwidth.694977622-800x500.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn47@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-58-692_e20ecec69518039c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-35-044_bee8d63e6902619a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=GYeltCsI_2U:k6XAuNH7YyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn27@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-34-899_865c17c416e666fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-34-870_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245698196},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:58","title":"No, Russia has not threatened to leave an American astronaut behind in space","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1840469","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1189005183-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"A warmly dressed man in a hardhat.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1189005183.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin has been tweeting like he's unhinged since Russia invaded Ukraine.

SpaceNews, for example, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/soyuz-embargo-strands-satellites-with-limited-launch-options/\">tallied 16 commercial launches</a> that had been scheduled to fly on the Russian Soyuz rocket during the next two years. These payloads are now stranded, affecting customers ranging from the private company OneWeb, to the European Commission, to the government of Sweden. And the joint Europe-Russia probe scheduled to launch to Mars this year, ExoMars, will be delayed for years and may very well be canceled, sources say.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this has led to speculation about the fate of the International Space Station, which has 15 partner nations and is the crown jewel of unity in space between NASA and Russia.
