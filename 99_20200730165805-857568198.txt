Folklore only bolsters their theories.</p> <p id=\"XnNUcY\">Taylor Swift’s new album <em>Folklore</em> dropped July 24, and despite the last-minute notice, it immediately became something of a pop culture flashpoint. The intrigue stems both from its high-quality songs and its departure from the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/26/18518142/taylor-swift-me-single-old-taylor-new-taylor\">blanket self-absorption</a> found on previous Swift albums.<em> Folklore</em>, fans and critics agreed, is a stand-out in Swift’s catalogue and beyond. </p>\n<p id=\"ZNRgat\">Swift’s attempts to move away from lyrical navel-gazing resulted in an album largely focused on third-party narratives, which also serve as allegorical and metaphorical reflections on Swift’s own life and emotions. So, naturally, <em>Folklore</em>’s songs about other people are stirring up the biggest rumors and debate about Swift. Most of the album’s tales about other people also feel like coded confessions — the kind that Swift typically likes to offer about herself.</p>\n<p id=\"OanDrU\">And a lot of those confessions, should you choose to take them as such, are really ... well ... gay. Or, rather, <em>sapphic</em>, as you might explain to your local <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harold-theyre-lesbians\">Harold</a>. </p>\n<aside id=\"Qh9Guj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How Taylor Swift reset her image with Folklore\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21337131/taylor-swift-folklore-image\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"kEjjgL\">Fans have homed in on two songs on the album — track seven, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEY-GPsru_E\">Seven,</a>” and track 15, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAPqXkZW_I\">Betty</a>” — and declared them to be loaded with explicit and inferred queer symbolism.

Isn’t Tay straight? Isn’t she in love with that <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25654362/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-timeline/\">exhaustingly generic British guy</a> she keeps writing songs about? Isn’t <em>Folklore </em>presumably full of songs about heterosexual romance? The answer to all those questions is an emphatic yes — but that doesn’t necessarily make <em>Folklore</em> any less gay. </p>\n<p id=\"nEhnPi\">In fact, despite its textual straightness, <em>Folklore</em> is burning up queer social media and reviving longstanding rumors about Swift’s own sexuality — especially the internet theory about her great secret lesbian love affair. Combining this gossip with Swift’s increasingly outspoken LGBTQ advocacy and <em>Folklore’</em>s witchy queer cottagecore vibe, we have all the ingredients for a steaming hot brew of queer subtext.</p>\n<h3 id=\"El2DXZ\">Rumors about Tay’s personal life have long been entangled with the sapphic themes of her music</h3>\n<p id=\"mBnYSy\">The queering of Taylor Swift involves a combination of classic signposts: gossip, politics, and subtext.</p>\n<p id=\"J0ihi2\">Even as a Taylor Swift fan, you may have missed the mountains of internet lore devoted to the belief that Swift is bisexual. The primary fuel for this is the intense fandom conspiracy that Swift previously was in a relationship with her famous best friend, the supermodel Karlie Kloss. Kaylor, as the women are known as together, is an<strong> </strong>epic ship by any standards, and the rabbit hole of Kaylor “evidence” is <a href=\"https://kaylorevidence.com/masterposts/\">duly intense</a>. The two were first <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/865383/taylor-swift-the-single-life/\">friendly on social media</a>, then reportedly became friends at the 2013 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which was itself kind of <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a15266/taylor-swift-victorias-secret-fashion-show/\">a sapphic wet dream</a>. Fans like to make much of Taylor behind the scenes that night, <a href=\"https://ailurophiles.co.vu/post/143723813530/darkgreytshirt-speaknowaf-can-we-talk-about\">caught on camera gazing at Karlie</a> in what looks like mesmerized awe.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tW5TmIXJ-eQn9V4lgM8ddRDK9dQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20343347/tumblr_o1x3t4ri4c1u5ycmgo1_500.gif\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://helplessgay.tumblr.com/post/138652066252/kaylorgifs-x\" target=\"_blank\">helplessgay</a> / Tumblr</cite>\n      <figcaption>Oh, girl, we know.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"cySTnS\">“I do feel confident that they at least had a fling,” Sarah Dickson told me of Kaylor. Dickson is a queer fan who started to pay more attention to Swift after 2014’s breakout <em>1989</em>, which had a strong “queer vibe” that resonated with her. She quickly fell down the internet rabbit hole of speculation over which <em>1989</em> songs referenced Kaylor. As they’ve done with so many of Swift’s (straight) relationships, Swift obsessives have devoted <a href=\"https://kaylorevidence.com/2019/03/songs-about-karlie/\">reams of analysis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/is-cornelia-street-about-karlie-kloss-taylor-swift-fans-have-a-theory-about-the-lover-song-18696153\">decoding</a> the many alleged <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/music/2017/11/9/16625462/taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-kaylor-tumblr-shipping\">references</a> to Karlie in Taylor’s songwriting. (There’s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rE33nMNB8twCdPLVQudM4kN0N5gv7UnnYQfYy0t3ObI/mobilepresent?slide=id.g3b692fe12f_0_378\">37-page PowerPoint</a> just about possible hints of Kaylor on the album <em>Reputation</em> alone.) There’s also plenty of accompanying “evidence” that the two friends may have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaffypark/status/540751424913948672\">blurred the line</a> between friendship and romance.</p>\n<p id=\"TWm9Iw\">“I don’t know if they would have called each other ‘girlfriends,’” Dickson told me. “[But] it seemed to be more than just a really strong friendship.”</p>\n<p id=\"Zrye9q\">Despite years of a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/kaylor-covers-vogue\">very public</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.co.za/celebrity-news/10-times-kaylor-taught-us-better-couple/\">intimate</a> friendship, Kaylor has cooled off. Swift <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28676533/why-taylor-swift-didnt-go-to-karlie-kloss-two-weddings/\">skipped out</a> on Kloss’s two separate wedding ceremonies in 2018 and 2019, and a <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/08/10/inside-the-downfall-of-taylor-swift-and-karlie-kloss-friendship/\">2019 rumor</a> held that Kloss had <a href=\"https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/116453788.html\">sided with the mega-producer and noted Swift villain</a> Scooter Braun in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/1/20677241/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-controversy-explained\">Swift’s ongoing feud with Braun</a> over the rights to her old master recordings. </p>\n<p id=\"ZycSKx\">And you can make the argument that trying to shoehorn Kaylor into a romance belittles the unique closeness of <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/test2/2004/10/04/girlfriends_2/\">female friendships</a>. “The thing that I have the most trouble with is that I don’t want to force this assumption [about Swift and Kloss’s sexuality] on people I don’t know,” Dickson admitted. </p>\n<aside id=\"4tMg94\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Unpacking the twisty genre of political fanfiction through Curtis Sittenfeld’s Rodham\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/7/10/21315905/vox-book-club-rodham-week-1-political-fanfiction-rpf\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"QSCXTr\">“I think sometimes that probably the reason [celebrity friends get paired together romantically] is because our culture strips us of the vocabulary to understand something like that outside of the context of romance,” my friend Stacey Lantagne, a longtime fan, reminded me. “Friendships [of all kinds] do not get cultural weight, because our culture places all of the value in a single romantic relationship that is supposed to sustain you over time.” </p>\n<p id=\"rkhsYj\">But such friendships frequently <em>do</em> get full attention in a Taylor Swift album. Whether Kaylor was ever real or not, the fact that so many Swifties (a.k.a. Taylor’s hardcore fans) believed it so intensely speaks to the larger, ongoing presence of sapphic friendships that fills her music. Much of that subtext is implied through things like her vague (and occasionally <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1j8HFpL_y5M?t=161\">gender-flipped</a>) pronoun choices, her music videos, and the rampant blurring in her songs between empowered female friendships and intimate lesbian ones.</p>\n<div id=\"VHCUpy\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmujCAtRav0?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"fE8wjh\">The tension between “friends” and “more than friends” fits right into Swift’s famously confessional songwriting, which is rife with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/24/20708383/taylor-swift-archer-lover-track-five\">intimate musings on love and loss</a>. It’s no wonder fans have devoted <a href=\"https://medium.com/@carolyngearig/taylor-swifts-gayest-songs-ranked-by-gayness-ac5e7c8d4df\">lists</a> and <a href=\"https://thebookishactress.wordpress.com/2018/07/29/top-twenty-gayest-taylor-swift-songs/\">more lists</a> to calling out the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/7j6vwq/the_gayest_taylor_swift_songs_add_yours/\">gayest lyrics</a> in her musical pantheon. Among their strongest contenders for straight songs that are actually gay: 2009’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw\">You Belong With Me</a>,” which famously spawned a version from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhlyESuSBwo\">gay male perspective</a> that reinforced Swifties’ belief that the song was about repressed homosexuality all along; and 2018’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIVdnXW-6Xg\">Dress</a>” (“Our secret moments in your crowded room / They’ve got no idea about me and you ... I don’t want you like a best friend / Only bought this dress so you could take it off”).</p>\n<p id=\"TLXcZw\">“People say that you can find queer subtext anywhere, if that’s what you’re looking for,” Dickson said. “But there’s something about Taylor’s music [...] Even though she’s the epitome of popular music, she doesn’t seem that concerned with what gender roles she takes on in her writing. She’s not afraid to have her perspective take the ‘masculine’ role, while still being really soft, which feels very ‘woman-loving-woman’ to me.”</p>\n<p id=\"v4ztKb\">One can argue, then, that a subtle “queer vibe” has been present in aspects of Swift’s music all along. Only in recent years has that subtext gotten such widespread attention, thanks not only to Kaylor but to Swift’s growing political conscience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Ld6j3j\">Swift’s emerging political activism has only bolstered her queer vibe</h3>\n<p id=\"Ck7SoT\">Much like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/9/16598106/taylor-swift-reputation-intimacy-control\">her celebrity persona</a> in general, Swift’s politics used to be a confusing and even shadowy subject. Because Swift started out as a country music artist, many people assumed over the years that her personal politics, like those of many country music artists, skewed conservative. Her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/8/13565144/who-is-taylor-swift-voting-for-clinton-trump-election\">refusal to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton</a> or even engage with the 2016 election at all even briefly turned her into <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ae5x8a/cant-shake-it-off-how-taylor-swift-became-a-nazi-idol\">a white supremacist icon</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"uYhFMc\">Swift <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/8/20791816/taylor-swift-hillary-clinton-2016-endorsement-vogue-september-issue\">later explained</a> her decision to say silent, saying that she thought an endorsement from her would likely turn more people <em>against</em> Clinton than help the candidate. Swift referred both to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/09/opinions/streep-golden-globes-cane-opinion/index.html\">Trump’s anti-celebrity populism</a> and her own reputation as a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/15/21067331/warren-is-a-snake-hashtag-explained\">snake</a>” as reasons not to publicly lend support to Clinton; she was in the throes of backlash that year, due to Kim Kardashian West’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210858/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-snapchat-kanye-west\">July 2016 release</a> of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/26/20828559/taylor-swift-kanye-west-2009-mtv-vmas-explained\">taped phone call</a> appearing to paint Swift as a manipulative liar. (That same tape was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/21/21189239/taylor-swift-kanye-west-famous-leaked-phone-call-kanye-west-is-over-party\">reframed in Swift’s favor</a> years later, in March 2020.)</p>\n<p id=\"eZp3X4\">After Trump won the presidential race in 2016, Swift decided it was time to use her platform for change. She <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/7/17949592/taylor-swift-politics-democrat-instagram-phil-bredesen-marsha-blackburn\">incited fierce backlash in 2018</a> after she urged fans in her home state of Tennessee not to vote for the stridently homophobic senatorial candidate Marsha Blackburn. (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/6/18049520/midterm-election-results-tennessee-senate-marsha-blackburn-winner\">Blackburn won anyway</a>, perhaps proving Taylor’s point about people resenting and turning against her.) In her January 2020 documentary, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/28/21095321/miss-americana-taylor-swift-documentary-interview-lana-wilson-netflix-sundance\"><em>Miss Americana</em></a>, Swift tearily argued with her team about her desire to say something about Blackburn, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leCrPcbAZaE\">a scene</a> that seemingly confirmed that her newfound political advocacy was genuine and personal. </p>\n<p id=\"HpOKJ3\">Yet despite her prior resistance against expressing herself politically, Swift has long been a subtle advocate for equality. Vogue’s Abby Aguirre pointed this out in <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019\">a September 2019 cover story</a> on the artist, noting that music videos and songs from as far back as 2010 have portrayed her acceptance of gay relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"GKVzwV\">This relatively rosy track record of inclusivity notwithstanding, many fans have been skeptical. “I think she wants to be seen as an ally,” Dickson said. She cited lines like <em>1989</em>’s “you can want... boys and boys and girls and girls...” as some of the less effective moments from that album. “It was just very awkwardly performative.”</p>\n<p id=\"iGGz91\">At times, this awkward performativity from Swift has overshadowed her music. With songs with titles like “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuXNumBwDOM\">Me!</a>” and entire albums dedicated to processing her relationships past and current, Swift has always been pointedly self-interested. But throughout 2019, she added activism on behalf of gay rights to her list of showy traits. In June, she released her single “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/17/18682588/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-gay-anthem\">You Need To Calm Down</a>” as a Pride month anthem for gay rights. This song’s accompanying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\">music video</a> was again awash in rainbow colors and featured <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/17/18681878/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-video-celebrity-guide\">a litany of queer and trans celebrities</a>, from Laverne Cox to Ellen DeGeneres. For this stunt, she was met with <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/06/21/how-taylor-swift-angered-everyone-you-need-calm-down/1512715001/\">heavy criticism</a> from the queer community for appropriating and commodifying the cause — but she also drew praise from fans convinced that the song was part of Swift’s own gradual, ongoing, coming-out process.<strong> </strong>They pointed to what seemed to be <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/music/taylor-swift-bisexual-music-video/\">coded references to Taylor’s bisexuality</a> in the music video for the song, including a scene where she dyed her hair in what appeared to be the colors of the bisexual flag. </p>\n<p id=\"QMzJ8n\">Barely two months later, Swift ignited more speculation that her advocacy and her sexuality were entwined like two girls in a hot tub when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0yzUuGjB7q/\">posted an Instagram photo</a> of her wearing a “PROUD” bracelet, using a filter with colors identical to those of the bisexual pride flag. That escapade led to headlines like “<a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/08/07/fans-are-convinced-taylor-swift-just-came-out-as-bisexual/\">Fans are convinced Taylor Swift just came out as bisexual</a>,” which resulted in Swift <a href=\"https://www.out.com/news/2019/8/08/taylor-swift-says-shes-straight-despite-all-bisexual-rumors\">later clarifying</a> that she didn’t consider herself a part of the queer community (though she didn’t address whether she herself identified as queer). </p>\n<p id=\"pUORVj\">All of these contradictions make Swift a complicated ally to stan. “There are plenty of other, much better icons or people to look up to,” Dickson told me. “I don’t want to give her too much credit when I don’t know her.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id=\"81yTcD\">But Swift’s self-promoting style also makes the conscious decision to add queer-aligned elements into her art that much more significant. </p>\n<p id=\"JsIFAl\">“I think she’s a very smart person, because she’s managed her own image very well,” Dickson said, “so most things she does are very purposeful. Here’s this perfect straight white cis woman, this American daughter from a country [music] background, but when she does breach that image she’s created, it’s very intentional.”</p>\n<p id=\"vbjXgi\">In other words, this queer circus surrounding Swift is really due to her own occasional subversion of the carefully crafted American Girl persona she’s created. And that occasional deviance has led us right to <em>Folklore</em>, which takes all of this speculation — and arguably Swift’s subversiveness — to a whole new level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"azpsfk\">\n<em>Folklore</em> is full of witchy lesbian vibes and a lot of outright gay symbolism</h3>\n<p id=\"zDugJ5\">Because queerness is traditionally framed as something deviant, as a subversion of social norms, queer subtext in media usually goes hand in hand with some other kind of social subversion. In horror and fantasy, for example, villains and monsters are often metaphors for queerness: Vampires are homoerotic, werewolves are repressed, and witches are sapphic. </p>\n<p id=\"KxQS4N\"><em>Folklore</em> doesn’t feature any outright witches, but it does have a strong <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/7/7/21315213/cottagecore-tiktok-dark-academia\">cottagecore vibe</a>, and it’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21337131/taylor-swift-folklore-image\">teeming with women behaving badly</a>, a theme <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2018/10/31/18047208/trump-witch-hunt\">perennially tied to witches</a>. The album’s best song, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s5xdY6MCeI\">The Last Great American Dynasty</a>,” is all about the story of Rebekah Harkness, the scandalous Rhode Island heiress whose <a href=\"https://www.theday.com/article/20130505/NWS05/305059947\">huge coastal mansion Swift bought in 2013</a>. Harkness, like Swift, had her own titillating <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/taylor-swift-squad-timeline-katy-perry-karlie-kloss.html\">“bitch squad”</a> and a bad reputation. She wasn’t a witch, but it’s easy to imagine Harkness and her gang <a href=\"https://news.avclub.com/dont-worry-some-baby-witches-tried-to-hex-the-moon-b-1844442874\">hexing the moon</a> and accidentally enraging some brawny male god. </p>\n<div id=\"nutd8M\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">manifesting witchy cottagecore folklore in new taylor swift album and mv <a href=\"https://t.co/Mzo23E9L1o\">pic.twitter.com/Mzo23E9L1o</a></p>— alma (@filmjolnir) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/filmjolnir/status/1286329499479498753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"H7hBfN\">Musically, <em>Folklore</em> eschews the radio pop earworms of Swift’s more recent albums and returns to the primarily country-influenced, more acoustic sounds of her earlier days. That sonic palette leaves the impression that Swift is looking into the past to gain insight into her future. Swift uses the stories of other, often fictional people in <em>Folklore</em> to reflect indirectly on her own life and identity — and while not explicitly queer, Swift’s storytelling veers toward the consciously homoerotic. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"dTVSAy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:9337151\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"Iwv8ku\">The song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEY-GPsru_E\">Seven</a>” is about an intense friendship between Taylor’s narrator and a childhood friend, who seems to have been an abuse victim. Though she can no longer remember her friend’s face, Swift still longs to protect her. There are no gendered pronouns given for Swift’s friend, but between references to the other girl’s “braids” and “dolls,” the assumption is there. “</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"im8abZ\">And I think you should come live with me</p>\n<p id=\"DItPHq\">And we can be pirates</p>\n<p id=\"LO862r\">Then you won’t have to cry</p>\n<p id=\"uXQVbq\">Or hide in the closet</p>\n<p id=\"fpZGvH\">And just like a folk song</p>\n<p id=\"W9maY3\">Our love will be passed on ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"PW3rF7\">Even though the characters in “Seven” seem to be kids, the narrator’s adulthood reminiscence is laced with queer symbolism. “This truly sounds like an ode to a childhood queer girl crush,” Dickson told me. In addition to the obvious closet metaphor and the references to a secret love, Swift sings about wanting to escape with her friend to India, and loving her “to the moon and to Saturn” — Saturn being, according to some astrologers, <a href=\"https://www.intomore.com/culture/third-gender-and-homosexuality-in-astrology\">a trans and lesbian deity</a> in Hindu astrology. Fans have read other coded queer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_amllis/status/1286581681642778625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1286581681642778625%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\">references</a> into the song, all while pointing to the song’s overall theme of yearning and idealized love as the most obvious example of all.  </p>\n<p id=\"pYqGSw\"><strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAPqXkZW_I\">Betty</a>” is even more explicit — so much so that the track’s apparent queerness took social media by surprise, instantly becoming the track no one could stop talking about. “Betty” is the last of a triptych of songs on the album outlining a fictional love triangle between a teen girl named Betty, another girl, Inez, and a 17-year-old boy named James. </p>\n<aside id=\"sr72nO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The 6 songs that explain Taylor Swift’s new album, Folklore\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/7/24/21337105/taylor-swift-folklore-lyrics-best-songs-rebekah-harkness\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"1zNYLB\">Swift, in narrating a far more nuanced portrait of infidelity than she’s ever told before, appears to have put a little of herself into all three viewpoints. In “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLSUp53y-HQ\">Cardigan</a>,” the first of the three songs, Betty looks at her relationship with James both before and after he cheated on her with Inez. “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn_0zPAfyo8\">August</a>” sees Inez plaintively describing the summer fling she knew wouldn’t last; and finally, in “Betty,” James looks back on his decision to cheat on Betty as “the worst thing I ever did,” describing how “I dreamed of you all summer long.”</p>\n<p id=\"Ua8qQY\">On one level, Swift’s character of James reads like a typical teenage boy, brash and malleable. But because Taylor is named after James Taylor, <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/is-taylor-swifts-betty-about-karlie-kloss-the-new-song-is-fueling-a-popular-theory-29974284\">some Kaylor truthers</a> are reading the fictional James as a stand-in for Swift herself — which would make the entire song overtly queer. So lines like the following suddenly become not Swift’s typical straight teen love story, but a subversive exploration of queer desire:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"E3Ivqc\">But if I just showed up at your party</p>\n<p id=\"rCvimJ\">Would you have me? Would you want me?</p>\n<p id=\"Pu7e4O\">Would you tell me to go fuck myself</p>\n<p id=\"O3hgPs\">Or lead me to the garden? ...</p>\n<p id=\"zXfkvh\"></p>\n<p id=\"gMYxz7\">Yeah, I showed up at your party</p>\n<p id=\"jgHGrw\">Will you have me? Will you love me?</p>\n<p id=\"Q6V1Mv\">Will you kiss me on the porch</p>\n<p id=\"joEwEU\">In front of all your stupid friends?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"His8Vs\">Yeah, all of this seems really, really gay. Suffice it to say that “Betty” has sparked a deluge of queer Taylor fans claiming the song as their own.</p>\n<div id=\"0BulAw\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You heard the rumors from Inez? <a href=\"https://t.co/FinuCjbmFN\">pic.twitter.com/FinuCjbmFN</a></p>— whembley (@whembleysewell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whembleysewell/status/1286545461353095169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"G7vu3d\">The song has <a href=\"https://www.laineygossip.com/taylor-swifts-new-album-folklore-about-storytelling-instead-of-settling-scores/66712\">galvanized</a> all the Kaylor shippers — because, come on, which other girl but Karlie would Tay still be pining over years later?</p>\n<div id=\"dS32cC\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">karlie’s husband and joe alwyn listening to betty <a href=\"https://t.co/HoWp8XZSYJ\">pic.twitter.com/HoWp8XZSYJ</a></p>— jasmine (@ladyinthealps) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyinthealps/status/1286692467149017088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"qIyKjm\">Of course, believing that “Betty” — and Taylor — are queer requires ignoring the song’s text that it’s a song about a girl and a boy, and jumping ahead to the subtext. It’s entirely possible that all of this is just in our intense imagination (and in the imaginations, apparently, of most of the internet). As we’ve noted, “Betty” is far from the first example where Swift’s lyrics have proved to be fertile ground for queer interpretation, however unintentional.</p>\n<div id=\"l1dFVD\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Look, I dont give 2 shits if taylor swift said that \"betty\" is from a man's perspective, I'm still gonna take it as my new lesbian anthem <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Folklore?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Folklore</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/j1oEo01Nln\">pic.twitter.com/j1oEo01Nln</a></p>—    |     ( )       |    (@valixe_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valixe_/status/1286633504533614595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<div id=\"ZBwJdh\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">adding betty to my sapphic playlist <a href=\"https://t.co/NeY0K8AAAE\">pic.twitter.com/NeY0K8AAAE</a></p>— grace (@goldnstyles_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goldnstyles_/status/1286583694673629185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"ZuxwfB\">It’s also fully possible that Swift <em>is</em> intentionally writing queer subtext to give her work an added layer of tension and nuance. After all, lots of writers <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/jane-epsenson-inteview\">do exactly that</a>; writing queer subtext doesn’t make you queer any more than writing a male/male romance turns you into a gay man. </p>\n<p id=\"fIOcIM\">What the addition of subtext <em>does</em> do, as Swift is undoubtedly aware, is allow more people to see themselves in, and relate to, the music and the storytelling. Not only does a queer reading of <em>Folklore</em> further validate all the earlier queer readings of many of Swift’s other songs, it also opens up possibilities for more nuanced, equally rewarding readings of Swift’s songs:</p>\n<div id=\"7qjqB8\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">anyways james is a nonbinary lesbian and betty is a trans lesbian</p>— raiberry !! ✿ (@GENDERPHOBE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GENDERPHOBE/status/1286765157994070017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"J3fpB5\">Sadly for gay America, none of this brings us closer to Taylor Swift coming out as queer and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/21/20827218/taylor-swift-re-recording-master-rights-scooter-braun\">re-recording all her songs</a> with all the appropriate gender-swapped imagery. And while Swift’s storytelling has undoubtedly grown, it has at times been <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/1664730/taylor-swift-songwriting/\">regressively straight</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/17/18682588/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-gay-anthem\">her allyship so far is flawed at best</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"uofeom\">But if <em>Folklore</em> is all about the way other people’s narratives can tell you something about your own story, then perhaps the ultimate reading of <em>Folklore</em> is as a prism through which queer people can glimpse a fragment of themselves. We may not be able to claim Swift as our own — but we can claim her songs. And that makes them mean more for everyone.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

There is no evidence whatsoever supporting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ru0WNd\">Universal mail-in voting refers to a practice where states automatically mail a ballot to all registered voters within the state — a ballot that can then be cast by mail or returned in-person to various polling sites. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-your-state-election-under-pandemic-conditions\">seven states</a> — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington — are vote-by-mail states.</p>\n<p id=\"r8gYkU\">Vote-by-mail is not a new practice. Oregon became the <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/history-vote-by-mail-oregon-elections/\">first state to adopt this practice in 2000</a>. Since then, the state has provided over 100 million mail-in ballots to voters since 2000. It has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-vote-mail.html\">only documented 12 cases of fraud</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"3aOlng\">In 2018, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, a Trump appointee spoke to Colorado election officials and effusively praised the vote-by-mail state as a model of safe and secure elections. “We’d love to continue to <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/06/colorado-tops-us-in-vote-security/\">use you as an example of what other states can adopt</a>,” Trump’s homeland security secretary told the Colorado election officials at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"imeg0H\">So Trump isn’t simply using false fears to justify delaying the November election — he’s using false fears that his own administration rejected as recently as two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"XTAS3m\">This brings us to the question of whether Trump can actually delay, or even cancel, the election. The short answer to this question is “no.”</p>\n<p id=\"M1beho\">A trio of federal laws set Election Day for <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1\">presidential electors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1\">senators</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7\">US representatives</a> as “the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.” If Republicans want to change this law, they would need to go through the Democratic House.</p>\n<p id=\"PI8ct3\">The 20th Amendment, moreover, provides that “the terms of the President and the Vice President <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xx\">shall end at noon on the 20th day of January</a>.” Thus, even if the election were somehow canceled, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s terms would still expire as scheduled — although, as explained below, the question of who would succeed them is devilishly complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"BOflgh\">That doesn’t necessarily mean that the November election is safe. Republican state governors and legislatures may still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/21/21188152/trump-cancel-november-election-constitution-coronavirus\">manipulate their own election rules</a> to give an advantage to Trump. But Trump does not have the lawful power to delay or cancel an election.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iaNB0u\">Who gets to decide when an election is held?</h3>\n<p id=\"TH5pi1\">There are different sets of rules for congressional elections and presidential elections.</p>\n<p id=\"UTcJix\">For congressional elections, the Constitution provides that “the times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei\">but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations</a>, except as to the places of choosing Senators.” This means that both Congress and state lawmakers have control over when a congressional election is held, but Congress has the final word if there’s a disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"GwubuF\">Congress has set the date of House and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1\">Senate elections</a> for “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7\">the Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November</a>.” Neither Trump nor any state official has the power to alter this date. Only a subsequent act of Congress could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"xteXvL\">The picture for presidential elections is slightly more complicated. A <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1\">federal statute</a> does provide that “the electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November,” so states must choose members of the Electoral College on the same day as a congressional election takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"atJQ0p\">That said, there is technically no constitutional requirement that a state must hold an election to choose members of the Electoral College. The Constitution provides that “each state shall appoint, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii\">in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct</a>, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.” So a state legislature could theoretically decide to select presidential electors out of a hat. More worrisome, a legislature controlled by one party could potentially appoint loyal members of that party directly to the Electoral College.</p>\n<p id=\"TEC1fF\">Yet while state lawmakers theoretically have this power, the idea that presidents are chosen by popular election is now so ingrained into our culture that it is highly unlikely any state legislature would try to appoint electors directly. By 1832, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/state-law-on-the-nomination-election-and-instruction-of-presidential-electors/94797574E044DE4F8C3D67AF657930DC\">every US state except South Carolina</a> used a popular election to choose members of the Electoral College. South Carolina came around in the 1860s.</p>\n<p id=\"NmjJlX\">Moreover, once a state decides to hold an election to choose members of the Electoral College, all voters must be afforded equal status. As the Supreme Court explained in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10289081725638058283&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections</em></a> (1966), “once the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”</p>\n<p id=\"8qCuhp\">Additionally, even if a state did decide to appoint electors directly, that would require the state to enact a law changing its method of selecting members of the Electoral College. Several crucial swing states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, have Democratic governors who could veto such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"kEhnfK\">All of which is a long way of saying that the risk that an election will be outright canceled — or that a state may try to take the power to remove President Trump away from its people — is exceedingly low.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cp1Q8T\">Okay, but if the election <em>is</em> canceled, what happens then?</h3>\n<p id=\"tA2yGJ\">Let’s presume, for just a moment, that the election does not happen as scheduled, for whatever reason. Who does that leave in charge? It turns out that the answer to this question is surprisingly complicated, and it may turn on whether at least one state manages to name individuals to the Electoral College.</p>\n<p id=\"itG9gj\">Buckle up. This is about to get really deep into the constitutional weeds.</p>\n<p id=\"S8kFmO\">The 12th Amendment provides that after the members of the Electoral College are chosen, those electors shall meet and cast their ballots, and “the person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xii\">if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"wSZKF0\">It’s unclear what happens if only some states hold the presidential election as scheduled, while others fail to appoint electors at all, but the 12th Amendment’s text (“a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed”) suggests that the total number of electors needed to choose a president declines if some states do not appoint anyone to the Electoral College. If only 100 electors are appointed, 51 electoral votes could potentially be enough to choose a president.</p>\n<p id=\"Niil6z\">Needless to say, this quirk of the Constitution’s text gives every state an incentive to hold their election. If a bloc of red states delays the election, while blue states do not, Republicans could effectively forfeit the Electoral College vote.</p>\n<p id=\"jxlQhN\">But let’s say that no one wins a majority of the electors. If that happens, the power to choose a president falls to the House — but with a twist. If the House is called upon to choose a president, it must choose one of the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. Moreover, each state’s congressional delegation has only one vote, and “<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xii\">a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"1LGY39\">While Democrats have a substantial majority in the US House as a whole, Republicans control a <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/states\">majority of the House seats in 26 states</a> — just enough to choose a president. That said, this number could easily change. In many states, one party controls only one or two seats more than the other. If a handful of House members are incapacitated due to coronavirus, that could potentially alter the outcome of a House vote to choose the president.</p>\n<p id=\"S7Uw0P\">Now let’s shift gears to a scenario where no members of the Electoral College are appointed. In this scenario, the House cannot choose a president because the 12th Amendment requires it to choose from among the three candidates who receive the most electoral votes.</p>\n<p id=\"mk56QH\">Under the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xx%5C\">20th Amendment</a>, “the terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d [sic] day of January.” So, if no one is elected to replace these officials, Trump and Pence cease to be elected officials the minute their terms expire on January 20. Members of the House serve two-year terms, so all members of the House will cease to be representatives on January 3; one-third of senators’ terms also expire on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"h2aCjT\">Ordinarily, if the presidency and vice presidency are both vacant at the same time, the office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/index.html\">falls to the speaker of the House</a>. But if there is no election, there will be no speaker when Trump and Pence’s terms expire because all House seats will become vacant on January 3.</p>\n<p id=\"gCOCtb\">If there is no president, vice president, or speaker, the next official in line is the president pro tempore of the Senate, a largely ceremonial position that is traditionally held by the most senior member of the majority party. Right now that is Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).</p>\n<p id=\"EMFs0i\">But wait! Recall that the terms of many senators also expire on January 3. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">23 seats held by Republicans and only 12 seats held by Democrats</a> are up for election this year, so if no election is held, Democrats will have a majority in the Senate once these seats become vacant. Which would mean that Senate Democrats would be able to choose a new president pro tempore. If they follow the tradition of choosing the most senior member of their caucus, that would place Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) next in line for the presidency.</p>\n<p id=\"n8vlb0\">Things actually get even more complicated from here. The 17th Amendment permits state governors to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvii\">name temporary senators to vacant seats</a>, but not all states allow their governors to do so. It’s also not immediately clear who would be the governor of many states if no election takes place in 2020, because much of the line of succession in those states could be rendered vacant as well.</p>\n<p id=\"1SVEvx\">In any event, if you’ve read this far, your eyes are probably glazing over by now. The quirks of presidential succession provide fodder for constitutional lawyers to chew over, but, at the end of the day, the federal government’s power <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\">flows from the consent of the people</a>. We allow our leaders to govern because we trust that they’ve been selected in a constitutionally valid process. And we trust that process because it is, at least, vaguely comprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"aWahal\">If someone starts calling themselves “president” because they were chosen by a subset of a Senate that is missing a third of its members, a likely outcome is civil unrest — especially in a nation that is already on edge because of the extraordinary measures needed to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p id=\"jD61Lw\">In the exceedingly unlikely event that the 2020 election is canceled, the result isn’t likely to be an extended term for President Trump. The most likely result is chaos.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

It reinforces everything about Disney’s trademark wonder and nostalgia, not to mention the distinctly American sentimentality of saving hard-earned money and spending it on the same vacation you may have experienced as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"QYS3ir\">After four months of being stuck in my own home, it took a ride on Space Mountain’s shuttle to bring me back to pre-pandemic times, whipping through turns and drops I’d known so well yet somewhat forgotten during the Magic Kingdom’s 117-day closure. Here I was, double-masked, with Bath &amp; Body Works Sweet Pea-scented antibacterial gel at the ready, thrill-bound for the first time in what felt like forever. </p>\n<p id=\"zzhYdQ\">Disney World isn’t just a personal pastime; it’s my office. As a <a href=\"https://www.carlyewisel.com\">theme park journalist</a>, I’ve been everywhere in the name of reporting — international parks, cruise ships, inside Florida’s castle — but this was my first trip to Tomorrowland in the midst of a global health crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"yFHBnK\">I was finally home, I thought. But should I be?</p>\n<p id=\"fd4iBP\">On the day Disney’s Magic Kingdom theme park reopened, Florida broke records for having the highest number of new Covid-19 cases of any day, in any state, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases.html\">since the pandemic began</a>. The turn-of-the-century soundtrack still played, the teacups kept spinning, the princesses waved. The show, albeit amended, went on.</p>\n<p id=\"u61qUF\">A respiratory disease <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/5/21162138/vox-guide-to-covid-19-coronavirus\">continuing its global conquest</a> is deeply discordant with a 40-square-mile vacation destination trademarked as The Most Magical Place on Earth. And yet, with a mix of safety regulations, specified closures, and operational changes, Disney has made surprising strides toward finding harmony between the two realities. </p>\n<p id=\"OLk25o\">On its peroxide-treated surface, a visit to Walt Disney World’s theme parks still hits the high notes. You can buy a Moana doll, but you may have to join a virtual waiting list prior to entering the store. Want a Mickey-shaped ice cream bar? Be sure to step aside before removing your mask to enjoy it. You can see but not touch Minnie Mouse, as character meet-and-greets have been scrapped for distanced greetings and limited parades. Not all experiences and hotels are open, and not everyone has returned to work. Everything’s the same and yet nothing is, with even Disney’s emblematic Cinderella Castle undergoing a <a href=\"https://allears.net/2020/07/09/you-wont-believe-how-theyre-painting-the-rest-of-cinderella-castle-in-magic-kingdom/\">rose gold-hued transformation</a> during quarantine. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><div id=\"xXXvCd\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBg3gZ4jf_o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Enacting a vast upheaval of tried-and-true operations, many of which lean on customer service and human contact, Disney meticulously reimagined its parks and already considerable cleaning procedures for a family-friendly getaway that may not be entirely safe, but at least appears that way. </p>\n<p id=\"yNBdtr\">The choice to open Walt Disney World this month goes far beyond what many, including <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/im-a-huge-disney-fan-but-im-not-ready-to-return-to-disney-world\">travel magazines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBg3gZ4jf_o/\">Disney’s own fans</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConanOBrien/status/1285671641079570432\">late-night monologists</a> have critiqued as irresponsible, bundling the Florida government’s laissez-faire approach to the Mouse, subpar statewide unemployment, and union negotiations into a Matryoshka doll of complications. </p>\n<p id=\"61eHTp\">A leisure resort that’s just as much its own city, Disney took the time and opportunity afforded by Florida’s shutdown to create a microcosm for society during one of its most challenging eras. While debates and stress rage outside, in here, the refusal to wear a mask or follow the rules will lead not only to community ire but to one’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fpark-rules%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fthe-goods%2F21346476%2Fdisney-world-reopening-magic-kingdom-covid-florida\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">potential ejection</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"B5orca\">The Walt Disney Company is by no means impervious to a pandemic, taking a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/disneyland-disneyworld-coronavirus-losses-q2-earnings-disney-1202926668/\">$1 billion hit</a> in its theme park division as of early May. The attractions industry news site Blooloop estimates Walt Disney World and Disneyland theme parks lost a combined $37 million <a href=\"https://blooloop.com/features/theme-park-financial-impact-covid-19/\">each day they sat closed</a>; the latter has not yet reopened. “We’re doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of the cash burn,” CEO Bob Chapek told analysts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/business/media/coronavirus-disney-earnings.html\">nearly three months ago</a>.

How? Because the Florida government never shut down the resort in the first place. Disney closed itself down and Disney decided to open itself back up. Gov. Ron DeSantis pushed through plans in favor of reopening the state’s economy, one that <a href=\"https://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/about-us.html\">relies on tourism</a> to the tune of $90 billion annually.</p>\n<p id=\"WSId2X\">Hong Kong Disneyland may be partially government-owned, but Disney’s domestic resorts, wholly owned by The Walt Disney Company, are still subject to local legislation. Disneyland Resort’s theme parks and two of its hotels delayed their July reopening <a href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/disneyland-postpones-july-17-park-reopening-until-further-notice\">pending California government approval</a>, and no update has yet been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"7ORepy\">As Vox previously reported, Florida’s approach to reopening was fast and fierce. Add a public “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/17/21324398/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-outbreak\">fueled by politics and complacency</a>” who went out en masse without masks to packed restaurants, gyms, and bars, and you’ve got a perfect storm, one that resulted in a surge of cases from which the state <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/17/21324398/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-outbreak\">has not yet recovered</a>. As cases increased in late June, Gov. DeSantis doubled down, <a href=\"https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/florida-governor-not-rolling-back-disney-reopening-plans/67-1ebfc01e-8731-46a5-8eb6-bcdc79f6bab8\">issuing a statement</a> that “we are monitoring all aspects related to Covid-19 in Florida and do not have plans to roll back any approved reopening business plans at this time.”</p>\n<p id=\"wX9upQ\">“I’ve made it very clear in the past that I don’t think any theme park should have opened at this moment whatsoever,” said Florida House Rep. Anna Eskamani, who serves the 47th District in Orange County, where Disney and Universal’s theme parks are located. “We have some of the worst cases in Central Florida and in the state. Theme parks, to Disney’s credit, are trying really hard to create a safe environment and have made it very clear of the risk. I think they’re definitely taking it seriously, I just wish that we had leadership at the state level and county level that would balance these decisions with public health.”</p>\n<p id=\"4ZaVev\">If it sounds as though Disney World is self-governed, that’s perhaps due to an arrangement dating back to the 1960s. Disney’s <a href=\"https://www.rcid.org\">Reedy Creek Improvement District</a>, which stretches across Florida’s Orange and Osceola counties, operates its own fire departments, emergency medical services, and utilities, while two mini-communities of residents allow Disney World to be just that — <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-disney-cities-20150522-story.html\">a set of private cities</a>. (The company, said to own around 30,000 acres of land, <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2020/04/01/breaking-disney-buys-more-land-near-magic-kingdom.html\">continues to buy more</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"IOwWSU\">Florida’s Covid-19 statistics and <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/07/07/central-floridas-largest-hospitals-out-of-icu-beds-but-say-they-can-scale-up-if-covid-19-demand-increases/\">dwindling hospital bed availability</a> at the time left many questioning why Walt Disney World chose to reopen its parks at the peak of a pandemic. The resort has been test-running safety procedures since it began a phased reopening on May 20; similar safety guidelines were in place at Shanghai Disneyland when it reopened mid-May.</p>\n<p id=\"ii9Tac\">Walt Disney World is also the last resort to open in Florida, with its largest regional competitor, Universal Orlando Resort, opening more than a month prior. Sea World, Legoland, and Busch Gardens’ Florida locations all opened in early and mid-June.</p>\n<p id=\"QgZDpu\">Disney is undoubtedly a leader in the field — when it closed, other parks followed suit; even a recent <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2020/7/20/21331190/disney-world-bans-walking-and-eating-without-face-masks\">change in mask guidelines</a> was echoed by Universal <a href=\"https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2020/07/21/universal-orlando-updated-their-guidelines-on-face-coverings-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">the next day</a> — but much has changed over the past few weeks. When the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-27/walt-disney-world-park-reopening\">resort’s reopening plans</a> were presented at a virtual Orange County Economic Task Force meeting on May 27, Florida had <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-coronavirus-wednesday-may-27-20200527-rg7sibx6ybcvnajiipj2fi7cg4-story.html\">464 new cases</a>; by Magic Kingdom’s opening day, that number <a href=\"https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/new-coronavirus-numbers-data-florida-july12/67-010b4d81-3bd9-45a5-85ea-01e14c9a4210\">had tripled</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"YBSfBZ\">The optics of pushing ahead were bleak. Headlines blared of the company’s shortsightedness, MSNBC’s Katy Tur <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/-you-re-defending-the-opening-of-a-theme-park-katy-tur-asks-florida-mayor-87610949587\">lambasted Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings</a> on TV, and a now-deleted marketing video of cheerful employees was ridiculed and recut <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSatre/status/1282014432105816066\">as a horror movie trailer</a>. (The name of that clip? “<a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2020/07/walt-disney-world-reopens-florida-coronavirus-welcome-home-video-inspires-parodies.html\">Welcome Home</a>.”) </p>\n<p id=\"SnMlkt\"><a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-bz-disney-president-promoted-damaro-vahle-20200518-wnkwciyehzfphoa4to73jfvabe-story.html\">Newly crowned</a> Disney Parks chair Josh D’Amaro emphasized to CNN that “we are watching the external environment really carefully. But what we’ve done here is we’ve built an operations protocol. We’ve phased this opening. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/11/media/disney-world-reopening-disney-parks-chief/index.html\">We put ourselves in complete control</a>,” he said, sharing his confidence in the decision to open Disney World responsibly. “We are in a new normal right now, so what’s happening outside of the gates of Walt Disney World is our new world,” he later added.</p>\n<p id=\"fmk2HF\">When reached for comment, Disney PR told Vox it would not be granting interviews, instead referring reporters to its public-facing <a href=\"https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/\">Disney Parks Blog</a>. This sentiment has seemingly been echoed across media outlets covering the resort’s reopening, for which access had been unusually restricted; even the New York Times, which was granted an interview, had its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/business/florida-coronavirus-disney-world-reopening.html\">photo credentials rescinded</a>.</p>\n<div><aside id=\"VltoFu\"><q>“Theme parks, to Disney’s credit, are trying really hard to create a safe environment ... I just wish that we had leadership at the state level and county level that would balance these decisions with public health”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"j4TzP6\">Inside the parks, it doesn’t take long to adjust to that new normal D’Amaro mentioned. Updated procedures are clear and easy to follow, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheUGseries/status/1281219034030256128\">striped lines</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bioreconstruct/status/1281277438543253509\">numbered decals</a> dictating where to stand and mealtimes streamlined by QR code menus and expansive mobile ordering. The upside of visiting a popular theme park during a pandemic is that it no longer really operates like a popular theme park. Disney’s exhausting booking methods, which rationalize 4 am wake-up calls to reserve spots on an<em> Avatar</em>-themed simulator and brunch reservations six months in advance, have been temporarily suspended, allowing guests to embrace spontaneity for the first time in years.  </p>\n<p id=\"QvPu87\">With Disney capping attendance, requiring entry reservations, and removing the “skip the line” Fastpass+ system, wait times have plummeted compared to what they typically are at <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/wait-times\">this time of year</a>. Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, a website that algorithmically tracks crowds and wait times, deems them “comparable to what you’d expect if you visited the parks the day after a hurricane hit, and another hurricane was due in a couple of days,” with rides, even the park’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Blog_Mickey/status/1286411274369282049?s=20\">most popular</a>, occasionally offering the ability to “re-ride” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/countrybearsam/status/1286645045471387649?s=20\">over and over</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"PBp8vb\">Disney World is indeed a unique situation, one that’s at minimum considered “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html\">higher risk</a>” by CDC recommendations while simultaneously providing a refuge of stringently enforced guidelines within Florida. Safety <a href=\"https://www.disneyinstitute.com/blog/disney-customer-service-101-why-courtesy-is-not-always-our-first-priority/\">was always a priority</a> for the company, but never has it been as visible as plexiglass dividers on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj-tva7ihgs\">DINOSAUR</a>’s Time Rover vehicles or Mickey Mouse exclusively appearing on a pontoon boat, in a glitzed-up 1920s touring car, or perched atop a socially distanced <a href=\"https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2020/07/07/we-got-a-first-look-at-disney-worlds-new-character-cavalcades-and-entertainment/\">cartoonish Chevy convertible</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"WZbblp\">But is it enough? Some new measures, such as adding portable hand-washing stations, are scientifically proven to be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/11/21173187/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-washing-sanitizer-compared-soap-is-dope\">effective</a>; others, like temperature checks, may provide an <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/health/temperature-check-fever-covid-pandemic/\">inflated sense of security</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/2/21241636/coronavirus-children-kids-spread-transmit-switzerland\">Not considered to be major spreaders</a>, children 2 and under are not required to wear masks or have their temperatures checked.) </p>\n<p id=\"TyP5R5\">Ride vehicles <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EnchantingErin1/status/1280907227587645447\">are cleaned</a> every two hours with a <a href=\"https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/heres-how-disney-world-is-cleaning-their-attractions-throughout-the-day/\">peroxide-based disinfectant</a>, and antibacterial gel dispensers, which number in the thousands, are provided upon entry and exit of each attraction. It all sounds peachy until you run it past Lydia Bourouiba, associate professor and director of <a href=\"http://lbourouiba.mit.edu\">MIT’s Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory</a>, who ... doesn’t love it.</p>\n<p id=\"gIs02l\">“I am surprised to hear, if that is the case, that they didn’t have a protocol for decontamination after each batch of riders,” Bourouiba explained. “Given they are running the facility at low capacity, it would appear reasonable and easily doable to implement such measures.”</p>\n<p id=\"JFKfx2\">She adds that while some people use antibacterial gel thoroughly, others can leave areas of their hands exposed, posing a risk when gripping a shared surface.<strong> “</strong>For high-touch areas that are not decontaminated, one can think of it as effectively touching everybody else’s hands,” she said. This point of potential failure, as Bourouiba calls it, presents a deeper challenge on attractions with joysticks, pull-strings, or even Disney’s <em>Star War</em>s-themed Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction, whose <a href=\"https://screencrush.com/millennium-falcon-smugglers-run-tips/\">replica cockpit</a> prides itself on abundant buttons and switches that actually click when you touch them. (Though Universal Orlando Resort cleans at a lesser frequency, Bourouiba commends the park for wiping down vehicles whenever a mask is removed on-ride.)</p>\n<p id=\"du3f6g\">Prolonged exposure to respiratory droplets between people in close quarters <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/7/13/21315879/covid-19-airborne-who-aerosol-droplet-transmission\">remains the biggest threat</a> when it comes to coronavirus transmission, and if there ever was a time to invest in plexiglass, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/makers-race-to-produce-supplies-for-coronavirus-economy-plexiglass-sanitizer-masks-11590944400\">spring 2020 was it</a>. Now as omnipresent as Disney’s crew of anthropomorphic characters, <a href=\"https://allears.net/2020/07/07/this-is-what-the-ride-process-looks-like-at-disney-world/\">barriers of the stuff</a> divide <a href=\"https://www.kennythepirate.com/2020/07/23/social-distancing-on-kilimanjaro-safaris-what-to-expect-and-where-not-to-sit/\">tight queues for rides</a>, keep guests from employees <a href=\"https://www.micechat.com/disneyland-world-of-disney-checkout-plexiglass-micechat/\">at checkout terminals</a>, and, on some attractions, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JayInFlorida/status/1280491937548644357\">separate passengers </a>when they have no choice but to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Park_Journey/status/1283136923746394112\">be in close quarters</a>. Each ride’s 6-foot distancing protocols were also met differently, with boat rides leaving middle rows empty, coasters skipping seats, and others, like Soarin’ Around the World, attaching dividers by what appears to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrookeGMcDonald/status/1283905570903396353\">a child’s booster seat</a>.</p>\n<div><div id=\"eoDXFA\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jungle Cruise uses plexiglass to divide groups. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Disney?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Disney</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagicKingdom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MagicKingdom</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0WKB1Y2Tag\">pic.twitter.com/0WKB1Y2Tag</a></p>— JAY-COB (wears a mask) (@JayInFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JayInFlorida/status/1280491937548644357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"nZsMnN\">Eating indoors <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21296067/coronavirus-covid-symptoms-superspreaders-superspreading-contagious-bars-restaurants\">is questionable anywhere</a>, and though Disney restaurants benefit from ample space <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/21262619/is-it-safe-to-eat-out-coronavirus-restaurant-safety-risks-covid-19\">beyond that of traditional restaurants</a>, “it’s really not just about the distance when you’re inside and eating. It’s also about the air venting, handling, and details of the transient flow patterns that matter,” Bourouiba said, exposing the risk in mask-free environments like Disney’s indoor, air-conditioned <a href=\"https://wdwprepschool.com/reopening/relaxation-stations/\">Relaxation Stations</a>, which provide a tempting hideout from Florida’s summer heat. “Six feet apart in an indoor space is not by itself a safety magical bullet.”</p>\n<p id=\"FPz0Ng\">When I asked Jade Pagkas-Bather, infectious diseases attending physician and clinical epidemiologist at University of Chicago Medicine, how safe it is to visit Disney World with these precautions in place, she laughed. “You probably could not pay me money to go to a theme park. I might consider it if someone says they’d wipe out my student loan debt from medical school, but that is not a place I would recommend going to.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZzUDJh\">Her top concern is other people, particularly their willingness to comply with safety protocols. “All these things that many of us in the medical public health sphere are recommending are not things that are natural for a lot of Americans or people in large public spaces,” she said.</p>\n<p id=\"BAM1BO\">With guests traveling cross-country, Pagkas-Bather added, most will arrive with different levels of mask compliance from back home. “Are people going to be so excited to be there that they’ll be compliant? Or are you going to see what we know exists as ugly human behavior that sometimes happens when people don’t want to be told what to do, particularly at an expensive theme park that maybe they spent a lot of money traveling to?”</p>\n<p id=\"uR7nls\">In anticipation of this issue, Disney has positioned yellow-shirted members of the “Incredi-Crew” — named for the <em>Pixar</em> animated films — to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shelbytheCM71/status/1284984778291400707\">hold up smile signs</a> and remind guests to properly don masks at park entrances each morning. Compliance during my time in the parks was surprisingly high, as much removal didn’t appear to be malicious but simply a gasp for air in Florida’s humid heat, though willingness to mask up seemed to wane toward day’s end. (Rule adherence at Disney Springs appears to have <a href=\"https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/disney-springs-falls-behind-on-safety-as-theme-parks-set-a-high-bar/\">more uneven results</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"BFK2we\">A week after opening, Disney clarified its mask policy even further, explicitly restricting neck gaiters and bandanas and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/walt-disney-world-new-mask-rule-covid-19/index.html\">providing limitations on eating while walking</a>, assigning additional staff to Epcot’s food festival <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wishful_thnkng/status/1285295267324088320?s=20\">to enforce the update</a>. <a href=\"https://attractionsmagazine.com/disney-has-officially-banned-another-type-of-face-mask/#more-224809\">Another update on</a> July 26 confirmed facial coverings cannot contain valves, mesh, or holes of any kind, officially acknowledging <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-16/coronavirus-mask-droplet-spread-n95-vent\">vented mask inefficacy</a> and condemning the <a href=\"https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/13-investigates-anti-mask-protestors-turn-to-mesh-yarn-crochet-masks-covid-coronavirus/531-5350260c-d6b1-4bd8-857e-860fe84e0f52\">facial covering tomfoolery</a> happening nationwide due to the politicization of health and public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"eJOTbR\">Compliance is one piece of the puzzle. Operations is another, and for a resort of its size with completely reinvented guidelines, Disney’s updated procedures have appeared to be working well. Still, situations that arise on the fly are the real test, and resiliency to events unaccounted for during planning hasn’t always been optimal. I witnessed this firsthand as I was directed down a cramped walkway with a dense line of guests on Magic Kingdom’s opening day. Having nervously flown to Florida with the belief that I could remove myself from any dangerous situation, it shook me enough to leave the park without entering, stunned as nearby employees seemed oblivious to the issue. Socially distanced line markers magically appeared in that same spot the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"QdCa58\">Clustering in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDIS/status/1283449348999786496?s=20\">busy Epcot building</a>, crowding as mobile-ordered meals <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MickeyViews/status/1281981196361175041\">are prepared</a>, indoor queues presenting an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Blog_Mickey/status/1284874657733189635?s=20\">uncomfortable environment</a> during a ride’s temporary closure — they’re infrequent kinks in a functioning system that, even if rectified going forward, increased the likelihood of a pathogen’s transmission on the day.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Njr21g\"><q>“You probably could not pay me money to go to a theme park. I might consider it if someone says they’d wipe out my student loan debt from medical school.”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"I7aA0a\">“Is Disney willing to crack down and be kind of a bad guy even though it’s this sort of magical land?” asked Pagkas-Bather. “It’s really hard to become an enforcer of things when you are known for childhood happiness and dreams and this sort of magic and wonder. All of those things kind of encourage exploration without restriction — of your imagination but also your bodily movements. Is that going to dramatically change the dynamics of Disney World?”</p>\n<p id=\"e71rMO\">For some, just being there may be good enough: Not a single park guest I spoke with during my nine-day trip felt endangered inside Disney’s parks, with reporters, friends, and strangers all expressing they felt safer here than in their respective hometowns. Bethany Jones, 39, who took her first solo trip for the opening, bought a ticket three days prior and drove down from Atlanta. “I was going to be simply happy with the sights and the sounds and smell of Main Street and the toned-down versions of my favorite attractions,” she said, acknowledging Disney as an escape. “Once I was inside, it almost felt like a dream.”</p>\n<p id=\"WJZCNY\">The destination’s insular design — round-trip-airport buses, free transportation to the on-property mall — intentionally provides a physical disconnect from the outside. There’s no proper drugstore or grocery, just hotel gift shops with tiny packs of Tylenol, frozen meals, and some Disney-approved brands of beer. Many guests never step foot off its hallowed ground at all, a testament to Disney’s irresistible charm that may be more of a glimmering fantasy. </p>\n<p id=\"xP9XH5\">“Nothing on this trip at all has made me scared. Nothing,” said Suzy McGarrah, who flew from Kansas City to celebrate her 49th birthday. “It’s a big decision to make, to travel into a hot spot ... but we’re not traveling around Orlando. We’re not going to Target. We’re not going to restaurants in Orlando. We’re not going to the grocery store. I feel like we’re in a bubble. It’s been Disney ever since we stepped off the plane, so we put all of our trust in their hands, and I feel like they’ve taken care of our trust.”</p>\n<p id=\"zNmfuV\">Having been unsure before leaving — “I was terrified to come and I second-guessed it all the way until I got on the airplane” — she decided to travel after seeing on social media how well things went during park previews. Days later, influencers would be invited to attend Magic Kingdom’s opening day and encouraged to post about their experiences at the park related to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CChNvDVDGUX/\">health and safety</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"D5r7YG\">Fans who attended the reopening have praised new procedures put in place, but the guest experience has shifted as well. Is it possible for visitors to vacation or even relax when safety needs to be top of mind?</p>\n<p id=\"3xXu4S\">As a Tampa-based Disney fan — “It’s been a part of my life forever, probably before birth” — Micaela Figueroa, 25, felt comfortable at Disney World with its new regulations but recognized she’d begun to let her guard down in doing so. “As a guest, I needed to be self-aware, way more than I have ever been going to a theme park,” she explained. “You want to go to Disney and hug the characters and stand right next to a neighbor and wave at characters from a parade and go eat at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fdining%2Fmagic-kingdom%2Fcinderella-royal-table%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fthe-goods%2F21346476%2Fdisney-world-reopening-magic-kingdom-covid-florida\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cinderella’s Royal Table</a>, and all that fun stuff. It definitely felt weird to make sure you’re double-checking yourself every minute.”</p>\n<p id=\"72eltF\">Jane Mayo, a 43-year-old “but I act 12” Disney fan <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/no-guilt-disney-podcast/id1496530181\">and podcaster</a> whose “whole life revolves around Disney,” felt similarly. “You’re there and you’re in this magical place where, for the most part, people go and they forget about the outside world. But there is not a second of my day that I am not thinking about Covid-19,” she said. “It’s great and comforting and there is a [feeling of] ‘I’m home!’ but there’s also, ‘I am home and now I’m concerned about my home.’”</p>\n<p id=\"b5KZXS\">Even the cheerful face behind popular Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michaeldoesdisney/?hl=en\">@MichaelDoesDisney</a> — who prefers to keep his last name private — felt conflicted on his visit. “Normally the parks are a true escape for me. They are a place where I can go and act like a child again,” he said of his adoration for Disney. “For me, they’re just the happiest place out here.” Known for his effervescent joy, Michael, 30, confessed to his 55,000 followers that he found the experience to be stressful — not by Disney’s safety standards, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjankfDhrR/\">but his own</a>.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id=\"BWWJWu\">“When you’re going on a ride that’s only 90 seconds long, and you spend the first 30 of it questioning, ‘Did I sanitize? Did I touch the lap bar?’ ... it’s hard to have a decent fun time, in my opinion,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"dDbniJ\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjankfDhrR/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I am probably one or the most positive and optimistic people you'll ever meet/follow but I've also never been one to \"spin\" things in a way to make them seem absolutely perfect, when unfortunately they're not. i have finally gathered all of my THOUGHTS on going to Disney right now. SWIPE to read all of them! i know it's a lot, but i did my best to look at this from an unbiased perspective and to put my thoughts into the simplest bullet points that i possibly could.   ‍♂️</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michaeldoesdisney/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Michael Does Disney</a> (@michaeldoesdisney) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-07-12T19:14:16+00:00\">Jul 12, 2020 at 12:14pm PDT</time></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"hQedDY\">There’s merit to the concern. CDC guidelines such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand-washing are effective, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21299527/masks-coronavirus-covid-19-studies-research-evidence\">not foolproof</a>, as any public activity and associated travel present a risk. “I have no doubt [Disney is] taking it seriously and doing their best under the very difficult circumstances, but this is a moment where doing your best doesn’t equal zero transmissions,” said Rep. Eskamani. “It’s just impossible.”</p>\n<p id=\"RtOBCl\">Take into consideration, too, that Central Florida has faced a staggering caseload in communities where those who keep the Mouse running call home. With thousands of visitors to the parks each day, some traveling across the country to do so, it goes without saying that the coronavirus will also be present.</p>\n<p id=\"WZqCzt\">Reports of Universal Orlando Resort employees contracting Covid-19 floated around Twitter and among employees in the weeks after it opened, many of whom spoke to Vox on the condition of anonymity due to internal reporting procedures. One team member divulged that so many positive cases had been tied to the park’s entertainment division that it was being nicknamed “ground zero” among coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"guoiMw\">According to a Universal Orlando Resort spokesperson: </p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"ilW1Jc\">Privacy concerns would prevent us from sharing any specifics, but we can say the health and safety of our guests and team members is always our top priority. We have aggressive protocols in place and closely follow CDC guidelines: team members who test positive as well as team members who were in contact or near-contact would be required to self-quarantine. No one would be able to return to work until they had been medically cleared. In addition, our aggressive procedures call for us to thoroughly clean and disinfect any impacted areas before anyone is admitted to the area. And, as always, we will continue to follow CDC guidelines and have implemented destination-wide enhanced screening, spacing and sanitization procedures.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aDiNOM\">Similar discussions among employees appeared in the days surrounding Disney’s grand reopening as cases <a href=\"https://www.wftv.com/news/local/employees-30-central-florida-publix-stores-test-positive-covid-19-see-if-your-store-is-list/IP5JYSTMBZG3ZBQ3A7D5R3ARH4/\">spiked at nearby grocery stores</a> and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myaofmars/status/1281631427528921089\">compilation of anonymous reports</a> throughout the Orlando area grew longer each day. (Disney did not respond to a request for comment on this.) While explaining that no self-reported cases had been tied to viral outbreaks in the parks, Orange County Health Department’s Dr. Raul Pino confirmed that, indeed, some employees of Florida theme parks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AshleyLCarter1/status/1285318103438626821\">had become ill</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"KvpUDc\">One Walt Disney World food and beverage employee considers contracting Covid-19 somewhat inevitable. “I’m not scared that I’m going to die from going to work,” he said. “But I realistically think some people will.” (Disney employees are explicitly unauthorized to speak to the media and have been granted anonymity for their candor.) Mayor Demings contends he will <a href=\"https://www.wftv.com/news/local/demings-i-will-not-hesitate-close-theme-parks-other-businesses-orange-county-if-linked-covid-19-outbreaks/V7VC2NRR7JGTZKQWD4WVJRQSTU/?fbclid=IwAR2Rm5XRR-Un_b_72oer6wE0l6d82asAvuTNYunDGHcv2iG6LXcDYZqqEqE\">close the theme parks</a> if cases are linked back, an unlikely proposition given Orange County’s spread is now so vast its Department of Health is attempting to <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/07/16/orange-county-recruiting-100-people-for-contact-tracing-to-limit-spread-of-covid-19/\">contact trace effectively</a> but is struggling to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LSeabrookWFTV/status/1286052357424517125\">appropriately do so</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"ICNq0z\">You won’t find Finding Nemo puppetry, immersive lightsaber-building, or Indiana Jones’s live stunts at Disney parks right now. Negotiations broke down between Disney and the Actors’ Equity Association, which represents 750 performers in more than 20 park productions, when the union requested safety measures like routine testing in line with <a href=\"https://members.actorsequity.org/newsandevents/equitynews/news/CoronavirusUpdate/ensuring-the-safety-and-health-of-equity-members\">doctor-recommended guidelines</a>, resulting in around 250 performers having their “recall” back to work rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"Eezweu\">“Think about the work that an actor does,” says Brandon Lorenz, a spokesperson for Actors’ Equity. “You can’t socially distance when someone’s putting makeup on you. You can’t socially distance when someone’s putting a costume on you. The very nature of the work is just different than anyone else in the park.” (AEA has since <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-equity-grievance-20200709-36krn2o4yjb5zfeacvqcjidhkq-story.html\">filed a grievance</a>, and Disney found <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/arts-and-theater/os-et-disney-world-show-changes-equity-20200719-osclusbhrffi7pj442obdefclq-story.html\">temporary workarounds</a> as members’ <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/arts-and-theater/os-disney-world-performers-lockout-help-20200725-csayf6bsmfhkhgdmh3qfce6loe-story.html\">reactions are divided</a>.) Due to union specificities, you can’t hear Belle sing but you can wave hello to her at Disney World, consciously distanced from other princesses, none of whom ever wear masks. </p>\n<p id=\"Q6GgoN\">While around 20,000 of Disney’s union employees have been “called back” to return to work, the New York Times<em> </em>estimates about 23,000 more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/business/florida-coronavirus-disney-world-reopening.html\">have been on furlough</a> since April 19, left to grapple with Florida’s miserable benefits system. “Florida has had just a horrifying experience with unemployment,” explained Rep. Eskamani. “Both Orange and Osceola counties have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country [because] a large part of our economy has been service-driven and tourism-driven, and being able to access benefits has been really, really painful to this day.” Not only were many Floridians wrongfully deemed ineligible, not receiving approved benefits and missing $600 payments — an error Eskamani calls “super common” among the 16,000 cases she’s overseen — but the state’s system was designed so poorly it’s now <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/jobs-economy/os-bz-coronavirus-federal-investigation-florida-unemployment-20200608-4p5ws7rfpnc6vd5t3fapokkiiu-story.html\">the subject of a federal investigation</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"E8ad1B\">Florida’s unemployment is also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/business/coronavirus-florida-disney-tourism.html\">below average</a> in both amount and duration, paying out $275 per week — <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/how-much-unemployment-will-i-get-that-depends-on-your-state.html\">$100 below the national average</a> — for 12 weeks, the least amount of time nationwide. It’s why the CARES Act has been imperative for residents and potentially catastrophic if, upon its July 31 expiration, the new <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21345006/senate-republicans-heals-act-unemployment-insurance\">HEALS Act</a> does not provide adequate unemployment insurance. <a href=\"https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2019/03/15/orlando-is-literally-the-worst-place-in-the-country-right-now-for-affordable-housing\">Affordable housing</a> remains an issue in the region as efforts including Tango Cares’s <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/eat-well-give-back-orlando\">community kitchen</a>, Feed the Need’s <a href=\"https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2020/07/06/feed-the-need-expands-meal-distributions-to-the-plaza-live-in-orlando\">weekly distributions</a>, and the donation-based volunteer-run <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/castmemberpantry/\">Cast Member Pantry</a> assist theme park employees who may be food-insecure.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A worker wearing gloves and a mask cleans at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7d-_CobbMiujIzsslxE5ZOEtNFc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20664706/Enhanced_Cleaning_Measures_2.jpg\">\n      <cite>Matt Stroshane/Disney</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"gwND1R\">On top of that, some workers may not get their jobs back at all. Universal Orlando laid off an <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-et-universal-orlando-layoffs-coronavirus-epic-20200624-6akamh4nobf5nm7sei7k5kfd34-story.html\">undisclosed number of employees</a> last month and canceled its annual <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/universal-studios-halloween-horror-nights-canceled-2020/index.html\">Halloween Horror Nights</a> event while Rosen Hotel, a central Florida chain with multiple convention center properties, announced more than 1,000 layoffs across its eight resorts, effectively <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2020/07/15/nearly-half-of-rosen-hotel-s-workforce-laid-off.html\">halving its workforce</a>. Tourism struggles like these can have ripple effects elsewhere; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCKFKu1pcaT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">Thinkwell Group</a>, a global design company used by theme parks worldwide, incurred large layoffs as well.</p>\n<p id=\"PAfcmo\">Disney employees I spoke with on the condition of anonymity are hopeful to return given the circumstances. One furloughed worker cannot wait to get back; another, already back in the parks, is surprised by the false sense of normalcy but continues to worry about guest behavior. One expressed frustration that take-home pay for a full workweek — in a theme park-issued costume and mask in the sun — is less than what they made on unemployment while safely sheltering in place, even though payments could be reduced or end soon. </p>\n<p id=\"tO46Gn\">Many workers “don’t feel like they have a choice but to go back to work. They might not feel safe going back to work, but they feel like the option is the only one to be able to pay their bills because they can’t rely on the unemployment system,” said Eskamani, emphasizing workers being put in uncomfortable positions if they care for an elder or have a child with a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"k62MNr\">A petition by <a href=\"https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/protect-our-magic-makers-don-t-open-theme-parks-until-it-s-safe?bucket=&amp;source=facebook-share-button&amp;time=1592695244&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;share=69129279-e34d-4c58-8df2-183cd9cb569c\">Protect the Magic Makers</a>, a coalition of concerned cast members, yielded 20,000 signatures; a Facebook group for local theme park employees gives Disney workers an outlet for vital conversations about evolving protocol, like if gloves are now allowed or if anyone else had a reaction to new cleaning materials. One such discussion centered on company-provided face masks, which, to many members’ dismay, will be laundered and redistributed if turned in. “It’s basically the equivalent of wearing someone else’s underwear,” said one employee. “I find it super gross.”</p>\n<p id=\"k8rfDu\">Park employees who have returned to work are also given personal hand sanitizer, goggles for any bus transportation, and face shields for certain guest-facing roles. Those masks, made of thick fabric yet intended for use in a humid climate, are but one new stressor of a pandemic-era workweek. The intersection of old habits and updated procedures causes trouble too, as employees struggle to effectively communicate through physical barriers and plexiglass walls. </p>\n<p id=\"exFwsL\">“I don’t think there was any bad intent at all, but when we reopened, someone came up and I couldn’t hear her, so she pulled down her mask to her chin and leaned around the barrier,” said one Walt Disney World employee who works directly with visitors. “Guests are always a wild card. The vast majority of people are on board with safety procedures and trying their best to do their part, but it really only takes a few people.”</p>\n<p id=\"r0FBRt\">Disney’s theme parks have made concessions to standard procedure by alleviating disciplinary “points” for employees calling out of work through August, but hazard pay is not offered; the Walt Disney Company’s corporate offices have not yet reopened for business as those employees continue to work from home. </p>\n<p id=\"iYvtkj\">Disney’s Florida resort is quietly powered by a legion of college-age participants in its Disney College Program, which was <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-college-program-canceled-20200702-e5muyfaaprhpllo5jkgmdqnsjq-story.html\">abruptly canceled in March</a> and <a href=\"https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/2020/07/02/news-disney-cancels-the-2020-fall-disney-college-program-for-disney-world-and-disneyland/\">suspended until 2021</a>. Professional internships <a href=\"https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2020/04/06/disney-to-suspend-remaining-disney-internships-and-programs\">suffered a similar fate</a>, as Epcot, short on cultural representatives that typically <a href=\"https://jobs.disneycareers.com/cultural-representative-program\">staff some of its 11 country pavilions</a>, has Americans scooping caramel corn in a German sweets shop and serving baguettes in a French boulangerie. </p>\n<p id=\"ufKzgU\">Even with the challenges, risks, and uncertainty, it’s more than just a workplace for many who have hung their Mickey-eared hat in this place. Carly Chomen and Hannah Gray, Disney College Program participants and former roommates whose experience was cut short, traveled from Texas to attend Walt Disney World’s reopening. “We decided we were the last ones in the park, so we wanted to be one of the first ones back,” Chomen explained. When asked how they felt to be back, the duo responds in unison — “very emotional!” — particularly after Carly first saw Main Street Confectionary, her former work location.</p>\n<p id=\"oKJbN4\">“We were in tears, so excited to be back,” said Chomen of the emotional pull of Disney’s Florida resort.</p>\n<p class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"CkvMRL\">“It’s just home.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Not just the worst on record, but the worst on record by a large margin. </p>\n<p id=\"FsouTq\">But while the economic situation really is bad, a key indicator, the annualized rate concept, leads experts to believe there may be some hope for improvement. The idea here is that the Bureau of Economic Analysis normally wants to give us quarterly growth statistics that are comparable to annual growth statistics. </p>\n<p id=\"o2gsNV\">A year of 4 percent GDP growth would be really good. A real of 3 percent GDP growth would be good. A year of 2 percent GDP growth would probably be a bit disappointing. So in a normal quarter, we’re trying to ask how the short-term trend compares to those kinds of benchmarks, and we’re asking essentially, “What if we had four quarters in a row that looked like this quarter?”</p>\n<p id=\"vVxn23\">That’s a fine way to do economic statistics, but it’s a kind of wild question to ask about Q2 of 2020, given that what happened then was a huge number of businesses shut down and consumers withdrew from huge segments of the marketplace. </p>\n<p id=\"rCgvHp\">The annualized rate concept then asks us not “What if things stayed shut down for a whole year?” but “What if we kept shutting things down at the rate they shut down in the second quarter?” </p>\n<p id=\"a6vyGK\">Statistically, the answer to that question turns out to be “economic activity would fall by about a third.” But this is not a question with any real-world implication. Ever since roughly April, the US has been allowing more economic activity, not less. Some of that economic activity has probably been unwise from a public health standpoint and may need to be shut down again in the future. But some of it reflects our improved understanding of what kinds of things — outdoor transactions, things that are compatible with mask-wearing — are safe, and some of it reflects our enhanced ability to conduct business online or in appropriately distanced ways. </p>\n<p id=\"ByyMSE\">When we look ahead to Q3, we’re seeing a lot of industries that are reopening either wholly (dentist’s offices, car dealerships, appliance stores) or partially (restaurants), and we’re probably going to see a historically amazing growth number when expressed as an annualized rate. President Trump will doubly brag that it’s the best economy ever, but of course it won’t be, any more than Q2 was the worst economy. </p>\n<p id=\"1ZzIC0\">Instead, what we have, plainly, is a pretty bad economic situation — high unemployment, many retail businesses on the brink or going bankrupt — that has been significantly cushioned by generous government income supports for vulnerable people. Indeed, thanks to the CARES Act, disposable personal income actually went up.</p>\n<div id=\"7kbrx4\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To appreciate how substantial the fiscal support was: real disposable personal income ROSE 10% (annual rate was 44.9%) in Q2.<br><br>The economy collapsed but incomes were up due to stimulus checks and UI.</p>— Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1288816606165032962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 30, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"3i9HNA\">The two big questions going forward are going to be whether deteriorating public health conditions will force a new round of economic pullback, and whether congressional Republican intransigence will lead to big drops in household income as emergency benefits expire. </p>\n<p id=\"Fu75v9\">Until the pandemic is under control, it will be difficult to return to any kind of economic normal. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google — who together control companies worth nearly $5 trillion — called in individually via videoconference and fielded questions for nearly six hours. Some questions were tough. Some were just all over the place.</p>\n<p id=\"ta3vtu\">It was a scattered and, at times, awkward hearing. Members of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust received only five minutes at a time to ask all four executives questions. The event was also full of all the technical glitches you can expect in a standard video chat, as well as some anticipated but nevertheless distracting political drama.</p>\n<p id=\"bBzyxf\">Democrats focused on whether the companies are engaged in anticompetitive<strong> </strong>practices that crush competitors and harm consumers. Much to Democrats’ frustration, many Republicans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/29/21347128/big-tech-antitrust-hearing-facebook-zuckerberg-amazon-bezos-apple-cook-google-pichai\">diverted from antitrust issues</a> to focus on unfounded claims of anti-conservative bias on social media platforms and Google.</p>\n<p id=\"6i1p19\">While the marathon hearing won’t result in any immediate political or regulatory action, it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/6/21125026/big-tech-congress-antitrust-investigation-amazon-apple-google-facebook\">could apply pressure to antitrust regulators at the FTC and DOJ</a> and set the stage for broader government probes into these companies’ business practices and the laws that have failed to rein them in. The event also stands to influence the public’s opinion of tech at a time when nearly <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/07/29/big-tech-regulation-hearing-poll/\">half the country thinks the industry needs government regulation</a>. Naturally, some emerged from the debacle looking like winners. There were also some clear losers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ovm9tW\">Winners</h3>\n<p id=\"naFf9X\"><strong>Rep. Pramila Jayapal</strong></p>\n<p id=\"02DgG8\">Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic Congress member from Washington, came prepared with sharp lines of questioning for the witnesses, particularly for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who she grilled about the 2012 acquisition of his company’s then-competitor Instagram.</p>\n<p id=\"ZKxbkd\">Jayapal directly quoted internal documents to press Zuckerberg when he repeatedly denied strong-arming Instagram founder Kevin Systrom into a deal. Instead of moving on to another question, Jayapal <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-saw-instagram-as-a-potential-threat-emails-show/\">read back old emails</a> and strategically reminded Zuckerberg that he was under oath to tell the truth. After a tense back-and-forth, the Facebook CEO told Jayapal he disagreed with her characterization of his messages to Systrom. </p>\n<p id=\"wZ71n8\">“I think it was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t view those conversations as a threat in any way.” </p>\n<div id=\"TNbEjY\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepJayapal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RepJayapal</a> asks Facebook CEOs Mark Zuckerberg about copying and threatening smaller competitors like Instagram and Snapchat in order to pressure them into selling to the company.<br><br>Full video here: <a href=\"https://t.co/CNTNmIDxiY\">https://t.co/CNTNmIDxiY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Itwu0lRf77\">pic.twitter.com/Itwu0lRf77</a></p>— CSPAN (@cspan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1288572966012428290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"z9uz7H\">But Jayapal, who had clearly done her homework, had more proof, citing messages in which Systrom shared his worries with an investor that Zuckerberg would go into “destroy mode,” copying and crushing his app if he rejected a deal.</p>\n<p id=\"mOxvO1\">“Facebook is a case study in monopoly power, because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals,” said Jayapal at the end of her round of questioning on the Instagram deal.</p>\n<p id=\"uDAm9Y\">Jayapal’s questions produced some of the most damning evidence presented at the antitrust hearing. It demonstrated how Facebook’s market dominance can strike fear in its competitors, even if it’s still undecided whether that fits the legal threshold for anti-competitive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"Jj7kYz\"><strong>Tim Cook</strong></p>\n<p id=\"psVV8r\">Even though his company has faced intensifying allegations of antitrust violations <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/16/21292973/apple-antitrust-european-union-commission-spotify\">in recent weeks</a>, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook only received about half of number of questions as his tech CEO rivals, according to an <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/29/antitrust-hearing-amazon-facebook-google-questioned-more-than-apple/\">analysis by VentureBeat</a>, </p>\n<p id=\"elrOTW\">Cook did face some tough questions about whether Apple <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/apple-app-store-airbnb-classpass.html\">takes too big of a cut</a> from the revenue of third-party developers that sell apps in its App Store. Spotify, for example, has very publicly complained about the issue, leading to European regulators launching a pair of antitrust investigations <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">in June</a>. Yet, on Wednesday, members of Congress didn’t focus their ire on Apple’s issues as they did on those of the other tech CEOs.</p>\n<p id=\"idq1Iw\">Overall, Cook won by laying low. To date, Cook has been masterful at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/21/20975979/donald-trump-apple-plant-austin-texas-tim-cook\">staying quiet</a> when he needs to in order to win at the hyperpartisan politics of the Trump era. And Wednesday’s hearing proved to be no exception. </p>\n<h3 id=\"xG8atv\">Losers</h3>\n<p id=\"lS28oz\"><strong>Mark Zuckerberg </strong></p>\n<p id=\"EHfe7s\">The Facebook CEO, who’s testified at congressional hearings before, faced some of the toughest questions from lawmakers on both sides. Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1288816523193339906\">argue</a> that the young executive held up well to questioning, but the fact that Zuckerberg became the focus of so much ire undoubtedly directed negative attention to Facebook.</p>\n<p id=\"7wIOIz\">Democrats pressed Facebook about its inability to stop hate speech and misinformation from spreading on the platform. But where Zuckerberg struggled was in the line of questioning from members like Jayapal, who made strong cases for how Facebook has engaged in anti-competitive business practices over the years in what Jayapal called a “copy, acquire, and kill” strategy toward pushing competitors out of business.  </p>\n<p id=\"4QyuwX\">Zuckerberg defended Facebook on this point in several ways. First, he argued that if Facebook hadn’t acquired smaller rivals like Instagram, those startups may have never succeeded at the scale they’re at today because they needed Facebook’s support and talent to grow. Second, Zuckerberg said that Facebook isn’t really a monopoly because it competes with companies like Google on ads, Amazon on commerce, and TikTok on social. Third, he claimed that if United States regulators break up tech giants like Facebook, other Chinese competitors (hint: TikTok) who are “less committed” to American values could take over.</p>\n<p id=\"xoPzSX\">But Zuckerberg’s grilling from Congress didn’t stop with acquisitions. Zuckerberg faced a slew of angry questions <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtTlzsaKlg\">from Republicans</a> who accused, with scant evidence, that Facebook is inherently biased against conservatives. Even if these claims are unfounded, they left Zuckerberg defending his company from all kinds of angles.</p>\n<p id=\"LTq8jS\"><strong>Sundar Pichai</strong></p>\n<p id=\"KXL4Ts\">The famously soft-spoken, even-keeled Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, was forced into controversy at Wednesday’s hearing, where he faced a hammering over Google’s privacy practices and dominance in the ads market.</p>\n<p id=\"bAvejA\">Like Zuckerberg, Pichai was also on the receiving end of a lot of hell about largely unfounded accusations of political bias on Google. But the partisan Republican attacks didn’t end there. Several Republicans, like Reps. Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz, also took issue with Google <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-pentagons-plan-to-win-over-silicon-valleys-ai-experts/\">dropping a major contract</a> with the Pentagon to develop AI to be used in drone warfare. The project, nicknamed Maven, was abandoned in part due to thousands of Google employees’ open dissent, arguing that they didn’t sign up to be in the business of war. </p>\n<p id=\"wCJ1Ee\">In his questioning, Pichai acknowledged that employees’ anger about Maven factored into the decision to drop the project, which is an obvious and understandable conclusion that Rep. Gaetz framed as some kind of bombshell revelation. Pichai also said the company is actively working with US government agencies. </p>\n<div id=\"PP6FKt\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“We are not working with the Chinese military.”<br><br>Rep. Gaetz asks Google why an American company would aid the Chinese military <a href=\"https://t.co/yG1r9oR8w7\">pic.twitter.com/yG1r9oR8w7</a></p>— Bloomberg QuickTake (@QuickTake) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QuickTake/status/1288548379618938880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"L52GbC\">This all puts Pichai in a tough spot, though. On the one hand, he has to keep his engineers — a narrow pool of talent who are notoriously difficult to recruit — happy. And many of those engineers are vehemently against developing technology that can cause physical harm. At the same time, as evidenced in the hearing, Pichai has to answer to angry lawmakers who see any refusal not to engage in military or police contracts as unpatriotic. </p>\n<p id=\"imryWB\">Google’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china\">previous work to build a search engine</a> in compliance with the Chinese Communist Party’s strict censorship was also a subject of questioning by Republicans, who accused Pichai of cozying up to the Chinese government.</p>\n<p id=\"Ona9lu\">For Google, all of this matters because it’s the company most likely to face potential antitrust action in the near future. The Republican-led <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/doj-and-state-ags-likely-to-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-wsj.html\">DOJ is expected to file a lawsuit against Google this summer</a>. So you might say there was no chance for Pichai to win on Wednesday.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rapg3Q\">Both winners and losers</h3>\n<p id=\"hWsl5D\"><strong>Jeff Bezos</strong></p>\n<p id=\"YdwAUr\">The Amazon CEO and world’s richest man was calm, polite, and mostly direct in his answers during <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/27/21340218/jeff-bezos-congress-testimony-antitrust-big-tech-ceos\">his first time testifying before Congress</a>. He also survived more than an hour at the beginning of the hearing without being asked a single question thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceciliakang/status/1288544973831405570\">a reported tech issue</a> and didn’t face much in the way of “smoking gun” internal documents that would have put him in a tougher spot when the queries finally began.</p>\n<p id=\"0eIE8Y\">But <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/29/21346584/jeff-bezos-amazon-antitrust-hearing-congressional-testimony-power-to-make-or-break-small-merchants\">Bezos’s testimony did little to quash a variety of concerns about the power Amazon wields</a> over its 1.7 million small and mid-sized sellers. These include suspicions over how the company uses data to develop competing products as well as its penchant for suspending or banning sellers with little notice or explanation. Bezos was also specifically called out for increasing the cut of sales that Amazon charges smaller sellers, a sum they must pay in order to have a shot at success on the giant shopping marketplace. </p>\n<p id=\"p5y6X3\">When confronted with anecdotes or accusations of Amazon abusing its power as the ruler of its marketplace, Bezos would express his disapproval, vow to look into it, and try to assure lawmakers that the problems weren’t systemic. Even if he’s right and the abuses are a series of one-offs, the pattern shows that Amazon has grown so powerful that it can massively disrupt or upend its own partner businesses — even it does so by neglect or by accident. </p>\n<p id=\"qIJz0S\"><strong>Rep. Jim Jordan</strong></p>\n<p id=\"lyU01h\">The Ohio Congress member was the most outspoken of his Republican colleagues in attacking the tech giants, claiming that they censor or otherwise suppress conservative viewpoints in various ways. “I will just cut to the chase. Big tech is out to get conservatives,” he said in his opening. So if success for Republicans was based on airing as many unproven theories of bias as possible, Jordan was the star.

Kamala Harris hugs Joe Biden after she endorsed him at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on March 9. | Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</small>\n\n\n  <p>What we know about Biden’s possible vice presidential picks.</p> <p id=\"zqerg9\">Former Vice President Joe Biden is about a week away from announcing the name of the woman who will be his vice presidential pick.</p>\n<p id=\"1FceZi\">“I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August,” Biden told reporters after a Tuesday speech. “I promise I’ll let you know when I do.”</p>\n<p id=\"NyE6xE\">With a lengthy background interview process near completed, all that is left for the Biden campaign is for the critically important one-on-one interviews between Biden and his potential picks, although Biden said Tuesday he didn’t know whether those interviews would happen in person. Biden’s team has been slowly narrowing a lengthy list of candidates. There’s been increased pressure for Biden to pick a woman of color, and a number of his top candidates are Black women, like Sen. Kamala Harris and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice. </p>\n<p id=\"30ZCGS\">Picking a woman running mate is already a smart political choice; for months, Biden has opened up a vast lead with women voters. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/upshot/polling-trump-erosion-support.html\">New York Times analysis</a> of a slew of May and June polls found Biden 25 points ahead of President Donald Trump with women. More recent polls from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-leads-by-double-digits-as-coronavirus-takes-a-toll-on-the-president-post-abc-poll-finds/2020/07/18/8d041884-c840-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-trump-poll-women-florida-arizona-texas-2020-daily-trail-markers/\">CBS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/30/publics-mood-turns-grim-trump-trails-biden-on-most-personal-traits-major-issues/\">Pew</a> have found Trump still trailing Biden among women voters, albeit by narrower margins. The Post poll found Trump slightly behind Biden among white women — a group he won by 9 points in 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"0IEQQf\">And <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/23/biden-black-women-veep-379460\">another recent poll</a> conducted by Democratic strategist Karen Finney and veteran pollster Cornell Belcher suggests Biden picking a Black woman could boost his standing particularly with younger voters — a group lacking enthusiasm for the 77-year-old former vice president. </p>\n<aside id=\"ihl5cT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How the coronavirus got Joe Biden to think much bigger\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21318721/coronavirus-joe-biden-trump-election\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"C3lR2X\">There are a number of factors going into Biden’s important decision that go far beyond politics. As former President Barack Obama’s No. 2, Biden wants a vice president who is ideologically aligned with him and is someone he can work well with. A potential boon for the US senators on Biden’s list is that as a former longtime senator and Obama’s frequent deputy to Capitol Hill as vice president, Biden may be seeking someone with built-in relationships on the Hill. He also has expertise and an intense interest in foreign policy, meaning he may be seeking a candidate with those credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"Z0wHI9\">As<strong> </strong>the oldest first-term president ever, if elected, Biden has also been clear he wants someone considerably younger and ready to assume the duties of the presidency should health problems or other unforeseen circumstances arise.</p>\n<p id=\"lEX4Ix\">“The most important thing — and I’ve actually talked to Barack about this — the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,” Biden said. </p>\n<h3 id=\"3Bo2M7\">Do vice presidential picks actually matter politically?</h3>\n<p id=\"IQXR6M\">There’s a prevailing idea that a vice presidential candidate can “deliver” their home state for the party. There are candidates on Biden’s list who hail from Midwestern states, as well as candidates who come from key Sun Belt states like Georgia and Florida. There are others who come from safe Democratic states like California, and at least one — Rice — who has little firsthand political experience. </p>\n<p id=\"7w1vEO\">The data supporting the idea of a home-state advantage in a general election is very slim, according to two political science professors — Chris Devine of the University of Dayton and Kyle Kopko of Elizabethtown College — <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/election-2016-vice-president-selection-matters-less-than-you-think-213805\">who have been studying it for years</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Zox0Nw\">“We’re pretty skeptical of the home-state advantage too,” Kopko told Vox in a recent interview. “You have to make a lot of assumptions that someone’s going to feel so strongly about their home state that’s going to override any partisan predispositions.”</p>\n<p id=\"ALKHnJ\">Kopko and Devine analyzed election and voter data going back more than 100 years and found vice presidential candidates usually only make a difference to the outcome of a general election when they are either very popular or very polarizing. </p>\n<p id=\"A1qyf8\"><a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/vice-presidential-picks/\">The Wall Street Journal in 2016</a> also analyzed years of election data and found that even when a vice presidential pick was viewed favorably by voters in their party, a majority of voters said the VP pick ultimately had no measurable impact on their vote for president. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHMpmLPyKjGBWer1tBmg-UdAS00=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789324/GettyImages_1227818229.jpg\">\n      <cite>Mark Makela/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Joe Biden delivers a speech in front of reporters Wilmington, Delaware, on July 28.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"6nH0nQ\">The importance of a vice presidential candidate has to do more with what the selection says about the presidential candidate and their judgment. A vice presidential pick sends an early signal about what a future administration might look like. </p>\n<p id=\"qZkUbh\">“It provides some info to voters about how this person would operate as a president, what does he or she stand for, what are going to be the priorities in office,” Devine said.</p>\n<p id=\"IaCnaa\">The fact that Biden is only considering women candidates for his running mate says more about where the Democratic Party is than it does about Biden’s personal convictions, Devine and Kopko said. </p>\n<p id=\"if8TZp\">“Up to this point it’s seen as picking a woman would be a bold move, an unconventional move, a strong signal,” said Devine. “At this point, I think the script is flipped somewhat, and it would be a slight to have an all-male ticket.”</p>\n<p id=\"pHd999\">The real question now is whether Biden will pick a woman of color like Harris, Rice, Reps. Karen Bass and Val Demings, or Stacey Abrams; a progressive like Sen. Elizabeth Warren; or a figure from the Midwest like Sen. Tammy Baldwin or Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. </p>\n<h3 id=\"SsYG7G\">The veepstakes list, explained</h3>\n<p id=\"SStmub\">Biden’s list is still pretty long; he previously said he hoped to narrow it to a “shortlist” of around 12 or so contenders. One young political star, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY), isn’t on it. At 30 years old, she is still five years shy of the minimum age for a vice presidential candidate — not to mention more ideologically aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"ZG3myM\">Here’s a list of potential contenders either mentioned by Biden himself or raised by his prominent allies and advisers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FIP3jJ\">California Sen. Kamala Harris</h4>\n<p id=\"KtlYlt\">Kamala Harris tops many vice presidential lists, for good reason. Biden’s onetime competitor for the 2020 presidential nomination represents California in the US Senate; she was elected to that position after serving as<strong> </strong>the state’s attorney general. As a Black woman, she may appeal to the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituency, and she recently helped craft the Justice in Policing Act, the sweeping policing reform bill from House and Senate Democrats. However, Harris’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record\">criminal justice record</a> as a former prosecutor has not always translated into the easiest relationship with Black communities — especially with groups on the left.</p>\n<div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdJ0gclwcdBtFP3LuQxDRojq45c=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19887594/GettyImages_1196862581.jpg\">\n      <cite>Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sen. Kamala Harris at the Senate chamber on January 27.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"ShPD37\">Despite some tense moments between Harris and Biden early in the campaign (she scored a polling bump after criticizing his record on racial issues at the first presidential debate), the two seem to have reconciled — maybe.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/kamala-harris-biden-vp-381829\">Politico recently reported</a> that former Sen. Chris Dodd, who is helping lead Biden’s VP search committee, told a Biden donor that Harris “had no remorse” over her debate skirmish with Biden.</p>\n<p id=\"PSXA4z\">Still,<strong> </strong>Harris’s profile could be boosted by the fact that she’s a sitting senator with relationships on Capitol Hill, and that she’s an experienced campaigner who has already been subjected to media scrutiny during the Democratic primary. She also hails from blue California, a Senate seat that will be easy for Democrats to fill. Biden has showered Harris with praise and confirmed she is on the list early on.</p>\n<p id=\"se12Tp\">“She is solid. She can be president someday herself. She can be the vice president,” <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/12/04/joe-biden-would-consider-kamala-harris-his-vice-president-pick/2611460001/\">he said in December</a>. “She can go on to be a Supreme Court justice. She can be attorney general. I mean, she has enormous capability.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZpCMDB\">Harris has also shown she’s not afraid to go toe-to-toe with members of the Trump administration or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17910850/kamala-harris-brett-kavanaugh-hearing\">Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a>. Having a vice presidential nominee who is a fighter can satisfy the base and<strong> </strong>leave Biden free to pitch himself as the commonsense unity candidate going up against Trump.</p>\n<h4 id=\"0FrWrF\">California Rep. Karen Bass</h4>\n<p id=\"RnBhQD\">In recent weeks, Bass’s profile has risen considerably in the vice presidential search. Bass is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a five-term member of Congress from Los Angeles. Before serving in Congress, she was in the California state Assembly for years, and was assembly speaker for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"ovJnMb\">Unlike many other names on Biden’s list, Bass is not known for seeking the spotlight. But her hardworking, behind-the-scenes approach on Capitol Hill has made her beloved within the House Democratic caucus and even gotten her approval from some House Republicans, including fellow Californian and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6YnUcVJcbFyfqK0cxOLfr1wcyjQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789330/GettyImages_1223812445.jpg\">\n      <cite>Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Rep. Karen Bass on Capitol Hill on July 1.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"7zgC3w\">“She’s very respectful of everybody, and she works with people extremely well, but she doesn’t create tension or respond to it,” said longtime California Democratic strategist Bill Carrick, who has known Bass for years. “She’s focused on getting things done, and she doesn’t necessarily believe that’s a function of getting a lot of media attention or drawing attention to yourself. She’s much more into bringing people together or working together to get things done.”</p>\n<p id=\"XuosbF\">Bass was a Biden pick for the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21317850/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-task-forces-progressive-agenda\">recent policy task forces</a> that included members picked by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders. She’s viewed as someone who can keep the party united, and progressives who know Bass would view her selection as a win for the left. </p>\n<p id=\"NXdoAF\">Like Harris, Bass has played an integral role in crafting and introducing Democrats’ police reform bill, the Justice in Policing Act. With a background in health care before becoming a state and now national politician, she’s also become an important voice on coronavirus and its disproportionate impacts on communities of color. And like Biden, she has experienced the loss of a child; her daughter and son-in-law were both killed in a 2006 car accident. </p>\n<p id=\"HZrCTR\">One potential problem with Bass as a vice presidential pick was remarks she made about former Cuban leader Fidel Castro upon his death in 2016, when Bass referred to him as “comandante en jefe.” Some fear the term of respect could anger Cuban Americans in Florida, a key swing state in the 2020 general election. </p>\n<p id=\"qjOypp\">Bass won’t necessarily be a flashy debater against Vice President Mike Pence, but if Biden wants to lean into his message of “healing” a fractured nation, Bass could be instrumental in delivering on that message. </p>\n<h4 id=\"6fv0qQ\">Former national security adviser and UN Ambassador Susan Rice</h4>\n<p id=\"Yuqa2k\">Rice’s name has been generating speculation for months, which has only intensified recently. </p>\n<p id=\"xxIxuV\">At first glance, Rice may seem like an unusual pick. A career civil servant and expert in foreign policy, Rice isn’t necessarily the strongest choice in campaigning or political maneuvering. But in her corner is the fact that she already has something with Biden that he’s said he wants in his No. 2: a close working relationship. Biden and Rice worked together on a number of critical foreign matters in the Obama White House, where he was also a key figure in advising Obama on foreign policy after chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for years.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xdtNsGkDiepmLz9nY1Pfb8Qah1s=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789340/947143646.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Win McNamee/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice in 2018.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"qEJQFB\">Biden surrogates have confirmed Rice is being vetted by the campaign. But Biden must also consider the prospect that Republicans could once again dredge up their favorite issue, the US-led intervention in Libya and the resulting deaths of four Americans in Benghazi. Democrats may hope the issue will no longer be salient in the minds of swing voters, but Republicans may still hammer it nonetheless. </p>\n<p id=\"GagJNT\">Still, having worked with Rice extensively on foreign policy issues he cares deeply about could be about as meaningful for Biden as any other factor he must weigh in his decision. After Trump’s chaotic presidency, the US will have to do a lot of rebuilding relationships with other foreign leaders in Europe and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"D0m1Dq\">Having a vice president who is steeped in these issues could free up Biden to focus on myriad domestic issues he will have to tackle as president. </p>\n<h4 id=\"Ip11zh\">Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</h4>\n<p id=\"ugjv2m\">Gretchen Whitmer’s political star is rising, and Biden is taking notice.</p>\n<p id=\"qo5Ymt\">Whitmer is the 48-year-old Democratic governor of Michigan and served as the state Senate minority leader years before that. She’s a pragmatic, middle-of-the-road governor focused on health care and infrastructure whose 2018 campaign slogan was “fix the damn roads.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qrlQqkwGbcmoAWAy_NcVUhOJbI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19887955/GettyImages_974429728.jpg\">\n      <cite>Bill Pugliano/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2018.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"yEFTAO\">Michigan is one of the states representing Democrats’ recent troubles (and possible redemption) in the Midwest, and Biden’s path to the White House runs through it. Whitmer could be a big asset in this endeavor. She worked to appeal to Michigan’s Republican and independent voters in the 2018 election, where she beat the state’s Republican then-attorney general Bill Schuette by 9 points. Whitmer won counties that went for Trump in 2016, showing her appeal across party lines.</p>\n<p id=\"8VRCMS\">“We are a state that goes back and forth; we are not a state that comfortably fits into one party or another,” she <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/30/17616800/progressives-abdul-el-sayed-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-michigan-governor-democrat-primary\">told Vox in a 2018 interview</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"EtZOLH\">As Detroit has been hit hard during the coronavirus crisis, Whitmer has become a fixation of Trump’s as she’s attempted to secure more federal aid and health care equipment for her state. Whitmer is far from the only governor (Republican and Democrat alike) to call for more help, yet Trump reserved some of his worst insults for her. He called her “Gretchen ‘Half’ Whitmer” in a tweet and said he had a “big problem” with the “young ... woman governor” in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"JXE11r\">Biden invited Whitmer <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/heres-the-deal/\">onto his podcast</a> in early April, where he called her “one of the most talented people in the country” and a “friend.” In addition to talking about the challenges facing the country, the two seem to have an affinity for each other; Whitmer recounted how Biden shared Fig Newtons with her and her daughter during a campaign stop.</p>\n<p id=\"7MU1Ho\">Whitmer seems to have a lot of what Biden is looking for in a running mate, although she has spent fewer years in higher office than some other contenders. The larger question might be if she’d accept (she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/biden-potential-running-mates/index.html\">has already said</a> “it’s not going to be me”), or if Democrats would be willing to jeopardize a key governor’s seat.</p>\n<h4 id=\"eI4FwQ\">Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren</h4>\n<p id=\"6dMt0I\">If Biden wants to do some serious outreach to progressives, Elizabeth Warren is the obvious choice.</p>\n<p id=\"IG89Zf\">Warren’s campaign was the tireless policy machine of 2020, churning out plans for everything from <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/combating-infectious-disease-outbreaks\">pandemic preparedness</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/22/18509196/elizabeth-warren-debt-free-college\">debt-free college</a>. Biden recently backed a Warren plan that allows student debt to be canceled during bankruptcy — a notable move, given a famous policy disagreement between the two <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/6/18518381/baccpa-bankruptcy-bill-2005-biden-warren\">on a 2005 bankruptcy bill</a>. He also <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-2020-vice-president-3536f876-8239-4a31-b7c4-b9d2b39e8521.html\">mused to Axios in December</a> that while he would add Warren to his VP list, “The question is would she add me made to her list.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEAlyyPJ5efmqZw-s5uoAiezJ9M=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789348/GettyImages_1227737858.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sen. Elizabeth Warren addresses extensions of eviction protections in the next coronavirus bill on July 22.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"v465iz\">Warren may be the choice for uniting the ideological wings of the party, and picking her would certainly say something about where a Biden administration would be willing to go policy-wise. But electorally, it might make more sense to go with a woman of color, or a moderate from the Midwest, rather than an unapologetic liberal Democrat representing Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"GnTMag\">And then there’s the question of whether Warren would actually want the vice presidential job. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/20/20867899/elizabeth-warren-cfpb-founding-plans-obama-president\">As Vox’s Emily Stewart wrote</a>, Warren’s time setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau demonstrated her executive leadership and knack for “pulling administrative levers.”</p>\n<p id=\"o2T1MF\">With this in mind, Warren actually might be more at home — and have more of an impact — as a Cabinet pick like secretary of Treasury or education, where she could actually enact a chunk of her broad regulatory agenda. </p>\n<h4 id=\"5jtPf7\">Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin</h4>\n<p id=\"4B3vwr\">The two-term senator from Wisconsin checks a whole lot of boxes. She made history in 2012 as the first openly gay senator. And even as Republicans spent millions to try to oust her in 2018, she cruised to reelection, beating her Republican challenger by 11 points.</p>\n<p id=\"dNcaUF\">Wisconsin Republicans were hoping to prove the state was red once and for all in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/15/17085078/tammy-baldwin-2018-wisconsin-senate-race-kevin-nicholson\">as Vox’s Dylan Scott wrote</a>. Instead, Baldwin hung on and former Gov. Scott Walker (R) lost to Democrat Tony Evers, showing signs of life for the Democratic Party there. Baldwin ran — and won — on the issue of health care. Her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/29/17792588/tammy-baldwin-preexisting-conditions-trump-short-term-insurance\">fight in the Senate to protect those with preexisting conditions</a> is personal; she has a preexisting condition from childhood.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI7JRui6vR7IGgIKfDVd_vboHTQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19888262/GettyImages_906166250.jpg\">\n      <cite>Alex Wong/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sen. Tammy Baldwin is a two-term progressive from Wisconsin and made history in 2012 as the first openly gay senator.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"C8N8sT\">In addition to proving her staying power in a Midwestern swing state, Baldwin has serious progressive bona fides, even if they don’t get as much attention as Warren’s or Sanders’s credentials. Like Michigan, Wisconsin is crucial for Biden to win, and Baldwin could give him a boost.</p>\n<p id=\"juoy1Q\">But taking her away from the Senate could be risky for Democrats; Wisconsin voters will by no means automatically elect another Democrat to take her place.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Ch9H4N\">Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth</h4>\n<p id=\"ySsovH\">There’s been a lot of push and pull between a woman of color and a woman from the Midwest — Tammy Duckworth is both.</p>\n<p id=\"5rHJ7d\">A Thai American who made history as the first US senator <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/10/17219416/tammy-duckworth-first-senator-birth-baby\">to give birth while holding office</a> (and then <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17067466/tammy-duckworth-senate-leave-policy\">spoke to the challenges</a> of taking maternity leave while holding that office), Duckworth is helping change one of America’s oldest institutions. She cast a vote in 2018 while holding her newborn baby.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nx-wndMKeUNILuLOecAVVyiyBcY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19887979/GettyImages_854178266.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) is an Iraq War veteran and the first US senator to give birth while holding office.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"g63pXY\">Duckworth has an impressive résumé; she’s a military veteran who flew Black Hawk helicopters in Iraq and had a double leg amputation after her helicopter went down.</p>\n<p id=\"lAAiKq\">The senator from Illinois is also unapologetically moderate. In the wake of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise primary win in 2018, Duckworth questioned whether that brand of progressivism could be replicated in more moderate parts of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"cWhozi\">“I think it’s the future of the party in the Bronx.” Duckworth said, adding, “I think that you can’t win the White House without the Midwest, and I don’t think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"1bP3jA\">Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams</h4>\n<p id=\"tUWspp\">Abrams, a voting rights activist who narrowly lost a bid for Georgia’s governorship in 2018, has been generating VP speculation for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"uRGPzI\">She came within 1.4 points of being America’s first Black woman governor in 2018, but now that 2020 is here and there are two Senate races in her home state of Georgia, she’s showing few signs of wanting to run in either one. Even with her relative lack of experience in higher office, she’s very popular with Black women. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/balancing-ticket-stacey-abrams-kamala-harris-top-vp-picks-she-n1155471\">A March poll done by She the People</a>, an organization for and by women of color, found Abrams was the clear first choice among its respondents — even over Harris.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fbgs909FprXm2h4Qg29xl_BelHk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19888255/GettyImages_1052872562.jpg\">\n      <cite>Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Stacy Abrams narrowly lost her bid to become the first Black woman governor in 2018.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"QsG8a5\">As Abrams continues her work on the issue of expanding voting rights for voters of color, she has very publicly been making a case for herself to be the vice president in TV interviews and podcast appearances. Even so, Abrams recently said she has not yet been contacted by the Biden campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"7kkL0V\">“I would be honored to be on the campaign trail as a running mate,” Abrams recently told <em>Pod Save America</em>. “That is a process you can’t campaign for and I’m not campaigning for.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"WxxNWl\">New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham</h4>\n<p id=\"sykRhr\">In the same vein, Biden may also want to take a look at New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the first Democratic Latina governor in the US. Before she was elected governor in 2018, Lujan Grisham was a member of Congress, serving as the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuxmOH-CLBd4zlskhto01ScXeto=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19888250/GettyImages_973218914.jpg\">\n      <cite>Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is a former chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ID4ruA\">Even though New Mexico is no longer considered a swing state, the governor’s mansion was under Republican control for eight years. Lujan Grisham flipped it from red to blue. She also led the influential Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the Trump administration’s family separation policy and was a loud voice against the administration’s treatment of migrants.</p>\n<p id=\"YCwRP9\">“We’re doing everything we can to stop the president and Homeland Security from continuing to enact pain using the terminology for zero tolerance for anybody breaking the law,” Lujan Grisham told <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico/articles/2018-06-22/immigration-debate-stirs-campaigns-for-new-mexico-governor\"><strong>the Associated Press in June 2018</strong></a>.</p>\n<p id=\"q7IFcK\">She has proved she’s electable in her home state, but it might be tough to introduce her to the rest of the country.</p>\n<h4 id=\"NLzMH7\">Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms</h4>\n<p id=\"axXB7P\">One of Biden’s earliest supporters, Bottoms has stuck with the former vice president from the beginning. She <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state%E2%80%94regional-govt%E2%80%94politics/how-atlanta-mayor-has-emerged-one-biden-top-supporters/ahYxLZGS9TTv6vWNJXbJSI/\">endorsed him after the first Democratic debate</a>, rather than throwing her support behind Harris or Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), the two Black candidates running at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"K0Mq1z\">Her reasoning was a belief that Biden was best positioned to beat Trump in a general election. Even as Biden was faltering in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Bottoms was one of the main surrogates campaigning for him in South Carolina, the state where he staged his comeback. Bottoms’s city of Atlanta has been one of the epicenters of protests against police brutality, especially after police shot and killed Rayshard Brooks in a Wendy’s parking lot. Bottoms has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/atlanta-mayor-keisha-bottoms-police-force-policy-rayshard-brooks-shooting/\">vowed police reforms</a> in the Atlanta Police Department, including limiting the amount of force officers can use.</p>\n<p id=\"CaBF3r\">One of Biden’s top allies, Jim Clyburn, has been pushing Biden to choose a woman of color as his running mate for months. And Clyburn made it clear early that he thinks Bottoms could be the woman for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"DmM5vd\">“There is a young lady right there in Georgia who I think would make a tremendous VP candidate, and that’s the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms,” Clyburn told the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/national-govt%E2%80%94politics/clyburn-mentions-atlanta-mayor-bottoms-possible-pick/wFvHVod1v84uqHMLvYweqI/\">in a recent interview</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"RK3kKv\">Florida Rep. Val Demings</h4>\n<p id=\"DBALKb\">Demings has developed a high profile in Congress in a relatively short time. She was one of the impeachment managers selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to present the case against President Trump to the US Senate.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZaGrIk98uIi30wIxX24R06sSvRA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19888249/GettyImages_1195887086.jpg\">\n      <cite>Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Rep. Val Demings served as one of the impeachment managers in the case against President Trump.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"681bez\">Before she was a member of Congress, Demings had a background in law enforcement. She was the first woman chief of police in Orlando, Florida. Even though she’s not as well known as some other names on this list, the fact that she hails from the Orlando area is politically important — the I-4 corridor from Tampa to Orlando is a competitive part of a key swing state Democrats would like to win back in 2020.</p>\n<p id=\"mxHUiX\">Biden confirmed Demings was on his shortlist in a May interview, calling her “a very competent, very capable person.”</p>\n<p id=\"8TaFru\">Demings’s role in the impeachment trial lends her some name recognition, but impeachment could be ripe for Republican attacks; Democrats might avoid wading into that area and instead focus on issues like health care. Demings has said she’d be up to take the slot if Biden asked her.</p>\n<p id=\"SLZblv\">“I love being a member of Congress,” Demings recently told Florida TV station WFTV-9. “But if asked, I would consider it an honor.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"Tud29j\">Former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano</h4>\n<p id=\"0HUxTt\">Napolitano’s name <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/sort-vp-biden-really-needs/611122/\">has been floating around a bit</a> — albeit much less than some other more high-profile contenders. Napolitano served as Arizona governor from 2003 to 2009 before making the transition to Barack Obama’s Cabinet, working as the director of the Homeland Security Department from 2009 to 2013. Napolitano hasn’t been in office for years, but she has valuable national security experience and led a red state as a Democrat in the mid-2000s.</p>\n<p id=\"iVG5Xr\">While there’s been a lot of talk about the importance of Midwestern swing states in the 2020 election, Arizona is just as significant. It used to be reliably Republican, but it is diversifying and Democrats had some notable success in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/12/18056978/senate-midterm-results-arizona-kyrsten-sinema-winner\">key 2018 Senate race</a>. They could pick up a second Senate seat as well this year, and election forecasters say Arizona will likely be key to Biden’s Electoral College math in November. Napolitano is an unknown for a lot of people outside the state, but if Biden is serious about winning there, she could be an asset.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Those who lived through the faddish interest in climate in the mid-2000s, around the release of Al Gore’s <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, will recall the endless torrent of breathless corporate announcements. NBC had a “green week,” big corporations bought cheap <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/27/20994118/carbon-offset-climate-change-net-zero-neutral-emissions\">offsets</a> to become “carbon neutral,” automakers sold SUVs with vegan leather seats, and dozens of companies sold “sustainable” coffee cups, T-shirts, and tchotchkes. It was a greenwashing parade.</p>\n<p id=\"uyF8d1\">But times really have changed. The steps tech companies are taking these days represent a sea change in engagement. Climate change has moved out of the public relations department, into the C-suite, and down to the shop floor. </p>\n<p id=\"nzurLv\">To explore the strength of recent corporate climate commitments (and their limits), I want to focus in on Microsoft, a widely acknowledged leader in the field. Earlier this year, it <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\">committed</a> not just to reducing its emissions but to going carbon negative, wiping out all the carbon the company and its suppliers have emitted since its founding in 1975. In recent weeks, Microsoft has released a flurry of announcements updating its progress, so now seems like a propitious time to take a close look.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"MSFT executives\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjfxtzrbKknxyO9EolXrNvPYIko=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20790448/MS_Event_2020_01_Carbon_T8A7561_small.jpg\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Smale/MSFT</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Microsoft president Brad Smith, CFO Amy Hood, and CEO Satya Nadella preparing to announce Microsoft’s plan to be carbon negative by 2030.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"58n8uv\">Over the past week, I’ve been talking to corporate sustainability experts and people who have worked with, and at, Microsoft. I tried to piece together how big a deal its work on climate is — how seriously to take it, what influence it may have, and where it might fall short.</p>\n<p id=\"zVaNJm\">To spoil the ending: It is a big deal. The company is setting new standards, especially in the rigor and transparency it is applying to the effort, and it is deliberately attempting to bring other companies, both suppliers and competitors, along with it into a world of shared metrics and data. There is more it could do, but it is earning its good climate reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"4RgEpm\">I’ll dig into what Microsoft is doing and what makes it unusual. But first, some background.</p>\n<h3 id=\"XekVjR\">A quick note on kinds of emissions</h3>\n<p id=\"ApcpaB\">In the carbon world, the emissions of a company (or person, city, or country) can be divided into three buckets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"I7zziM\">\n<strong>Scope 1 emissions</strong> come directly from resources the business owns or controls, like furnaces or delivery vehicles.</li>\n<li id=\"7sgA6p\">\n<strong>Scope 2 emissions</strong> come from the power plants that generate the electricity the business uses.</li>\n<li id=\"iLuBkd\">\n<strong>Scope 3 emissions</strong> are indirect, “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/7/1/18743992/climate-change-cities-food-cars-emissions\">embedded</a>” in the materials and services the business uses, representing the emissions of the full supply chain. (Business travel is a common example — there are carbon emissions embedded in every plane ticket.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"9wHxcu\">In the early days of corporate climate engagement, companies typically measured and reduced only their direct energy emissions (scope 1 and 2). But in the past several years, in part thanks to the example set by companies like Dow, Unilever, Apple, and Microsoft, measuring and taking responsibility for scope 3 emissions has become the new norm. </p>\n<p id=\"aL9RtJ\">This is significant, because for most companies, including Microsoft, scope 3 emissions are substantially larger than scope 1 and 2 combined. </p>\n<p id=\"aUo55m\">“At Microsoft, we expect to emit 16 million metric tons of carbon this year,” president Brad Smith <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\">wrote</a> in a January blog post. “Of this total, about 100,000 are scope 1 emissions and about 4 million are scope 2 emissions. The remaining 12 million tons all fall into scope 3. Given the wide range of scope 3 activities, this higher percentage of the total is probably typical for most organizations.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"yNcVvB\">Microsoft has a recent history as a sustainability leader</h3>\n<p id=\"NSzjNM\">On Monday, Microsoft <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hydrogen-datacenters/\">announced</a> it has completed the largest-ever test running data center servers on hydrogen fuel cells, which can be powered by zero-carbon hydrogen generated from renewable energy. Currently, even if they run entirely on renewables, data centers have diesel generators on site for long-term backup in case of an outage. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NB2b81KQRCEowiD95jzcT5AfkNk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20790454/Visual_Asset_2.jpg\">\n      <cite>Power Innovations</cite>\n      <figcaption>Power Innovations built a 250-kilowatt fuel cell system to help Microsoft explore the potential of using a hydrogen fuel cells for backup power generation at data centers. In a proof of concept, the system powered a row of servers for 48 consecutive hours.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"X5sXs5\">With 160 data centers worldwide and multiple generators per data center, that adds up to a lot of diesel generators. The company has pledged to phase them all out by 2030. That’s why it is testing fuel cells as backup power. </p>\n<p id=\"9Nf1x1\">It is the latest in a <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vox&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsustainability%2Fapproach%3Factivetab%3Dpivot1%3Aprimaryr6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">string of climate initiatives</a> that go back almost a decade. The company has been 100 percent carbon neutral, through the purchase of carbon offsets, since 2012. In 2013, it implemented an internal carbon tax on the scope 1 and 2 emissions of all divisions, with the revenue going toward sustainability improvements. It created a business unit focused on climate solutions, which produces things like <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vox&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fai%2Fai-for-earth\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI for Earth</a>.

In 2016, it <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/2016-climate-leadership-award-winners#Microsoft%20Corporation\">won a climate leadership award</a> from EPA. </p>\n<p id=\"64za52\">“We’ve seen them as a leader since 2013,” says Nicolette Bartlett, climate change director at the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a global clearinghouse of corporate sustainability data. The CDP has a <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores\">scorecard</a>, which takes into account hundreds of sustainability and transparency metrics, and Microsoft has consistently gotten an A. “It really matters to them,” Bartlett says.</p>\n<aside id=\"vrnXVG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Why the US bears the most responsibility for climate change, in one chart\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"gbZHCO\">In recent years, thanks to the IPCC report and pressure from investors and employees, concern over climate change has risen to the highest levels of the company. Josh Henretig, who spent 12 years on the company’s global sustainability team, rising to senior director before leaving in February, says he witnessed the shift from his team pushing to his team being pulled. “We started to almost stumble under the full weight and examination that the executive team imposed on us around the question: What’s really required?” he says.</p>\n<p id=\"yIdbUi\">“At this stage,” says Verena Radulovic, director of corporate engagement at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, “Microsoft has enough experience with reducing its own emissions, and support from its leadership to keep doing so, that it is able to take its climate commitment to a more ambitious level.”</p>\n<p id=\"BchxyS\">And that’s what it did in January.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fPTC38\">Microsoft will go carbon negative and wipe out all the carbon it has ever emitted</h3>\n<p id=\"HYIAwI\">In January, Microsoft made a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\">startling announcement</a>: Not only will it reduce its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 55 percent, it will continue beyond that and go carbon negative, drawing down more carbon than it emits, by 2030. By 2050, it will draw down enough carbon to account for all the company’s emissions since its founding in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"uIqyba\">“It set a new bar for what is considered climate leadership,” says Radulovic.</p>\n<p id=\"cwRsZV\">As you can see on the graph below, the target represents a radical acceleration of Microsoft’s carbon reduction efforts. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A chart showing a projected fall in Microsoft emissions under its carbon-reduction plan.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sjd5CTXEo1JdRAMTz0FD0kavoJU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20530842/ppt_slide_3.jpg\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Microsoft’s net emissions reached a peak in recent years, and would need to continue a steady decline to reach zero by 2030.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"3iCGXi\">The January announcement, which came from Smith, the company’s president, backed by CFO Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella, laid out a set of principles that would guide the company’s approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"SPNkXz\">Grounding in science and math</li>\n<li id=\"7FTciP\">Taking responsibility for our carbon footprint </li>\n<li id=\"sT0O7l\">Investing for new carbon reduction and removal technology</li>\n<li id=\"ZCECPt\">Empowering customers around the world </li>\n<li id=\"Dc5SjT\">Ensuring effective transparency </li>\n<li id=\"s7dUcX\">Using our voice on carbon-related public policy issues </li>\n<li id=\"kFpvnp\">Enlisting our employees</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"dUhGWY\">The post goes into detail on each. I’ll just hit some highlights. </p>\n<p id=\"VtGdCf\">Nos. 1 and 2 are about proper measurement, scope 1-3 emissions, and historical emissions. “While we at Microsoft have worked hard to be ‘carbon neutral’ since 2012,” Smith writes, “our recent work has led us to conclude that this is an area where we’re far better served by humility than pride.” </p>\n<p id=\"EXpTOY\">“We had some very heartwarming, but also uncomfortable, conversations,” says Henretig. </p>\n<p id=\"008YGy\">Through these discussions, the company concluded that voluntary offsets are insufficient. It is now moving to a model where it directly contracts with renewable projects through power purchase agreements, (PPAs) — it is aiming to hit net zero for its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 — and will compensate for what it can’t directly reduce with negative emissions. </p>\n<p id=\"3no5wP\">In this area, especially, Microsoft is showing real leadership. </p>\n<aside id=\"Wh5Pfj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Can you really negate your carbon emissions?

Just recently, for instance, the International Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/7/14/21319678/climate-change-renewable-energy-technology-innovation-net-zero-emissions\">argued</a> that crucial early-stage technologies need enabling infrastructure to continue developing.</p>\n<p id=\"sjo8F6\">“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” says consultant and former corporate social responsibility (CSR) executive Lindsay Baker. “There are opportunities to invest in infrastructure and other types of projects that have a market rate of return, more in line with just getting your money back — I would really like to see corporations making more of those kinds of investments.”  </p>\n<p id=\"n8ChMY\">Baker also notes that there are “plenty of opportunities for charitable giving that will help move the needle on climate,” including in lab-stage research or <a href=\"https://primecoalition.org/\">companies still in product development</a>. A company like Microsoft, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/microsoft-apple-and-alphabet-are-sitting-on-more-than-100-billion-in-cash.html\">well over $100 billion in the bank</a>, could put some money toward these other areas as well, or at least divert a portion of its $1 billion to them. </p>\n<p id=\"kgBh5c\">Nonetheless, a billion dollars in VC money is nothing to sneeze at. Nor is the signal Microsoft has sent to other companies by committing to a goal it admits it does not yet have the technology to achieve. It says going carbon negative will require “negative emission technologies (NET) potentially including afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/14/17445622/direct-air-capture-air-to-fuels-carbon-dioxide-engineering\">direct air capture</a> (DAC).”</p>\n<aside id=\"REueNE\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/24/18001538/climate-change-co2-removal-negative-emissions-cdr-carbon-dioxide\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"WHnLpv\">Some of those technologies don’t exist at meaningful scale yet, and Microsoft is making a concerted effort to accelerate them. Especially if it can inspire other companies to make similar investments — Amazon <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/sustainability/amazon-launches-a-2-billion-climate-pledge-fund\">announced a $2 billion climate fund</a> in June — the spillover effects will help boost the entire sector.</p>\n<p id=\"q5Q1U4\">“While much of Microsoft’s focus is on technologies that will help it reduce its own footprint,” says Radulovic, “the hope and vision is that these technologies will scale and others can use them.”</p>\n<p id=\"rSqgBa\">No. 4 is about products and services Microsoft will design that will enable its clients to reduce their own emissions. We will return to No. 4 in a bit, since some of the biggest controversies reside here.</p>\n<p id=\"lqG4ux\">No. 5, transparency, is another area where the company is showing leadership. Every year, Microsoft will publish a <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vox&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevices%2Fsustainability-report%2F\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sustainability report</a>, breaking down its emissions and progress against its goals. It has had its targets verified by the <a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/\">Science Based Targets Initiative</a> as being in line with a pathway to limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C. In reporting its emissions, it is following the World Resources Institute’s <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/greenhouse-gas-protocol#:~:text=Standards%20and%20tools%20for%20companies,efficient%2C%20resilient%2C%20and%20prosperous.&amp;text=The%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Protocol%20(GHGP,trainings%20for%20business%20and%20government.\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a>. And it is sharing its data with the CDP. In short, it is modeling best practices in transparency.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l9w-0pRuMFYk2Z55h-ow-ZL9kNs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20790460/Screen_Shot_2020_07_29_at_11.16.24_PM.png\">\n      <cite>MSFT</cite>\n      <figcaption>Microsoft’s 2018 greenhouse gas emissions, by sector.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"UuPzug\">No. 6 is also interesting, but we’ll come back to that later as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BASToE\">The company just announced its first concrete steps toward its target</h3>\n<p id=\"67kcAT\">This month, Microsoft chief environmental officer Lucas Joppa <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/21/carbon-negative-transform-to-net-zero/\">published an update on Microsoft’s progress</a>, with several new announcements. </p>\n<p id=\"xbyL0E\">First, Microsoft is joining with nine other large companies — A.P. Moller-Maersk, Danone, Mercedes-Benz, AG,  Natura &amp; Co, Nike, Starbucks, Unilever, and Wipro, along with the Environmental Defense Fund — in <a href=\"https://transformtonetzero.org/\">Transform to Net Zero</a>, “a cross-sector initiative to accelerate the transition to a net zero global economy.” It will run on much the same principles that Microsoft laid out for itself, including science-based measurement and transparency, with a commitment to knowledge sharing and norm-setting.</p>\n<p id=\"KibCr6\">“When you look at the reach of these initial eight companies, as well as the supply and value chains of those companies, you start to get a pretty big market share,” says Jenn Crider, senior director of communications at Microsoft. It will exert a pull on other companies to use “a common and standardized approach to the math, the language, and the accounting,” she says.</p>\n<p id=\"XvXNuJ\">Second, Microsoft debuted a <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vox&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsustainability%3Frtc%3D1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sustainability calculator</a> that will help its cloud clients calculate and reduce their carbon footprint. Third, it pledged to be completely free of diesel fuel and diesel generators by 2030. Fourth, it <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/04/15/were-increasing-our-carbon-fee-as-we-double-down-on-sustainability/\">raised its internal carbon tax</a> and broadened it to encompass scope 3 emissions. Fifth, it updated its <a href=\"https://aka.ms/scoc\">Supplier Code of Conduct</a> to require suppliers to calculate and report their full emissions. </p>\n<p id=\"80K9ZO\">Sixth and perhaps most intriguingly, it has issued a request for proposals (RFP) seeking, for this fiscal year, a million metric tons of “carbon removal from a range of nature- and technology-based solutions that are net negative and verified to a high degree of scientific integrity.” It recognizes that these technologies are not fully developed, acknowledges that it will make mistakes, and says it is explicitly “using this RFP to harvest and share best available science and market intelligence on carbon removal,” to make things easier for other companies that want to follow suit.</p>\n<p id=\"Yr4x9V\">“Someday, CO2 removal will be fully commoditized,” says Julio Friedmann, a carbon researcher at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who has helped advise Microsoft on its RFP. “These actions help put us on that course.”</p>\n<p id=\"DtO4Xo\">It will be extremely interesting to see which and what type of carbon removal projects Microsoft ends up choosing through its RFP.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qoc6s6AvV7PXwK-AuH-4QYNOR-E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12901251/carbon_engineering.jpg\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"http://carbonengineering.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Engineering</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>A mockup of a direct air capture (DAC) machine from Carbon Engineering. </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ewx00L\">Seventh, Microsoft announced the first investment from its $1 billion <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vox&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fcorporate-responsibility%2Fsustainability%2Fclimate-innovation-fund\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Innovation Fund</a>: $50 million will go to <a href=\"https://www.energyimpactpartners.com/\">Energy Impact Partners</a>, “a leading venture capital firm focused on decarbonized, decentralized energy industry transition that shares learnings among partners and facilitates collaboration.”</p>\n<p id=\"AY70TV\">Eighth and finally, the company is taking action on environmental justice, partnering with renewables developer <a href=\"https://www.solsystems.com/\">Sol Systems</a> on 500 megawatts of distributed solar energy projects “in under-resourced communities, working with local leaders and prioritizing minority and women-owned businesses.” Given that the average residential rooftop solar system is a bit over 5 kW and commercial solar rooftop systems around 100 kW, that’s a <em>lot</em> of solar projects, representing the “single largest renewable energy portfolio investment Microsoft has ever made.”</p>\n<p id=\"HgB5oh\">Alongside those projects, the company will provide $50 million in “community-led grants and investments that support educational programs, job and career training, habitat restoration and programs that support access to clean energy and energy efficiency.” </p>\n<p id=\"YNT02W\">So that’s one big target, seven principles, and eight initiatives. What should we make of it?</p>\n<h3 id=\"TjbLM0\">Microsoft is earning kudos for its climate efforts </h3>\n<p id=\"xa0SWd\">I’ve talked with numerous experts in corporate sustainability to wrap my head around how to judge Microsoft’s efforts. Without exception, they praised Microsoft as a leader on climate change. Its commitment to good science, shared metrics, transparent reporting, and full carbon responsibility (not relying on offsets) is already setting a good example. </p>\n<p id=\"TS2Yyw\">“In Microsoft being among the first large companies to set such an ambitious target,” says Radulovic, “it allowed others, especially in non-tech sectors with more risk-averse or less innovative cultures, a safe space to do the same.”</p>\n<p id=\"UuKSY7\">It is difficult to trace direct causal lines between Microsoft’s announcements and those of other companies. Major corporate initiatives take years to develop. Their true effects will be measured by how many companies they pull into their wake in years to come. This was a common theme from experts in the field: Microsoft will have its biggest impact through the partnerships and collaborations it forms to spread its tools and ambitions.</p>\n<p id=\"ObGjqG\">Another notable feature of Microsoft’s efforts is the clear support from the top of the company. “All the big environmental announcements come from the CEO himself, which means there’s C-suite buy-in for everything they are doing,” says Jen Boynton, who works in corporate social responsibility at Cisco. “He’s making the commitment, he’s accountable, and there is financial and investor skin in the game.”</p>\n<div id=\"ZQfHcU\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B55viclEWLc?rel=0&amp;%3Bstart=455&amp;start=455\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"c6lFu1\">You could think of this as the evolution of corporate climate engagement, both within individual companies and across sectors: It begins in public relations, moves to the “environmental department,” and then gets taken up by top leadership, who look to their engineers to figure it out.</p>\n<p id=\"LQsw91\">“The sustainability guys tend to think inside of a box,” says Bartlett, “but as soon as the shop floor gets hold of it, it becomes part of the DNA of the organization.”</p>\n<p id=\"zDm2Kp\">Brian Janous, general manager of energy and sustainability at Microsoft, recalls the effect at the company when carbon reporting was expanded from scope 1 and 2 (energy) to scope 3 (supply chain, materials, and everything else): “Suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodwork. ‘Oh, we have to solve this, we have to solve that. We have to think about the amount of electricity being used to manufacture Xboxes. We have to think about the electricity being consumed by the people that use Xboxes.’”</p>\n<p id=\"vuAwgk\">It brought designers and engineers from every division to the task, people whose lives revolve around solving problems within resource parameters. Microsoft has made carbon a parameter for every team of engineers in the company now, and they are going to work on it. </p>\n<p id=\"2MaxHG\">And there’s one other feature worth celebrating. “The thing about Microsoft’s work that I love, love, love is the investment in climate equity and environmental justice,” says Alison Murphy, who has directed sustainability and social impact work at companies like Lime and Lululemon. “This has been missing from the corporate dialogue. More companies should take this kind of intersectional lens.”</p>\n<p id=\"82uz7U\">As much as Microsoft is doing, though, this is climate change, which means it’s never enough. Climate advocates and activists are not going to stop pushing for more. What would more look like? </p>\n<p id=\"pZZZ8d\">As I’ve asked around, the areas where Microsoft’s efforts could be critiqued fall into roughly four buckets. </p>\n<h3 id=\"I8fLnb\">Microsoft could go even further by requiring suppliers to reduce emissions</h3>\n<p id=\"uEPIHb\">The same day Microsoft published its updates on progress, Apple <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F07%2Fapple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fenergy-and-environment%2F2020%2F7%2F30%2F21336777%2Fmicrosoft-climate-change-goals-negative-emissions-technologies\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it would aim to be “carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030,” an astonishing goal for a company that manufactures, ships, and disposes of so many devices. </p>\n<p id=\"5ng2n9\">“Apple has said their suppliers will all run on renewable energy,” says Bartlett. “It set targets for them.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Since 2014, all of Apple’s data centers have been powered by 100 percent renewable energy.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHmfktpb4Xg2e212cVVNAaWH7k8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20790468/Apple_commits_100_percent_carbon_neutrality_for_supply_chain_and_products_by_2030_datacenter_or_prineville_07212020.jpg\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F07%2Fapple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fenergy-and-environment%2F2020%2F7%2F30%2F21336777%2Fmicrosoft-climate-change-goals-negative-emissions-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\">Apple</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Since 2014, Apple has purchased enough renewable energy to offset the usage of all its data centers.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"T6phD8\">So far, Microsoft — which deals more in software and thus has a smaller scope 3 footprint — has only said that its suppliers must measure and report their full emissions. “Right now I read it to say, ‘we’re working with suppliers to find efficiencies’,” says Elizabeth Jardim, a corporate campaigner at Greenpeace USA. “And efficiency is important. But it only gets you so far.”</p>\n<p id=\"5tH96i\">Apple will not simply cut off suppliers, Bartlett says, but will work with them to build their capacity to reduce emissions. “It’s not going to be every company in your supply chain” that needs special attention, she says. “It’s the 80/20 rule — go for the big ones first.”</p>\n<p id=\"tpq588\">There are signs Microsoft is heading in the same direction. In its commitments thus far, “you see a forecasting of where we’re going,” says Crider. “The first step is reporting requirements; the next steps will be reduction. You can make the assumption that there will be requirements on that reduction over time.”</p>\n<p id=\"YrIiuq\">For now, Apple is setting the bar on supply chain reductions, but it’s a close race.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wFfLAb\">It could stop selling products to companies that use them to dig up fossil fuels</h3>\n<p id=\"SlHiy4\">Microsoft says it will develop products and services that will help its clients reduce their emissions, which is laudable. But there remains the question of how its other products are used. </p>\n<p id=\"BxAIDd\">In particular, attention has recently focused on contracts for cloud and AI services between big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies. Journalist Brian Merchant had a great <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-google-microsoft-and-big-tech-are-automating-the-1832790799\">exposé<strong> </strong>on this at Gizmodo</a> last year. The services in question “are explicitly aimed at streamlining, improving, and rendering oil and gas extraction operations more profitable,” he wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"FdMYmQ\">In May, Greenpeace issued a report looking closer at “<a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/oil-in-the-cloud/\">how tech companies are helping big oil profit from climate destruction</a>.” It found, among other things, that “Microsoft’s contract with ExxonMobil alone could lead to emissions greater than 20% of Microsoft’s annual carbon footprint.”</p>\n<p id=\"c2gI7Q\">“Right now, the emissions from those contracts are not included in [Microsoft’s] carbon footprint,” says Jardim. “They’re not even tracking it.”</p>\n<div id=\"TknMJl\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft has made a pledge to be carbon negative by 2030. Its approach has won praise from climate scientists, but the company also counts some of the worst emitters — oil and gas giants such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil — among its customers. <a href=\"https://t.co/j9x0DQIuLs\">https://t.co/j9x0DQIuLs</a></p>— The Seattle Times (@seattletimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seattletimes/status/1269735116022132740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"sbCY7c\">In response to the Greenpeace report (which followed on the heels of years of criticism from tech workers, investors, and politicians), <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/google-says-it-will-not-build-custom-a-i-for-oil-and-gas-extraction-72d1f71f42c8\">Google announced</a> that it will no longer “build custom [artificial intelligence or machine learning] algorithms to facilitate upstream extraction in the oil and gas industry.” </p>\n<p id=\"3pSxEq\">In Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\">January announcement</a>, Smith writes that the company is “committed to continuing to work with all our customers, including those in the oil and gas business.” Because a prosperous future will require more energy, he says, “it’s imperative that we enable energy companies to transition.” (The company issued a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/05/19/commitment-zero-carbon-future/\">response to the Greenpeace report</a>, which says much the same thing.)</p>\n<p id=\"n5NAU2\">“Another acceptable path forward would be to show us how Microsoft’s machine learning technology is actually scaling up renewables or scaling down fossil fuel production,” says Jardim. “Right now their contracts are not doing that.” Improving fossil fuel extraction projects doesn’t do much to help fossil fuel companies transition away from fossil fuel extraction. </p>\n<p id=\"v0DeUq\">The oil company contracts are “a revolving debate within the company right now,” Henretig says. “It’s one of the areas a lot of employees are feeling conflicted about.”</p>\n<p id=\"4Kye3S\">If they want to stay ahead of the pack, Microsoft and Amazon should listen to their employees and follow Google’s lead. </p>\n<h3 id=\"XNNJYj\">It could throw some elbows on public policy</h3>\n<p id=\"pSemBB\">Microsoft says it will use its voice to advocate for public policy in four areas: more public research, “the removal of regulatory barriers” to clean energy, market-based mechanisms, and universal standards for measuring the carbon content of consumer goods. </p>\n<p id=\"amrXLl\">That is, relative to the breadth and specificity of its other commitments, fairly weak tea. It sounds like a devotion to incremental, bipartisan policy, which is not only inadequate but has proven nearly impossible to achieve in practice. </p>\n<p id=\"UBJ32Y\">In its defense, the company has spoken up on some important issues. It pushed for <a href=\"https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy/largest-data-center-operators-pressure-virginia-utility-renewables\">more renewables in Virginia</a>, supported the <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/10/16/microsoft-supports-i-1631/\">carbon-tax initiative in Washington</a>, and opposed <a href=\"https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/why-business-supported-the-clean-power-plan\">the rollback of Obama’s Clean Power Plan</a>.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A photo of an underwater diver holding a sign supporting a carbon-pricing initiative.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7h7zMpeg7CZo-qvUdUNVgu0mFYY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13402033/Aquarium_HannahLetinich.jpeg\">\n      <cite><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"http://yeson1631.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hannah Letinich, Yes On 1631</a></cite>\n      <figcaption>Support for Washington’s carbon-pricing initiative, 1631, was deep.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"XrS0De\">“It’s great to see Microsoft and others stepping up in ways that clearly acknowledge the urgency of the climate crisis,” says Bill Wiehl, founder of ClimateVoice, a nonprofit working to organize tech workers behind climate ambition. “Now we need them to step up their lobbying for a broad range of public policies to address climate change, everywhere they operate.”  </p>\n<p id=\"OJrNTH\">Microsoft could speak up for clean energy money in the next stimulus bill, call out denialist politicians, push back on state-level conservative efforts to block electric vehicles or prop up coal plants, or help push a national clean electricity standard or tightened fuel economy standards. There’s a whole lot of policy needed to get where Microsoft says the world needs to go.</p>\n<p id=\"4lBTnq\">Perhaps most importantly, Microsoft is still a part of the US Chamber of Commerce, a conservative trade group that relentlessly lobbies against clean energy. Will Microsoft leave the chamber (as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/10/apple-leaves-chamber-hot-over-climate/27854/\">Apple did in 2009</a>) or at least step off its boards and lobby within it for a new direction (as <a href=\"https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/nike-resigns-from-chamber-board/\">Nike did in 2009</a>)? Microsoft said it <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/pete-altman/microsoft-chamber-doesnt-speak-us-climate\">won’t participate in Chamber climate initiatives</a>, but that’s it so far. (Read my story on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/7/18654957/climate-change-lobbying-chamber-of-commerce\">a trio of senators going after the chamber on climate</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"NnpQNS\">Microsoft isn’t fully throwing around its weight. “We do have a PAC, the PAC does make investments,” says Crider, “but not at a level that sways an election in one direction or the other.”</p>\n<p id=\"jmRabX\">A more vigorous form of power politics is called for in an age of climate crisis. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mAG45w\">It could clearly pledge to eliminate its own emissions</h3>\n<p id=\"iGXtGF\">Microsoft aims to reduce its full emissions by 55 percent by 2030, with negative emissions technology soaking up the rest. While it has said it will draw down enough carbon to account for all its historic emissions, it has not said how fast, or even whether, its own emissions will reach zero after 2030.</p>\n<p id=\"NRSXLf\">While carbon negative is an admirable and standard-setting target, it is, in the end, a way of buying time. Every sector and business that possibly can hit true zero — run on 100 percent carbon-free energy — must ultimately do so. Pushing for negative emissions is not a license to ease up on the broader goal.</p>\n<p id=\"gO9clG\">Microsoft should make clear that true zero emissions, as fast as possible, is still its long-term target. “Its voice saying that we need to get to zero is really powerful,” Bartlett says. “Ultimately, you need a business model that will flourish in a zero world, right?”</p>\n<p id=\"rTSJzY\">True zero emissions is a bit of a moonshot for Microsoft, but if Apple can do it, Microsoft can too. And there are reasons to think it will try.</p>\n<p id=\"oN26PE\">“Obviously, the first thing we want to do is reduce emissions,” says Janous. “The goal is, get our scope 3 emissions down to as close as possible to zero. The commitment we made, 55 percent reduction — I think we’re going to do better than that.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A visitor playing video games at a booth.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n16Nh2fYSWFl5ut5XyRaoJx-kVA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20790486/1256533228.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Zhou You/VCG via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Can this be done sustainably? (Above, a Microsoft Xbox exhibit at a July event in Shanghai, China.)</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"REs9ry\">Microsoft is doing what it can within the bounds of capitalism</h3>\n<p id=\"uxfUts\">Most of Microsoft’s emissions are from energy and will ultimately be eliminated by a cleaner, more robust electricity grid. Janous says the company is experimenting with using its data centers to provide backup and other ancillary services to grids, in pursuit of a “holistic solution” to grid issues, but to get there, “markets need to evolve to create more opportunities for flexibility.”</p>\n<p id=\"wdrJTc\">While Microsoft is working on a better energy grid, its peers will be approaching the problem from other angles. “It’s not like we’re all going to solve electricity, right?” says Janous. “Amazon’s going to work on transportation; Apple is going to work on materials and inputs. I’m excited about the breadth of impact we’re going to have as an industry, because we are all going to attack this thing a little bit differently.”</p>\n<p id=\"E6Jycn\">It is difficult to predict anything in today’s world, but there’s every reason to expect that large, well-established companies like Microsoft, Dow, Apple, Unilever, and Amazon committing to net zero will reverberate. </p>\n<p id=\"2fII8Q\">It’s not just that the target could become the expected norm in the business world (though that appears to be happening faster than anyone expected). It’s that all the people working in those companies, and all the people who interact with those companies, will see that reducing emissions produces a torrent of innovation. They will see that the process draws top talent to these companies and gives their young, diverse workforces focus and motivation. </p>\n<p id=\"XkJms1\">They will see that common purpose brings out the best in people and that decarbonization is not a hair shirt or a sacrifice, but a chance to design and build a better world. They will take what they’ve seen to the voting booth.</p>\n<p id=\"HPjgnv\">It is the nature of climate change that virtually nothing that is possible today amounts to enough, and that’s true of Microsoft’s climate efforts. Within the conventional boundaries of US consumer capitalism, the company is unquestionably a leader, but if climate is a crisis, it may call for pushing at those boundaries: throwing some political elbows, cutting off some clients, perhaps even questioning the imperative for continuous growth. </p>\n<p id=\"ykiG1o\">Microsoft has shown what can happen when engineers get ahold of the carbon problem. Now its leaders should trust its engineers and move farther, faster.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"DdEUmD\">\n<p id=\"vMP4lY\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

He had a rare combination of raw literary talent and intellectual honesty that made him uniquely equipped to communicate an alien reality to someone like me, a white kid growing up in the South.</p>\n<p id=\"MuaNZz\">As it happens, Baldwin, who would have turned 96 this Sunday, has been in the news these past few years. The writer <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/james-baldwin-tanehisi-coates/399413/\">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a> has invoked him as a model; he was the subject of a widely praised <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/26/18097639/15-best-documentaries-to-stream-right-now-i-am-not-your-negro-james-baldwin\">2017 documentary</a>; and his novel <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> was adapted into a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/18/17853434/if-beale-street-could-talk-review-barry-jenkins-james-baldwin\">feature film</a> in 2018. </p>\n<p id=\"c7sR7q\">Obviously, no one is raising Baldwin from the dead, but we now have maybe the next best thing: a book about Baldwin from Princeton African American studies professor Eddie Glaude Jr. It’s called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Begin-Again-Baldwins-America-Lessons/dp/0525575324\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Being Again: James Baldwin’s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em>the book is part memoir, part biography, and part political essay. It’s Glaude’s attempt to process what’s happening right now through Baldwin’s eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"dh1PJd\">I reached out to Glaude to talk about Baldwin’s conception of America and how it can speak to this moment. This is a long and honest discussion about the contradictions of the American project and why racial progress is both real and illusory at the same time. It is also, I hope, a clarifying exchange on the moral dilemmas at the heart of this challenge. There are no easy answers in any of this, but, in a strange way, the unanswerability of the questions is a reminder that we’re all figuring out how to navigate this moment together.</p>\n<p id=\"CmSAw8\">A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1ntfDt\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"Xvu9Yz\">What was Baldwin’s greatest insight into this country? What did he see more clearly than anyone else?</p>\n<h4 id=\"wbBNUx\">Eddie Glaude Jr. </h4>\n<p id=\"0V6GRm\">I’ve never been asked that question before. The easy answer is that he saw that America was constantly telling itself lies. It refused to look itself squarely in the face. In some ways, America had refused to face its fears, refused to look at its own self-conception. </p>\n<p id=\"oIoyaQ\">Baldwin said that Black people are the rejected sons and daughters of America. He put it this way once, and I’m paraphrasing here: There’s a level of barbarity and psychological fracture when you’re selling your own child. You know that’s your child on the auction block. For Baldwin, that takes us to a deep level of neurosis, of psychosis at the heart of the country that requires exploring. So I think his insight was in recognizing this psychological wound that’s at the heart of the American project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"IBcAc8\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"3gH63X\">What were the lies he thought America kept telling itself?</p>\n<h4 id=\"mI8Gsz\">Eddie Glaude Jr. </h4>\n<p id=\"nCBnPi\">In 1964, Baldwin wrote an essay entitled “The White Problem.” He has this formulation that says, “The people who settled the country had a fatal flaw. They could recognize a man when they saw one. They knew he wasn’t anything else but a man, but since they were Christian and since they had already decided that they came here to establish a free country, the only way to justify the role this chattel was playing in one’s life was to say that he was not a man. But if he wasn’t, then no crime had been committed. That lie is the basis of our present trouble.”</p>\n<p id=\"YbnVNb\">So this idea of dehumanization is at the heart of this capitalist enterprise called slavery. Then built around it is this elaborate discourse that accounts for my intelligence, my passions, and my capabilities. And then we tell stories about what we have done not only to these people but to other people around the world that protect our innocence. Then we distort anything that threatens to reveal the lie of our innocence. </p>\n<p id=\"jIWAq5\">So this is at the heart of this self-conception of the United States as the redeeming nation.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"ATRWcg\"><q>“People are complaining about taking down monuments, but our entire built environment is a monument to a deeper racial ideology”</q></aside></div>\n<h4 id=\"7Yh5E4\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"UyupKG\">There’s so much going on there and we’ll get to it, but I want to weave in what you think as we work through what Baldwin thought. So let me ask you this: When you look at this moment we’re in, and I mean the whole damn thing — the pandemic, the racial reckoning, the economic crisis — what stands out to you the most? What’s the unifying thread tying all of this unrest together?</p>\n<h4 id=\"2lK1hm\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"y7C8iq\">The country is broken. It’s built on a bankrupt ideology. There’s a reason why we’re not responding to the pandemic in a certain sort of way, because we’ve lived for over 40 to 50 years with an ideology that has said that big government is bad, that any sane intervention in the economy is an intrusion on our liberty. So that’s the first thing. </p>\n<p id=\"pvvYSi\">Ever since 9/11, there’s only been a certain portion of the country bearing the sacrifice for what we’ve experienced, for the forever wars. All of us aren’t asked to sacrifice. Even when it comes to wearing a mask, we’re too selfish. We invoke liberty as a defense instead of acting responsibly on behalf of one’s fellows. It’s a broken culture and a broken ideology.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lj7pEc\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"FaPMim\">When Trump started campaigning in 2015, my biggest worry is that he would uncork resentments that had been festering beneath the surface for decades. On the one hand, maybe it’s necessary to bring these deep problems into the light in order to deal with them; on the other hand, it feels like the norms and constraints holding this experiment together have cracked apart. </p>\n<p id=\"VgNatI\">I’m curious how you think about this paradox.</p>\n<h4 id=\"LqX1Ov\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"HovSx8\">First off, I think that’s absolutely right. The post-civil rights consensus has been broken, just like the post-World War II consensus about global governance has been broken. Part of what the post-civil rights consensus entailed was that you could racially dog-whistle. You could mobilize racial resentments for political ends, but you couldn’t do it in such a way that would spark full-blown racial wars. The cultural wars involved, in part, appealing to these resentments.</p>\n<p id=\"IeV6bv\">[This has been] the undertow of American politics, from Reagan’s run in ’80 to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/this-1988-ad-inspired-the-gops-latest-attack-on-tim-kaine/2016/10/03/c74931f8-8980-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506_video.html\">George H.W. Bush’s Willie Horton ads</a> and right on down the line. Race has been mobilizing white resentments for a long while. Trump has put aside the dog whistle and grabbed a foghorn. So he appeals to them explicitly, and he’s brought those people who were initially banished to the margins of our body politic into the center of politics. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TRrNd20mMBciUVmAgCw49nIe2MQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20077108/GLAUDE_Begin_Again_book_cover.jpg\">\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h6ESsD\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"VxNzKa\">Baldwin fell into despair, especially after MLK’s assassination, but he never completely lost faith in his home country, right? He still believed a moment of true freedom was possible, what he called the New Jerusalem.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ZqIaT8\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"PRqpWq\">Yeah, but I don’t think he was ever optimistic. He might’ve been hopeful, but not optimistic. But even that hope was blue-soaked. He was never naive about the capacities of white folk in this country. Jimmy makes a crucial distinction between white people and people who happen to be white.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4boma7\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"8oOegA\">What’s the difference?</p>\n<h4 id=\"GR9x7R\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"4cVyCp\">A white person is someone who’s invested in the value gap and is fine with how advantage and disadvantage is distributed along those lines. So a world that values white people more than others is a world that invests in that particular identity and the way in which the world is organized and arranged. </p>\n<p id=\"9iKZDP\">Someone who happens to be white is someone who is not invested in that, but understands how the language of whiteness comes to them as natural as the love of their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"O71xqN\">This is what the writer <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/2/20862854/wendell-berry-climate-change-port-royal-michael-pollan\">Wendell Berry</a> talks about in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Wound-Wendell-Berry/dp/1582434867\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Hidden Wound</em></a>. He’s Kentucky-born. He knows that racism comes to him like language. But just the fact that he knows it and that he’s engaged in the ongoing work of trying to deconstruct it and deconstruct the world that has been organized in light of it says that he’s that dude. So the difference is whether you’re someone who’s invested in an identity of whiteness or someone who understands the dynamics of that identity and is trying to build a more just world in spite of it. </p>\n<h4 id=\"zhQ5Jy\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"jIm5w9\">Baldwin eventually concluded, for reasons you just hinted at, that “white Americans had to save themselves.” What did he mean by that?</p>\n<h4 id=\"nNLOsq\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"DrZhtX\">Baldwin’s revolutionary inversion is to flip the white man’s burden. The white man’s burden becomes the Black man’s burden. That’s when he says, “I’m not the N-word. Never have been.” The question is, why did you need to invent the N-word? Once you understand why, then maybe we can get off this damn hamster wheel. He didn’t say it that way, but you get what I mean. The point is that, “I’m not the N-word. You invented the N-word. We need to figure out why you invented the N-word. Until we do that, I’m going to give that N-word back to you. You must be the N-word.” That’s the revolutionary move.</p>\n<p id=\"V9Jbpo\">In the early stages, the second move was to say, “Well, since that’s the case, we got to help them understand themselves differently. We have to love them into viewing themselves otherwise,” because otherwise we bear the brunt of this way of understanding themselves. But by the time MLK is assassinated, that feeling is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"IfVBvp\">Then the question is, we only have a finite amount of civic energy, so do we use that energy trying to convince people who hold noxious views about race not to hold them? Or do we spend our energy trying to build a world where those views have no quarter to breathe? It’s the latter that I think he’s invested in. We can still build a New Jerusalem. We can still do the work of trying to build a more just world. But that’s not going to involve me having to compromise with these folk, and I don’t want to do that anymore. Because every time we compromise, somebody, namely us, we have to bear the brunt of the compromise. </p>\n<h4 id=\"WvcYk8\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"gEBsD3\">The move you make in the book, and the move Baldwin eventually makes, is that there’s an idea of America defined by whiteness that simply isn’t salvageable and we’ve got to get clear about that before we can do anything else.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i5sDaS\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"6MEXn8\">Yes! I say that the idea of white America is irredeemable, but that doesn’t mean that we are. There’s nothing about the idea of an America that is defined by whiteness that we can salvage.</p>\n<p id=\"RHJz8F\">In the book, I’m trying to sever this idea of American identity from this idea of whiteness. Because they’re so intrinsically linked, when we tell the truth about the country, people think everything is going to collapse — that we’re no longer distinctive in some sort of way if we don’t tell the story in the way in which we’ve told it. I think Jimmy is trying to insist that by confronting our ghastly failures, we can be otherwise. There’s this wonderful line he said in 1962: “We are in deeper trouble than we think: The trouble is in us.” </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"James Baldwin Speaks In Montgomery March\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9HIbZuNb-FGmDpBgC-XKBhDzgc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20085176/93525454.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Robert Abbott Sengstacke/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The author James Baldwin smiles while addressing the crowd from the speaker’s platform, after participating in the march from Selma to Montgomery in support of voting rights, Alabama, March 1965.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h4 id=\"1L6T9E\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"kvYSBQ\">There’s a tension I struggle with and I want to be honest about it here. I’ll do it by reading something you wrote in the book: “I hoped one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change — that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?” </p>\n<p id=\"VtF9iN\">Do you really think the country has remained the same?</p>\n<h4 id=\"DCFq7g\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"l8ADV0\">It all depends on what we mean by that. The throughline of American history is the value gap. So what does it mean to believe that white people matter more than others in the context of slavery? It’s very different than what it would mean in the context of Jim Crow, which is very different from what it would mean in the context of the industrialized cities, or in context of the first Black president. In each instance, there’s going to be an element of progress, but if that valuation evidences itself in dispositions and practices, then it’s still a throughline. Until we uproot it and the habits it produces, we’re basically the same.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sLEUtz\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"NxYGoU\">That helps clarify my own thinking on this. The simple way to talk about this is to say that the arc of this country is clearly moving, however unevenly and awkwardly, in the direction of progress. But the deeper question you’re posing is, are our underlying values changing in any fundamental way, or are the manifestations of those values just taking on new — and undoubtedly better — forms? And if we don’t uproot the value structure, the thing that brings this ugliness into being remains untouched.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MPMyc8\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"q0n6gY\">That’s exactly right. This is what I mean when I say our progress is still laced with lies. Because we’re not getting to the core. We’re not getting to the heart of the problem. So in these moments, like we’re in now, they want us to tinker around the edges and not get to the heart of the problem. I keep saying over and over again we have to figure out how to be together differently. We can’t be mysteries anymore to each other. We can’t live like this.</p>\n<p id=\"Rf3ecw\">People are complaining about taking down monuments, but our entire built environment is a monument to a deeper racial ideology. The highway systems in Chicago and New York are monuments to a particular racial ideology. So I think you’re absolutely right. This is why Jimmy always understood the problem to be a moral one. This is why he understood the justification for Black power. He fully understood that the problem at the heart of all of this is rooted in valuation and the dispositions that follow from them. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"ZguqQJ\"><q>“I say that the idea of white America is irredeemable, but that doesn’t mean that we are”</q></aside></div>\n<h4 id=\"wcWvbi\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"TEgKs5\">Part of the frustration with these conversations, not ours but these conversations more generally, is that they often get bogged down in this false choice between acknowledging the obvious progress and considering the problem solved or recognizing those victories without turning away from the root of the problem.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FsZMzA\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"jmQtfO\">A lot of folks view racial justice and racial equality as a philanthropic enterprise. It’s something that they can give to us. It almost reveals that at the heart of their conception of racial justice is charity, as opposed to justice. So part of what we have to do is to understand that frame as part of the problem. Racial justice is not something that you give to other people. It’s instantiated in the social arrangements, the way in which we imagine standing in right relation with one another. It’s a world defined by non-domination. </p>\n<p id=\"npIj6K\">So people often ask me, “What else can I do? How can I help?” Commit yourself to building a more just world. Let’s do that. Once we get past the philanthropic model, we need to start getting at the heart of the matter. I had to watch my son deal with this. My dad had to watch me deal with this. His dad had to watch him deal with this. His dad had to teach him how to deal with this. People are saying it’s all better, but I can go back generations and see Black people witnessing this public ritual of Black grief and suffering. Somebody had to bury their child because of what? “Oh, look how far we’ve come!”</p>\n<p id=\"Jorgv0\">So part of our challenge is not to fall into the trap of this American insistence on gratitude and congratulations. </p>\n<h4 id=\"0JIang\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"cTS4dZ\">Baldwin believed that telling the truth about ourselves — really telling the truth — could release us from our past and make space for a new story about who and what we are as a country. What did he think that story would look like? Did he even get that far? Did you get that far?</p>\n<h4 id=\"fT24BK\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"wuf42O\">There’s a line that he wrote when he resigned from the editorial board of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Liberator-Vol-No-July-1964/dp/B00124CQGO\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liberator</a>. [Liberator was an American socialist magazine that ran from 1918 to 1924.] It’s a line that almost moves me to tears every time I say it. He wrote, “I want us to do something unprecedented, and that is to be able to create a self without the need for enemies.” Right? “To create a self without the need for enemies.” What would a world look like with that as its cornerstone? </p>\n<h4 id=\"iQ8guj\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"B5Eum3\">I’ve never seen it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UpiVqr\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"mqmgml\">Exactly. But that’s Baldwin’s idea of a New Jerusalem. Where we try to stand in right relation with one another, where we can see each other. Not in the name of some sentimental humanism that says we’re all the same. No, that’s not what he’s saying. Because we all got this funkiness in us. It’s the dark cellar of who we are. But that’s actually the bridge. Our suffering is the bridge. But how do we see each other so that we can be together for real? That to me is the ground for the world that I would love to inhabit. What it would look like in its details? I’m not sure. We would have to build it first.</p>\n<h4 id=\"U88SEv\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"mT9dDh\">You say that we’ll have to decide, once and for all, whether we will truly be a multiracial democracy. Do you believe, in your heart of hearts, that we will answer in the affirmative?</p>\n<h4 id=\"XNhuyD\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"BVKmoZ\">Not really, to be honest. Our history tells me that we won’t do very well. In the moments that we’ve had something of this magnitude in front of us, we’ve taken steps forward while still doubling down on the value gap. The cornerstone of America’s carceral state is the same old value gap, and it’s just hard to imagine a true public infrastructure of care in this country. After all, we just <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/donald-trump\">doubled down on ugliness</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"6mRySZ\">So our past doesn’t fill me with optimism, and it didn’t fill Baldwin with optimism either. But I also believe this: Wherever human beings are, we have a chance. Because we’re not just simply disasters — we’re also miracles. </p>\n<h4 id=\"XjuUY3\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"Sl9K2P\">But if this project we’re all involved in is truly Sisyphean, if we’re just going to keep rolling the boulder of equality up the hill only to watch it tumble back down to the ground, what’s the point?</p>\n<h4 id=\"egmLKV\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"mXz4bT\">We have to conclude that the end is not the issue. What’s at the heart of this is not the end but the process. The struggle itself becomes the source of meaning.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i9712p\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"o1iCeQ\">That’s very existentialist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"uDRMDK\">Eddie Glaude Jr.</h4>\n<p id=\"RRLuuU\">Exactly, but it’s true. It’s the beautiful struggle, right? When there’s no guarantee of the outcome, the fight itself becomes the motivation. But wherever human beings are, we have a chance. Things are fucked up, we all know it, but as Samuel Beckett said, “Fail, fail again, fail better.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Then Trump got in the way.</p> <p id=\"dWkVSZ\">On June 25, San Francisco Mayor London Breed was excited the city’s zoo would finally reopen after closing down for months in response to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">Covid-19</a>. She visited the facilities, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1276265717134848001\">posting photos on social media</a> with a mask on and giraffes in the background. </p>\n<p id=\"d4N96s\">“I know people are eager to get back to some sense of normalcy, especially families and children,” she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1276265716002373632\">tweeted</a>. And it looked like her city was taking a step toward it.</p>\n<p id=\"0meDNH\">The day after the visit, Breed had to announce the sad news: San Francisco’s reopening plan — for the zoo and various other facilities, including hair salons and indoor museums — <a href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/06/26/reopening-setback-sf-june-29-openings-delayed-hair-salons-barbers-zoos-museums/\">would have to be put on hold</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"SbC25o\">“COVID-19 cases are rising throughout CA. We’re now seeing a rise in cases in SF too. Our numbers are still low but rising rapidly,” she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1276596917770715136\">tweeted</a>. “As a result, we’re temporarily delaying the re-openings that were scheduled for Monday.”</p>\n<p id=\"NLwndH\">While state and local leaders nationwide were pushing ahead with reopening, Breed pulled back. “I listened to our public health experts,” she told me. “It’s hard. The last thing I want to do is go out there and say one thing and then have to say something else. But I think it’s important that people understand things can change. This is a fluid situation.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/strusThq-Pr-DEYKOzk3Wnw5MA8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789144/GettyImages_1255978426.jpg\">\n      <cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Visitors look at the giraffe exhibit at the San Francisco Zoo on July 13.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"XojCim\">The decision — taken weeks before  California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1282752861835649024\">move to shut down</a> risky indoor venues statewide in July — was emblematic of San Francisco’s cautious approach throughout the coronavirus crisis. The city joined a regional stay-at-home order in March, before the rest of the state and New York, which became a Covid-19 epicenter, imposed their own orders. It was also slower to reopen: When California started to close down indoor venues again, the order largely didn’t affect San Francisco — because the city never reopened bars and indoor dining, among other high-risk venues, in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"83QR1W\">By and large, the approach — aided by regional cooperation, with leadership from <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/06/20/santa-clara-countys-health-officer-sara-cody-from-public-hero-to-public-enemy-no-1/\">Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody</a>, and widespread social distancing and mask-wearing by the public — has kept cases of Covid-19 manageable. In the spring, California and the Bay Area saw some of the first coronavirus cases, but quick action since then has let San Francisco and the surrounding region avoid turning into a major hot spot.</p>\n<p id=\"DfUng7\">The increase in cases this summer has exceeded the April peak and fallen particularly hard on marginalized groups, especially Latin communities. But that, too, seems to be turning around: New cases <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/dak2-gvuj\">started to fall by July 20</a> — almost a week before the state as a whole <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html\">began to plateau</a>. San Francisco has maintained less than 60 percent the Covid-19 cases per capita as California, and less than 30 percent the deaths per capita. Its caseload and death toll are lower than other large cities, including Washington, DC, and Columbus, Ohio, and far lower than current hot spots like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311347/arizona-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\">Arizona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/17/21324398/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-outbreak\">Florida</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"ERbpFo\">“It’s doing as well as it can, given what’s going on around it,” Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California San Francisco, told me.</p>\n<p id=\"vQsBkI\">Experts and local officials say the summer increase in cases doesn’t take away from what San Francisco has done. What it shows, instead, is the limits of what a local government can do — and the risk of relying on a county-by-county, state-by-state federalist approach to a truly national crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"BJshmn\">“We have to accept that we are all interrelated in a pandemic,” Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at UCSF, told me. “We have to help each other out.”</p>\n<p id=\"girhHj\">The city’s leaders agree, pointing to some of the problems that have addled their response to the pandemic as the federal government did little — from a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21194402/coronavirus-masks-n95-respirators-personal-protective-equipment-ppe\">lack of personal protective equipment for health care workers</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/10/21317860/coronavirus-testing-problems-delays-shortages-covid\">continued shortfalls in tests for Covid-19</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"fBeM3k\">“We are not isolated; we are interconnected,” Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, told me. “The virus exploits that very interconnectedness of our society. Without a consistent, robust, and sustained federal response that is driven by science … eventually things cannot be sustained.”</p>\n<p id=\"d3qRJn\">This is why, experts argue, federal leadership is so key: The federal government is the one entity that could address these problems on a large scale. But President Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html\">ceded</a> his role to the states and private actors — what his administration called the “state authority handoff” and the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html\">described</a> as “perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.”</p>\n<p id=\"lfJV8B\">That’s left cities and states to fend for themselves. San Francisco has made the best of it, with the kind of model that experts argued could have prevented the current coronavirus resurgence if it had been followed nationally.</p>\n<p id=\"lKa2eB\">“There’s a value to being cautious,” Bibbins-Domingo said. “Any type of reopening is going to come with some increase in cases. That’s what we are learning in the pandemic. That’s what the infectious disease experts told us was going to happen. Places that thought they could just reopen without caution have really paid the price for it.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"MwDzqh\">San Francisco’s leaders were ahead on Covid-19</h3>\n<p id=\"Sbr9ap\">Breed started to really worry about the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">coronavirus</a> in February, when she saw a glimpse of the future.</p>\n<p id=\"1zG592\">Stories of overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan, China, showed that Covid-19 could cripple health care systems. But Breed believed, she said, that San Francisco’s larger, more advanced health care system could handle the blow. Then her advisers and experts told her differently — that a situation like Wuhan’s really could happen in San Francisco if she didn’t act.</p>\n<p id=\"CE3b5l\">“The shock I got,” Breed said. “We have all these hospitals, all these places where we have some of the most incredible doctors and research institutions. So in my mind, I’ve always thought this is where you want to be if something happens. To be told that here’s what our capacity is, here’s what happens if we do nothing, and what we need to prepare for, it really did blow my mind.”</p>\n<p id=\"CM4eNr\">At that point, she concluded, “We need to shut the city down to make sure this doesn’t happen.”</p>\n<p id=\"gALbXf\">The virus has been the biggest challenge yet for Breed, who first became mayor in 2017, when her predecessor died, before she was elected to the role in 2018, having previously served on the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"H04YsI\">But Breed, with the guidance of the Bay Area’s public health officials, has consistently kept the city ahead on Covid-19. The day before Trump <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-statements-about-the-coronavirus/\">claimed</a>, falsely, that coronavirus cases would go from 15 to nearly zero in the US, Breed on February 25 <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-mayor-London-Breed-declares-state-of-emergency-15083811.php\">declared</a> a local state of emergency over the virus. Three days before California <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/19/governor-gavin-newsom-issues-stay-at-home-order/\">issued</a> a stay-at-home order and nearly a week before New York state <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-yorks-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order-here-are-the-guidelines\">did</a>, San Francisco County, with Breed’s full backing, on March 16 <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-bay-area-counties-shelter-in-place/\">joined</a> the five other Bay Area counties in issuing the country’s first regional stay-at-home order.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1HQ6oH35n5KoYqnKHHFwOckaEE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789263/GettyImages_1212812698.jpg\">\n      <cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Mayor London Breed issues stay-at-home orders during a press conference in San Francisco’s City Hall on March 16.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"TQa2RV\">Breed was ahead of not just much of the nation, but her progressive peers as well. On March 2, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1234602545231753216\">warned on Twitter</a> that the public should “prepare for possible disruption from an outbreak,” advising people to stock up on essential medications, make a child care plan in case a caregiver gets sick, and plan for school closures. The same day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/1234648718714036229\">tweeted</a> that he was “encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus.”</p>\n<p id=\"QWGwxl\">New York City would go on to suffer one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world, with its total death rate standing, as of July 29, at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html\">272 per 100,000 people</a> — more than 45 times as high as San Francisco’s rate of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html\">6 per 100,000</a>. (De Blasio’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p id=\"5A6g7M\">San Francisco’s death toll is also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html\">fairly low</a> compared to that of some other areas in California — a fraction of Los Angeles County’s 45 per 100,000 and Imperial County’s 103. San Mateo County, a Bay Area county that reopened more aggressively, has more than double the death rate, at 15 per 100,000. San Francisco looks even better compared to cities and counties beyond California — with less than a tenth the deaths per capita as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\">Washington, DC</a>, and about a sixth as many as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/ohio-coronavirus-cases.html\">Franklin County, Ohio</a>, where Columbus is, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/georgia-coronavirus-cases.html\">Fulton County, Georgia</a>, where most of Atlanta is.</p>\n<p id=\"d6kI5i\">At the time of the initial stay-at-home order, Chin-Hong said, people wondered if Breed was overreacting. “Of course, in hindsight, she was very prescient. She knew what was coming.”</p>\n<p id=\"V5qL89\">There’s good reason to believe that San Francisco’s early action, particularly its lockdown, helped. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/18/21262528/coronavirus-us-state-lockdown-stay-at-home-orders-study\">research</a> indicates that stay-at-home orders and similar measures worked, with one preliminary <em>Health Affairs</em> <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00608\">study</a> concluding: </p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"FwJGt7\">Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 percentage points after 1–5 days, 6.8 after 6–10 days, 8.2 after 11–15 days, and 9.1 after 16–20 days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply 10 times greater spread by April 27 without SIPOs (10 million cases) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the four measures (35 million).</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"VjkPZb\">That’s not to say San Francisco performed flawlessly. </p>\n<p id=\"6z5RbZ\">Even the experts who praised Breed simultaneously raised alarms about how the virus had disproportionately affected minority populations — with <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/w6za-6st8\">about half of confirmed Covid-19 cases</a> affecting Latin people, even though they comprise <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocitycalifornia,US/PST045219\">about 15 percent of the local population</a>. The city’s large homeless population <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2020/04/covid-atlantic-london-breed/\">is also a major point of concern</a>, with a <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-homeless-san-francisco-shelter-outbreak-covid-19-cases/6093091/\">big outbreak</a> at the largest local homeless shelter. These are the kinds of blind spots with Covid-19 that have shown up across the country — as minority groups, in particular, are more likely to work in the kind of job deemed “essential” — and San Francisco isn’t immune to them.</p>\n<p id=\"9GY28j\">“Myself, just taking care of patients, I know that some of those patients are going back to work sick if they don’t have to be hospitalized,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford, told me. “They can’t afford not to work.”</p>\n<p id=\"Tcwn3D\">Local officials point out they have taken aggressive action to shield marginalized populations — <a href=\"https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-expands-outreach-and-support-latino-community-heavily-impacted-covid-19\">creating support programs for them</a>, fielding contact tracing calls in Spanish, and setting up more than 2,500 hotel rooms for the vulnerable, including homeless people. And the disproportionate case count for Latin people is from a baseline of cases that’s lower than other parts of the state and country with similar disparities. Out of <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/w6za-6st8\">57 Covid-19 deaths in the city</a>, only one was a homeless person.</p>\n<p id=\"DM755K\">Breed acknowledged the challenge, describing the city’s response to Covid-19 as a work in progress as she and other officials struggle with the uncertainty that surrounds a virus that’s still relatively new to humans.</p>\n<p id=\"0AWmow\">“That’s hard,” Breed said. “We have to make the hard decisions. What we hope people will understand is why. We keep trying to call attention to what’s happening or could happen to any of us. It’s a constant struggle.”</p>\n<p id=\"MZ9VYy\">That’s especially compounded by the massive sacrifices that people have to make as they’re forced to stay at home, potentially giving up income, child care, and social connections.</p>\n<p id=\"1XA6tc\">Breed is aware this is no easy task. On a personal level, she said, “I’m tired of being in the house. I’ll tell you that much.” She acknowledged that the shutdown has left many people struggling, “because their livelihoods are at stake, their ability to take care of themselves is at stake.”</p>\n<aside id=\"gzmTYD\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The odd, growing list of Covid-19 symptoms, explained \",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21327317/symptoms-of-covid-19-coronavirus-fever-cough-toes-rash-loss-of-taste-smell\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Q1y5jQ\">But the alternative, she suggested, is much worse. It’s not just more Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths — but harm to the economy if a major outbreak forces cities and states to shut down all over again. As a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3561560\">preliminary study</a> of the 1918 flu pandemic <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/31/21199874/coronavirus-spanish-flu-social-distancing\">found</a>, the cities that came out economically stronger back then took more aggressive action that hindered economies in the short term but better kept infections and deaths down overall.</p>\n<p id=\"kSegNa\">Experts echoed a similar sentiment. “Dead people don’t shop. They don’t spend money. They don’t invest in things,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease expert and doctor at the University of Chicago, told me. “When you fail to invest in the health of your population, then there are longitudinal downstream effects.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"MqQVCx\">Breed had a key ally in San Francisco: The public</h3>\n<p id=\"c103ib\">Chin-Hong, who lives and works in the Bay Area, recalled a recent experience he had at the grocery store. With the place at full capacity, people were waiting outside the store in a line. One person joined the line without a mask on. People began to eye him disapprovingly. He grew visibly nervous, at one point pulling his shirt over his mouth. After a while, a store staff member came out and gave him a mask, which he quickly put on.</p>\n<p id=\"Kbe9Aq\">The story is emblematic of one of Breed’s key advantages as she has pushed forward with aggressive actions against the coronavirus: San Francisco’s public is by and large on board, with a lot of solidarity built around social distancing and masking.</p>\n<p id=\"QeRbTX\">“The politician is only as good as her constituents,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s a key factor in all of this.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZTE7AD\">In some ways, the public was even ahead of Breed. In the weeks before Bay Area counties issued a stay-at-home order, major tech companies in the region, like Google and Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-has-prompted-these-tech-companies-to-ask-employees-to-work-from-home-2020-03-05\">told employees to work from home</a>. That partly reflects tech employees’ ability to work from home with fewer disruptions, but also a greater sense of vigilance for an industry with close ties to the countries in East Asia that saw Covid-19 cases earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"cmcZCx\">It wasn’t just the tech sector. <a href=\"https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry\">Restaurant data from OpenTable</a> shows San Francisco was starting to shirk dining out by the first week of March, while most other cities in the US saw at best small decreases, if any changes: On March 1, dining out via OpenTable was down 18 percent in San Francisco, compared to down 3 percent in Los Angeles, down 2 percent in New York City, up 2 percent in Houston, and up 21 percent in Philadelphia. From that point forward, San Francisco’s numbers steadily dropped, while much of the US fluctuated before the depth of the outbreak became clearer nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"ebkWky\">San Francisco has also been better than much of the country about mask-wearing. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html\">New York Times analysis</a> found there’s a roughly 60 to 90 percent chance, depending on the part of the city, that everyone is masked in five random encounters in San Francisco. In other parts of the US, including cities, the percent chance can drop to as low as 20, 10, or the single digits.</p>\n<p id=\"wThj69\">Even in California, it wasn’t guaranteed things would go like this. Orange County’s chief health officer <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-09/orange-county-public-health-officer-resigns-amid-controversy-over-face-coverings\">resigned</a> in June due to public resistance against a mask-wearing order. Sheriffs in Orange, Riverside, Fresno, and Sacramento counties <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-01/newsom-imposes-new-rollbacks-of-californias-coronavirus-reopening\">said</a> they wouldn’t enforce Gov. Newsom’s June order requiring masks in public and high-risk areas. With Trump and other Republicans suggesting that social distancing and masking requirements were part of a broader overreaction to the pandemic and an attempt at government overreach, and people genuinely suffering due to the economic downturn, San Francisco could have taken a very different direction.</p>\n<aside id=\"BeGt5o\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How California went from a coronavirus success story to a worrying new hot spot\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/6/21308351/california-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"4hiN5A\">We don’t know for certain why San Francisco’s public is more aggressive about precautions against Covid-19. One advantage San Franciscans have is many of them, particularly those in the tech sector and other office jobs, can work from home much more easily than, say, “essential” agricultural employees. The city also has close ties to East Asia, including China, potentially offering personal connections — and an early warning — to the first coronavirus outbreaks and the value of masking. San Francisco is also very progressive and Democratic, which helps as physical distancing, masking, and related measures <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/21/21331310/mask-masks-trump-covid19-rule-georgia-alabama\">have become politically polarized</a>. Perhaps Breed’s more aggressive communication paid off.</p>\n<p id=\"2iZjRF\">Whatever the cause, there’s good reason to believe the public embrace of precautions helped the city. A <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext\">review of the research</a> published in <em>The Lancet</em> found that “evidence shows that physical distancing of more than 1 m is highly effective and that face masks are associated with protection, even in non-health-care settings.”</p>\n<p id=\"84LrhX\">Again, it’s not perfect. Breed told me of a recent trip to a local store that was clearly far above the city’s reduced standards of capacity, with some of the staff and customers not wearing masks. “I was like, ‘What the heck is this? This is ridiculous,’” she said. “I called [the San Francisco Department of] Public Health, and they put a stop to it.”</p>\n<p id=\"ds9bgr\">More recently, Breed had to get tested for coronavirus after she went to an event attended by someone who reportedly knew they were positive. She used the moment to lightly admonish those who didn’t follow the recommended precautions: “I know people want to be out in public right now, but this disease is killing people. It’s simply reckless for those who have tested positive [to] go out and risk the lives of others,” she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/1281034093094813697\">tweeted</a>. “I cannot stress this enough: if you test positive, it’s on you to stay home and not expose others.” (Breed <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/london-breed-twitter-mayor-covid/6309443/\">tested negative</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"i0yGPA\">But San Francisco’s public is seemingly better than much of the country at following the recommended precautions. Beyond Breed’s actions, that’s a potent explanation for why San Francisco has done relatively well — and why other parts of the state and country haven’t.</p>\n<h3 id=\"siLzSq\">Local governments can only do so much about a pandemic</h3>\n<p id=\"haS0IO\">As successful as San Francisco has been relative to other parts of California and the US, it hasn’t escaped the recent rise in Covid-19 cases untouched. As of July 22 (the most recent reliable local data available), the city hit a seven-day average of <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/dak2-gvuj\">98 new cases a day</a> — down from a peak of 120 several days prior but up from the previous peak of 48 in mid-April. </p>\n<p id=\"tf3wh5\">More than reflecting San Francisco’s own failures, experts said the upward swing in cases reflects the limits of what a local government can do when a virus spreads nationally and globally. When a virus can cross borders, there’s only so much San Francisco can do if its residents can drive an hour or two to a county where bars and indoor dining are open for service, or to meet with family members in an area that’s hit much harder by Covid-19. </p>\n<p id=\"mVTZQY\">“When you have different rules for different counties, it’s very confusing,” Maldonado said. “People lose the message.”</p>\n<p id=\"JqcuqB\">There are similar limitations to what even California can do. It can impose its own lockdown, but it has less control over cases from Arizona, Nevada, Mexico, or other parts of the globe. While the state has taken steps to build up its testing capacity — surpassing the benchmark of 150 tests per 100,000, which is the equivalent of 500,000 tests nationwide — it can only go so far if there are constraints around the country for testing.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"ikWfEa\"><q>“We need a national plan. In terms of the structures to improve the supply chain or procure more stuff for the whole country, that’s a federal level of support. You need that to be in place.”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"9DAofq\">The testing problem is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21345590/covid-19-coronavirus-us-testing-contact-tracing-jobs\">especially acute now</a>: With new outbreaks across the US, demand for tests climbed as supply constraints reappeared. That’s led to waiting periods of up to weeks for getting results back — making tests practically useless for confirming, tracing, and containing infections before they have time to spread.</p>\n<p id=\"YlMeCb\">But there are limits to what San Francisco or California can do if the bottlenecks for testing are originating in other parts of the country or world — whether they’re due to epidemics in Arizona and Florida, or because factories in the Northeast and South can’t produce enough swabs to collect samples or reagents to run tests.</p>\n<p id=\"HI17n0\">“We need a national plan,” Cyrus Shahpar, a director at the global health advocacy group Resolve to Save Lives, told me. “In terms of the structures to improve the supply chain or procure more stuff for the whole country, that’s a federal level of support. You need that to be in place.”</p>\n<p id=\"SHo9XB\">The Trump administration, however, has explicitly left most of these issues for states to solve. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/28/21239729/coronavirus-testing-trump-plan-white-house\">White House’s testing plan</a> declared that the federal government is merely a “supplier of last resort,” leaving it to local and state governments and private actors to fix choke points along the testing supply chain. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html\">explained</a> this was part of a broader “state authority handoff” plan that would “shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the White House to the states.”</p>\n<p id=\"I4BZJV\">To the extent the federal government has provided support, Trump has actively undermined it. When the federal government released a phased plan for state reopenings, Trump called on states to reopen faster — to supposedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130?s=20\">“LIBERATE”</a> them from economic calamity. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people in public wear masks, Trump said it was a personal choice, refused to wear a mask in public for months, and even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21295826/coronavirus-us-update-trump-wsj-interview-masks-tests\">suggested</a> that people wear masks to spite him (although a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1285299379746811915\">recent tweet</a> seemed to support masking). (The White House didn’t return a request for comment.)</p>\n<p id=\"6zjYtP\">In my interviews, local officials, health care workers, and experts repeatedly complained about the problems caused by federal inaction. Breed lamented that San Francisco, and California, couldn’t rely on federal support to get <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21194402/coronavirus-masks-n95-respirators-personal-protective-equipment-ppe\">personal protective equipment for health care workers</a>, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic. A San Francisco Department of Public Health spokesperson told me that testing took time to scale up while the federal government did little to address supply constraints, commenting that the mixed messaging and inaction from the federal government “are hampering local efforts to be as effective as we would like to be.”</p>\n<p id=\"JtVqOK\">Over time, even the once-proactive California let its guard down. As Gov. Newsom faced pressure from local governments and businesses to reopen the state quickly, he allowed counties to reopen at a quicker pace if they met certain metrics. That led to new outbreaks, particularly in Central and Southern California — each of which presented a risk of bleeding over to the Bay Area. As Bibbins-Domingo said, county-by-county variations “have not been helpful” for suppressing the virus in San Francisco or statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"4dPWox\">California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly said that, like everyone else, the state was still learning how to properly combat the pandemic. But he argued it does make sense to tailor local responses to Covid-19 to what’s happening locally — and that’s what the state tried to do as it let some counties move quicker than others, while keeping some oversight by enforcing certain criteria before counties moved ahead.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkqEG51YLHrpPwVdzy39AZnECfM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20789146/GettyImages_1254149466.jpg\">\n      <cite>Liu Guanguan/China News Service via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Experts said the upward swing in cases reflects the limits of what a local government can do when a virus spreads nationally and globally.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"98GxbD\">The state is still “figuring out … the balance between hundreds of different things,” Ghaly told me. That includes, he added, “how you support counties making local decisions while maintaining some level of cohesiveness at a regional and statewide level so we don’t erode gains.”</p>\n<p id=\"LE5qaD\">Still, the fractured nature of federalism doesn’t help for fighting a virus that ignores local, state, and national borders.</p>\n<p id=\"BgwDbY\">A recent <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/16/science.abc5096\">study</a> in <em>Science</em> backed that up. Running simulations for Europe, researchers concluded that better-coordinated action within the European Union can help suppress Covid-19 better than different countries acting in different ways. Drawing on that finding, the authors concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"6WMcFP\">The implications of our study extend well beyond Europe and COVID-19, broadly demonstrating the importance of communities coordinating easing of various [non-pharmaceutical interventions] for any potential pandemic. In the United States, [non-pharmaceutical interventions] have been generally implemented at the state-level, and because states will be strongly interconnected, our results emphasize national coordination of pandemic preparedness efforts moving forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"4d0PDb\">That the US has by and large stuck to a state-by-state and county-by-county approach to public health — an approach that predates the coronavirus pandemic — can help explain, then, why the country has continued to fail to control Covid-19 in the same way countries with strong national plans and, in some cases, international cooperation haven’t. To this day, America <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/briefing/william-barr-mlb-john-lewis.html\">reports</a> among the highest rates of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"F2mMIv\">In that context, with outbreaks raging around San Francisco and California, there’s only so much any single local or state government could do. “When you look at success stories of countries on Covid, you had a strong central voice,” Chin-Hong said.</p>\n<p id=\"blJC3T\">So while San Francisco has done a lot right, it will take the rest of the country adopting a similar approach for the city, the broader Bay Area, or anywhere else in the US to really be safe from the coronavirus.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Its mission: collect samples to return to Earth.</p> <p id=\"RqgRYJ\">On Thursday, at 7:50 am Eastern, NASA launched its fifth rover to Mars. And with it, started a mission that may provide a conclusive answer to the question: Has there ever been life on the red planet?</p>\n<p id=\"RTabfA\">The rover is called Perseverance, and it’s modeled after the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a>, which landed on Mars in 2012. Like a new-model-year car, Perseverance comes with many upgrades: It can travel faster, farther, and around more obstacles on the Martian surface than Curiosity can. It has improved autonomous driving and more resilient wheels. It has a drone helicopter aboard (called <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/6-things-to-know-about-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter/\">Ingenuity</a>), which will become the first aircraft to fly on another planet. </p>\n<p id=\"rccHUg\">It even has an experiment designed to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/\">generate oxygen out of the Martian atmosphere</a>, as a proof of concept for future rocket fuel factories on the planet. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1-KnDAPXVxZxafG8VKLysIcdlA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20664543/spacecraft_rover_cameras.png\">\n      <cite>NASA/JPL-Caltech</cite>\n      <figcaption>Perseverance’s various scientific instruments.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"xrKCr4\">And like any new piece of engineering these days, it comes with more cameras than the previous model: 23, compared to Curiosity’s 17.</p>\n<p id=\"zVBeRP\">You can<em> </em>watch NASA’s live broadcast of the launch below. </p>\n<div id=\"rl2LyV\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/21X5lGlDOfg?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"6wtUJ0\">Previous rover missions have been launched in pursuit of the question: Was Mars ever hospitable to life? They found that it was, with water once on the surface and organic chemicals in the environment. </p>\n<p id=\"CEhxAn\">This endeavor is going to go for the ultimate question: Can it find evidence of actual microbial life, frozen in time on the Martian surface? </p>\n<p id=\"X9A2DL\">“This Mars mission is going to be the first mission to actually go and directly search for past evidence of life on Mars,” says Philip Twu, a robotics engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who helped design Perseverance’s autonomous driving system. This is stuff scientists dream about answering as kids. And now they can really do it. </p>\n<p id=\"B08o6t\">How? Perseverance is going to drill into Mars and collect samples of rocks that may contain evidence of ancient life. More audacious, though, is the follow-up plan: A future mission will recover those samples from Mars and return them to Earth. </p>\n<h3 id=\"BGehG8\">“Seven minutes of terror” </h3>\n<p id=\"hJavfc\">To find out the answer to that epic question — did Mars ever have life? — first Perseverance will have to travel through space for seven months to reach the red planet. </p>\n<p id=\"g1Gv1c\">Upon arrival to Mars in February, it will have to repeat an exceedingly tricky landing first achieved by Curiosity. The rover and all its gizmos are too heavy to land on the planet via parachutes alone. (Mars’s atmosphere is thinner than Earth’s to begin with, so parachutes are less effective there.) It has to be slowed downed with a powered (i.e., rocket) descent. </p>\n<p id=\"bV1YPX\">When Perseverance is <em>just</em> above the surface, the 2,260-pound rover will be lowered gently from the rocket via what NASA’s engineers call a “sky crane.” </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ruaKpfozFZDlqBCSXjwigF81UlE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20628778/PIA14839.jpg\">\n      <cite>NASA/JPL-Caltech</cite>\n      <figcaption>An artist’s depiction of the “sky crane” landing.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"5rJSe0\">This whole feat is made more impressive by the fact that Perseverance has to land itself. Mars is far enough away from Earth that any radio signal we send to it takes seven minutes to reach Mars. That means there’s no piloting Perseverance in real time. It has to slow itself down from around 12,000 mph to zero, all while choosing an unobstructed place to land.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRB-kl6cFHQnPYHVKu03382b5gM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20664544/edl_timeline_2020_imperial.jpg\">\n      <cite>NASA/JPL-Caltech</cite>\n      <figcaption>Perseverance’s landing will be completely self-guided by its computers.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"iE5kye\">Even though Curiosity successfully pulled off this feat in 2012, “our hearts will still be beating hard when we get to that point of the mission,” Matt Wallace, deputy project manager for Perseverance, told reporters at a Tuesday press conference. This is the most dangerous part of the whole mission, and where it could fail catastrophically. Once the landing sequence starts, NASA will have no control over the craft. </p>\n<p id=\"1dgS9J\">Engineers call this landing the “seven minutes of terror” because we won’t find out if Perseverance has made it safely to the surface until it has landed and sent a radio transmission back to Earth. (Unlike Curiosity, Perseverance will be able to film its landing, which the public will be able to see at a later date. That will be rad.) </p>\n<h3 id=\"3Vav9A\">Looking for signs of ancient life</h3>\n<p id=\"wR19nT\">Curiosity landed in Gale Crater, a dried-up ancient lake bed. Perseverance is going to a location called Jezero Crater, which is an ancient river delta. The terrain there is a little more treacherous than Gale, but the rewards may be richer. </p>\n<p id=\"hdO3lJ\">“It’s going to be a lot more rocks, it’s going to be a lot more cliffs, there’s going to be a lot more things that are gonna really require a rover to be able to be a lot smarter in the way it drives,” Twu says. It all has to work perfectly: If the rover gets stuck or breaks a wheel, there’s no Martian equivalent of AAA to tow it. (As with any Mars missions, many technical malfunctions are possible. Last year, for instance, a heat probe <a href=\"https://www.space.com/nasa-insight-mars-lander-mole-stuck.html\">on NASA’s Mars Insight </a>lander got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936315/nasa-mars-insight-lander-heat-probe-mole-digging-failure\">unexpectedly stuck</a> while drilling into the ground.)</p>\n<p id=\"sBVWPD\">But the risk will be worth it. “If life ever did exist on Mars, this is the kind of place where that evidence would be preserved,” Lori Glaze, the director of NASA’s planetary science division, says.  </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sulebBJcnHyIeKaAtrPP-pmOT3I=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20641183/22474_PIA23239_800w.jpg\">\n      <cite>NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/JHU-APL</cite>\n      <figcaption>This image of <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22474/jezero-crater-mars-2020s-landing-site/\" target=\"_blank\">Jezero Crater</a>, the landing site for the Mars Perseverance Rover, was taken by instruments on NASA’s <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>. </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"rpoTcu\">That’s because the crater is home to a 3.4 billion-year-old dried-up river delta. You can see its shape in the image above. This is an ideal place to look for signs of past life, Tanja Bosak, an MIT geobiologist working on the Perseverance mission, says. </p>\n<p id=\"BNN3aT\">In a river bed, “there are a lot of clay minerals, and as they settle, they can really just kind of smother anything organic, or they can even absorb organic molecules,” she says. That is: In the ancient dried clay of the delta, there may be microscopic fossils of microbial life, or geological patterns indicative of life. (Typically, Bosak studies how microorganisms alter rocks on Earth. The research she and her colleagues are doing in this area will provide the basis for what rocks to look out for on Mars.)</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaAux3fwTbou4QQLUomqsPME5GQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20664576/Mars2020_Depot_Caching_animated.gif\">\n      <cite>NASA/JPL-Caltech</cite>\n      <figcaption>Perseverance’s planned journey through Jezero Crater. It’s nuclear-powered (like Curiosity), and its initial mission to explore an ancient river delta on Mars is set to last a Martian year (two Earth years) but could be extended for much longer.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"TA08n4\">Once in the delta, Perseverance will use its cameras and various chemical sensors to find the rocks most likely to contain this evidence. (One of the sensors is called SHERLOC, short for “Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman &amp; Luminescence for Organics &amp; Chemicals.”) Scientists here on Earth will analyze that data and choose several dozen samples for the rover to drill into. Then the samples will be stored in special tubes inside the rover where they’ll be undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"FVSD1n\">The most audacious plan, though, is to come. A future mission — <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-sample-return-msr/\">whose date</a> is not yet determined — called the Mars sample return will send a new rover to Mars to collect the samples from a drop-off point and then launch those back to Earth on a small rocket. </p>\n<div id=\"G6mA2L\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sD_pwr_T2pU?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"vPkbaP\">What type of life might scientists find? </h3>\n<p id=\"TlmNiJ\">Once back on Earth, scientists can study the samples extremely precisely and determine whether or not they contain signs of ancient life. </p>\n<p id=\"r6WNEb\">They’re not expecting anything more than microbes — bacteria-like, or other single-celled organisms. This is not a mission to find little green men. </p>\n<p id=\"SXJdzh\">But it still is exciting. “These [Martian] rocks are older, by half a billion or a billion years, than anything that’s well preserved that we have on Earth,” Bosak says. Which means we might not only find life on Mars but a form of life older and more primordial than any previously observed on Earth. When it comes to life on Earth, she says, we can’t even ask “what life was like on Earth at that time.” The potential life on Mars may give us a better understanding of how life evolved on our own planet. </p>\n<p id=\"ZiLnTb\">Of course, the discovery of life on Mars will also provoke epic questions, like: Did life originate on Mars separately from Earth? Was there a common event that created life on both planets? Did life start on one planet and then jump to another via meteorite? Scientists won’t have these answers right away, but with actual samples from Mars, they can start thinking about them. (It’s also possible these Martian samples show no signs of ancient life.)</p>\n<p id=\"RwlaF3\">“Is there life in space?” is one of the biggest questions that gets kids interested in science. But scientists usually have to settle for figuring out the answers to smaller questions. “You learn to ask questions you can actually answer,” Bosak says. Now, in the relatively near future, we might be able to actually answer the big question. </p>\n<p id=\"3WOCQJ\">“This is something that is so unashamedly cool,” Asad Aboobaker, an engineer who worked on an experimental oxygen generator aboard Perseverance, says. This is his first Mars mission, and he’s just giddy about it. “Like, I get to send something to Mars, right? I mean, it’s literally going to go to another planet and land there and it’s going to do something that’s never been done before.”</p>\n<p id=\"nbdMCN\">It’s something hopeful to think about during the pandemic. The rover was named Perseverance in March after NASA conducted a nationwide <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/#Essay\">essay-writing</a> contest asking students for their ideas. Back then, the pandemic was not all-encompassing. Now the name has a new significance for many of the NASA engineers who have had to finish out their work from home, or in person with increased biohazard safety burdens. “The name has taken on a lot of special meaning,” Glaze says. “The team has really had to overcome unbelievable obstacles.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
