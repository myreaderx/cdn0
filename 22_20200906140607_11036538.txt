semesters, whether it be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fewer-us-colleges-committing-to-in-person-fall-reopening-classes-2020-7\">in-person or online</a>. As some students choose to take <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-colleges-higher-education-financial-struggles-pandemic-online-classes-2020-5\">online courses or are not interested in returning to college</a>, this can affect the economy of towns dependent on college students.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Many colleges closed and transitioned to remote learning in March, causing many to report <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-colleges-higher-education-financial-struggles-pandemic-online-classes-2020-5\">budget shortfalls</a>. Colleges are also estimating more financial losses for the current fiscal year. For instance, <a href=\"https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/oregon-state-board-trustees-approve-covid-19-resumption-plan-discuss-growing-budget-gap\">Oregon State University</a> projects a budget shortfall of $217 million, and undergraduates make up about 33.7% of the population in the university's home town of Corvallis.</p><p><a href=\"https://statements.cornell.edu/2020/20200702-additional-measures.cfm\">Cornell University</a>&#160;also estimates an overall budget shortfall of $210 million, even with a hybrid fall semester. The <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/04/leaders-discuss-budget-measures-forum\">Ithaca campus</a> of Cornell University already reported a loss of $45 million for the previous fiscal year.&#160;</p><p>There are many factors that contribute to the economies of college towns, including students spending money in the local economy and supporting businesses that employ workers. The <a href=\"https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/new-england-public-policy-center-regional-briefs/2020/college-towns-and-covid-19-the-impact-on-new-england.aspx\">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</a> analyzed college towns in New England and found 45% of wages and 38% of jobs in these towns and cities come from colleges and universities.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/small-businesses-in-college-towns-suffer-close-down-without-students-2020-6\">businesses</a> that usually rely on students bringing in revenue have also been negatively affected by campus closures these past few months. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/what-the-pandemic-is-doing-to-college-towns\">Bloomberg CityLab</a> interviewed a hospitality company in State College, Pennsylvania, where the main campus of Penn State University is located. Curtis Shulman, the director of operations for the company, said 60% of their revenue occurs during the academic year and 20% alone comes from football weekends.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Business Insider decided to look at the college towns that would be most affected if students don't return for in-person classes or if the university with the largest number of undergrads in the town have to move to a fully remote semester.</p><p>To figure out which college towns are the most economically vulnerable, we based our ranking on undergraduate enrollment as a share of the town or city's population. To do this, we looked at the 200 colleges and universities with the largest number of degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates based on fall 2018 college data from the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data\">National Center for Education Statistics' Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS.)</a>&#160;We focused on schools that are mainly four-year, bachelor-earning schools.</p><p>We then calculated the share of these undergraduates in the population of the towns and places where these large campuses are located. We used 2018 population estimates of incorporated places from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-cities-and-towns.html\">US Census Bureau</a> and focused on those with at least 30,000 residents.</p><p>IPEDS has specific enrollment data based on whether a student is taking distance classes or not. Since we want to estimate the share of students living in the town or city, we decided to look at the total number of undergraduates who are taking either some or no distance classes, rather than all-online courses, as a share of the population.</p><p>Although many of the colleges that made the top of our list are reopening for the fall semester, a few are choosing hybrid models or going fully remote. This includes <a href=\"https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/2020status\">Rutgers University-New Brunswick</a> where many of the classes will be held online and <a href=\"https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-08-18-plans-change.html\">Michigan State University</a>, which only recently decided students should learn online.</p><p>The following are 30 college towns that may be the most negatively impacted if students of the largest college campus in the town don't return or have to leave campus again, based on the share of residents of the towns that are undergrads. We included both the share of students who are normally either fully on-campus or only taking some distance-based courses and the share who are taking no distance courses.</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t30.

But as schools across the country plan an all-remote opening or a hybrid model with some in-person learning coupled with online learning, most parents know there is not.</p><p>What kids are doing about school depends very much on the wealth of their parents, now more than ever. But should it?</p><h2>An educational class divide</h2><p>With the upcoming school year still very much in flux, parents across the country will have to step in to pick up the educational slack left by school systems in disarray.&#160;</p><p>Parents will be forced to make an impossible choice: pause their careers and play administrative assistant to their kids while they learn via computer. Or don't and leave their kids on their own with potentially harmful consequences.&#160;</p><p>Some parents are setting up so-called \"pods\" to have their children either do <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/schools-choose-between-bad-online-learning-and-unsafe-classrooms-2020-7\">distance learning</a>, or actual homeschool, alongside a small group of other children. The idea is to give their kids some social interaction while mimicking at least some aspects of school.</p><p>The rich, of course, have many options. Their pods will likely consist of an in-person tutor who will work with the group to complete their schoolwork as they watch live instruction or videos from their actual school. Some will have the tutor design the curriculum themselves and form their own homeschool.</p><p>Other wealthy families will <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/style/wealthy-rich-parents-coronavirus-schools-hamptons.html\">stay at their summer homes</a> if schools are opening there. Or they'll have the choice of private schools which have a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/upshot/coronavirus-school-reopening-private-public-gap.html\">far better chance</a> than public schools of opening in the fall.</p><p>But for the vast majority of families, this school year will be an educational disaster. The achievement gap between rich and poor kids <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/27/the-pandemic-is-widening-educational-inequality\">is expected to widen significantly</a>.&#160;</p><p>To fight this educational inequality, a growing movement is demanding that if schools don't open that the money spent per student be returned to the parents to use as they see fit. If parents don't like the plan proposed by their public school, why should they not be able to take their child's funds and spend that money on the education of their choice?</p><h2>Giving parents flexibility</h2><p>This month, Senator Rand Paul <a href=\"https://www.paul.senate.gov/sites/default/files/page-attachments/SCHOOLAct.pdf\">introduced</a> the Support Children Having Open Opportunities for Learning (SCHOOL) Act which would send the federal funds spent on schools directly to parents to spend as they wish. It's a good idea but it's likely not enough.&#160;</p><p>Corey A. DeAngelis, Director of School Choice at the Reason Foundation, told me these federal funds make up about 9% of total education spending. If all federal funds were diverted directly to parents, families in the northeast of the country — which has the highest per student spending in the country with an average of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/school-system-finances.html\">nearly $20,000</a> — would see around $1,800. That's certainly a start but nowhere near enough&#160; for parents to effectively supplement their child's lacking education.&#160;</p><p>And parents in other regions would see even less. Parents in the South — where funding per child averages around $10,000 — would only receive $900.</p><p>Given the limited amount of federal funding, much of the interesting work on directly funding \"students, not systems,\" as DeAngelis says, is happening on the state level.&#160;</p><p>In Colorado, their legislature asked Gov. Jared Polis to convene a special session specifically to discuss educational concerns. The&#160; policy proposal by Colorado Republicans called \"Safe Learning Choices\"<a href=\"https://co.chalkbeat.org/2020/7/28/21345397/colorado-republicans-special-session-homeschooling-pods\"> argues</a> families are \"entitled to all or a portion of their child's per-pupil revenue to access the educational resources they need to thrive during the pandemic.\"</p><p>DeAngelis told me \"State constitutions require governments to provide 'free' public education. It's hard for states to say they're doing that if they aren't even reopening schools.\"</p><p>With many teachers asking for medical accommodations, which will mean only getting a portion of their pay under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act, schools will see some savings. Instead of diverting any of those funds to other programs, they must be passed on to parents to give them educational options. Local and state governments have to find the money as well. Education is mandatory and if it's not being provided by the public schools parents should be able to get it elsewhere.</p><h2>We already know we need more options</h2><p>No one wants to see kids left behind because their parents couldn't afford to skip work to help them with distance learning. We've <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/coronavirus-homeschooling-will-hurt-students-badly/2020/03/27/f639882a-6f62-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html\">already seen the harm</a> caused by just a few months of this kind of schooling and studies show this set up can <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/business/online-courses-are-harming-the-students-who-need-the-most-help.html\">leave many students behind</a> .&#160;</p><p>During the Spring, reports from parents about how distance learning was failing children were largely dismissed. After all, we were in a time where our tagline was \"two weeks to flatten the curve.\" Everyone thought it was temporary.&#160;</p><p>&#160;But as those two weeks kept getting extended provided, it was clear that many school systems were unprepared for the massive online shift.. I spoke to parents, at some of the best public schools in New York City, who did not have one instance of live online instruction during the spring semester.</p><p>Parents shouldn't be forced into another year of potentially lacking schooling just because they don't have the money for a private tutor or tuition for a private school. Schools which are not providing the service for which they are being paid should not continue to receive full funding. It shouldn't only be rich kids who have options.&#160;</p><h2>Taking politics out of the decision</h2><p>Some politicians may balk because the idea of school choice is seen as a conservative position, but the challenge right now is to depoliticize the issue of school funding for the good of the children. In normal times that would be an impossible task, but the unprecedented circumstances mean there's a chance.&#160;</p><p>Democrats can help shape the debate instead of shutting it down. They can help answer questions on how these funds can be used. What accreditation should be required for a teacher hired using this money? How can homeschooling parents prove how this money gets spent?&#160;</p><p>They can also force a time limit on these funds. Give parents access to these funds in the short term and see how it goes. If children thrive, why would we go back to the old system? If they don't, we can have an end date to the plan and return money to the schools.&#160;</p><p>Parents won't wait for their government to do the right thing for them. School districts around the country are already in the situation of asking parents to not un-enroll their children. Falls Church City Public Schools in Virginia <a href=\"https://www.fccps.org/article/287320?org=fccps\">sent a letter</a> to parents <a href=\"https://www.fccps.org/article/287320?org=fccps\">saying</a> they are experiencing \"a rise in families deciding to leave the system until we are either back in person or there is a vaccine to fight the virus\" and that \"If there is an exodus of students from FCCPS, the funding for our schools will decrease.\"&#160;</p><p>Similarly, The Denver Public Schools Board of Education <a href=\"https://www.dpsk12.org/board-of-education-statement-on-learning-pods-and-their-impact-on-the-community\">discouraged</a> parents from unenrolling their children and forming pods. \"It's also important to recognize the impact of unenrolling children from their school and/or hiring private teachers. We are deeply concerned about the pods' long-term negative implications for public education and social justice.\"</p><p>They're not wrong about these negative implications but their solution — to keep all children in non-optimal learning conditions — is untenable. Parents who can afford private tutors will still opt out or use their money to gain access to the tools to make online learning work for them.

up for a bad week of rest.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>A recent study from Sweden followed the sleep cycles of 100 people, aged

smoothly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>For many of us, work often competes for time with sleep — which is why many of us look forward to the weekend for a chance to \"catch up\" on sleep. But how much sleep is lost on days when we work? Our <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13157\">latest research shows</a> that we get about 30 minutes less sleep than we would ideally need on each night of the working week.</p><p>We followed 100 people aged from 60 to 71 over two years, covering their transition into retirement. We measured their sleep on three separate occasions, with one year in between, and compared the sleep habits while they were working against when — and for how long — they slept after retirement.</p><p>After retirement, we found that every day was like a weekend — at least when it came to how long people slept for. Sleep duration increased, but only on weekdays, from 6.5 to seven hours a night on average. This meant retired people got about an equal amount of sleep every night of the week.</p><p>The amount of sleep people tended to get on their weekends while still in work seemed to be their preferred sleep duration, rather than \"catch-up\" sleep. If weekend sleep was prolonged to compensate for the working week's sleep loss, we would have expected a drop after retirement (when there's no sleep loss to compensate for) — but this wasn't the case.</p><p>Given that participants' weekend sleep was their preferred sleep duration, weekend lie-ins will not compensate for sleep lost on weekdays while working. This means that our study participants had chronic partial sleep deprivation when they were working, of about 2.5 hours each week.</p><p>While adults are recommended to get <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/\">at least seven hours</a> per night for optimal health, sleep needs vary both between people and as we age. We need less sleep when we are older than when we are younger.</p><p>Different people need different amounts of sleep, which makes it hard to estimate what constitutes \"too little\" sleep for any given individual, but <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2003.00337.x\">other</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/\">studies</a> have in experiments found that getting only six to seven hours of sleep affects attention and reaction time negatively compared to getting eight to nine hours of shuteye. This performance drop remained, even after getting a full night's sleep three days in a row.</p><p>Partial sleep deprivation as a result of work can continue for years, which is why the accumulated effects needs to be considered. Sleeping less than seven hours on a regular basis is related to increased risk for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/\">various health conditions</a>, including diabetes, stroke, and depression. It's also <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/\">associated with</a> impaired immune system function, as well as increased risk of accidents.</p><h2>Social jetlag</h2><p>Not only did sleep duration change with retirement, but people also went to bed later and woke later. Getting rid of the alarm clock seemed to be what drove the increase, as retired people went to bed about half an hour later and woke up an hour later on average during weekdays compared to when they were working.</p><p>Going to bed in time to get plenty of sleep before getting up for work is not always easy — especially for the majority of the population who have a late \"<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079207000895\">biological clock</a>\". This means they naturally prefer to go to sleep later and wake up later than people with an early biological clock.</p><p>Those with a late biological clock also have a tendency to postpone their bed and wake times on weekends more than others, which unfortunately sets their biological clock even later — making it hard to go to bed early on Sunday and even harder wake up early on Monday morning.</p><p>When our biological clock is out of sync with the social clock (which is the timetable imposed on us by society) it can result in \"<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6784249/\">social jetlag</a>.\" Social jetlag acts a bit like regular jetlag, and can make us feel down and tired. It's also associated with higher risk for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6784249/\">metabolic disorders and depressive symptoms</a>.</p><p>Longer and more stable sleep across the week could, at least partly, explain why so many people experience <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2011/07000/Is_Retirement_Beneficial_for_Mental_Health__.20.aspx\">improved mental health</a> and drastically <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6149\">lower levels of fatigue</a> after retirement.</p><p>But even though sleep patterns became more stable after retirement, people still went to bed and woke up around half an hour later on weekends compared to weekdays. This hints that other social factors — such as visiting with friends — also affect when and how much we sleep.</p><p>We also found that retired participants with a full-time working partner changed their sleep timing to a smaller extent than the rest, highlighting that sleep is social, as opposed to a purely individual phenomenon.</p><p>But there are some things you can do yourself to adjust your sleep patterns more to work and avoid \"social jetlag\" on Monday morning, including making sure you get plenty of daylight in the mornings. Morning light pushes our biological clock backwards, making it easier to fall asleep at night. However, the opposite is also true, so bright light should be avoided in the evenings and bedrooms should be dark.</p><p>It also helps to prioritize your sleep and keep a more regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Allow yourself some extra time in bed on weekend mornings if you need it, but try to avoid throwing your weekend sleep schedule off too much in order to stay away from the vicious cycle of sleep loss and social jetlag.</p><p>That being said, our study suggests that work generates sleep loss and hinders people from sleeping in line with their natural rhythm. But just as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079215000891?via%3Dihub\">later school start times</a> are an effective way to improve sleep in adolescents, later (or flexible) start times at work could potentially have the same effect for working people — and may mean people won't have to wait until retirement to get enough sleep.<!-- End of code.

often seems impossible to know what's going on in Fido's head as he lounges on his dog bed.</p><p>But a handful of new studies offer surprising new insights about how our canine companions age, perceive human speech, and find their way home.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68821-6\">A study</a> published last month showed that dogs understand verbal communication just like we do: They parse out tone then meaning as separate aspects of human speech.&#160;</p><p>Dogs may also use Earth's magnetic field like a compass to find their way home, other recent <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/55080\">research revealed</a>.</p><p>And <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(20)30203-9\">another study</a> published this summer found that puppies age much faster than older dogs do — which means you're probably underestimating your dog's human-age equivalent.</p><p>Taken together, these recent discoveries may change how you understand your pet.</p><h2>We've been underestimating our dogs' ages</h2><p>Dogs live an average of 12 years. Human life expectancy, by contrast, is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">at least five times that</a>, which is why many people go by the&#160;common rule of thumb that&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-a-dog-year-equal-to-7-human-years-2014-10#:~:text=The%20seven%2Dyear%20rule%20is,at%20least%20once%20a%20year.%22\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">one \"dog year\" is equivalent to seven \"human years</a>.\"</p><p>But that one-to-seven ratio is wrong, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(20)30203-9\">researchers found</a> — it's a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/calculating-dog-age-human-years-2020-7\">misunderstanding of how dogs' aging processes</a> compare to those of humans. Instead, according to a July study, genetic evidence suggests that Labrador puppies and other young dogs age faster than their older counterparts.</p><p>\"What's surprising is exactly how old a 1-year-old dog is — it's like a 30-year-old human,\" Trey Ideker, a co-author of that study, <a href=\"https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-07/cp-asm070220.php\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\">said in a press release</a>.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f448c6b89aff80028ab7ac8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"lab puppy\" height=\"3497\" width=\"4662\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An 8-week-old golden Labrador husky mix sleeps on a cushion.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Angela Auclair/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But after that first year or two, dogs age more slowly as time passes — or rather, their cells do. So for each year older a dog gets, the corresponding increase in \"human years\" gets smaller. A 12-year-old Labrador is 70 human years old, the study found.</p><p>Ultimately, in order to calculate your dog's human-age equivalent, you'll need a calculator. The researchers' formula is: A dog's human age = 16 ln * your dog's age + 31. (The ln refers to the natural log of a number.)</p><h2>Dogs understand speech in the same way we do</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4573ca96eee670365a4d82?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Westminster Dog Show\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A dog gets groomed at the Westminster Dog Show.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Anneta Konstantinides/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>When humans hear someone speak, our brains divide the work if processing that verbal communication between the left and right hemispheres. First, the right hemisphere focuses on parsing out the speaker's underlying tone, then the left hemisphere processes the meaning of what we've heard.</p><p>Researchers discovered in 2014 that dogs' brains divvy up the task of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dog-brains-process-human-speech-in-the-same-way-we-do-35075\">speech processing</a> in the same way, between their left and right hemispheres, though the scientists weren't sure of the order in which that happened.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68821-6\">recent study</a>, however, found that dogs understand tone first, then meaning, in the same order humans do. The authors examined the brain activity of 12 pet dogs — six border collies, five golden retrievers, and one German shepherd — using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine.</p><p>They had the dogs listen to known praise words like \"clever,\" \"well done,\" and \"that's it,\" as well as unknown words like \"as if\" and \"yet\" in both praising and neutral tones. The data showed that the dogs processed \"simpler, emotionally loaded cues\" like tone first, then \"more complex, learnt cues,\" Attila Andics, one of the co-authors, <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-08/eelu-sph072720.php\">said in a press release</a>.</p><h2>Dogs use the magnetic field to navigate</h2><p>Dogs have an uncanny ability to find their way home using their sense of smell. But that's not the only navigational tool at their disposal: Pups can also orient themselves using Earth's magnetic field, according to a <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/55080\">June study</a>.</p><p>Birds, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gray-whales-stranded-during-solar-storms-cant-navigate-properly-2020-2\">whales</a>, and dolphins also use the same sixth sense, called magnetoreception, to plot their long migrations.</p><p>\"The magnetic field may provide dogs with a 'universal' reference frame, which is essential for long-distance navigation, and arguably, the most important component that is 'missing' from our current understanding of mammalian special behavior and cognition,\" the authors of the recent study wrote.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f453c4342f43f001ddfee01?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Two_Wire_Fox_Terriers\" height=\"2332\" width=\"3482\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Two wire-haired Fox Terriers.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Two_Wire_Fox_Terriers.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Alicia Nijdam/Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The researchers used GPS trackers to study how 27 dogs navigated over the course of 662 expeditions between 2014 and 2017 in the Czech Republic. They chose hunting breeds like terriers and dachshunds, which are trained to find prey like foxes in dense woodlands, then find their way back to their owners.</p><p>The researchers found that after the dogs were released into the woods, the animals typically retraced their steps back to their release point by following their own scent. But in one-third of the expeditions, the dogs took a different way home: On those trips, most of the dogs started off by running for 65 feet along Earth's north-south axis — even if the direction of their destination didn't align with that orientation.</p><p>This \"compass run\" helps the dogs figure out where magnetic north and south are, and where they are in relation to those points, according to the study authors.</p><p>\"This run is instrumental for bringing the mental map into register with the magnetic compass and to establish the heading of the animal,\" they wrote.</p><p>Kateřina Benediktová, one of the study authors,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/dogs-sense-earth-magnetic-field.html\">told Live Science</a> that unlike hunting dogs, a \"human would most probably get lost without a compass and a map if roaming over comparable distances in unfamiliar forested areas.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Black/Corbis via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Journalists of color have a unique understanding of racism.</li>\n<li>However, they are often assigned the \"racism beat,\" which is inherently a taxing thing to cover.</li>\n<li>Journalists of color are more than just the color of their skin, and should be treated as such.</li>\n<li>Neha Maqsood is a Pakistani journalist.</li>\n<li>This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>As a writer of color, I possess a distinct power. Through my identity as a Pakistani-Muslim, certain lived experiences have facilitated my writing on topics like racism, immigration, microaggressions, and Islamophobia. These subjects are not wholly accessible to a white writer who hasn't felt their effects firsthand.&#160;My authority on these topics has undoubtedly helped propel me at the start of my career, leading to multiple bylines with different publications.</p><p>However, in my early years as a journalist, I was also inadvertently pigeonholed onto the \"race beat\" – white editors and major publications would chiefly commission me to write on issues dealing with race that had already been covered extensively by writers of color before me.</p><p>Despite my frustration, the race beat also cemented the belief that as a brown woman, I was obligated to ensure that the unreported stories and events of communities of color were brought to light.</p><p>This was an opportunity to chronicle the systemic disparity and prejudice that was widespread across the globe. Through my writing, I attempted to appeal to the average white person to view things from the perspective of a person of color – to step into our shoes and see how different life was from this side. Ultimately, however, I realized that race was not&#160; just a 'beat' – it was a lived experience. And having to retell these traumatic stories would not only be taxing, but also an immense sacrifice to my mental health.</p><p>Following the latest uprisings connected to the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, there has been an abundance of features, op-eds and think pieces examining the tragic stories about police brutality.&#160;However, once these pieces are published across a wide range of publications, writers of color, particularly black writers, are continually asked to relive traumatic experiences by writing about topics which seem pretty cut and dry — racism is bad, white supremacy still reigns supreme. The end.</p><p>The responsibility of racial coverage has consistently been put solely on writers of color, granting white writers the license to bypass the subject. However, there is an inherent need to instill racial consciousness across the spectrum of all writers. Race is an intersectional phenomenon, and even white writers must be educated on how to integrate it into the narrative of stories. Whilst it is true that the expertise of writers of color can permit them to craft unique connections, it does not justify the burden of putting race reporting purely on them.</p><p>Race is entangled with inequality in politics, healthcare, business, housing, environment and other avenues. A 2016 research article published by <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1464884916663599\">Sage Journal</a> found that white reporters' history of remaining 'objective' when reporting on communities of colour had not benefited said communities in the slightest.</p><p>Objectively laying out the facts, instead, allowed for 'a narrative of ignorance, stereotyping, and racist framing'; remaining passive to the perspectives of marginalized communities perpetuates a vicious cycle where people of colour are seen as simply belonging to the binaries of good and bad. White writers must examine the trends, analyse the data and immerse themselves in a community which isn't their own to comprehend the more intricate reasons behind systemic bias.</p><h2><strong>Exploitative personal essays</strong></h2><p>Beyond news reporting, editors often rely on personal essays from writers of color to highlight critical issues. but in many cases these essays are not only achingly uncomfortable to write but also often verge on being exploitative.</p><p>In 2019, I had penned a very <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/30/racism-forced-dad-uk-23-years-later-driven-11976714/\">personal essay</a> for a prominent publication in the UK detailing my parents' immigration from Pakistan to the UK in the 1980's. My parents had moved in pursuit of a better life for their future children to a place where they believed success was based on merit and came to anyone who worked hard enough for it. However, after a few years of being subjected to blatant racism (from violent threats to being called 'Paki') and the second class treatment, my parents ultimately returned to Pakistan.</p><p>Through this piece, I conveyed that Britain had unfortunately forgotten to acknowledge its own colonial past and its xenophobic present. But following the publication of the piece, there was extraordinary backlash from predominantly white people. There were the classic responses including, 'Why don't you just go back to your own country' or the subtle: 'Paki's will always be our slaves'.</p><p>As journalists, we generally stay detached from our stories, but this was a different ballgame. This wasn't really my story; it was the story of my parents who had graciously shared their experiences with me knowing full well it's significance in South Asian history. Having white people trivialize the experiences of writers of color and invalidate the prejudice they feel, can make the entire process of writing seem not only soul wrenching but worthless .</p><p>I still often get commissioned on topics related to the 'race beat', but I mostly decline them. Most recently, I got asked to write an analysis piece on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-kashmir-crisis-isnt-about-territory-its-about-a-hindu-victory-over-islam/2019/08/16/ab84ffe2-bf79-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html\">Kashmir conflict</a> and the brutality invoked upon Kashmiri-Muslim's under the banner of Hindu nationalism, but I refused to do so. Thousands of writers before me have covered this story, and it is unlikely that my words will manifest actual change. At best, the piece may get a few retweets, a handful of angry comments and then be permanently archived in internet history. How many more angry think pieces are required to be written before sustainable and effective change is undertaken?</p><p>When journalists or literary writers write about such distressing issues, there is an unconscious hope that our work will at the least strike up a conversation and at the most, will induce a public response or lead to a policy change. But more often than not, our work seems to come to a standstill.</p><p>I will still continue to write about race and cover underrepresented communities and their stories, but I also want the media world to view me as more than just the color of my skin.

That similarity may be what saves markets from their own lofty valuations, according to James Paulsen, chief strategist at <a href=\"https://leutholdgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Leuthold Group</a>.</p><p>Stagnant price growth has plagued the US economy for years, and the coronavirus pandemic only worsened the problem. The Federal Reserve cut rates to zero, kicked off an unprecedented asset purchase program, and boosted the nation's money supply in an effort to keep inflation stable through the downturn.</p><p>Investors now fear such conditions will stifle a recovery from the current recession, but history suggests the opposite, according to the strategist.</p><p>The 1980s inflation fear spike sparked \"the beginning of a fabulous 'disinflationary,' two-decade performance in both the economy and the stock market,\" Paulsen said. The initial scare motivated a coordinated effort to right the economy. Such a solution will likely emerge once the coronavirus is contained and policymakers focus on stabilizing inflation.</p><p>Detailed below are the eight reasons Paulsen sees today's inflation scare giving way to a thriving economy and surging stock market.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bofa-september-meltdown-risks-technical-indicators-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bank of America lays out the under-the-radar indicators showing that huge swaths of the stock market are 'running on fumes' — and warns a September meltdown may just be getting started</a></em></p><h2>Demographic shift</h2><p>The US working-age population's decade-long annualized growth reached a record-low 0.3% this year, slumping in a downtrend similar to that seen starting in 1980. The past drop eventually reversed and led to a growth in the working-age population, a shift likely to repeat itself in the coming years, Paulsen said.</p><p>\"The size of the Gen-X age group is set to exceed the Baby Boomers in a few years,\" he wrote in a note.</p><p>That shift is partially behind the housing market's strength through the pandemic, as Gen-X Americans reach \"prime household-formation years.\" As the group ages further, they'll reach \"peak spending years\" and accelerate the nation's economic bounce-back, Paulsen added.</p><h2>Immigration vs inflation</h2><p>The country is also likely to pad its demographic trends by allowing for greater immigration over the next few years, the strategist said. Doing so \"could make underlying economic-resource growth far stronger than currently anticipated.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-investing-championship-strategy-matthew-caruso-contender-secret-to-return-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Investing Championship hopeful Matthew Caruso landed a 382% return in the first half of 2020. He shares the unique twist he's putting on a classic trading strategy — and 3 stocks he's holding right now.</a></em></p><h2>Turning the trade tide</h2><p>The economic rebound could be accelerated further should the US aspire to finally reach a trade surplus, Paulsen said. Trade balance data released Thursday showed the country <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-trade-deficit-july-widest-point-since-2008-coronavirus-economy-2020-9\">running a deficit of $63.6 billion</a>, its widest since 2008. A policy of enforcing fair-play trade among economic superpowers could improve the US's trade competitiveness and lift the economy, according to the strategist.</p><p>Boosting export activity would have a direct and powerful effect on national gross domestic product. Paulsen noted that, in a hypothetical scenario where the balance shifts from a 1% deficit to a 1% surplus, US GDP would improve an entire 2%.</p><h2>Closing the output gap</h2><p>The nation's output gap — a measure of the under-utilization of economic resources — sits at a post-war low. Such a disparity leaves \"considerable room for improvement\" when the pandemic ends and the US puts its resources back to work, Paulsen said.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-25-owned-outperforming-women-fund-managers-gs-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GOLDMAN SACHS: Female portfolio managers are outperforming their male counterparts so far in 2020. These are the 25 stocks they own the most compared to men.</a><br></em></p><h2>Permanently low-cost</h2><p>Companies battened down the hatches to ride out the pandemic, and that cost-cutting could end up speeding up the nation's rebound. Lowered breakeven points will yield greater profits when activity picks up, Paulsen said. The trend will also justify stocks' historically high prices as investors pay up for \"uncommon earnings leverage,\" he added.</p><h2>Recipe for productivity</h2><p>The latter two predictions come together in Paulsen's forecast for a surge in productivity. \"Hyper-efficient companies\" and the strong potential output-gap improvement suggests economic productivity \"could surprise to the upside\" throughout the recovery, he wrote.</p><h2>Poised to spend</h2><p>Households are unusually prepared to drive the economy out of its slump compared to past downturns, according to Paulsen. Americans spent more than a decade paying off debts, refinancing, raising their net worths, and growing more cost-efficient. Homes now tout a savings rate close to 20%, \"an uncommonly liquid status quo\" that stands to ignite a strong new expansion, the strategist wrote.</p><p>\"How much could economic growth be bolstered should household-sector attitudes turn optimistic about the future?\" he added.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-expert-says-hypervalued-market-set-to-plunge-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">'Never been so extreme': A renowned stock bear says today's 'hypervalued' market implies the worst market returns in history — and expects a 66% crash from today's levels</a></em></p><h2>Government backing</h2><p>Lastly, Paulsen sees the government's \"amazingly aggressive\" monetary and fiscal policies buttressing the nation's economic rebound. The Federal Reserve recently overhauled its policy framework to better control inflation as it expects to hold interest rates close to zero through 2022. Congress remains in a deadlock over new stimulus, but economists still expect a package to arrive before the November election.</p><p>So long as the government and the Fed keep their relief efforts intact, Paulsen expects the backdrop to usher in an expansion to rival even the most bullish outlooks.</p><p>\"Just as the restrictive policies employed in 1980 helped to break the inflation surge, it seems probable today's unique and massively accommodative economic policies will quicken future economic growth more than thought,\" the strategist wrote.</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets

specializing in lifestyle topics who lives on the coast of Maine with her husband and their rescue dog.</li>\n<li>Pre-pandemic, she had an inconsistent self-care routine &#8212; it was anything from watching a Bravo show with a glass of wine to meditating in the morning.</li>\n<li>But the insularity of the pandemic has given her the opportunity to nail down an actual daily routine.</li>\n<li>From journaling to yogic sleep, here's the routine she's been using to take care of herself.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Over the course of the last decade, my self-care routine has been inconsistent. Some days, self-care meant rising before the sun to meditate for 30 minutes. Other days, it meant eating a bowl of pasta on the couch, with a glass of wine and a Bravo show.</p><p>But with the arrival of COVID-19, everything changed, and I was forced to live a more insular life. Although being stuck in my house had many downsides, there was one positive development: without the distraction of the outside world, it was easier to implement a daily self-care routine.&#160;</p><p>It didn't take long to realize that taking time for myself, even during a workday, was imperative for my well-being during this stressful time. Here's the routine that works for me:&#160;</p><h2><strong>7:00 am</strong>: I get out of bed, gratefully accept a cup of tea from my husband, and begin to write in my journal.&#160;</h2><p>Today I have a lot going on in my head, and I pour my thoughts, feelings, worries, and ideas into three pages in my notebook. By the time I am finished, I feel lighter, unbound by my perceived limitations, and I have a better sense of direction for the day.</p><p>Next, I set a daily intention using oracle cards. During the pandemic, I started working with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Offering-Oracle-52-Card-Giving/dp/1401954766\">The Wild Offering Oracle</a>; the deck is imbued with hope and usually offers a positive perspective, even when the world feels gloomy. I shuffle the deck, fan the cards, and choose one at random. I record the intention in my journal and keep the card face up throughout the day to serve as a reminder.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524b3f7ed0ee001e25d7e6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"IMG 1146\" height=\"1739\" width=\"2319\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author choosing a card.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jersey Griggs</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>As a rule, I'm not allowed to check my phone until I've completed this routine. Starting my day with thoughtful introspection — instead of going straight to the news or social media — allows me to check in with myself without bias. When I begin my day clear-headed and centered (and without any negative distractions from outside forces) my mental health is rewarded.</p><h2><strong>10:30 am</strong>: After working for an hour and a half, I take a mid-morning break to meditate.</h2><p>This habit began at the onset of the pandemic, when I was invited by a friend to meditate with the <a href=\"https://sfdharmacollective.org/\">San Francisco Dharma Collective</a>. The community-led sangha offers a virtual <a href=\"https://sfdharmacollective.org/upcoming-events/\">morning sit</a> every day at 7:30 PST/10:30 EST, and the unguided group meditation is open to all.&#160;</p><p>Meditating with a group at a designated time has allowed me to cultivate a more consistent practice; eventually, I became accustomed to meditating on my own as a way to break up the morning.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524b80e6ff30001d4e7156?format=jpeg\" alt=\"IMG 1169\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author meditating.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jersey Griggs</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This morning, I am feeling creatively blocked. Instead of berating myself for being stuck, I give myself a literal break. As I settle onto my meditation pillow — which is just around the corner from my desk — I choose to put my frustration aside for 15 minutes.&#160;</p><p>I set a timer on my phone, close my eyes, and drop into the quiet. As I focus on my breath, I'm able to clear the clutter in my brain; it feels like a return to myself.&#160;</p><p>Shortly into the meditation, an idea pops into my head. For a moment, I recognize the solution to my problem, but I ignore it by focusing on my breath. When the timer goes off, I open my eyes and return to my desk with a fresh idea, eager to work.&#160;</p><h2><strong>12:30 pm</strong>: After eating lunch, I allow myself 30 minutes of free time to spend outside, sort of like recess during school.</h2><p>Before the pandemic, I used to rush back to work, worried about getting everything done. But during quarantine, I discovered that I benefited greatly from any time spent outside, even during the workday.</p><p>What I do during this time varies from walking the dog to weeding the vegetable garden, but one thing remains the same — it is time I carve out to enjoy life away from my desk.</p><p>Today, I pick a bouquet of flowers from my garden to drop off at my neighbor's house, who recently lost her dog to cancer. Picking and arranging flowers is simultaneously soothing and joyful, and it's a new favorite pastime.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524c7ee6ff30001d4e7166?format=jpeg\" alt=\"IMG 0200\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3023\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The bouquet of flowers.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jersey Griggs</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>&#160;I admire a bee drinking a sunflower's nectar and stop to watch a butterfly float past, finding myself grateful the pandemic gave my husband the time to dig these new flower beds.<p>When I return to my computer, I feel rested and rejuvenated. Instead of detracting from my profession, I've found that this scheduled free time translates into more focus and greater clarity during my workday.&#160;</p><h2><strong>8:00 pm</strong>: Today is Wednesday, which means it's time for <a href=\"https://www.mindfulbreathworkproject.com/bookings-checkout/yoga-nidra\">Yoga Nidra</a> with Becca Stoltz, creator of the <a href=\"https://www.mindfulbreathworkproject.com/\">Mindful Breathwork Project</a>.</h2><p>Also known as \"yogic sleep,\" Yoga Nidra is a guided practice that takes you to a place of deep consciousness, a state somewhere between wake and sleep.&#160;</p><p>In recent months, it has become an invaluable part of my weekly self-care routine. It's been helpful in releasing the physical discomforts and mental anxieties that often accumulate over the course of a week.&#160;</p><p>Before signing onto Zoom, I brush my teeth and put on my pajamas, as if I'm getting ready for bed.

That's why fabrics with higher thread counts are better at filtering particles.</p><p>It's also preferable to have more than one layer. The World Health Organizations recommends that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-fabric-masks-need-3-layers-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-2020-6\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"2862944a2a3ce27d33e9c8cc00af6f78\">fabric masks have three layers</a>: an inner layer that absorbs, a middle layer that filters, and an outer layer made from a nonabsorbent material like polyester.</p><p>N95 masks are the most protective because they seal tightly around the nose and mouth so that very few viral particles seep in or out. They also contain tangled fibers to filter airborne pathogens — the name refers to their minimum 95% efficiency at filtering aerosols.

Despite the UK spending around <a href=\"http://www.greetingcardassociation.org.uk/resources/for-publishers/the-market/facts-and-figures\">£1.7 billion</a> ($2.25 billion) annually on greeting cards, <a href=\"https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/greetings-cards-lack-of-diversity-interracial-couples-anniversary-valentines-birthday-cards/272581\">the industry doesn't accurately represent marginalized groups</a>.</p><p>Kutenda also platforms the work of up-and-coming artists and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds, saying that \"large retailers either ignore minority artists or steal their ideas.\" Alongside cards, the marketplace also sells gifts including mugs, stationery, and bookmarks.</p><p>Founder Avila Diana Chidume said Kutenda hopes to \"create a sense of belonging in a world created to not adequately provide representation.\" The young entrepreneur named the company after the word for \"thankful\" in Shona, a language spoken in her home country of Zimbabwe.</p><p>Chidume was motivated to create the business by the cards she received growing up. \"I could never relate to, or understand why, I never got cards or gifts with Black people on them,\" she said, adding that the first ever birthday card she got featuring a Black person was for her 21st birthday – and it was one of her own designs from her greeting card company <a href=\"https://aviladiana.com/\">Avila.Diana</a>, which she launched in response to this problem.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5271b9e6ff30001d4e72ab?format=jpeg\" alt=\"avila.diana 2\" height=\"1166\" width=\"1555\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chidume launched her greeting cards line Avila.Diana while studying for her bachelors degree.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Avila.Diana</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Chidume isn't the only person to recognize <a href=\"https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/greetings-cards-lack-of-diversity-interracial-couples-anniversary-valentines-birthday-cards/272581\">this underrepresentation in greeting cards</a>.

his ex-boss' obsessive hatred of President Barack Obama in extracts from his upcoming memoir published by news outlets Saturday.&#160;</p><p>In an extract of Cohen's \"Disloyalty: A Memoir,\" <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/05/politics/michael-cohen-book-trump-white-house/index.html\">published by CNN</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cohen-trump-book/2020/09/05/235aa10a-ef96-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html\">Washington Post,</a> Cohen claims that Trump described Obama as a \"Manchurian candidate\" who owed his place at Columbia University and Harvard Law School to \"f---ing affirmative action.\"</p><p>According to the CNN extract, Trump, in pursuing his grudge against Obama, hired a lookalike \"Fauxbama\" and \"ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him\" in a bizarre video.</p><p>In the book, reports CNN, Cohen does not name the man hired to play Obama or say on what date the incident took place, but does include a picture from the video.&#160;</p><p>It shows Trump sitting across his Trump Tower desk from a man resembling Obama. On the desk in front of Trump are two books, one with Obama's name on the front.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Pervaiz Shallwani  (@Pervaizistan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1302427987929899008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 6, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>But a copy of the video has emerged online</p><p>A parody of Trump's hit reality show The Apprentice, it was supposed to be aired at the 2013 RNC convention, according to reports, but was canned by party bosses.&#160;</p><p>In the video, <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2013/07/06/exclusive-watch-never-before-seen-full-video-of-donald-trump-firing-obama/\">published by Breitbart in 2013</a>, Trump attacks the Obama lookalike's record as president, his lack of business experience, and his golf game. It ends with Trump hurling his \"you're fired\" Apprentice catchphrase at Obama and banishing him from his office.&#160;</p><p>\"They never put it on,\" Trump told Breitbart of the RNC decision not to air the video at the time. \"The reason they didn't put it on is because they thought it was too controversial. Controversy. It might not be politically correct.\"</p><p>Cohen, in extracts of the book published by the Post, details several racist diatribes by Trump. Cohen claims that when ranting about Obama in one incident, he went on to say, \"tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.\"</p><p>According to the extracts, Trump belittled minority voters, saying, \"I will never get the Hispanic vote. Like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for Trump.\"</p><p>He also, writes Cohen, insulted South African leader Nelson Mandela, and praised the racist Apartheid regime.&#160;</p><p>\"Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it's a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader,\" Cohen claims Trump said.&#160;</p><p>In the book, Cohen's assessment of his former boss's character is withering, and he describes him as \"a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.\"</p><p>But the White House has hit back at Cohen, who was jailed last year for lying to Congress and for election finance crimes prosecutors claimed were committed at Trump's behest.&#160;</p><p>In a statement to the Post, the White House attacked Cohen's credibility, describing him as \"a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.\"</p><p>But Cohen is not the first source to have claimed that Trump is consumed by hatred for Obama.&#160;</p><p>Trump launched his political career with the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, claiming, groundlessly, that Obama was ineligible for the presidency because he wasn't born in the US. (Obama was born in the US state of Hawaii.)&#160;</p><p>In a notorious incident at the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, Obama singled out Trump in the audience and mocked him. Some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/02/26/did-the-2011-white-house-correspondents-dinner-spur-trump-to-run-for-president/\">pundits have speculated the public humiliation</a> was a key factor in Trump's decision to run for the presidency in 2016.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

hitting a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/stock-market-news-today-sp500-nasdaq-record-stimulus-expectations-2020-9-1029557908\">fresh record high</a> on the heels of its

industrial average and the Nasdaq also slumped, reversing gains from earlier in the week.&#160;</p><p>\"We view the latest sell-off as a bout of profit-taking after a strong run,\" said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS, in a Friday note. \"Stocks are still well-supported by a combination of Fed liquidity, attractive equity risk premiums, and an ongoing recovery as economies reopen from the lockdowns.\"</p><p>While the S&#38;P 500 is now sitting roughly at UBS's target, there's also further upside that could be driven by a coronavirus vaccine or \"positive medical developments,\" a new stimulus bill from the government with an election outcome favorable to growth, and a real rates dropping further, according to the

Here are three recommendations he has for investors.&#160;</p><p><strong>1. Ease into markets&#160;</strong></p><p>Heightened volatility can be scary, but shouldn't mean investors get stuck on the sidelines. \"Rather than trying to time the market and potentially miss out on gains, we recommend an averaging-in approach by establishing a set schedule to commit capital to stocks within a 12-month timeframe,\" said Haefele.&#160;</p><p>He also recommended a \"put-writing approach to enter markets defensively, for those investors who can implement options,\" and \"making use of structured investments to add asymmetric exposure to stocks, e.g., with a degree of capital protection.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-investing-championship-strategy-matthew-caruso-contender-secret-to-return-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Investing Championship hopeful Matthew Caruso landed a 382% return in the first half of 2020. He shares the unique twist he's putting on a classic trading strategy — and 3 stocks he's holding right now.</a></em></p><p><strong>2. Diversify for the next leg&#160;</strong></p><p>\"The mega-cap IT complex has driven an outsize portion of the year-to-date gains in the US equity market,\" Haefele wrote. \"But while we don't think tech is in a bubble, we do recommend that investors with excess exposure to the biggest US stocks consider rebalancing into areas accelerated by COVID-19, such as companies exposed to the 5G rollout, and sustainability-aligned companies set to profit from a 'green recovery.'\"</p><p><strong>3. Protect against the downside&#160;</strong></p><p>\"COVID-19 has brought unprecedented uncertainty for investors, and further volatility cannot be ruled out,\" said Haefele. \"Diversification across asset classes and regions is the best way to manage the risks in one's portfolio.\"</p><p>That being said, Haefele added that investors will need to seek alternatives to portfolio diversification because of how low starting yields are on high-quality bonds. He recommended gold, which he sees as having further upside potential, and \"including some exposure to hedge funds with a strong track record of downside risk management,\" to insulate portfolios.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-expert-says-hypervalued-market-set-to-plunge-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">'Never been so extreme': A renowned stock bear says today's 'hypervalued' market implies the worst market returns in history — and expects a 66% crash from today's levels</a></em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-downturn-strategy-stay-invested-3-recommendations-ubs-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nIdnniQ3Rzg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 06 Sep 2020 13:10:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5cfad0c311e2053c903c32da?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"3708fcea104a5b4b535aac011b87eadd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn80@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-27-830_efd6606804aef41d.webp","destWidth":1776,"destHeight":1332,"sourceBytes":107944,"destBytes":107944,"author":"insider@insider.com (Carmen Reinicke)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5cfad0d211e2054007798c37?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-45-762_f8f1596c8d5dfe30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn76@2020_4/2020/09/06/14-05-49-381_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn43@2020_3/2020/09/06/14-05-45-366_d862ce09c6786a77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/06/14-05-45-300_f2da15ba258ffea0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_5/2020/09/06/14-05-44-327_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nIdnniQ3Rzg:IzaHwcBHHLU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-33-778_34184e6f64c1d02b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nIdnniQ3Rzg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-35-527_b2decce95365b898.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599401096931},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 22:04:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 22:04:56","title":"Social media is a parasite, it bleeds you to live","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/delete-social-media-phone-parasite-mental-health-instagram-twitter-facebook-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4fa9887ed0ee001e25cf5c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"cell phones parents\" height=\"2769\" width=\"5539\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Social media apps are designed using the same psychology as casino slot machines.

I'm hardly alone in this time of pandemic and social upheaval.&#160;</p><p>I've known for years that social media was a time suck. But lately, more than ever, I could feel myself growing anxious just a couple minutes into mindless \"<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/\">doomscrolling</a>\"&#160;</p><p>For all the personal and professional connections made, the worthwhile articles read, and the occasional laugh, it became evident that social media was not giving me anything close to the emotional value of what I was putting into it.&#160;</p><p>It was swallowing my time, which as a parent of three young kids, is spare. It was scrambling my once-decent attention span. And it was convincing me to care deeply about all kinds of ephemeral internet mush — things not worth caring about at all.&#160;</p><p>Even Instagram, generally a source of hi-fives for my cute kids' photos, started feeling toxic. Underneath the \"living your best life\" facade lurked a cycle of what I call \"envy porn\" — basically content meant to instill the most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out\">FOMO</a> on a global scale. Even if its users (a.k.a. content creators) mean well, Instagram is a place for people — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/opinion/sunday/instagram-social-media.html\">especially women</a> — to feel worse about themselves.&#160;</p><p>One afternoon, while eating lunch and scrolling down a Twitter rabbit hole of QAnon content, I rashly decided to delete all social media apps from my phone. I didn't delete my accounts, I just made a de facto rule: no social media on the phone.&#160;</p><p>It's been over two months, my life is better for it.&#160;</p><p>To be sure, I didn't totally go cold turkey. Twitter still hums on my desktop, for work, of course. Popping in on the latest journalistic flame wars, the ritualistic dunkings, and the rare but appreciated article worth reading maintains the \"connection,\" but it no longer feels like a limb.&#160;</p><p>There's been more book-reading, more music-listening, more goofing around with my kids. During all those simple but life-affirming experiences, a portion of my brain doesn't feel permanently tethered to the online matrix. I didn't even have to make a big show of \"leaving social media.\" All it took was getting social media off my phone.&#160;</p><p>Nobody is so thirsty for digital hearts that they're going to walk around mindlessly scrolling on a laptop. And yet, vacantly staring at hot takes and shitposts is socially acceptable, as long as it's on a phone.&#160;</p><p>The phone makes social media too instantly available. It promises that you'll never be bored again anywhere — at the in-laws, at the supermarket, in an elevator. And that's just awful.&#160;</p><p>We need to be bored, <a href=\"https://time.com/5480002/benefits-of-boredom/\">at least in moderation</a>. Mental health, creativity, and the ability to be entertained require brains to endure at least a little bit of empty space.</p><p>There was a moment a few years back, where after many years of \"social smoking\" at alcohol-soaked events, I decided once and for all that cigarettes were gross and not even worth the occasional \"social\" puff. This feels like that.&#160;</p><p>Last week, I tweeted a strong opinion. Can't remember what it was. But I did feel a familiar jones for the affirmation earned from sending very good non-ratioed takes. I had to walk away from my laptop after about a minute, and then I completely forgot about the tweet.&#160;</p><p>Reopening my computer a few hours later, there were a favorable amount of RTs and Faves, with a mere sprinkling of \"Go fuck yourself\" replies.&#160;</p><p>It was all there, the life story of that tweet.

It does not mention that the US-Mexico border is almost 2,000 miles long.</p><p>Here is a run-down of the major promises the president has made about the wall.</p><h2><strong>April 2014: \"I would build a border like nobody's seen before.\"</strong></h2><p>In April 2014, as Trump prepared to begin his bid for the Republican nomination, he made his first mention of a wall — or at least a fence — at a New Hampshire conservative event.&#160;</p><p>In preparing for <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?318743-2/donald-trump-freedom-summit\">his speech to the Freedom Summit</a>, advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone struggled to remind Trump to center immigration in his speech. Trump was resolving to be \"the hardest on the Right\" on these issues, Nunberg later told Business Insider, but struggled to stick closely to prepared notes.</p><p>The simple idea of a wall appealed to Trump.&#160;</p><p>\"We either have to have borders, and I mean strong borders ... and I mean strong. And you know I'm a builder, I build great buildings,\" Trump told his audience.<br><br>\"Building a border, you know they talk about 'oh I don't know, how could we possibly build a fence that nobody can climb over?' I would build a border like nobody's seen before. Nobody's climbing over.\"</p><h2><strong>June 2015: </strong><strong>\"I will make Mexico pay for that wall.\"</strong></h2><p>As Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, a new promise arose — and it appears to have been totally off the cuff.<br><br>\"I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and&#160;I will make Mexico pay for that wall,\" he said. \"Mark my words.\"<br><br>According to Ian Volner, who has chronicled the Trump wall in his book \"The Great Great Wall: Along the Borders of History from China to Mexico,\" the claim wasn't in the briefing notes circulated to journalists prior to his announcement speech.&#160;</p><p>His campaign quickly wound it back, qualifying the promise as it made headlines.&#160;</p><p>Whether Mexico was paying literally or figuratively didn't turn out to matter that much. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/09/fact-checking-president-trumps-oval-office-address-immigration/\">According to The Washington Post</a>, Trump would go on to talk about a border wall more than 200 times on the tumultuous 2016 campaign trail.</p><h2><strong>August 24, 2015: It will have a \"very big, beautiful door\"</strong></h2><p>\"This will be a wall with a very big, very beautiful door, because we want the legals to come back into the country,\" Trump told CBS News.&#160;<br><br>A big door to welcome documented immigrants hasn't been given much attention since. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPUk760vWw\">In a 2019 roundtable discussion on border security</a>, Trump remarked on the doorways in an existing section of wall and suggested not having any.</p><p>\"Because putting the doors on cost more than the property is worth,\" he said.&#160;</p><h2><strong>January 25 2017: He orders \"a contiguous, physical wall\" (or similar barrier).<br></strong></h2><p>Anti-immigration executive orders came at speed after Trump took office.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-border-security-immigration-enforcement-improvements/\">Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements</a> set in officialese exactly what Trump meant by the wall — a definition that left room for the <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2019/01/08/trump-wall-concept-timeline/2503855002/\">many, many visions</a> the president has described since.</p><p>\"'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier,\" read the order. With numerous natural barriers along the way, the amount of new construction has been reckoned at around 900 miles.</p><h2><strong>June 6, 2017: \"There is a chance that we can do a solar wall.\"</strong></h2><p>With this environmentally-friendly vision, proposed at a White House meeting with Republican congressional leaders, Trump suggested the costs of the wall could be covered by solar-power-generated electricity.</p><p>\"We are seriously looking at a solar wall,\" said Trump, pointing out that the sun-drenched border would offer obvious opportunity.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-solar-border-wall-2017-7\">As Business Insider's Leanna Garfield reported at the time</a>, a solar-powered array could conceivably recuperate construction costs, but only over decades.&#160;</p><p>It was never mentioned again.</p><h2><strong>July 7 2017: Mexico will \"absolutely\" pay.

He completed it in four months and 25% under budget.&#160;</p><p>However, with the scrutiny of Congress, he has not been able to repeat this success with his border wall.&#160;</p><h2>December 21, 2019: Government shutdown</h2><p>In mid-December, as Congress was wrangling with the president over the next year's funding bill, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-trump-border-wall-demands-deadlocks-congress-2018-12\">Trump made a late-notice demand for $5 billion for his wall</a> — much more than the $1.6 billion that the Democrats countered with for general border-security funding.</p><p>The standoff triggered a government shutdown that lastest well into the new year.&#160;</p><p>Trump begrudgingly agreed to a package including $1.4 billion for barrier construction on January 15, ending the shutdown.&#160;</p><h2><strong>January 10, 2019: No wall, renewed talk of Mexico paying</strong></h2><p>A year after his self-imposed deadline, there was no completed wall. Instead, there were more attempts to salvage the idea that Mexico might foot the bill.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mexico-write-check-for-border-wall-2019-1\">On January 10, Trump said</a>: \"When, during the campaign, I would say Mexico is going to pay for it, obviously I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check.\"</p><p>Instead, he said, Mexico will pay \"indirectly,\" through renegotiated trade deals. As Business Insider's Bob Bryan explained, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-oval-office-shutdown-speech-usmca-trade-deal-pay-border-wall-2019-1\">that's not how it works</a>.&#160;</p><h2>February 15, 2019: Trump declares a national emergency</h2><p>After the debacle of the government shutdown, Trump's next move was to declare the situation at the border <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-declares-national-emergency-build-border-wall-2019-2\">a national emergency</a>, enabling him to bypass Congress and approve billions in funding for his wall.&#160;</p><p>As he announced it, he told reporters: \"I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\"<br><br>Another $3.8 billion was raided from the Pentagon's budget for the wall, which was considered a \"higher priority item,\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805796618/trump-administration-diverts-3-8-billion-in-pentagon-funding-to-border-wall\">NPR reported</a>.</p><h2><strong>June 2020: Trump says Biden will finish the wall if he gets elected<br></strong></h2><p>With the project clearly not going to plan, and an election looming, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/trump-claims-joe-biden-will-finish-border-wall-because-therell-be-a-revolution-if-he-doesnt/\">Trump told Fox 10 in Phoenix</a> that the wall would continue even if he loses.</p><p>He predicted that Joe Biden would have to continue the project or there would be a \"revolution.\" <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-border-wall-construction-stop-elected\">Biden soon said the opposite</a>: if he is elected, construction will stop.</p><h2><strong>August 18, 2020: \"Almost complete\" — even though it is far from it.<br></strong></h2><p>Trump, and his campaign, have made many different claims about how done the wall is. On the campaign trail on August 28, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md8tIz-oblQ\">Trump told New Hampshire</a> that the wall is \"almost complete.\"</p><p>Yet on the Trump campaign website \"Promises Kept,\" the wall's completion <a href=\"https://www.promiseskept.com/achievement/overview/immigration/\">is discussed in the present tense</a>.&#160;</p><p>\"Pres. Trump is fulfilling his promise to build a border wall, with large portions finished or under construction,\" says the site.&#160;</p><p>The Trump campaign states that 216 miles have been completed, \"with an additional 339 miles under construction and 183 miles under pre-construction.\" It is not clear what \"pre-construction\" is.</p><p>But what we do know is that most of that was a replacement wall.

an environmentally friendly cargo transport aircraft with commercial production posied to begin in 2025.</li>\n<li>The LCA60T airship can off-load its up to 66-ton payload mid-air.</li>\n<li>Because the LCA60T is a VTOL, it won't require any extra infrastructure to operate, allowing it to serve more remote locations without harming the environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"http://flying-whales.com/en\">Flying Whales</a> is producing a blimp-like aircraft that can transport and drop off cargo mid-flight.</p><p>Several components of the cargo transport airship are made to be environmentally friendly, such as its floating capabilities powered by helium, hybrid-electric propulsion system, and lack of need for extra infrastructure during take-offs and landings.</p><p>But don't get confused by its oblong shape and helium-powered floating capabilities: the LCA60T&#160; is rigid and can't be \"deflated\", setting it apart from the traditional blimp despite its exterior appearance.</p><p>The aircraft was originally designed to transport wood logs around inaccessible areas by creating an airship that didn't need infrastructure support. However, the France-based team quickly pivoted to a larger, less targeted client base, the team told Business Insider.</p><p>\"We realized that this solution could be used in a lot of other sectors, so the [later] goal was not to make something that was only able to work for wood transport,\" Romain Schalck, marketing manager for Flying Whales, told Business Insider. \"But we wanted to start with something because it's, generally speaking, easier to start designing something to answer a specific market.\"</p><p>In terms of other iterations, Flying Whales is currently working with both state and private financial supporters and clients across various industries in Europe, Asia, and Canada, with plans to eventually expand to the US as the team grows in the future.</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tAs of right now, one of the company's biggest investors is the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The same year AVIC first called Flying Whales (2017), the company also received an investment from the French state of around $29.5 million, according to Schalck.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

aircraft in the woods.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://flying-whales.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Flying Whale</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Around then, the company started expanding from its team of five to six people, to 50 employees.</p><p>Now, Flying Whales has over 130 employees with plans to expand even more when the group starts shifting from an engineering to an industrial company, which will come when it's ready to start physically producing the airships.</p><p>\"Maybe at the end of the program development, we will be close to 300 people in the design office,\" Pierre-Yves Fouillen, market manager at Flying Whale, told Business Insider. \"Once we start to operate the airships, the number of employees will just explode.\"</p>\n\tFlying Whales plans to build its first factory in France in the coming year with the goal of having the first LCA60T in the air by 2024.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f50f6e8e6ff30001d4e6d49?format=jpeg\"

production.</p>\n\tAs of now, the price of the aircraft is confidential, but according to the Flying Whales team, its tag is closer to that of a helicopter than a plane.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img

several wind blades.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://flying-whales.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Flying Whale</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The company also plans to develop an \"ownership operator\" segment of its business that will allow clients to use the airships for short-term projects instead of having to purchase an entire unit just for one mission.</p>\n\tThe rigidity of the structure that sets the LCA60T apart from a blimp is its \"multilayer envelope technology,\" which uses several thin layers of textile fabric panels — similar to that of an inflatable boat — over the actual structure, according to Schalck.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f50f6f87ed0ee001e25d392?format=jpeg\" alt=\"LCA60T_pipeline\" height=\"1874\" width=\"2500\"

Whale</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>And since the air vehicle uses helium to hover, the LCA60T has a low fuel consumption compared to traditional aircrafts.</p>\n\tThe airship can also load and remove cargo while hovering, which is done by employing winches that are controlled by a \"loadmaster.\"\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f50f6fe7ed0ee001e25d393?format=jpeg\"

href=\"http://flying-whales.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Flying Whale</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Despite its 66-ton payload, the LCA60T can carry objects of any size or shape by using

And by hates, I mean structurally despises it, from soup to nuts: venture capitalists pretty much want to invest only in startups that promise to completely dominate markets, raking in as close to 100% of potential gains as possible.</p><p>It wasn't always like this: The first wave of technology firms, from Hewlett-Packard to Apple to Microsoft, emerged from the model of fierce, government-monitored competition, leading to a lot of innovation and a beneficial mix of great products and great prices. That's how we got computers on our desks, on our laps, and in our pockets when, decades ago, they required entire buildings.</p><p>The second wave of tech innovation, based on the internet and later mobile computing, turned venture capitalists into venture monopolists. That why we now have so few companies providing vast numbers of uses with essential digital products and services. And this state of affairs has been valorized, notably by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who infamously (and influentially) argued in 2014 that the conventional wisdom concerning monopolies is bogus.</p><p>\"All happy companies are different: Each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem,\" <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536#:~:text=Monopolies%20are%20a%20good%20thing%20for%20society%2C%20venture%20capitalist%20Peter,in%20an%20essay%20on%20WSJ.&text=The%20opposite%20of%20perfect%20competition,can%20set%20its%20own%20prices.ces.\">he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed</a> to support his book, <em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. \"</em>All failed companies are the same: They failed to escape competition,\" he added, riffing on Tolstoy's insight.</p><h2>An unhappy Elon Musk</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e6a8435e4f9fe21de44f5f4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"peter thiel\" height=\"1333\" width=\"1777\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Peter Thiel is a fan of monopolies.\n<p class=\"copyright\">J. Scott Applewhite/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It isn't worth debating whether Thiel is right or wrong. A successful business wants to aspire to the condition of monopoly, full stop. But that raises the question, \"Is that good for customers?\" And while the answer can be yes, a dynamic, capitalist economy has usually encouraged robust competition on the assumption that the key to consumer happiness is a fair market price, not a price established by one player and then charged as what economist term a \"rent.\"</p><p>Thiel's PayPal partner, Elon Musk, has found himself in a situation that, with just a bit of a stretch, fits the definition of a monopoly. Tesla is selling nearly all the electric cars that consumers are buying. Various competing products from startups and incumbents aren't making a dent in Tesla's business. And Tesla is taking advantage.</p><p>In general, the auto industry is a good example of how competition has led to a lot of consumer choice and a degree of predictability about prices. A Toyota Corolla is going to be a good car, and it's going to cost about $20,000, base. Likewise, a Honda Civic. There's abundant demand for cars at that price, and so the market in the US has performed superbly in inviting companies to meet that demand.</p><p>In the electric-vehicle space, however, demand isn't being met. It's almost impossible to buy an affordable, new EV, one that costs less than $500 per month on a typical auto loan. Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan is $38,000.</p><p>Musk is aware of this, and he isn't happy about it. His overarching goal is to get as many EVs on the roads as possible, Tesla-badged or otherwise. But for now, Tesla needs to sell expensive EVs to survive. Ironically, survival has yielded a monopoly, and Wall Street recognizes it: That's why Tesla's shares are up over 8,000% from the company's 2010 IPO and the market cap now exceeds every other carmaker's, along with those of some of America's biggest companies.</p><h2>Musk doesn't care about money</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a75ef0f419238243bb92?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk dances onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\" height=\"1982\" width=\"2643\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla is operating or building factories on three continents.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>If Musk had his way, he'd keep building factories and EVs all over the world, using Wall Street as an ATM to fund the expansion, and get millions of electric vehicles on the road in the next decade while losing money on everything. To be honest, that could be construed as a virtuous monopoly. Amazon, after all, has at times been content to remain profitless while offering consumers almost everything they want, from swift deliveries to rock-bottom prices.&#160;</p><p>However, Tesla is on the way to owning the entire EV market and capturing all of its future global growth, as a matter of course. Barriers to competitive entry are very, very high — it's monumentally expensive to develop and manufacture just one automobile — but the established carmakers who have the money and expertise haven't taken any meaningful market share away from Tesla, and it's unclear whether startups such as Rivian and Lucid have the potential to catch up.</p><p>In the jargon of investing, Tesla doesn't just have a protective moat — it has a veritable ocean.</p><p>In this respect, Tesla is the greatest monopoly Silicon Valley has yet produced. And nobody seems particularly troubled by it. Except for Musk, who'd like to sell a cheaper car, and folks like me, who value market competition for its own sake. Thiel would insist that competing to compete is bad business because you end up competing away your profits and eventually go out of business, but so what? No business should be forever, and a business's erosion of profits just means that consumers are getting what they want or need at a great price.</p><p>Well, there is one other concerned party: the federal government, which is supposed to regulate the business realm to avoid monopolies and steward capitalist competition. Tesla is too small, and in too broadly competitive a market (autos generally, not just EVs) to attract antitrust actions. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-monopoly-electric-car-market-2018-12\">I've called Tesla's achievement a micro-monopoly</a>, which is different from the real thing, but Tesla is preparing to scale up significantly, with new factories coming online, under construction, or planned for three continents.</p><h2>It's the data that matters</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/56a775b4c08a80880e8bc5a2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla autopilot\" height=\"1610\" width=\"2880\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla&#39;s Autopilot is a data-gathering powerhouse.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>So it's fair to assume that the micro-monopoly could be macro, in a decade or so. It wouldn't shock me if, in that scenario, Musk builds a $10,000 EV and sells it at a big loss, simply to execute his master plan. Imagine a world where one in four Americans, perhaps more, drives a Tesla. The traditional auto industry consolidates into two or three mega-manufacturers. Consumer choice is drastically reduced.</p><p>And now we have to consider that the largest business opportunity in transportation isn't selling cars. It's acquiring data, through networked vehicles. No one is sure who's going to end up owning this data, but for Silicon Valley, the paradigm is obvious: The network facilitator does. Facebook makes money off your updates, Google makes money off your searches.&#160;</p><p>This is the point at which Tesla could run into trouble with its monopoly power. The simple reason is that some critical aspects of its vehicle systems won't work without donated data. Autopilot, Tesla's semi-self-driving technology, already requires the entire fleet to donate data to shared learning.</p><p>Interestingly, a challenge to Tesla's monopoly, if this all comes to pass, would probably delight Musk. Because that would mean that Tesla got as big as he dreamed it would be, and the internal-combustion engine was killed off by competition malfunctioning for just long enough to save the planet from global warming. Maybe monopolies aren't so bad, after all. Just make them temporary.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-are-too-expensive-why-that-could-be-a-problem-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/6bITsMq1sCc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 06 Sep 2020 11:54:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5eb959773dac9a7119588d35?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9243cfba06f423d70d7ca59cc2d61b65","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-04-57-393_dc3857f134220782.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":62836,"destBytes":62836,"author":"insider@insider.com (Matthew DeBord)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5eb959773dac9a7119588d35?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-04-57-393_dc3857f134220782.webp","https://i.insider.com/5e6a8435e4f9fe21de44f5f4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn27@2020_1/2020/09/06/14-05-39-975_6133ffc32d45981f.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f11a75ef0f419238243bb92?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_4/2020/09/06/14-05-27-001_3d9ffc10b4623990.webp","https://i.insider.com/56a775b4c08a80880e8bc5a2?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-52-147_a74cee7359786f1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn76@2020_4/2020/09/06/14-05-49-381_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_6/2020/09/06/14-05-47-381_92d4d6751017987b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn52@2020_5/2020/09/06/14-05-52-196_563fa96e5efb098a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn71@2020_5/2020/09/06/14-05-44-327_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=6bITsMq1sCc:UQbsJJ1Nu30:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/06/14-05-41-255_40e65ee6f3a4ba43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/6bITsMq1sCc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_5/2020/09/06/14-05-48-755_767d21c3c812c3f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599401096937},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 22:04:57","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 22:04:57","title":"Biden needs to win big in November, otherwise we're in trouble","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-biden-win-landslide-against-trump-president-elections-issues-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3c11c27f9786001d1f89a3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump v biden donors 2x1\" height=\"1025\" width=\"2050\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tom Pennington/Getty Images; SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The election in November is the most consequential in modern history, as a Trump win could mean further descent into fascism.</li>\n<li>Biden is currently up in the polls, but in order to send the right message to Americans, and the world abroad, Biden must defeat Trump in a landslide.</li>\n<li>Michael Gordon has a long history in marketing and communications strategy and Democratic politics.</li>\n<li>This is an opinion column.

leaders do these seven things.\n<p class=\"copyright\">EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>During a pandemic, employees need honest, effective leaders to help them cope with tough times.&#160;</li>\n<li>Heidi Zak, cofounder and CEO of loungewear startup ThirdLove, believes leaders need to be more proactive and create safe spaces for employees to feel seen and supported.&#160;</li>\n<li>You can start to make a difference if you're transparent, agile, and optimistic with your employees. Communicate with them often to share your honest feelings and advocate for them to do the same.</li>\n<li>Establish a company mission, and be willing to adapt and apply it to current events.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that leadership in today's world requires a wide range of&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/emma-brudner/the-top-5-soft-skills-of-2020-how-to-develop-them.html\">soft skills</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Employees don't want to work for inauthentic&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/heidi-zak/the-2-things-you-need-as-a-founder-to-have-a-healthy-relationship-with-your-board-of-directors.html\">founders</a>, executives, or managers. Team members don't feel empowered when working with people who don't have a reasonable level of emotional intelligence. Partners, vendors, and clients don't want to be associated with companies that aren't transparent about the way they do business — and the masses don't want to support companies whose actions don't align with their mission statements.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Being an effective leader today, and especially while navigating our \"new normal,\" is about honesty, plain and simple. It means being honest in your day-to-day interactions, honest in the way you do business, and honest about the status of the organization. As many leaders learned back in March (including myself), these are not easy times to navigate — but being open and transparent with your team is crucial to long-term success.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Personally, I believe the coronavirus crisis will change the way people think about leadership forever.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here's what I think being an effective&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/202009/tom-foster/simon-sinek-daymond-john-kendra-scott-business-advice.html?cid=search&_ga=2.91017434.1970114794.1598279515-2120289157.15956026672667\">leader</a>&#160;in our new normal&#160;will look like, moving forward.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">1. Leaders must be proactive in their efforts, and deeply care about how the people around them are doing</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">When you work in an office, you can generally assess when somebody is having a bad day&#160;or if they're upset about something.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Digitally, this becomes much harder. Both at the leadership level as well as the managerial level, we have to be more thoughtful about how we check in on people. This means proactively asking questions like, \"How are you doing these days?\" and actually taking the time to listen.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of hopping on a Zoom call and immediately diving into work-related items, take a moment to show you care.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">2. Leaders need to share how they're feeling, as well</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Transparency in any organization is important.</p><p>But when everyone is working remotely, as difficult as it can be to get a read on how your employees and team members are feeling, it can be even more difficult for them to get a read on how you're doing — since they don't get to see you walking around the office.</p><p>I'm not advocating for oversharing, but especially with your executive team, I do believe it's important to be open and honest about your own feelings as well. I remember back in March, prior to letting people from our company go, I cried while talking to our leadership team. I was really upset, and felt horrible about the decision in front of us. And the other leaders within the company went down that emotional journey with me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Being an effective leader doesn't mean being emotionless.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It means having the capacity for the whole range of emotions, and still being able to make sound, logical decisions for the business.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">3. Leaders must create a safe environment where people feel a sense of belonging.</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the questions we ask in our employee surveys is whether they feel that their manager cares about them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Personally, I believe everyone finds fulfillment in their work only if they believe the people around them care about them as human beings, first. As a leader, it's then your job to create an environment where people feel this sense of belonging, and know that the hours they spend working toward the company's mission mean more than just earning a paycheck.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">4. Leaders have to solidify their mission — and live it out in the world</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Now more than ever, the mission of a company matters. Customers care about it. Employees care about it. Investors care about it. Everyone wants to know that where they are putting their time, energy, money, and support is behind an organization they believe is impacting the world in some sort of positive way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Second, and as more and more social impact campaigns shift the world, how your company's mission fits into these larger narratives of humanity can dramatically change the way people see your brand.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your mission, and how it ties into current events, is extremely important.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">5. Leaders must be willing to adapt</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">In a world of uncertainty, adaptability is key. It has always been true that leaders must constantly be thinking 10 steps ahead. But during a global crisis like COVID-19, flexibility and being able to make quick, informed decisions is crucial to keeping the business moving forward.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This means making it a regular priority to sit down and run through hypotheticals. \"What would happen to the business if X happened? What would we do if we lost Y? How would we think about the future if we couldn't do Z?\"&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's far better to have answers to these types of questions before, rather than during, a difficult time.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">6. Leaders have to remain optimistic about the future, without sugarcoating the present</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Building a company inherently requires some level of optimism. It's very difficult to build something that doesn't exist yet if you're a pessimist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once a company is off and running, though, the optimism can't stop. Your team needs it. Your co-captains and fellow leaders need it. Everyone around you needs to feel as though they can see the light at the end of the tunnel, just like you can.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That said, you also have to guard optimism from delusion. Being optimistic can't mean lying to or deceiving those around you — or especially yourself. Instead, it means being brutally honest, while at the same time acknowledging both the good and the bad, the lessons learned, and the growth to come.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">7. Leaders must overcommunicate</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Right now, especially, every leader should be overcommunicating with their teams.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the one hand, this means making sure people are receiving the information they need, when they need it. While working remotely, this might require you to do more frequent check-ins with employees&#160;or to set&#160;reminders to send status updates to key decision makers every day on Slack.&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the flipside, though, effective communication also means leaving room for others to speak up. For example, I held an all-hands recently and ended the meeting by asking, \"Does anyone have any questions?\" I let that question hang in the air for 20 or 30 seconds. And it took a while, but eventually someone spoke up and asked a great question. Digitally, creating space for this type of serendipity is crucial — and asks leaders to pause and not be so quick to just end the Zoom meeting and move on to the next thing.</p><div
