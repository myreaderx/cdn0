As the cheering section moves to the couch, everyone is asking the age-old question: “What channel is the game on?”</p><p>So today we’re adding new features to Google Search in the U.S. to help you quickly find the live games you're looking for. And when the game is over, we’re here to help you discover live TV shows or movies that you may like too.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Where to watch live sports</h3><p>Now when you come to Search looking for your favorite team, you’ll see live TV options for MLB and NBA games (and we’ll be integrating more leagues in the future). Search for “where to watch the Clippers game” or “how to watch the A’s game,” on your phone and you’ll easily find information on how to tune in across a variety of services where the game may be available.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Where_2_Watch_Sports_GIF_NBA.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/E699_Where_2_Watch_Sports_GIF_NBA_Blog_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>You can also find live TV options by searching for the individual team or game. For example, if you search for “Dodgers game,” you’ll see all of our usual game day features like live scores, top stories, and standings, but you’ll now see a new “Live on” button which shows the live TV options in your area.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Where 2 Watch Sports MLB.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/gif_2.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Blackout restrictions may apply.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>This feature currently includes a variety of cable and network channels, and we'll expand to more digital streaming options soon.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>But what about other live TV shows?</h3><p>We also want to help you find other shows and movies that are on linear television. Last year, we added a new way to <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-what-to-watch\">find TV shows and movie recommendations</a> in Search so you can easily decide on what to watch next. Starting this week, we’re enhancing this feature by adding carousels of live content from cable and broadcast providers. These recommendations will show content on live TV so you can keep track of everything that’s available to you.</p><p>When you search for things like “what to watch” or “good shows to watch” on mobile, you’ll now have visibility into both streaming and live TV shows. Our “On TV now” carousel shows you programming across multiple channels that’s currently airing, while “On TV later” shows you recommendations for future programming. So when it’s Sunday night and you just can’t decide what to watch before the week begins, Search is here to help.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"W2W_Live_TV.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/W2W_Live_TV_Blog_Static2x_2_1.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Availability of content varies by country and language. </p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Whether you’re searching for your favorite comedy show or your favorite basketball team, we want you to have all the information you need to enjoy TV night.

At Google, we’re honored to work on tools that lighten the load for teachers, school leaders, families, and especially the students who have navigated learning from home with grace and resilience. </p><p>As educators worldwide have reinvented their practice online, we’re also adapting our tools to meet the evolving needs of their new educational landscape. This year, we’re taking a virtual approach to “back to school” with <a href=\"https://educationonair.withgoogle.com/events/anywhereschool2020\">The Anywhere School</a>, bringing Google for Education announcements to hundreds of thousands of viewers in more than 250 countries around the world. </p><p>Inspired by your feedback, we’re sharing over 50 new features across Meet, Classroom, G Suite and other products. Check out <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-2020\">our other posts</a> for deeper dives into the features, and continue to <a href=\"http://goo.gle/theanywhereschool\">watch the keynote sessions</a>, which are running live for the next 24 hours and will be available on demand if you need to catch up later. Here’s a birds-eye view of what’s coming. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>A safer, more engaging Meet experience</h3><p>Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/new-meet-features-for-edu/\">announced new features</a> coming to Google Meet to improve moderation and engagement. Today, we’re sharing <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">more details</a> about these upcoming launches and when they’ll be available. Here are a few highlights:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>In September, we’ll kick off with a larger tiled view of up to 49 people and an integrated Jamboard whiteboard for collaboration. We’ll also release new controls so moderators can choose to always join first, end meetings for all participants, disable in-meeting chat, and much more.</p></li><li><p>In October, we’ll launch custom and blurred backgrounds to provide some extra privacy. Breakout rooms and attendance tracking will also be launching for all Google Enterprise for Education customers, allowing for more engaged classes and insights on participation.</p></li><li><p>Later this year, we’re rolling out hand raising for all customers and Q&amp;A and polling for G Suite Enterprise for Education customers. Plus, we’ll launch a new temporary recordings feature which will be available to all Education customers for free (premium recordings will still be part of G Suite Enterprise for Education). </p></li></ul><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Better support for students, educators and admins in Classroom</h3><p>With more teachers around the world using Classroom more than ever before, we’re working to make Classroom simpler and more efficient with <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">new features</a>.  </p><ul><li>A new to-do widget on the Classes page will help students see what’s coming up, what’s missing, and what’s been graded. </li><li>Teachers can now share a link to invite students to their class, which makes joining a class much easier. </li><li>Classroom will soon be available in 10 additional languages, for 54 languages total.</li></ul><p>Classroom also gives you access to originality reports, which are now better than ever. For example, educators can soon run originality reports five times per course (up from three previously). And with G Suite Enterprise for Education, educators will be able to see matches for potential plagiarism not only against webpages, but between student submissions at their school. <br/></p><p>We’re giving <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/back-to-school-gfe-admins\">admins more powerful tools</a> to manage G Suite and Classroom. For example, school leaders with Enterprise licenses will have greater visibility into Classroom usage via new Data Studio dashboards, which allow admins to see active classes, measure feature adoption, and monitor teacher and student engagement. To support teachers and admins, we’re making it easier to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9356588?hl=en\">sync Classroom grades</a> with a push to your Student Information System (SIS), starting with Infinite Campus customers (and more SIS to come). <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/the-anywhere-school-meet-classroom-updates\">Keep reading</a> for more details on what’s new in Classroom.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Enhance your learning management system with Assignments</h3>Our newest product for non-Classroom users is <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/assignments-originality-reports-updates\">Assignments,</a> an application for your learning management system (LMS) that gives educators a faster, simpler way to distribute, analyze and grade student work. This time-saving application helps educators automatically create and distribute personalized copies of classwork to each student's Google Drive folder, quickly provide feedback, and keep grading consistent and transparent with originality reports. Assignments is compatible with any LMS that supports LTI 1.1 and higher such as Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard and more. <br/></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Help students turn in their best work with Docs</h3><p>We recently launched <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/06/google-docs-assistive-writing-autocorrect-smart-compose-education.html\">SmartCompose and Auto Correct</a> in Docs for educators and students. This will help them compose high-quality content faster by cutting back on repetitive writing, while reducing the chance of spelling and grammatical errors (by the end of this month, admins will be able to disable both SmartCompose and Auto Correct if they choose). Soon we’re also launching citations so students can format and manage their sources directly in Docs. With the citations tool, after adding the relevant attributes for a source, students can insert formatted in-text citations or a bibliography.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>New resources and tools that continue to support families</h3><p>As many parents and guardians supported their childrens’ learning from home this year, we heard about a big need for more resources and training for families on Google’s tools. To help, we’ve created the <a href=\"http://goo.gle/techtoolkit-families\">Tech Toolkit for Families and Guardians</a>, which helps parents better understand the technology that their kids use in the classroom. Plus, we’ve added <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9900467?hl=en\">school accounts to Chrome OS</a> so students can access Classroom and their school files while having the safety net of Family Link. We’re sharing many more product <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/parents-become-teachers\">updates for families here.</a></p><p>Finally, educators can find free training, resources, and professional development programs like the new <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/teacher-center/programs/certified-coach/?modal_active=none\">Certified Coach program</a> to support them as they use these tools and features in their classroom in the new <a href=\"http://g.co/teachercenter\">Teacher Center</a>. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Moving forward together</h3><p>There’s so much more to share with you about what’s coming to Google for Education, and we encourage you to take some time to <a href=\"http://goo.gle/theanywhereschool\">watch the keynote sessions</a> from The Anywhere School event for all the updates. </p><br/><p>Most importantly, thank you for your partnership. We’re grateful for the insights you’ve shared with us, and we’ll continue to evolve our products to meet the unique needs of this moment. By working together, we can provide students with the education they deserve, no matter where it’s taking place.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/eOiilRH7jlk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/039-B2S-Blog-1-Best-of-Back-to-School-SL-v1.gif","linkMd5":"93d96a99700a5e4071673a7f0cda122f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/19/14-23-03-361_73192fec613f7c7e.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/039-B2S-Blog-1-Best-of-Back-to-School-SL-v1.gif","destWidth":2880,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":20374836,"destBytes":1643618,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/eOiilRH7jlk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn69@2020_4/2020/08/19/14-22-46-211_e44bed9a86a00d4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1597846941744},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 22:22:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 22:22:21","title":"Find jobs, recipes and products more easily on Search","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/find-jobs-recipes-and-products-more-easily-search/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Do you ever find yourself turning to Search again and again for the same question or topic?
