He was against de-segregation. He has voted for war over and over. He is a fiscal conservative in the worst way (aka. has often talked of cutting Social Security and Medicare.) He was for the crime bills of the 90s and a driving force behind the bankruptcy bill which made it impossible to discharge student loans, thus causing the current student loan crisis. He has said many good things about the environment lately, but he has also said he will not ban fracking. In terms of his actual record, about the only high point is his work against violence on women….</p> \n <p class=\"\">In terms of the economy, Biden is likely to bow to the deficit myth. Especially if Republicans hold the Senate (most likely), he will struggle to get money for his priorities, but worse, his career has generally shown him to be a fairly standard Democratic centrist who believes that only Republicans have the right to spend large amounts of money and that Democrats should reduce the deficit and instead of spend, rely on tax cuts. At worst Biden may be willing to cut a deal to reduce Social Security and Medicare benefits to “fix” the deficit. (This is nonsense, but it is nonsense Biden has believed his entire career.)</p> \n <p class=\"\">….One can assume that a Biden administraiton will generally be more technocratically competent. I expect the Covid response to improve significantly, for example, though stubborn red state governors and legislatures will remain a problem. Trump’s propaganda that masks don’t work; Covid is no big deal and that the closures are the problem, not the disease, will remain a huge issue crippling any American response, as will fears and refusal to take vaccines.</p> \n <p>Getting any large aid bill through Congress will be nearly impossible if Democrats don’t retake the Senate, for the simple reason that there’s no reason for Republicans to give Democrats a win like that.</p> \n <p>The great fear of a Biden administration, and why I only reluctantly supported Biden, is that he will start a new war….</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/07/joe-biden-cabinet-picks-possible-choices-433431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/07/joe-biden-cabinet-picks-possible-choices-433431\" data-original-title=\"\">Meet the contenders for Biden’s Cabinet</a></p> \n<p>[Politico 11-07-20]</p> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/11/what-it-took-the-price-of-democrat-victory-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/11/what-it-took-the-price-of-democrat-victory-2020.html\" data-original-title=\"\">“What It Took”: The Price of Democrat Victory in 2020</a></p> \n<p>Lambert Strether,&nbsp;November 9, 2020 [Naked Capitalism]</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>1)The Professional Managerial Class (PMC) attained class consciousness.</p> \n <p>2)&nbsp;The PMC was and is embubbled by a domestic psyop.</p> \n <p>3)&nbsp;The press replaced reporting with advocacy.</p> \n <p>4)&nbsp;Election legitimacy is determined by extra-Constitutional actors.</p> \n <p>5)&nbsp;“Fascism” became an empty signifier, not an analytical tool.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"\"><strong>The First 100 Days</strong></p> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/election-executive-actions-democratic-presidency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/election-executive-actions-democratic-presidency/\" data-original-title=\"\">The Day One Agenda: Now More Than Ever</a></p> \n<p>David Dayen, November 12, 2020 [The American Prospect]</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Without signing a single new law, the next president can lower prescription drug prices, cancel student debt, break up the big banks, give everybody who wants one a bank account, counteract the dominance of monopoly power, protect farmers from price discrimination and unfair dealing, force divestment from fossil fuel projects, close a slew of tax loopholes, hold crooked CEOs accountable, mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, allow the effective legalization of marijuana, make it easier for 800,000 workers to join a union, and much, much more.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"\"><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ianwelsh.net/america-can-have-a-boom-economy-six-months-from-whenever-it-gets-serious/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-original-title=\"\">America Can Have A Boom Economy Six Months From Whenever It Gets Serious</a></p> \n<p class=\"\">Ian Welsh, November 13, 2020</p> \n<p class=\"\"><em>The solutions are so damn obvious and so easy…. which makes the centrists’ lack of interest even more maddening.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p class=\"\"><em>….</em>we have been unable to accomplish anything important for over 50 years.

The Federal government effectively guarantees all mortgages; it sets the norms. You state that no mortgage is considered conforming starting in a year to three years if it doesn’t meet the new standards.&nbsp;You then offer the funds for the refit. This isn’t a gift, it is paid out of savings on utilities: half to the building owner so they win, half to the government. If you insist on doing this thru financial markets, then half goes to the entity who puts up the fund….</p> \n <p>There are a bunch of other things to do (for example, rebuild wetlands around cities and on the coast; build sea walls around cities which are too low, blah, blah), but the point should be obvious by now: you can help the environment, produce a massive number of jobs and create an economic boom. It isn’t hard (though it is complicated) you simply have to have the will to do it.&nbsp;Further, if you can get it going, it will soon have massive support because it will create a truly good economy for the first time in 50 odd years.

Heather Cox Richardson provides the details of this in her book,</em>&nbsp;How the South Won the Civil War: Oligarchy, Democracy, and the Continuing Fight for America <em>(Oxford University Press, 2020):<br /> </em></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p><em>In 1951, William F. Buckley Jr., a devout Catholic fresh out of Yale, the son of an oilman, suggested a new approach to destroying the liberal consensus. In God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of ‘Academic Freedom,” Buckley suggested that the whole idea that people would, make good decisions through argument based on evidence—the Enlightenment idea that had shaped America since its founding—was wrong. Had that been true, Americans would not have kept supporting the government activism launched by the New Deal. Americans’ faith in reasoned debate was a worse “superstition,’,’ he said, than the superstitions the Enlightenment had set out to replace.”</em></p> \n <p><em>Rather than continuing to try to change people’s beliefs through evidence-based arguments, he said, those opposed to the New Deal should, stand firm on an “orthodoxy” of religion and individualism’ and refuse to accept any questioning of those two fundamental principles. Buckley’s book showed how this should be done. Rather than making a reasoned argument that fairly presented others’ positions, it misrepresented the views of the professors with whom Buckley disagreed, claimed that the wealthy white Yale-educated Buckley was a ‘member of a persecuted minority, and smeared supporters of the liberal consensus as the tools of socialists and atheists.

In occupations ranging from home health aide to journalist and sandwich shop worker, employers have used this legal power to their great benefit. Non-compete clauses reduce worker mobility, help employers keep wages and wage growth down, deter small business formation, entrench potentially abusive, discriminatory, or hostile work environments, and fortify market power to the detriment of workers, rivals, consumers, and broader society…. Non-competes are merely one example of abusive contractual terms that the legal system has condoned or tolerated. Other terms, such as mandatory arbitration, class action waivers, confessions of judgment, and unilateral modification, reflect a ubiquitous economic and political problem. Corporations use these contractual terms to unilaterally rob consumers, suppliers, and workers of a wide range of constitutional and statutory rights. Like non-competes, these contractual terms are established in an environment of radical inequality between a corporation and a worker, consumer, or small business and are often contingent and non-salient to the person or business who must accept them. The result of these contracts of dispossession is the loss of legal recourse for wrongdoing, loss of possessions, and the imposition of unaccountable private governments.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/economy/california-prop-15-property-tax.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/economy/california-prop-15-property-tax.html\" data-original-title=\"\">“California’s 40-Year-Old Tax Revolt Survives a Counterattack” </a></p> \n<p>[ New York Times, via Naked Capitalism Water Cooler 11-11-20]</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“The new law, Proposition 15, would have removed commercial properties like office buildings and industrial parks from Proposition 13’s limits, and it would have given labor and progressive groups a long-sought victory to increase funding for education and local services.

And, again, the quick efforts by these companies to spin the narrative as something about protecting employee freedom and independence, and protecting flexibility, have really provided the type of misdirection that has prevented people from realizing that, exactly as you described, the proposition contains a 7/8ths supermajority vote requirement. So&nbsp;if the legislature in the future wants to expand rights for these workers, or wants to ensure that some other protections are provided, they will be unable to do so unless they get a 7/8ths majority vote of the state legislature. And I heard somebody say something pretty funny, but horrible in this situation, that you couldn’t get a 7/8ths majority vote for a Happy Mother’s Day Proclamation from the state legislature. So it’s difficult to imagine important social legislation protecting workers passing by that threshold in our current legislature. And the other thing that it does, that I also think was underreported, was the fact that&nbsp;it now preempts, or cancels, any local law that would protect workers, and regulate things like local wages, access to tips or insurance requirements for drivers: All the things that local governments are best suited to do in their jurisdiction, they now do not have the power to do it, because the ballot initiative preempts those laws. So they’ve essentially knocked out any way to change the law from the top, or any way to improve it from localities on the ground. That’s why we’ve described it as an attempt to essentially deregulate these industries, and at least as of Tuesday, they were successful, but I don’t think the fight ends there.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gd85/bidens-transition-team-is-stuffed-with-amazon-uber-lyft-and-airbnb-personnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gd85/bidens-transition-team-is-stuffed-with-amazon-uber-lyft-and-airbnb-personnel\" data-original-title=\"\">Biden’s Transition Team Is Stuffed With Amazon, Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb Personnel</a></p> \n<p>[Vice, via Naked Capitalism 11-13-20]</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\">….such as Bridget Dooling, a professor at George Washington who works out of the “non-partisan” Koch-funded Regulatory Studies Center who&nbsp;<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/koch-cog-rsc/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/koch-cog-rsc/\" data-original-title=\"\">conjures academic research</a>&nbsp;defending the deregulation of the fossil fuel industry.</span></p> \n <p><span data-component=\"TextBlock\">Staffing a transition team with lobbyists and tech insiders (even ones with a lot of government experience) certainly cuts against the message that Biden is leading an effort to bolster labor and bring Silicon Valley to heel.

Our analysis found that 97% of the 2,300 employees would have been better off with the other plan, which had lower premiums but higher cost-sharing. Yet 23% chose the higher-premium plan anyway.

The more I thought about it the more I realized how important the Friday cash requests are to the movement. When someone is in a bind what choice do they have? Too often it is go to a Pay Day Lender.

Joe Biden’s win is not a healing; it’s a reprieve. Now, not later, is the time to make that very clear both to ourselves and to him. The Democratic Party has no basis for self-congratulations at this point. When your opponent is a neo-fascist who has more in common with Mussolini than with Lincoln and has supervised the death of almost a quarter-million Americans, yet all you can do is beat him by a razor-thin margin, that is not a sign that things are going well.

There are two basic prongs to this; let’s address them both in turn. (1). Biden’s supposed advantages over Sanders have proven to be grossly overstated. One major argument for Biden, promoted by everyone from his campaign to Lincoln Project / Never-Trump pundits, was that his candidacy would be uniquely appealing to conservatives and Republicans…. Despite highly publicized defections from Trump among elites and a historically unprecedented outreach campaign to Republicans and conservatives, Joe Biden has performed&nbsp;<em>worse</em>&nbsp;among these groups than Hillary Clinton did in 2016…. (2). Biden’s weaknesses were Sanders’s strengths… Biden may have slightly improved on Clinton’s poor showing with poor voters, but he is still significantly underperforming the standard set by Obama in previous years. We have good reason to believe that Sanders — running on a platform of single payer healthcare, generous welfare benefits, and other programs aimed specifically at the poor – would have fared much better…. Note that Sanders also had a higher proportion of voters among the middle income bracket: the group where Biden overperformed, winning a 13 point margin among voters that Democrats have lost since 2008. Meanwhile, the only income group that Biden tended to fare better among — the wealthiest — is the group that he lost to Trump by a decisive 11 points. These numbers correspond directly with standard socialist intuitions about how a Sanders campaign would have played out. He would have run on class war, running up his margins among the poor and middle income brackets (IE, the overwhelming majority of voters) while boxing Trump in among the wealthiest voters. … Sanders also performed strongly among another major voting group that Biden struggled with: Latinos.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ianwelsh.net/the-good-scenario-for-americas-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-original-title=\"\">The Good Scenario For America’s Future</a></p> \n<p class=\"\">Ian Welsh, November 10, 2020</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p class=\"\">So, the default scenario is that Biden rules for 4 to 8 years, maybe Harris for another 4, then we get a more disciplined right wing “populist.” In the meantime, nothing that will actually change the trend-lines has been done about climate change or the continued concentration of wealth and power. America continues to be divided into two tribes who hate each other, while the West as a whole stagnates under neoliberalism….</p> \n <p>What’s the good scenario for the United States?</p> \n <p>AOC, basically. In 2022 she takes out Schumer and becomes a Senator. In 2024 she primaries Biden or Harris and wins.&nbsp;AOC is popular, Schumer is a lame duck. If she goes for him, I give her the nod to win. Having taken out the Senate leader, she looks unstoppable.</p> \n <p>The primary will be extremely difficult to win. Obama, Clinton, Clyburn and all the usual suspects will do everything they can to cheat her of a win, just as they did with Sanders twice. But AOC is clearly Bernie’s heir, having saved his bacon when he had a heart-attack, and never having betrayed him as Warren did. Unlike Sanders, she is genuinely charismatic, and like him she will pack massive arenas and have huge support from the grassroots and activists….</p> \n <p>Then we come to the general election. Contrary to what centrists claim, progressives running on Medicare-4-All did very well in this election, as did policies like a $15/hour wage. An aggressively progressive platform, with concrete job promises so people know where they go when fracking goes away, can win. A real Green New Deal offers tens of millions of good jobs….&nbsp;In fact, I see the primary as a bigger problem than the General: if AOC gets the nomination, she’s likely to win, because she can run both against unpopular Democratic politics and Republican ones. Running on an actual popular program, she stands a good chance of controlling both the House and Senate.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/democratic-party-blame-the-left-lackluster-election-results-down-ballot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/democratic-party-blame-the-left-lackluster-election-results-down-ballot\" data-original-title=\"\">“Democrats Can’t Blame the Left for Their Lackluster Election Results” </a></p> \n<p>[<a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/democratic-party-blame-the-left-lackluster-election-results-down-ballot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/democratic-party-blame-the-left-lackluster-election-results-down-ballot\">Jacobin</a>, via Naked Capitalism Water Cooler 11-13-20]</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>“Had Democrats delivered the landslide many were promising right up until election day, it’s not difficult to imagine the conclusions that would have ensued.

Most people, when they think of powerful politicians from Kentucky, think of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who over the last decade or so has singlehandedly reshaped how Congress functions, and has all but ensured the prioritization of corporate interests within the federal judiciary.&nbsp;<em>So you’re telling me there’s another powerful congressman from Kentucky who has control over virtually every aspect of my life?</em>&nbsp;That is indeed what I’m telling you, my friend, and it’s no coincidence that both of these men come from the mostly rural state of Kentucky…. As the nation’s rural regions experienced deindustrialization, out-migration, drug-assisted suicide, or a combination of all the above over the last three or four decades, rural elites had to figure out a way to maintain control over their constituents.
