Cells became to biology what atoms were to chemistry. Biology ushered in the revelation that every cell belonging to me as good &#8212; as healthy, as vital, as fit for replication &#8212; belongs to you.  </p>\n<p>That delicate interdependence of life and lives, with its tangled roots in biology and cultural history, is what <strong>Eula Biss</strong> explores in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Immunity-Inoculation-Eula-Biss/dp/1555976891/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>On Immunity: An Inoculation</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-immunity-an-inoculation/oclc/1146587404&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a book of penetrating and poetic insight, drawn with that rare scholarship capable of correcting the warped cultural hindsight we call history; a book of staggering foresight, conceived in the wake of the H1N1 flu pandemic, yet speaking with astonishing prescience to the complex epidemiological realities and social dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic unfolding more than five years after its publication.   </p>\n<p>For Biss &#8212; the daughter of a medical scientist and a poet &#8212; even her own biological inheritance as a universal donor with type O negative blood becomes a potent metaphor for the mechanism of vaccination, a lens through which to view the permeable membrane between the biological and social realities of immunity. With an eye to the blood banks that collect her donations to save other lives, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we imagine the action of a vaccine not just in terms of how it affects a single body, but also in terms of how it affects the collective body of a community, it is fair to think of vaccination as a kind of banking of immunity. Contributions to this bank are donations to those who cannot or will not be protected by their own immunity. This is the principle of <em>herd immunity</em>, and it is through herd immunity that mass vaccination becomes far more effective than individual vaccination.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is a rather unfortunate term for an unassailable scientific principle &#8212; we humans, especially in this culture of rugged individualism nursed on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/06/emerson-self-reliance/\">the Emersonian ideal of self-reliance</a>, bristle at thinking of ourselves as members of a herd. In our <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/16/thinking-with-animals-lorainne-daston-gregg-mitman/\">long history of thinking with animals</a>, herd animals have been the butt of our derogatory metaphors for mindless conformity. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_49569\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/14/louis-i-king-of-the-sheep-olivier-tallec/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/louisi_tallec00.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Art by Olivier Tallec from Louis I, King of the Sheep\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Olivier Tallec from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/14/louis-i-king-of-the-sheep-olivier-tallec/\"><em>Louis I, King of the Sheep</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>And yet inside the unfortunate linguistic container, an unfaltering biological reality resides: On large enough a scale, even a fairy ineffective vaccine that fails to produce immunity in some individuals will slow down the spread of infection in the community; as the virus fails to replicate itself in more and more new hosts, the vaccine will eventually halt it altogether. In consequence, even such a mediocre vaccine will protect all members of the community, even those for whom inoculation has not worked as intended on the individual level. This is why it is more dangerous to be the vaccinated animal amid a largely unvaccinated herd than the other way around. Biss writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The unvaccinated person is protected by the bodies around her, bodies through which disease is not circulating. But a vaccinated person surrounded by bodies that host disease is left vulnerable to vaccine failure or fading immunity. We are protected not so much by our own skin, but by what is beyond it. The boundaries between our bodies begin to dissolve here. Donations of blood and organs move between us, exiting one body and entering another, and so too with immunity, which is a common trust as much as it is a private account. Those of us who draw on collective immunity owe our health to our neighbors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With an eye to the origin of herd immunity theory &#8212; a theory developed in the 1840s by a doctor treating smallpox, which has taken manyfold more human lives than any other infectious disease in the history of our species and which has since been eradicated &#8212; Biss proposes an alternative, both more poetic and more precise, to the imperfect term that so perfectly describes the biosocial reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Herd immunity, an observable phenomenon, now seems implausible only if we think of our bodies as inherently disconnected from other bodies. Which, of course, we do. </p>\n<p>The very expression <em>herd immunity</em> suggests that we are cattle, waiting, perhaps, to be sent to slaughter. And it invites an unfortunate association with the term <em>herd mentality</em>, a stampede toward stupidity. The herd, we assume, is foolish. Those of us who eschew the herd mentality tend to prefer a frontier mentality in which we imagine our bodies as isolated homesteads that we tend either well or badly. The health of the homestead next to ours does not affect us, this thinking suggests, so long as ours is well tended. </p>\n<p>If we were to exchange the metaphor of the herd for a hive, perhaps the concept of shared immunity might be more appealing. Honeybees are matriarchal, environmental do-gooders who also happen to be entirely interdependent. The health of any individual bee, as we know from the recent epidemic of colony collapse, depends on the health of the hive.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/paul-sougy-the-bee-1962-proceeds-benefit-the-nature-conservancy_print?sku=s6-11999106p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?resize=680%2C879&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"879\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-69321\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?resize=240%2C310&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?resize=320%2C414&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?resize=768%2C993&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_bee.jpg?resize=600%2C776&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diagram of bee anatomy by French artist Paul Sougy, 1962.

Preying on the understandable human impulse toward concretizing blame for amorphous and ambiguous problems, the theory went viral before multiple subsequent studies debunked his results, before it was exposed that Wakefield was paid for his research by a lawyer readying a lawsuit against a vaccine maker, before the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom concluded its investigation with the verdict that Wakefield had been “irresponsible and dishonest” in conducting and publishing his work.</p>\n<p>Despite the scientific and ethical denunciation of Wakefield&#8217;s study, its ideological meme had already spread beyond retrieval. (Richard Dawkins coined the word <em>meme</em> in 1976 by <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/02/richard-dawkins-meme-appetite-for-wonder/\">borrowing from biology</a> &#8212; a word that came alive anew a quarter century later in the context of &#8220;viral&#8221; content on the internet, which has its own roots in epidemiology.) A quarter century later, echoes of Wakefield&#8217;s disproven falsehoods bellow with formidable vocality. That group of voices is often referred to as the anti-vaccination movement, but I find the term <em>movement</em> extremely ill-suited &#8212; such groupthink is not in movement but static, frozen in time and frozen with fear, petrified in the cultural amber of a time before the Age of Reason and lashed about by the same errors of magical thinking, willful blindness, and confusion of causation and correlation that made our medieval ancestors take comets for indisputable omens of future events and left-handedness for indisputable evidence of possession by the Devil. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-the-comet-book-15872417711_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?resize=680%2C798&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"798\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59410\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?resize=240%2C282&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?resize=320%2C375&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?resize=768%2C901&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/comet9.jpg?resize=600%2C704&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/11/kometenbuch-the-comet-book/\"><em>The Comet Book</em></a>, 1587.

And it can be occupied by those who choose not to carry immunity. For some&#8230; a refusal to vaccinate falls under a broader resistance to capitalism. But refusing immunity as a form of civil disobedience bears an unsettling resemblance to the very structure the Occupy movement seeks to disrupt &#8212; a privileged 1 percent are sheltered from risk while they draw resources from the other 99 percent.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>We are justified in feeling threatened by the unlimited expansion of industry, and we are justified in fearing that our interests are secondary to corporate interests. But refusal of vaccination undermines a system that is not actually typical of capitalism. It is a system in which both the burdens and the benefits are shared across the entire population. Vaccination allows us to use the products of capitalism for purposes that are counter to the pressures of capital.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73007\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?w=2362&#38;ssl=1 2362w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C768&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/honeybee_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Emissary</em> by Maria Popova</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a lovely antidote to the tragic human tendency toward cynicism &#8212; that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/09/hope-cynicism/\"> touchingly misguided and ineffective effort at self-protection</a>, that particularly virulent <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/21/caitlin-moran-cynicism/\">strain of cowardice</a> to which our culture has grown increasingly hospitable as it has grown increasingly impatient with the slow and vulnerable work of nuance &#8212; Biss adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That so many of us find it entirely plausible that a vast network of researchers and health officials and doctors worldwide would willfully harm children for money is evidence of what capitalism is really taking from us.

A generation later, another trailblazing woman of uncommon poetic sensibility and intimate relationship to the land echoed the sentiment in her own art, into her native canyons of the American Southwest: &#8220;It&#8217;s true that landscape forms the mind. If I stand here long enough I&#8217;ll learn how to sing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 1989, long before she became Poet Laureate of the United States, <strong>Joy Harjo</strong> entwined visions with the astronomer and photographer <a href=\"https://www.stephenstrom.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stephen Strom</a> in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Center-World-Sun-Tracks/dp/0816511136/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Secrets from the Center of the World</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/secrets-from-the-center-of-the-world/oclc/634091116&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a  slender, splendid installment in the University of Arizona&#8217;s wonderful <em>Sun Tracks</em> series, celebrating Native American literary art long before Native representation rose to the fore of the American mainstream, long before the English language awakened to how deeply its etymological reliance on the Earth permeates words as mundane as <em>mainstream</em>.</p>\n<p>Emerging from the lovely call-and-response between Strom&#8217;s photographs and Harjo&#8217;s short lyrical reflection is a subtle meditation on the interpenetration of place and mind, of landscape and the human spirit. Contemplating the ochre canyons and the golden valleys, the pleated sierras and the billowing mudhills, the frosty branches of the winter trees and the summer-blazed strata of sandstone, she unfolds the origami of deep time into a note some ghost-mother left for her ghost-child long ago on the edge of the kitchen table, on the edge of the world, inscribed with the meaning of being human.  </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73058\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Center-World-Sun-Tracks/dp/0816511136/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BluffHogan.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73058\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BluffHogan.jpg?w=600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BluffHogan.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BluffHogan.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Abandoned hogan south of Bluff, UT</em> by <a href=\"https://www.stephenstrom.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stephen Strom</a></figcaption></figure>\n<blockquote><p>This land is a poem of ochre and burnt sand I could never write, unless paper were the sacrament of sky, and ink the broken line of wild horses staggering the horizon several miles away.

It vesselled in language that peculiar, ineffable way art has of bringing you closer to yourself by taking you out of yourself &#8212; its singular power to furnish, Iris Murdoch&#8217;s exquisite phrasing, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">&#8220;an occasion for unselfing.&#8221;</a> And yet this notion cinches the central paradox of art: Every artist makes what they make with the whole of who they are &#8212; with the totality of experiences, beliefs, impressions, obsessions, childhood confusions, heartbreaks, inner conflicts, and contradictions that constellate a self. To be an artist is to put this  combinatorial self in the service of furnishing occasions for unselfing in others. </p>\n<p>That may be why the lives of artists have such singular allure as case studies and models of turning the confusion, complexity, and uncertainty of life into something beautiful and lasting &#8212; something that harmonizes the disquietude and dissonance of living.</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/georgiaokeeffe3.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Red Hill and White Shell</em> by Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, 1938</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Funny-Weather-Emergency-Olivia-Laing/dp/132400570X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/funny-weather-art-in-an-emergency/oclc/1122876898&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), <strong>Olivia Laing</strong> &#8212; one of the handful of living writers whose mind and prose I enjoy commensurately with the Whitmans and the Woolfs of yore &#8212; occasions a rare gift of unselfing through the lives and worlds of painters, poets, filmmakers, novelists, and musicians who have imprinted culture in a profound way while living largely outside the standards and stabilities of society, embodying of James Baldwin&#8217;s piercing insight that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/20/james-baldwin-the-creative-process/\">&#8220;a society must assume that it is stable, but the artist must know, and he must let us know, that there is nothing stable under heaven.&#8221;</a> </p>\n<p>Punctuating these biographical sketches laced with larger questions about art and the human spirit are Laing&#8217;s personal essays reflecting, through the lens of her own lived experience, on existential questions of freedom, desire, loneliness, queerness, democracy, rebellion, abandonment, and the myriad vulnerable tendrils of aliveness that make life worth living. </p>\n<p>What emerges is a case for art as a truly human endeavor, made by human beings with bodies and identities and beliefs often at odds with the collective imperative; art as &#8220;a zone of both enchantment and resistance,&#8221; art as sentinel and witness of &#8220;how truth is made, diagramming the stages of its construction, or as it may be dissolution,&#8221; art as &#8220;a direct response to the paucity and hostility of the culture at large,&#8221; art as a buoy for loneliness and a fulcrum for empathy.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_60591\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/03/22/agnes-martin-happiness-river-of-live/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=680%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"683\" class=\"size-full wp-image-60591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=240%2C241&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=320%2C321&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=768%2C771&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=600%2C603&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=32%2C32&#38;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#38;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=64%2C64&#38;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=96%2C96&#38;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agnesmartin_summer1964.jpg?resize=128%2C128&#38;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Summer 1964</em> by Agnes Martin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Laing writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read Dickens. It’s work. What art does is provide material with which to think: new registers, new spaces. After that, friend, it’s up to you. </p>\n<p>I don’t think art has a duty to be beautiful or uplifting, and some of the work I’m most drawn to refuses to traffic in either of those qualities. What I care about more&#8230; are the ways in which it’s concerned with resistance and repair.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A writer &#8212; a good writer &#8212; cannot write about art without writing about those who make it, about the lives of artists as the crucible of their creative contribution, about the delicate, triumphant art of living as a body in the world and a soul outside standard society. Olivia Laing is an excellent writer. Out of lives as varied as those of Basquiat and Agnes Martin, Derek Jarman and Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, David Bowie and Joseph Cornell, she constructs an orrery of art as a cosmos of human connection and a sensemaking mechanism for living. </p>\n<p>In a sentiment to which I relate <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/01/figuring/\">in my own approach to historical lives</a>, Laing frames her method of inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m going as a scout, hunting for resources and ideas that might be liberating or sustaining now, and in the future. What drives all these essays is a long-standing interest in how a person can be free, and especially in how to find a freedom that is shareable, and not dependent upon the oppression or exclusion of other people.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>We’re so often told that art can’t really change anything. But I think it can. It shapes our ethical landscapes; it opens us to the interior lives of others. It is a training ground for possibility. It makes plain inequalities, and it offers other ways of living.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Throughout these short, scrumptiously insightful and sensitive essays, Laing draws on the lives of artists &#8212; the wildly uneven topographies of wildly diverse interior worlds &#8212; to contour new landscapes of possibility for life itself, as we each live it, around and through and with art. In the essay about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/georgia-okeeffe/\">Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe</a> &#8212; who revolutionized modern art <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/17/georgia-o-keeffe-letters-anita-pollitzer/\">while living alone and impoverished in the middle of the desert, in the middle of the world&#8217;s first global war</a> &#8212; Laing observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you make the most of what’s inside you, your talents and desires, when they slam you up against a wall of prejudice, of limiting beliefs about what a woman must be and an artist can do?</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>From the beginning, New Mexico represented salvation, though not in the wooden sense of the hill-dominating crosses she so often painted. O’Keeffe’s salvation was earthy, even pagan, comprised of the cold-water pleasure of working unceasingly at what you love, burning anxiety away beneath the desert sun.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66261\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?resize=680%2C1092&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1092\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66261\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?w=800&#38;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?resize=240%2C386&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?resize=320%2C514&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?resize=768%2C1234&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GeorgiaOkeeffe1925.jpg?resize=600%2C964&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, <em>Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow</em>, 1923 (Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe Museum)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In an essay about another artist &#8212; the painter Chantal Joffe, for whom Laing sat &#8212; she echoes Jackson Pollock&#8217;s&#8217;s observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/04/09/jackson-pollock-selden-rodman-conversations-with-artists/\">&#8220;every good artist paints what he is,&#8221;</a> and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can’t paint reality: you can only paint your own place in it, the view from your eyes, as manifested by your own hands.</p>\n<p>A painting betrays fantasies and feelings, it bestows beauty or takes it away; eventually, it supplants the body in history.

I didn’t agree. I think writing about other people, making art about other people, is both dangerous and necessary. There are moral lines. There are limits to the known. But there’s a difference between respecting people’s right to tell or not tell their own stories and refusing to look at all.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>It depends whether you believe that we exist primarily as categories of people, who cannot communicate across our differences, or whether you think we have a common life, an obligation to regard and learn about each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sense, the entire book is a quiet manifesto for unselfing through the art we make and the art we cherish &#8212; a subtle and steadfast act of resistance to the attrition of human connection under the cultural forces of self-righteousness and sanctimonious othering, a stance against those fashionable and corrosive forces that so often indict as appropriation the mere act of learning beautiful things from each other. </p>\n<p>In another essay &#8212; about Ali Smith, the subject to whom Laing feels, or at least reads, the closest &#8212; she quotes a kindred sentiment of Smith&#8217;s:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Art is one of the prime ways we have of opening ourselves and going beyond ourselves. That’s what art is, it’s the product of the human being in the world and imagination, all coming together. The irrepressibility of the life in the works, regardless of the times, the histories, the life stories, it’s like being given the world, its darks and lights. At which point we can go about the darks and lights with our imagination energised.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72064\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?resize=680%2C531&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"531\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72064\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?w=1566&#38;ssl=1 1566w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?resize=240%2C187&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?resize=320%2C250&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?resize=768%2C599&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?resize=600%2C468&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/josephcornell1.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joseph Cornell, <em>Untitled (Celestial Navigation)</em>, 1958. (U.S. Department of State / Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Among the subjects of a subset of essays Laing aptly categorizes as &#8220;love letters&#8221; is John Berger, whose lovely notion of &#8220;hospitality&#8221; radiates from Laing&#8217;s own work &#8212; a notion she defines as &#8220;a capacity to enlarge and open, a corrective to the overwhelming political imperative, in ascendance once again this decade, to wall off, separate and reject.&#8221; She reflects on being stopped up short by Berger&#8217;s embodiment of such hospitality when she saw him speak at the British Library at the end of his long, intellectually generous life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It struck me then how rare it is to see a writer on stage actually thinking, and how glib and polished most speakers are. For Berger, thought was work, as taxing and rewarding as physical labour, a bringing of something real into the world. You have to strive and sweat; the act is urgent but might also fail.</p>\n<p>He talked that evening about hospitality. It was such a Bergerish notion. Hospitality: the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers, a word that shares its origin with hospital, a place to treat sick or injured people. This impetus towards kindness and care for the sick and strange, the vulnerable and dispossessed is everywhere in Berger’s work, the sprawling orchard of words he planted and tended over the decades.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Art he saw as a communal and vital possession, to be written about with sensual exactness&#8230; Capitalism, he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/28/ways-of-seeing-john-berger/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a>, survives by forcing the majority to define their own interests as narrowly as possible. It was narrowness he set himself against, the toxic impulse to wall in or wall off. Be generous to the strange, be open to difference, cross-pollinate freely. He put his faith in the people, the whole host of us.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_58043\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/03/22/agnes-martin-happiness-river-of-live/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=680%2C693&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Agnes Martin, With My Back to the World, 1997\" width=\"680\" height=\"693\" class=\"size-full wp-image-58043\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=240%2C245&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=320%2C326&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=768%2C783&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=600%2C612&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=32%2C32&#38;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#38;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/agnesmartin_withmybacktotheworld.jpg?resize=64%2C64&#38;ssl=1 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>With My Back to the World</em> by Agnes Martin, 1997</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a superb 2015 essay titled &#8220;The Future of Loneliness&#8221; &#8212; an essay that bloomed into a book a year later, the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/07/11/the-lonely-city-olivia-laing/\">splendid and unclassifiable book</a> that first enchanted me with Laing&#8217;s writing and the mind from which it springs &#8212; she considers how technology is mediating our already uneasy relationship to loneliness, and how art redeems the simulacra of belonging with which social media entrap us in this Stockholm syndrome of self-regard. In a passage of chillingly intimate resonance to all of us alive in the age of screens and selfies and the vacant, addictive affirmation of people we have never dined with tapping heart- and thumb-shaped icons on cold LED screens, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Loneliness centres around the act of being seen. When a person is lonely, they long to be witnessed, accepted, desired, at the same time as becoming intensely wary of exposure. According to research carried out over the past decade at the University of Chicago, the feeling of loneliness triggers what psychologists term hypervigilance for social threat. In this state, which is entered into unknowingly, the individual becomes hyperalert to rejection, becoming inclined to perceive their social interactions as tinged with hostility or scorn. The result of this shift in perception is a vicious circle of withdrawal, in which the lonely person becomes increasingly suspicious, intensifying their sense of isolation.</p>\n<p>This is where online engagement seems to exercise its special charm. Hidden behind a computer screen, the lonely person has control. They can search for company without the danger of being revealed or found wanting. They can reach out or they can hide; they can lurk and they can show themselves, safe from the humiliation of face-to-face rejection. The screen acts as a kind of protective membrane, a scrim that permits invisibility and also transformation. You can filter your image, concealing unattractive elements, and you can emerge enhanced: an online avatar designed to attract likes. But now a problem arises, for the contact this produces is not quite the same thing as intimacy. Curating a perfected self might win followers or Facebook friends, but it will not necessarily cure loneliness, since the cure for loneliness is not being looked at, but being seen and accepted as a whole person: ugly, unhappy and awkward as well as radiant and selfie-ready.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/27/ulysses-mimmo-paladino/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ulysses_paladino1.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Mimmo Paladino for <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/27/ulysses-mimmo-paladino/\">a rare edition of James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having met with Ryan Trecartin &#8212; &#8220;a baby-faced thirty-four-year-old&#8221; of whom I had never heard (saying more about my odd nineteenth-century life than about his art) but whose early-twenty-first-century films about the lurid and discomposing thrill of digital culture prompted <em>The New Yorker</em> to describe him as &#8220;the most consequential artist to have emerged since the nineteen-eighties&#8221; &#8212; Laing reflects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My own understanding of loneliness relied on a belief in solid, separate selves that he saw as hopelessly outmoded. In his world view, everyone was perpetually slipping into each other, passing through perpetual cycles of transformation; no longer separate, but interspersed. Perhaps he was right. We aren’t as solid as we once thought. We’re embodied but we’re also networks, expanding out into empty space, living on inside machines and in other people’s heads, memories and data streams as well as flesh. We’re being watched and we do not have control. We long for contact and it makes us afraid. But as long as we’re still capable of feeling and expressing vulnerability, intimacy stands a chance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Vulnerability &#8212; which Laing unfussily terms &#8220;the necessary condition of love&#8221; &#8212; is indeed the bellowing undertone of these essays: vulnerability as frisson and function of art, of life itself, of the atavistic impulse for transmuting living into meaning that we call art. </p>\n<p>Complement the thoroughly symphonic <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Funny-Weather-Emergency-Olivia-Laing/dp/132400570X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>Funny Weather</em></strong></a> with Paul Klee on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/09/24/paul-klee-tree-artist-creativity/\">creativity and why an artist is like a tree</a>, Kafka on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/07/03/kafka-music-art/\">why we make art</a>, Egon Schiele on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/06/01/egon-schiele-letter/\">why visionary artists tend to come from the minority</a>, and Virginia Woolf&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/09/virginia-woolf-cotton-wool-moments-of-being/\">garden epiphany about what it means to be an artist</a> &#8212; which remains, for me, the single most beautiful and penetrating thing ever written on the subject &#8212; then revisit Laing on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/16/olivia-laing-to-the-river/\">life, loss, and the wisdom of rivers</a>.  </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

Augustus Knapp, circa 1926)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In an era when the most widespread musical instrument was the tetrachord &#8212; the Hellenic four-string lyre &#8212; and musicians had no standardized system of tuning their instruments, no understanding of the underlying tonal patterns, and nothing more than a vague intuitive sense about how to strum melodies rather than discord, Pythagoras discovered the relationship between musical harmony and the mathematical harmony of numbers. According to his foremost biographer, the fourth-century Syrian scholar Iamblichus, Pythagoras took it upon himself to devise a mechanical aid for musical tuning. </p>\n<p>One day, Iamblichus’s account goes, Pythagoras was strolling past a blacksmith’s forge and was captivated by the sound of the many hammers pounding in a pattern that suddenly sounded harmonious. He rushed into the forge and immediately began investigating the cause of the harmony, testing the various hammers in various stroke combinations &#8212; some producing harmony, others discord. After analyzing the patterns and weighing the hammers, he discovered a simple mathematical relationship between those that produced harmony &#8212; their masses were exact ratios of one another’s. </p>\n<p>Although the anecdote may belong to that murky shoreline between the apocryphal and the factual that marks many biographies of genius, Pythagoras did eventually test these ratios on the lyre. They proved to be perfectly predictive of harmony &#8212; the first discovery of a mathematical rule undergirding a physical phenomenon, and the basis of what became known as the Music of the Spheres.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72847\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?resize=680%2C245&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"245\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72847\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?resize=240%2C87&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?resize=320%2C115&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?resize=768%2C277&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/harmonicesmundi_kepler.jpg?resize=600%2C217&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Celestial harmonics of the planets, from <em>The Harmony of the World</em> (1619) by Johannes Kepler, based on the Pythagorean concept of the Music of the Spheres.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In our time, Pythagoras, known to every schoolchild for his famous triangle theorem, is celebrated as the pioneer who set the golden age of mathematics into motion with the development of numeric logic. Having coined the word <em>philosophy</em> and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/23/pythagoras-olympic-games/\">defined the very meaning of wisdom</a>, he seeded scientific ideas that fomented the later revolutions ushered in by visionaries as far-ranging and far-reaching as Plato, Copernicus, Descartes, Kepler, Newton, and Einstein. </p>\n<p>But in his time, Pythagoras was very much a radical, a dissident, an intellectual deviant. His progressive views on social reform led him to flee the tyrannical rule of his native Samos. After arriving in the Greek colony of Croton as a refugee, he founded a philosophical school whose disciples, known as the Pythagoreans, devised an unexampled model of the universe, placing at its center a ball of fire more than a thousand years before Copernicus upended the geocentric Ptolemaic system with his heliocentricity. </p>\n<p>In another stroke of radicalism, the Pythagoreans admitted into their school a class of sub-citizens denied education and excluded from the newborn civic system of democracy: women. One of them became the world’s first known female astronomer &#8212; Hypatia, who lived her trailblazing life and died her savage death in the city where nearly every trace of Sappho vanished.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72839\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/death-of-sappho-by-miguel-carbonell-selva-1881_print?sku=s6-19311298p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?resize=680%2C989&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"989\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72843\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?resize=240%2C349&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?resize=320%2C465&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?resize=768%2C1117&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/deathofsappho_selva.jpg?resize=600%2C873&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Death of Sappho</em> by Miguel Carbonell Selva, 1881.

From this handful of surviving ashes, Sappho rose with her lyre and her verse to be remembered as the Tenth Muse, the inventor of the love song and the personal lyric, the first great beacon of women’s right to creative expression, and the first great champion of the right to love whom we love. Unlike Emily Dickinson, who deliberately changed the gender pronouns in her poems to conceal <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/10/emily-dickinson-love-letters-susan-gilbert/\">the same-sex passion</a> that fomented her poetry, Sappho kept the female pronouns in the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/09/29/sappho-i-simply-want-to-be-dead-constellation-chor/\">beautiful and heartbreaking odes</a> she wrote to the women she loved. In doing so, she pioneered a radical shift in musical culture &#8212; the permission to sing not about the gods, the seasons, and the wars, but about oneself: about the stunning interior universe of subjective human experience. Without Sappho, there would be no Nina Simone to pose in song <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/25/christof-koch-consciousness-qualia/\">the central question of consciousness</a>: “I wish you could know what it means to be me.”</p>\n<p>The epoch-making contributions of Pythagoras and Sappho come alive in Ted Gioia&#8217;s altogether wonderful book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Music-Subversive-History-Ted-Gioia/dp/1541644360/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>Music: A Subversive History</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/music-a-subversive-history/oclc/1184234686&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; the story of our species told through its most consummate and intimate art-form, traced through the lives of the visionaries and radicals who shaped it, from Pythagoras and Sappho to Bob Dylan and N.W.A. </p>\n<p>In a sentiment that calls to mind Iris Murdoch&#8217;s astute observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/12/iris-murdoch-salvation-by-words/\">&#8220;tyrants always fear art because tyrants want to mystify while art tends to clarify,&#8221;</a> Gioia frames his approach:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At every stage in human history, music has been a catalyst for change, challenging conventions and conveying coded messages &#8212; or, not infrequently, delivering blunt, unambiguous ones.

The rise of Pythagorean music theory, circa 500 BC, changed all that by conceptualizing music as a rational science of sounds that could be described in mathematical terms.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Looking back to antiquity from our own era, in which <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/01/24/nick-cave-music-ai/\">algorithms are mediating the relationship between music, feeling, and transcendence</a>, Gioia adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The very first algorithm entered Western music with this philosophical rupture that happened more than 2,500 years ago.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And yet while the Pythagorean model of mathematically distinguishing melody from noise liberated music by giving it a new language of codified expression, it also limited music by excluding from the musical canon styles that didn&#8217;t conform to these proportionate structures of scales and rhythms &#8212; styles like those that emerged from the African diaspora or from my own native Balkans. Gioia writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ratios and proportions that initially helped us grasp songs turned into the rules and constraints that defined them. The strategies and schemas were often seen as the ‘authentic’ music, and the actual sounds only got validation through their allegiance to what was written on the printed page&#8230; The eventual result was a conceptualization of music that excluded far more than it allowed.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The very practice of legitimization is an act of distortion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Still, the Pythagorean conceptualization of music had profound and beneficent consequences, stretching far beyond the realm of music and into the entire landscape of culture: By bringing mathematics to an art-form <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/06/28/an-essay-toward-a-natural-history-of-serpents/\">previously regarded as mystical</a>, it catalyzed the slow shift from a world of superstition and magic to a world of science and reason &#8212; a cultural evolution that would unfold on the scale of epochs. Two millennia after Pythagoras, Kepler would spend years <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/\">defending his mother in a witchcraft trial</a> while revolutionizing our understanding of the universe with his epoch-making laws of planetary motion, drawing on the Music of the Spheres to discover the proportional relationships of planetary orbits. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72848\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-the-harmony-of-the-world-by-johannes-kepler-1619_print?sku=s6-19311111p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?resize=680%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"768\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72848\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?resize=240%2C271&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?resize=320%2C361&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?resize=768%2C867&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kepler_solids.jpg?resize=600%2C678&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Solids from Kepler&#8217;s <em>Harmony of the World</em>, exploring the relationship between harmony and geometry.

Anyone who hoped to dislodge magical thinking in a traditional society and replace it with a scientific worldview was forced to address music theory, because it, too, could be conceptualized as either magic or science. Any choice between these two models would have profound implications. And not just for theory: society would be altered by how this matter was decided. Before Pythagoras, songs possessed magical potency. If Pythagoras and his followers hoped to eradicate superstition and elevate a more rational and logical worldview, they were almost forced to redefine all the parameters of musical practice.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But while this reconfiguration of musical practice as a mathematical language advanced the world toward science, it also repressed a central animating force of music &#8212; its elemental humanity, ablaze with feeling, sensuality, and a sense of the sacred. Even Schopenhauer, so very German and so unfaltering in his central tenet of the will as the supreme instrument of the human spirit, considered music capable of reaching beyond the reach of will, into <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/28/schopenhauer-on-the-power-of-music/\">&#8220;the inner being, the in-itself, of the world&#8221;</a>; even Kierkegaard, for all his ceaseless cerebration, his Nordic reserve, and his lifelong virginity, exulted in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/05/05/kierkegaard-mozart-music/\">the unparalleled sensuality of music</a>. </p>\n<p>It was Sappho who feathered the other great wing by which music took flight toward modernity, carrying the whole of human culture on its back. Gioia writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sappho has two obvious concerns, and they dominate her worldview even as they expose a hidden rift in Western thought: the emotional bonds of love, and communal obligations to the gods. In the later evolution of Western music, these two approaches will veer off into their separate traditions and have little to do with each other. You could hardly imagine two music genres with less in common than love songs and religious hymns, but for Sappho these are intimately connected.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Pythagoras took the mysticism of music and turned it into a mathematical language, Sappho took the ancient tradition of sacred singing and turned it into a new literary genre of personal poetics. By pioneering the love song and the self-permission for telling our own stories, drawn from our most intimate experiences, she gave the world an immense and abiding gift &#8212; the ability to preserve our stories in song as a fundament of identity and survival, from the African spirituals that sustained the souls of the enslaved to the folk ballads by which refugees hold on to culture and community. In fact, Sappho&#8217;s home island has always been a nexus of cultures and remains a major portal into Europe for refugees from the Middle East. Gioia writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the height of the Syrian crisis in 2016, new arrivals would show up on Lesbos almost every day, making their treacherous journey on small boats, rafts, and inflatable crafts&#8230; Songs are the possessions most likely to survive long journeys, remaining the property of the newcomer even when everything else has been taken away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement this fragment of the altogether fascinating <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Music-Subversive-History-Ted-Gioia/dp/1541644360/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>Music: A Subversive History</em></strong></a> with a haunting choral invocation of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/09/29/sappho-i-simply-want-to-be-dead-constellation-chor/\">Sappho&#8217;s timeless elegy for heartbreak</a>, then revisit Maurice Sendak on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/17/the-shape-of-music-maurice-sendak/\">the shape of music as the key to storytelling</a> and some of humanity&#8217;s most beloved storytellers on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/15/writers-on-music/\">the singular power of music</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

She never received her commission &#8212; the publisher went bankrupt. But her art captured the attentive imagination of the prolific English poet and novelist Walter de la Mare, who asked her to illustrate a fairy tale he had written a decade earlier. So began a lifelong friendship and Lathrop&#8217;s own prolific career. In her nine decades of life, she illustrated nearly forty books for children and wrote several, most of them celebrating her love of animals and the subtle beauties of the natural world. She become the first person to win the Caldecott Medal &#8212; the Nobel Prize of illustration.</p>\n<p>In 1922, Lathrop illustrated De la Mare&#8217;s <a

singular sensibility &#8212; lines as consummate as Rackham&#8217;s, but with a greater and more dreamlike elegance of movement; stunning dramas in black and white, evocative of <a

make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness,” Leo Tolstoy &#8212; a man of colossal compassion and colossal blind spots &#8212; wrote while <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/21/leo-tolstoy-kindness-calendar-of-wisdom/\">reckoning with his life</a> as it neared its end. </p>\n<p>“Practice kindness all day to everybody and you will realize you’re already in heaven now,” Jack Kerouac half-resolved, half-instructed an epoch later in a <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/12/jack-kerouac-golden-eternity/\">beautiful letter</a> to his first wife and lifelong friend.</p>\n<p>Of course, even the best-intentioned of us are not capable of perpetual kindness, not capable of being our most elevated selves all day with everybody. If you have not watched yourself, helpless and horrified, transform into an ill-tempered child with a loved one or the unsuspecting man blocking the produce aisle with his basket of bok choy, you have not lived. Discontinuous and self-contradictory even under the safest and sanest of circumstances, human beings are not wired for constancy of feeling, of conduct, of selfhood. When the world grows unsafe, when life charges at us with its stresses and its sorrows, our devotion to kindness can short-circuit with alarming ease. And yet, paradoxically, it is often in the laboratory of loss and uncertainty that we calibrate and supercharge our capacity for kindness. And it is always, as Kerouac intuited, a practice. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72914\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642738_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=680%2C979&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"979\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72914\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=320%2C461&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=600%2C864&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=240%2C346&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop6.jpg?resize=768%2C1106&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Dorothy Lathrop from her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">1922 fairy-poems</a>.

Le Guin wrote in her daybook, capturing the necessary passion that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/01/ursula-k-le-guin-writing-falling-in-love/\">makes writing akin to falling in love</a>. But reading is where the parallel begins. Some of us read in order to write &#8212; one must first read about the fifteenth century and microbiology and sleep research before writing about it &#8212; and some read purely for the private joy of a world enlarged. Reading is the real fulcrum that lifts us up into new realms of thought and feeling, new atmospheres of reality, from which we free-fall into a deeper love of life itself. And whenever we read, we read the way we love &#8212; with our whole being, bringing to the book every experience we&#8217;ve ever had, every vestige of half-remembered impressions and half-survived heartbreaks, the imprint every other book we&#8217;ve ever read has left on our conscience. </p>\n<p>From <strong>Italo Calvino</strong> (October 15, 1923&#8211;September 19, 1985) comes an uncommonly insightful, tender, and sensual celebration of this parallel between reading and love &#8212; the making of it, the falling into it &#8212; in a wonderful passage from 1979 novel <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Winters-Traveler-Everymans-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0679420258/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>If on a winter&#8217;s night a traveler</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/if-on-a-winters-night-a-traveler/oclc/1112354040&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>). From the frame narrative about a reader trying to read a book to the novel&#8217;s very title, deliberately styled like a sentence and not like a caption of capitalized words, this book is the ultimate meta-homage to reading &#8212; a book by and for the unabashed, obsessive lover of books; a book that exemplifies all of Calvino&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/06/italo-calvinos-14-definitions-of-a-classic/\">fourteen criteria for a classic</a>, but especially the fourth: &#8220;a book which with each rereading offers as much of a sense of discovery as the first reading.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66293\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/a-velocity-of-being-violeta-lopiz_print?sku=s6-10131448p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?resize=680%2C1041&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1041\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66293\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?resize=240%2C367&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?resize=320%2C490&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?resize=768%2C1176&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_VioletaLopiz.jpg?resize=600%2C919&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Violeta Lópiz from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/20/a-velocity-of-being-letters-to-a-young-reader/\"><em>A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader</em></a>.

Everything has already begun before, the first line of the first page of every novel refers to something that has already happened outside the book. Or else the real story is the one that begins ten or a hundred pages further on, and everything that precedes it is only a prologue. The lives of individuals of the human race form a constant plot, in which every attempt to isolate one piece of living that has a meaning separate from the rest &#8212; for example, the meeting of two people, which will become decisive for both &#8212; must bear in mind that each of the two brings with himself a texture of events, environments, other people, and that from the meeting, in turn, other stories will be derived which will break off from their common story.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>He considers how reading, like physical intimacy, is an act of total immersion that at its best requires a delicate osmotic balance of total surrender and unassailable sovereignty &#8212; one of the mind, the other of the body: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, since your bodies are trying to find, skin to skin, the adhesion most generous in sensations, to transmit and receive vibrations and waves, to compenetrate the fullnesses and the voids, since in mental activity you have also agreed on the maximum agreement, you can be addressed with an articulated speech that includes you both in a sole, two-headed person. First of all the field of action, or of existence, must be established for this double entity you form. Where is the reciprocal identification leading? What is the central theme that recurs in your variations and modulations? A tension concentrated on not losing anything of its own potential, on prolonging a state of reactivity, on exploiting the accumulation of the other’s desire in order to multiply one’s own charge? Or is it the most submissive abandonment, the exploration of the immensity of strokable and reciprocally stroking spaces, the dissolving of one’s being in a lake whose surface is infinitely tactile?</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a sentiment evocative of Rilke&#8217;s poignant observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/03/rilke-love-marriage/\">&#8220;even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist&#8221;</a> and that a healthy love is one of spacious union between two neighboring solitudes, Calvino concludes of this necessary negotiation between separateness and unity:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In both situations you certainly do not exist except in relation to each other, but, to make those situations possible, your respective egos have not so much to erase themselves as to occupy, without reserve, all the void of the mental space, invest in itself at the maximum interest or spend itself to the last penny. In short, what you are doing is very beautiful but grammatically it doesn’t change a thing. At the moment when you most appear to be a united <em>voi</em>, a second person plural, you are two <em>tu’</em>s, more separate and circumscribed than before.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66459\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/a-velocity-of-being-ping-zhu_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?resize=680%2C913&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"913\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66459\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?resize=240%2C322&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?resize=320%2C430&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?resize=768%2C1032&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PingZhu.jpg?resize=600%2C806&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Ping Zhu for <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/20/a-velocity-of-being-letters-to-a-young-reader/\"><em>A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader</em></a>.

Your body is being subjected to a systematic reading, through channels of tactile information, visual, olfactory, and not without some intervention of the taste buds. Hearing also has its role, alert to your gasps and your trills. It is not only the body that is, in you, the object of reading: the body matters insofar as it is part of a complex of elaborate elements, not all visible and not all present, but manifested in visible and present events: the clouding of your eyes, your laughing, the words you speak, your way of gathering and spreading your hair, your initiatives and your reticences, and all the signs that are on the frontier between you and usage and habits and memory and prehistory and fashion, all codes, all the poor alphabets by which one human being believes at certain moments that he is reading another human being&#8230; The Other Reader now is reviewing your body as if skimming the index, and at some moments she consults it as if gripped by sudden and specific curiosities, then she lingers, questioning it and waiting till a silent answer reaches her, as if every partial inspection interested her only in the light of a wider spatial reconnaissance. Now she dwells on negligible details, perhaps tiny stylistic faults&#8230; and she exploits them to establish a margin of detachment, critical reserve, or joking intimacy; now instead the accidentally discovered detail is excessively cherished &#8212; for example, the shape of your chin or a special nip you take at her shoulder &#8212; and from this start she gains impetus, covers (you cover together) pages and pages from top to bottom without skipping a comma.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64208\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/how-calm-how-solemn-it-grows-to-ascend-the-atmosphere-of-lovers_print?sku=s6-8967910p4a1v45?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=680%2C899&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"899\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64208\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=240%2C317&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=320%2C423&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=768%2C1015&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass10.jpg?resize=600%2C793&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

It starts at any point, skips, repeats itself, goes backward, insists, ramifies in simultaneous and divergent messages, converges again, has moments of irritation, turns the page, finds its place, gets lost. A direction can be recognized in it, a route to an end, since it tends toward a climax, and with this end in view it arranges rhythmic phases, metrical scansions, recurrence of motives. But is the climax really the end? Or is the race toward that end opposed by another drive which works in the opposite direction, swimming against the moments, recovering time? </p>\n<p>If one wanted to depict the whole thing graphically, every episode, with its climax, would require a three-dimensional model, perhaps four-dimensional, or, rather, no model: every experience is unrepeatable. What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66289\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/a-velocity-of-being-lia-halloran_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?resize=680%2C865&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"865\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66289\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?resize=240%2C305&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?resize=320%2C407&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?resize=768%2C977&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Velocity_LiaHalloran.jpg?resize=600%2C763&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Lia Halloran from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/11/20/a-velocity-of-being-letters-to-a-young-reader/\"><em>A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader</em></a>.

One winter afternoon in his early fifties, leafing through his son&#8217;s Latin dictionary, he paused at <em>fractus</em> &#8212; the adjective from the verb <em>frangere</em>, &#8220;to break.&#8221; Having survived his own early life as a Jewish refugee in Europe by metabolizing languages &#8212; his native Lithuanian, then French when his family fled to France, then English as he began his life in science &#8212; he recognized immediately the word&#8217;s echoes in the English <em>fracture</em> and <em>fraction</em>, concepts that resonated with the nature of his jagged self-replicating geometries. Out of the dead language of classical science he sculpted the vocabulary of a new sensemaking model for the living world. The word <em>fractal</em> was born &#8212; binominal and bilingual, both adjective and noun, the same in English and in French &#8212; and all the universe was new.</p>\n<p>In his essay for artist Katie Holten&#8217;s lovely anthology of art and science, <a href=\"https://www.katieholten.com/abouttrees\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>About Trees</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/about-trees/oclc/916721640&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; trees being perhaps the most tangible and most enchanting manifestation of fractals in nature &#8212; the poetic science historian James Gleick reflects on Mandelbrot&#8217;s titanic legacy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mandelbrot created nothing less than a new geometry, to stand side by side with Euclid&#8217;s &#8212; a geometry to mirror not the ideal forms of thought but the real complexity of nature. He was a mathematician who was never welcomed into the fraternity&#8230; and he pretended that was fine with him&#8230; In various incarnations he taught physiology and economics.

Now imagine a certain transformation &#8212; a particular, well-defined, easily repeated set of rules. Take the middle one-third of each side and attach a new triangle, identical in shape but one-third the size. The result is a star of David. Instead of three one-foot segments, the outline of this shape is now twelve four-inch segments. Instead of three points, there are six.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you incline toward infinity and repeat this transformation over and over, adhering smaller and smaller triangles onto smaller and smaller sides, the shape becomes more and more detailed, looking more and more like the contour of an intricate perfect snowflake &#8212; but one with astonishing and mesmerizing features: a continuous contour that never intersects itself as its length increases with each recursive addition while the area bounded by it remains almost unchanged. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/19/wilson-bentley-snowflakes/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wilsonbentley_snowflakes22.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plate from Wilson Bentley&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/19/wilson-bentley-snowflakes/\">pioneering 19th-century photomicroscopy of snowflakes</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>If the curve were ironed out into a straight Euclidean line, its vector would reach toward the edge of the universe. </p>\n<p>It thrills and troubles the mind to bend itself around this concept.

Gleick writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Benoit Mandelbrot is best understood as a refugee. He was born in Warsaw in 1924 to a Lithuanian Jewish family, his father a clothing wholesaler, his mother a dentist. Alert to geopolitical reality, the family moved to Paris in 1936, drawn in part by the presence of Mandelbrot’s uncle, Szolem Mandelbrojt, a mathematician. When the war came, the family stayed just ahead of the Nazis once again, abandoning everything but a few suitcases and joining the stream of refugees who clogged the roads south from Paris. They finally reached the town of Tulle. </p>\n<p>For a while Benoit went around as an apprentice toolmaker, dangerously conspicuous by his height and his educated background. It was a time of unforgettable sights and fears, yet later he recalled little personal hardship, remembering instead the times he was befriended in Tulle and elsewhere by schoolteachers, some of them distinguished scholars, themselves stranded by the war. In all, his schooling was irregular and discontinuous. He claimed never to have learned the alphabet or, more significantly, multiplication tables past the fives. Still, he had a gift. </p>\n<p>When Paris was liberated, he took and passed the month-long oral and written admissions examination for École Normale and École Polytechnique, despite his lack of preparation. Among other elements, the test had a vestigial examination in drawing, and Mandelbrot discovered a latent facility for copying the Venus de Milo. On the mathematical sections of the test &#8212; exercises in formal algebra and integrated analysis &#8212; he managed to hide his lack of training with the help of his geometrical intuition. He had realized that, given an analytic problem, he could almost always think of it in terms of some shape in his mind. Given a shape, he could find ways of transforming it, altering its symmetries, making it more harmonious. Often his transformations led directly to a solution of the analogous problem. In physics and chemistry, where he could not apply geometry, he got poor grades. But in mathematics, questions he could never have answered using proper techniques melted away in the face of his manipulations of shapes.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72788\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?resize=680%2C1019&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1019\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72788\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?w=1035&#38;ssl=1 1035w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?resize=240%2C360&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?resize=320%2C480&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/benoitmandelbrot_teenager.jpg?resize=600%2C899&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Benoit Mandelbrot as a teenager.

Beneath the surface of this paradoxical sentiment is a kind of koan, simple yet profound, replete with layered truth for those of us living expatriated lives &#8212; expatriated from a place or a culture, in space or in time. </p>\n<p>Two generations before Angelou, <strong>Gertrude Stein</strong> (February 3, 1874&#8211;July 27, 1946), living out <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/28/maira-kalman-the-autobiography-of-alice-b-toklas/\">her great love story</a> as an American expatriate in Paris, addressed this paradox with uncommon insight and her own characteristic koan-like style in a passage from her 1940 novel <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Paris-France-Gertrude-Stein/dp/0871403749/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Paris France</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/paris-france/oclc/999861268&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/28/maira-kalman-the-autobiography-of-alice-b-toklas/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MairaKalman_SteinToklas2.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gertrude Stein by artist Maira Kalman from her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/28/maira-kalman-the-autobiography-of-alice-b-toklas/\">superb illustrated edition</a> of Stein&#8217;s <em>The Autobiography of Alice B.

That is why writers have to have two countries, the one where they belong and the one in which they live really. The second one is romantic, it is separate from themselves, it is not real but it is really there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stein notes that the Victorians found their romantic home in Italy, Americans found theirs in Spain in the first half of the nineteenth century and in England in the second, and her own generation found it in Paris. Prefiguring Angelou&#8217;s sentiment, she adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course sometimes people discover their own country as if it were the other&#8230; but in general that other country that you need to be free is in the other country not the country where you really belong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I read this and think of Leonard Cohen&#8217;s lovely notion of poetry as <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/03/01/leonard-cohen-death-of-a-ladys-man-words/\">&#8220;the Constitution of the inner country.&#8221;</a> For me, living an unbelonging life in a country other than the one in which I was born and raised, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/poetry/\">poetry</a> has been an increasingly vital portal to that inner landscape of freedom that Stein contours &#8212; a way of tending to and befriending the interior wilderness from which all creative work springs and which remains a sovereign territory of psychogeography, wherever one&#8217;s body may be located and whatever artificial borders may be drawn around it by outside observers. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/28/maira-kalman-the-autobiography-of-alice-b-toklas/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MairaKalman_SteinToklas9.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Maira Kalman from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/28/maira-kalman-the-autobiography-of-alice-b-toklas/\"><em>The Autobiography of Alice B.

love and how to live with the fundamental fear of loss</a>. &#8220;Such fearlessness exists only in the complete calm that can no longer be shaken by events expected of the future&#8230; Hence the only valid tense is the present, the Now.” </p>\n<p>Half a century before her, Leo Tolstoy &#8212; who befriended a Buddhist monk late in life and became deeply influenced by Buddhist philosophy &#8212; echoed these ancient truths as he contemplated <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/09/leo-tolstoy-on-love/\">the paradoxical nature of love</a>: “Future love does not exist. Love is a present activity only.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That in love and in life, freedom from fear &#8212; like all species of freedom &#8212; is only possible within the present moment has long been a core teaching of the most ancient Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions. It is one of the most elemental truths of existence, and one of those most difficult to put into practice as we move through our daily human lives, so habitually inclined toward the next moment and the mentally constructed universe of expected events &#8212; the parallel universe where anxiety dwells, where hope and fear for what might be eclipse what is, and where we cease to be free because we are no longer in the direct light of reality.</p>\n<p>The relationship between freedom, fear, and love is what <strong>Alan Watts</strong> (January 6, 1915&#8211;November 16, 1973) explores in one of the most insightful chapters of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Anxiety/dp/0307741206/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/wisdom-of-insecurity-a-message-for-an-age-of-anxiety/oclc/662402941&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; his altogether revelatory 1951 classic, which introduced Eastern philosophy to the West with its lucid and luminous case for <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/06/alan-watts-wisdom-of-insecurity-1/\">how to live with presence</a>. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Anxiety/dp/0307741206/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/alanwatts.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alan Watts, early 1970s (Image courtesy of Everett Collection)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Drawing on his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/01/alan-watts-wisdom-of-insecurity-3/\">admonition against the dangers of the divided mind</a> &#8212; the mindset that divides us into interior self-awareness and external reality, into ego and universe, which is the mindset the whole of Western culture has instilled in us &#8212; he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The meaning of freedom can never be grasped by the divided mind. If I feel separate from my experience, and from the world, freedom will seem to be the extent to which I can push the world around, and fate the extent to which the world pushes me around. But to the whole mind there is no contrast of “I” and the world. There is just one process acting, and it does everything that happens. It raises my little finger and it creates earthquakes. Or, if you want to put it that way, I raise my little finger and also make earthquakes. No one fates and no one is being fated.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This model of freedom is orthogonal to our conditioned view that freedom is a matter of bending external reality to our will by the power of our choices &#8212; controlling what remains of nature once the &#8220;I&#8221; is separated out. Watts draws a subtle, crucial distinction between freedom and choice: </p>\n<blockquote><p>What we ordinarily mean by choice is not freedom. Choices are usually decisions motivated by pleasure and pain, and the divided mind acts with the sole purpose of getting “I” into pleasure and out of pain. But the best pleasures are those for which we do not plan, and the worst part of pain is expecting it and trying to get away from it when it has come. You cannot plan to be happy. You can plan to exist, but in themselves existence and non-existence are neither pleasurable nor painful.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72735\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-thomas-wrights-an-original-theory-or-new-hypothesis-of-the-universe-17504457506_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?resize=680%2C753&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"753\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72735\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?resize=240%2C266&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?resize=320%2C354&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?resize=768%2C850&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright6.jpg?resize=600%2C664&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Thomas Wright from his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\"><em>Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe</em></a>, 1750.

Watts writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The sense of not being free comes from trying to do things which are impossible and even meaningless. You are not “free” to draw a square circle, to live without a head, or to stop certain reflex actions. These are not obstacles to freedom; they are the conditions of freedom. I am not free to draw a circle if perchance it should turn out to be a square circle. I am not, thank heaven, free to walk out of doors and leave my head at home. Likewise I am not free to live in any moment but this one, or to separate myself from my feelings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Without the motive forces of pleasure and pain, it might at first appear paradoxical to make any decisions at all &#8212; a contradiction that makes it impossible to choose between options as we navigate even the most basic realities of life: Why choose to take the umbrella into the downpour, why choose to eat this piece of mango and not this piece of cardboard? But Watts observes that the only real contradiction is of our own making as we cede the present to an imagined future. More than half a century before psychologists came to study <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/18/daniel-gilbert-happiness-future-self/\">how your present self is sabotaging your future happiness</a>, Watts offers the personal counterpart to Albert Camus&#8217;s astute political observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/17/albert-camus-the-rebel/\">&#8220;real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present,&#8221;</a> and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I fall straight into contradiction when I try to act and decide in order to be happy, when I make “being pleased” my future goal. For the more my actions are directed towards future pleasures, the more I am incapable of enjoying any pleasures at all. For all pleasures are present, and nothing save complete awareness of the present can even begin to guarantee future happiness.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>You can only live in one moment at a time, and you cannot think simultaneously about listening to the waves and whether you are enjoying listening to the waves. Contradictions of this kind are the only real types of action without freedom.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64211\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/i-musing-late-in-the-autumn-day_framed-print?sku=s6-8967581p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=680%2C851&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"851\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64211\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=240%2C300&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=320%2C401&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=768%2C961&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=600%2C751&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

This is but another example of split-mindedness, for what is the difference between “me” and “mental mechanisms” whether conscious or unconscious? Who is being moved by these processes? The notion that anyone is being motivated comes from the persisting illusion of “I.” The real man<a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/\">*</a>, the organism-in-relation-to-the-universe, <em>is</em> this unconscious motivation. And because he <em>is</em> it, he is not being moved <em>by</em> it.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Events look inevitable in retrospect because when they have happened, nothing can change them. Yet the fact that I can make safe bets could prove equally well that events are not <em>determined</em> but <em>consistent</em>. In other words, the universal process acts freely and spontaneously at every moment, but tends to throw out events in regular, and so predictable, sequences.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only by such a misapprehension of freedom, Watts observes, do we ever feel unfree: When we enter a state that causes us psychological pain, our immediate impulse is to get the &#8220;I&#8221; out of the pain, which is invariably a resistance to the present moment as it is; because we cannot will a different psychological state, we reach for an easy escape: a drink, a drug, a compulsive scroll through an Instagram feed. All the ways in which we try to abate our feelings of abject loneliness and boredom and inadequacy by escaping from the present moment where they unfold are motivated by the fear that those intolerable feelings will subsume us. And yet the instant we become motivated by fear, we become unfree &#8212; we are prisoners of fear. We are only free within the bounds of the present moment, with all of its disquieting feelings, because only in that moment can they dissipate into the totality of integrated reality, leaving no divide between us as feelers and the feelings being felt, and therefore no painful contrast between preferred state and actual state. Watts writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So long as the mind believes in the possibility of escape from what it is at this moment, there can be no freedom.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>It <em>sounds</em> as if it were the most abject fatalism to have to admit that I am what I am, and that no escape or division is possible. It seems that if I <em>am</em> afraid, then I am “stuck” with fear. But in fact I am chained to the fear only so long as I am trying to get away from it. On the other hand, when I do not try to get away I discover that there is nothing “stuck” or fixed about the reality of the moment. When I am aware of this feeling without naming it, without calling it “fear,” “bad,” “negative,” etc., it changes instantly into something else, and life moves freely ahead. The feeling no longer perpetuates itself by creating the feeler behind it.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72737\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-thomas-wrights-an-original-theory-or-new-hypothesis-of-the-universe-1750_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=680%2C977&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"977\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72737\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=240%2C345&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=320%2C460&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=768%2C1103&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=600%2C862&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Thomas Wright from his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\"><em>Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe</em></a>, 1750.

She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Since childhood] we are taught to ignore sadness, to stuff it down into our satchels and pretend it isn’t there. As adults, we often have to learn to hear the clarity of its call. That is wintering. It is the active acceptance of sadness. It is the practice of allowing ourselves to feel it as a need. It is the courage to stare down the worst parts of our experience and to commit to healing them the best we can. Wintering is a moment of intuition, our true needs felt keenly as a knife.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/29/the-shadow-elephant/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant10.jpg\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Valerio Vidali from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/29/the-shadow-elephant/\"><em>The Shadow Elephant</em></a> by Nadine Robert &#8212; a subtle children&#8217;s book about honoring sadness.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like happiness &#8212; which, as <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/09/23/george-eliot-happiness/\">George Eliot well knew</a>, is a skill we incrementally master as we grow older &#8212; sadness, May reminds us, is also a skill: There are self-punishing ways to be sad, and self-salving ways to be sad. In skillful wintering, we learn the difference between the two. Rilke, who wintered amply and wisely, knew that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/10/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-sadness/\">great sadnesses clarify us to ourselves</a> &#8212; winters of the spirit come in various sizes and cycles, each meaningful, all cumulative in their soul-sculpting beneficence. May writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you start tuning in to winter, you realise that we live through a thousand winters in our lives &#8212; some big, some small&#8230; Some winters creep up on us so slowly that they have infiltrated every part of our lives before we truly feel them.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>To get better at wintering, we need to address our very notion of time. We tend to imagine that our lives are linear, but they are in fact cyclical.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This cyclical nature of the seasons of the spirit is counter to our dominant cultural narrative of self-improvement, with its ethos of linear progression toward   states of ever-increasing flourishing. It is counter, too, to the world&#8217;s major spiritual traditions, with their ideas of salvation and enlightenment. (Any longtime practitioner of Zen or metta meditation, for instance, knows that while we do reach moments of so-called enlightenment &#8212; a gladsome dissolution of the self into an all-pervading lovingkindness &#8212; these moments are inevitably punctuated by visitations of our habitual tendencies toward egoic shortness of temper, the self-absorption we call melancholy, and other conditioned modes of unenlightened conduct.) And yet befriending this cyclical rhythm of our inner lives, May observes with life-tested clarity, is the key to wintering &#8212; to emerging from the coldest seasons of the soul not only undiminished but revitalized.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72869\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/everafter4601789_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C343&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72869\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C121&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C162&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C388&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EverAfter_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C303&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ever/After</em> by Maria Popova.

This is a brutal untruth. Life meanders like a path through the woods. We have seasons when we flourish and seasons when the leaves fall from us, revealing our bare bones. Given time, they grow again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the book&#8217;s wonderful portals into the world of science as a means of comprehending our elemental humanity, May considers the astonishing actuality of trees beyond the merely metaphorical:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The dropping of leaves by deciduous trees is called abscission. It occurs on the cusp between autumn and winter, as part of an arc of growth, maturity, and renewal. In spring and summer, leaf cells are full of chlorophyll, a bright green substance that absorbs sunlight, fueling the process that converts carbon dioxide and water into the starch and sugar that allow the tree to grow. But at the end of the summer, as the days grow shorter and the temperature falls, deciduous trees stop making food. In the absence of sunlight, it becomes too costly to maintain the machinery of growth. The chlorophyll begins to break down, revealing other colours that were always present in the leaf, but which were masked by the abundance of green pigment: oranges and yellows, derived from carotene and xanthophyll. Other chemical changes take place to create red anthocyanin pigments. The exact mix is different for each tree, sometimes producing bright yellows, oranges, and browns, and sometimes displaying as reds or purples.</p>\n<p>But while this is happening, a layer of cells is weakening between the stem and the branch: this is called the abscission zone. Gradually it severs the leaf from access to water, and the leaf dries and browns and in most cases falls off, either under its own weight or encouraged by wintery rains and winds. Within a few hours, the tree will have released substances to heal the scar the leaf has left, protecting itself from the evaporation of water, infection, or the invasion of parasites.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72867\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/alive4601335_print?sku=s6-19355251p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=680%2C797&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"797\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72867\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=240%2C281&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=320%2C375&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=768%2C900&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alive_by_MariaPopova.jpg?resize=600%2C704&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sundown Poem</em> by Maria Popova.

Many trees also display catkins in the winter, like the acid-green lambs’ tails of the hazel and the furry grey nubs of the willow. These employ the wind or insects to spread pollen, ready for the new year.</p>\n<p>The tree is waiting. It has everything ready. Its fallen leaves are mulching the forest floor, and its roots are drawing up the extra winter moisture, providing a firm anchor against seasonal storms. Its ripe cones and nuts are providing essential food in this scarce time for mice and squirrels, and its bark is hosting hibernating insects and providing a source of nourishment for hungry deer. It is far from dead. It is in fact the life and soul of the wood. It’s just getting on with it quietly. It will not burst into life in the spring. It will just put on a new coat and face the world again.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/goodbye-summer-from-trees-at-night-by-art-young_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?resize=680%2C1023&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1023\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68428\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?resize=240%2C361&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?resize=320%2C482&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?resize=768%2C1156&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight13.jpg?resize=600%2C903&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"\"><em>Trees at Night</em></a> by Art Young, 1926.

And in return, it’s our responsibility to listen to those who have wintered before us. It’s an exchange of gifts in which nobody loses out. This may involve the breaking of a lifelong habit, one passed down carefully through generations: that of looking at other people’s misfortunes and feeling certain that they brought them upon themselves in a way that you never would. This isn’t just an unkind attitude. It does us harm, because it keeps us from learning that disasters do indeed happen and how we can adapt when they do. It stops us from reaching out to those who are suffering. And when our own disaster comes, it forces us into a humiliated retreat, as we try to hunt down mistakes that we never made in the first place or wrongheaded attitudes that we never held. Either that, or we become certain that there must be someone out there we can blame. Watching winter and really listening to its messages, we learn that effect is often disproportionate to cause; that tiny mistakes can lead to huge disasters; that life is often bloody unfair, but it carries on happening with or without our consent. We learn to look more kindly on other people’s crises, because they are so often portents of our own future.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/29/arthur-rackham-brothers-grimm/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/arthurrackham_grimm5.jpg\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Arthur Rackham for a <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/29/arthur-rackham-brothers-grimm/\">rare 1917 edition</a> of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales.

A century before the Oxford Children&#8217;s Dictionary <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/\">discarded dozens of words related to nature</a> as irrelevant to the imagination and its prosthesis in language, the small bedridden boy grew especially enchanted by the feathered creatures of free flight that he met on the page. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelostwords7.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Jackie Morris from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/17/the-lost-words-macfarlane-morris/\"><em>The Lost Words</em></a> by Robert Macfarlane</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Literature remained his portal into life as he set out on a literary career in New York. But nature beckoned, the birds beckoned. </p>\n<p>At thirty, Vogt abruptly left the city for Latin America, traveling on a Peruvian commission to study bird populations on the guano islands. In the three years he spent there, laboring in the salty air on the hot barren rocks, he arrived at an empirical proof of Muir&#8217;s insight &#8212; Vogt discovered that when changes in ocean currents diminished the population of plankton and anchovies, millions of birds fled the islands in search of food, leaving their defenseless chicks to die in &#8220;pitiful, collapsed, downy clumps&#8221; that broke his heart. </p>\n<p>He saw in this heartbreak a miniature of the whole &#8212; the intricate interlacing of creaturely destinies on a planet of finite resources, growing populations, and infinite interconnectedness of needs. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IYCTE.Birds_.2000.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/05/if-you-come-to-earth-sophie-blackall/\"><em>If You Come to Earth</em></a> by Sophie Blackall</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Vogt spent the next decade and a half developing these ideas by devouring countless books and scientific papers, talking with scientists and sea captains, farmers and diplomats, presidents and sheepherders in Patagonia, engineers and trappers in Manitoba. In 1948 &#8212; the year the great nature writer Henry Beston cast his poetic hope that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/01/henry-beston-northern-farm-human-nature/\">&#8220;perhaps there is still time to take a stand for the Kingdom of Life [which] needs defenders&#8221;</a> and that &#8220;perhaps, mighty as its enemies may be, allies will come who are even mightier” &#8212; Vogt distilled his learnings in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Road-Survival-William-Vogt/dp/1166135950/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Road to Survival</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/road-to-survival/oclc/1057726082&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), a mighty manifesto that roused a generation of allies to stand for the Kingdom of Life. </p>\n<p>At the crux of his inquiry into the key motive forces of our civilization&#8217;s course is Vogt&#8217;s insistence that while much is broken with the exploitive consumerism behind the world&#8217;s government and industry, much more depends on and is mendable by the concerted collective action of ordinary people. In a humbling testament to the slow work of cultural change and civilizational course-correction, it would take nearly a century for his ideas to come alive and actionable in such pillars of ecological responsibility as the Paris Agreement, the Green New Deal, and Greta Thunberg&#8217;s global school climate strike movement. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72765\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?resize=680%2C622&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"622\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72765\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?resize=240%2C220&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?resize=320%2C293&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?resize=768%2C703&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/williamvogt.jpg?resize=600%2C549&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Vogt</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In an era when humanity regarded the rest of nature as <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/10/america-ferrera-sojourns-in-the-parallel-world-denise-levertov/\">a world parallel to our own</a> &#8212; a world at best visited in pleasant excursions, at worst reduced to extractable resources to serve human needs &#8212; Vogt insists that &#8220;ecological health is one of the indispensables&#8221; in the &#8220;flowering of human happiness and well-being.&#8221; A century after Ernst Haeckel <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/03/26/ernst-haeckel-medusae/\">coined the term <em>ecology</em></a> and a decade before Rachel Carson <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/\">made it a household word</a>, Vogt draws on his island discovery to contour the totality of Earth&#8217;s ecological interdependence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Drastic measures are inescapable. Above everything else, we must reorganize our thinking. If we are to escape the crash we must abandon all thought of living unto ourselves. We form an earth-company, and the lot of the Indiana farmer can no longer be isolated from that of the Bantu&#8230; An eroding hillside in Mexico or Yugoslavia affects the living standard and probability of survival of the American people&#8230; Today&#8217;s white bread may force a break in the levees, and flood New Orleans next spring.

I mean every person who reads a newspaper printed on pulp from vanishing forests. I mean every man and woman who eats a meal drawn from steadily shrinking lands. Everyone who flushes a toilet, and thereby pollutes a river, wastes fertile organic matter and helps to lower a water table. Everyone who puts on a wool garment derived from overgrazed ranges that have been cut by the little hoofs and gullied by the rains, sending runoff and topsoil into the rivers downstream, flooding cities hundreds of miles away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Writing shortly before he became National Director of Planned Parenthood &#8212; a position he would hold for more than a decade in parallel with his conservation work &#8212; Vogt adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Especially do I mean men and women in overpopulated countries who produce excessive numbers of children who, unhappily, cannot escape their fate as hostages to the forces of misery and disaster that lower upon the horizon of our future.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The direction of these curves and the misery they write across the earth are not likely to be changed in the proximate future. Their direction is fixed for some decades. Great masses of people have a preponderantly young population; as they come into the breeding age we must, despite all possible efforts short of generalized slaughter, expect human numbers to increase for a time. The drag imposed by ignorance, selfishness, nationalism, custom, etc., is certain to retard, by some decades, any effective or substantial improvement of resource management.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an admonition of astonishing prescience, Vogt insists that changing the trend requires revising our past ideals to calibrate them to an evolving ecological reality:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The freebooting, rugged individualist, whose vigor, imagination, and courage contributed so much of good to the building of our country (along with the bad), we must now recognize, where his activities destroy resources, as the Enemy of the People he has become&#8230; Above all, we must learn to know &#8212; to feel to the core of our beings &#8212; our dependence upon the earth and the riches with which it sustains us. We can no longer believe valid our assumption that we live in independence.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/04/wangari-maathai-the-woman-who-planted-millions-of-trees/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wangarimaathai4.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Aurélia Fronty from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/06/04/wangari-maathai-the-woman-who-planted-millions-of-trees/\"><em>Wangari Maathai: The Woman Who Planted Millions of Trees</em></a> by Franck Prévot</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Writing shortly before Rachel Carson penned her prescient open letter to America, insisting that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/08/rachel-carson-washington-post-letter-1953/\">&#8220;the real wealth of the Nation lies in the resources of the earth &#8212; soil, water, forests, minerals, and wildlife,&#8221;</a> Vogt calls for long-term thinking and broad-range feeling:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We must &#8212; all of us, men, women, and children &#8212; reorient ourselves with relation to the world in which we live&#8230; We must come to understand our past, our history, in terms of the soil and water and forests and grasses that have made it what it is. We must see the years to come in the frame that makes space and time one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a world he considered already overcrowded and resource-strained by the two billion people inhabiting it &#8212; a population that would triple within a generation &#8212; Vogt adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we are crowded together&#8230; on the shrinking surface of the globe, we have set in motion historical forces that are directed by our total environment.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/thesnailwiththerightheart_comet.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Ping Zhu from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\"><em>The Snail with the Right Heart</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Half a century after Alfred Russel Wallace issued his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/12/11/the-wonderful-century-alfred-russel-wallace/\">prophetic prescription for civilizational course-correction</a> &#8212; an admonition that fell on deaf ears at the outset of the twentieth century and would remain a point of willful deafness in the climate denial of the twenty-first &#8212; Vogt makes an impassioned and empowering appeal to the only substantive force of change in the grand scheme of any society and civilization:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we ourselves do not govern our destiny, firmly and courageously, no one is going to do it for us. To regain ecological freedom for our civilization will be a heavy task. It will frequently require arduous and uncomfortable measures. It will cost considerable sums of money. Democratic governments are not likely to set forth on such a steep and rocky path unless people lead the way.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>So that the people shall not delude themselves, find further frustration through quack nostrums, fight their way into blind alleys, it is imperative that this world-wide dilemma be made known to all mankind. The human race is caught in a situation as concrete as a pair of shoes two sizes too small. We must understand that, and stop blaming economic systems, the weather, bad luck, or callous saints. This is the beginning of wisdom, and the first step on the long road back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a contemporary counterpart to Vogt&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Road-Survival-William-Vogt/dp/1166135950/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Road to Survival</em></strong></a>, see the excellent anthology of policy, poetry, and science <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-We-Can-Save-Solutions/dp/0593237064/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All We Can Save: Truth, Courage, and Solutions for the Climate Crisis</em></a>, shining a kaleidoscope of actionable perspective by women leading the way on the road Vogt envisioned, then revisit Eve Ensler&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/28/eve-ensler-apology-mother-earth/\">extraordinary letter of apology to Mother Earth</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.

Determined to honor Newton with a worthy cenotaph &#8212; a memorial tomb for a person buried elsewhere &#8212; he designed a sphere 500 feet in diameter, taller than the Pyramids of Giza, nested into a colossal pedestal and encircled by hundreds of cypress trees, giving it the transfixing illusion of being both half-buried into the Earth and hovering unmoored from gravity.

Doubly touching was his choice of a sphere: One of Newton&#8217;s most revolutionary contributions &#8212; the mathematical inference that because gravity is weaker at the equator, the shape of the Earth must be spherical &#8212; had defied France&#8217;s greatest son, René Descartes, who maintained that the Earth was egg-shaped. When Boullée was still a boy, a young Frenchman &#8212; Émilie du Châtelet&#8217;s mathematics tutor &#8212; had joined a perilous Arctic expedition to prove Newton correct.

A century before the teenage Virginia Woolf wrote that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/14/virginia-woolf-on-imitation-and-the-arts/\">&#8220;all the Arts&#8230; imitate as far as they can the one great truth that all can see,&#8221;</a> Boullée insisted:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No idea exists that does not derive from nature&#8230; It is impossible to create architectural imagery without a profound knowledge of nature: the Poetry of architecture lies in natural effects. That is what makes architecture an art and that art sublime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Architecture in the modern sense was then a young art, because <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/01/02/perspective/\">the art-science of perspective was so novel</a>. Newton&#8217;s optics, derived directly from the laws of nature, had revolutionized it all. Boullée came to define architecture as &#8220;the art of creating perspectives by the arrangement of volumes,&#8221; but a highly poetic art: </p>\n<blockquote><p>The real talent of an architect lies in incorporating in his work the sublime attraction of Poetry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The poetry of architecture, he argued, resides in using perspective and light in such a way that &#8220;our senses are reminded of nature.&#8221; He interpreted the laws of nature, as clarified by Newton&#8217;s optics and mathematics, to intimate that no shape embodies this serenade to the senses with greater power and precision than the sphere:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A sphere is, in all respects, the image of perfection. It combines strict symmetry with the most perfect regularity and the greatest possible variety; its form is developed to the fullest extent and is the simplest that exists; its shape is outlined by the most agreeable contour and, finally, the light effects that it produces are so beautifully graduated that they could not possibly be softer, more agreeable or more varied. These unique advantages, which the sphere derives from nature, have an immeasurable hold over our senses.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72981\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?resize=680%2C404&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"404\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72981\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?w=1297&#38;ssl=1 1297w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?resize=320%2C190&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?resize=600%2C356&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?resize=240%2C142&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph2.jpg?resize=768%2C456&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of Bibliothèque nationale de France.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>And so Boullée predicated his cenotaph for Newton on an enormous sphere that would convey his ultimate intent for the temple &#8212; to arouse in the visitor&#8217;s soul &#8220;feelings in keeping with religious ceremonies,&#8221; a sense of grandeur leaving them &#8220;moved by such an excess of sensibility&#8230; that all the faculties of our soul are disturbed to such an extent that we feel it is departing from our body&#8221; &#8212; an effect always best achieved not by an enormity of sheer size and space but by a considered contrast of scales. No building, he observed, &#8220;calls for the Poetry of architecture&#8221; more than a memorial to the dead. Believing that architecture, like all art, should ultimately serve to enlarge our sense of aliveness, and that we are never more alive than when we are rooted in our creaturely senses, Boullée insisted that the key to this sense of grandeur lies in applying the principles of nature&#8217;s mathematics with poetic subtlety &#8212; the principles laid bare in the <em>Principia</em>, the principles that &#8220;derive from order, the symbol of wisdom.&#8221; He wrote: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Symmetry&#8230; is what results from the order that extends in every direction and multiplies them at our glance until we can no longer count them. By extending the sweep of an avenue so that its end is out of sight, the laws of optics and the effects of perspective given an impression of immensity; at each step, the objects appear in a new guise and our pleasure is renewed by a succession of different vistas. Finally, by some miracle which in fact is the result of our own movement but which we attribute to the objects around us, the latter seem to move with us, as if we had imparted Life to them.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72975\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?resize=680%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"667\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72975\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?w=1041&#38;ssl=1 1041w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?resize=320%2C314&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?resize=600%2C588&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?resize=240%2C235&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph1.jpg?resize=768%2C753&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aerial cross-section. Image courtesy of Bibliothèque nationale de France.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But my favorite part of the story is that Boullée found his formative inspiration, not only for the Newton cenotaph and but for his entire creative philosophy, in an unusual encounter with trees &#8212; those <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/05/04/natascha-mcelhone-wander-hesse-kew/\">profoundest of teachers</a>.</p>\n<p>One evening, heavy with grief, Boullée went for a walk along the edge of a forest. Under the moonlight, he noticed his shadow. He had seen his shadow a thousand times before, but the peculiar lens of his psychic state rendered it entirely new &#8212; a living artwork of &#8220;extreme melancholy.&#8221; Looking around, he saw the shadows of the trees in this new light, too, etching onto the ground the profound drama of life. The entire scene was suddenly awash in &#8220;all that is sombre in nature.&#8221; He had seen the state of his soul mirrored back by the natural world, as we so often do in those rawest moments when we are stripped to the base of our being, grounded into our creaturely senses. </p>\n<p>This was the moment of Boullée&#8217;s artistic awakening &#8212; that moment of revelation when, as Virginia Woolf wrote in her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/09/virginia-woolf-cotton-wool-moments-of-being/\">exquisite account of her own artistic awakening</a>, something lifts &#8220;the cotton wool of daily life&#8221; and we see the familiar world afresh. Boullée recounted:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The mass of objects stood out in black against the extreme wanness of the light. Nature offered itself to my gaze in mourning. I was struck by the sensations I was experiencing and immediately began to wonder how to apply this, especially to architecture. I tried to find a composition made up of the effect of shadows. To achieve this, I imagined the light (as I had observed it in nature) giving back to me all that my imagination could think of. That was how I proceeded when I was seeking to discover this new type of architecture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He called this new architecture &#8220;the architecture of shadow.&#8221; His vision for Newton&#8217;s cenotaph was its grand testament:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attempted to create the greatest of all effects, that of immensity; for that is what gives us lofty thoughts as we contemplate the Creator and give us celestial sensations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He attempted, more than that, to honor Newton on his own terms, by the essence of his genius:</p>\n<blockquote><p>O Newton! With the range of your intelligence and the sublime nature of your Genius, you have defined the shape of the earth; I have conceived the idea of enveloping you with your discovery&#8230; your own self. How can I find outside you anything worthy of you?</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72979\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?resize=680%2C411&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"411\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72979\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?w=1313&#38;ssl=1 1313w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?resize=320%2C193&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?resize=600%2C362&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?resize=240%2C145&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph4.jpg?resize=768%2C464&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of Bibliothèque nationale de France.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a further homage to Newton&#8217;s legacy, with Boullée regarded as a &#8220;divine system&#8221; of laws, he chose to suspend a sole spherical lamp over the tomb as the only decoration in the entire monument &#8212; anything else, he felt, would be &#8220;committing sacrilege.&#8221; The contrast of scales &#8212; the smaller sphere of the lamp inside the enormous sphere of the building &#8212; would dramatize the contrast of light and shadow, just as the moonlight had done that fateful night of artistic revelation by the trees. This would give the visitor the sense that they are &#8220;as if by magic floating in the air, borne in the wake of images in the immensity of space.&#8221; Boullée considered the play of light the vital element in this enchantment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is light that produces impressions which arouse in us various contradictory sensations depending on whether they are brilliant or sombre. If I could manage to diffuse in my temple magnificent light effects I would fill the onlooker with joy; but if, on the contrary, my temple had only sombre effects, I would fill him with sadness. If I could avoid direct light and arrange for its presence without the onlooker being aware of its source, the ensuing effect of mysterious daylight would produce inconceivable impression and, in a sense, a truly enchanting magic quality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At a time long before readily available electric light and light-projection, he leaned on Newton&#8217;s optics to envision something that was part Stonehenge and part Hayden Planetarium. A century and a half before the first modern planetarium dome, Boullée dotted the black interior of his dome with an intricate arrangement of tiny holes reflecting the positions of the constellations and the planets, streaming in daylight to create an enchanting nightscape inside. But unlike the modern counterpart, Boullée&#8217;s was a reversible planetarium &#8212; at night, the sole spherical light would irradiate the tiny holes from the other direction, making the dome appear as a self-contained universe if viewed from above. This, lest we forget, was the golden age of aeronautics, when hot-air balloons first defied gravity to lift the human animal into the sky. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72977\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?resize=680%2C412&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"412\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72977\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?w=1302&#38;ssl=1 1302w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?resize=320%2C194&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?resize=600%2C363&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?resize=240%2C145&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/boullee_newtoncenotaph6.jpg?resize=768%2C465&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Side cross-section.

We live by unconsciously measuring the inverse distances of our proximity: an intimacy calibrated by the vulnerability we feel in giving up our sense of separation.</p>\n<p>To go beyond our normal identities and become closer than close is to lose our sense of self in temporary joy, a form of arrival that only opens us to deeper forms of intimacy that blur our fixed, controlling, surface identity.</p>\n<p>To consciously become close is a courageous form of unilateral disarmament, a chancing of our arm and our love, a willingness to hazard our affections and an unconscious declaration that we might be equal to the inevitable loss that the vulnerability of being close will bring.</p>\n<p>Human beings do not find their essence through fulfillment or eventual arrival but by staying close to the way they like to travel, to the way they hold the conversation between the ground on which they stand and the horizon to which they go. What makes the rainbow beautiful, is not the pot of gold at its end, but the arc of its journey between here and there, between now and then, between where we are now and where we want to go, illustrated above our unconscious heads in primary colour.</p>\n<p>We are in effect, always, close; always close to the ultimate secret: that we are more real in our simple wish to find a way than any destination we could reach: the step between not understanding that and understanding that, is as close as we get to happiness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement Dawson&#8217;s poetic short film with Dylan Thomas&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/27/dylan-thomas-being-but-men/\">cinematic poem about how trees illuminate the wonder of our humanity</a> and Robert Macfarlane&#8217;s reflection on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/11/13/robert-macfarlane-underland-tree-love/\">how trees embody the secret to healthy relationships</a>, then revisit Whyte&#8217;s lyrical rerooting of the meanings of <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/16/david-whyte-consolations-courage-crisis/\">courage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/11/david-whyte-vulnerability/\">vulnerability</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/15/david-whyte-consolations-anger-forgiveness-maturity/\">forgiveness</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/29/david-whyte-consolations-words/\">love</a>.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.
