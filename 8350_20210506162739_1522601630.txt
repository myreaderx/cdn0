You can quickly start an approval flow from the same place you send a chat, in a channel conversation, or from the Approvals app itself. Just select an approval type, add details, attach files, and choose approvers. Once submitted, approvers are notified and can review and act on the request. <A href=\"http://aka.ms/ApprovalsinTeams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more</A>.</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO vid=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fdqSxKuJw\" align=\"center\" size=\"large\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z9fdqSxKuJw/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Offline autosend</STRONG><BR />The offline experience for Microsoft Teams chat and channels helps you to continue be productive even without a network connection.

Administrators who manage tenants that have less than or equal to 10,000 members can now create an org-wide team, which automatically syncs all the tenant’s members with the team. <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/create-an-org-wide-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more</A>.</P>\n<P><BR /><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>What’s New: Meetings</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P><STRONG>Meeting chat moderation settings&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P>Meeting organizers and teachers can now choose from three chat settings to help create a safe and inclusive meeting environment. Chats can be “Disabled”,&nbsp;preventing the organizer and participants from using the meeting chat. Alternatively, they can be set to “Only during the meeting”,&nbsp;allowing participants to send messages only during the meeting and the organizer to send messages at any time. Lastly, the default will be set to “Enabled”,&nbsp;allowing chats for all meeting attendees at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Meeting chat moderation settings.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/250445i1711DD73FB5AF020/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"Meeting chat moderation settings.png\" alt=\"Meeting chat moderation settings.png\" /></span></P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Add a shared calendar to a Teams channel</STRONG> <BR />Create and share a calendar with members of a specific channel.
