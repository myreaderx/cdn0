Several app developers on both iOS and Android have used Dark Sky's API for weather data for a while now, but like Android support, that's going away. There's a little more time in that case, though: developers have until the end of next year to find and implement alternative data sources.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1696055#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1696055&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 19:44:30 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-02-11.59.40-980x2156.jpg","linkMd5":"f19f60aaa0cc1f2a911cd68ea0ac45fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn20@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513614694_db166d4b184dedd6.webp","author":"Samuel Axon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-02-11.59.40-980x2156.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn20@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513614694_db166d4b184dedd6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513680725_780b50c54fe4ac6c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qZQ2kEe_2OU:uhXiDkVQ3QY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513680902_c13ea2090682d4f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn92@2020_2/2020-08-04/1596513680707_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_3/2020-08-04/1596513680773_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-04 11:59:29","updatedTime":"2020-08-04 11:59:29","title":"Genki Covert is a $75 ultra-portable dock for Nintendo Switch","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1696046","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200803_131353-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Clockwise from the top: a Nintendo Switch resting in an official Nintendo dock, a Switch Joy-Con, and the Genki Covert third-party dock.

It's the size and shape of a compact USB charger, with folding 120VAC prongs for US electrical power (slide-on adapters for other countries are included in the box). We know everybody's worried about third-party docks right now—but Genki's lead engineer is the one who first discovered <em>why</em> Switch consoles tended to brick in third-party docks. So the Covert feels like a safe bet.</p>\n<p>Although Covert Dock does come with a manual, you aren't going to need it—usage is very simple. You plug the Covert Dock directly into the wall, just as you would any compact phone charger. Plug an HDMI cable from the Covert Dock into your display, and plug the included USB-C 3.1 charge cable from your Switch to the Covert. Voila—a few seconds later, your Switch's video and audio are routed over HDMI to your display, and it's charging.</p>\n<h2>Simple device, real engineering</h2>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-right\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/71DY0hOVuTL._SL1500_-300x366.jpg\" alt=\"Genki Covert Dock for Nintendo Switch product image\" class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"></div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Genki Covert Dock for Nintendo Switch                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_65276805\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2PjajPF\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $75 at Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>It's effectively impossible to buy a Nintendo Switch right now—I know, I keep looking.

(credit: Educational Images)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>It has become abundantly clear that children tend to have less severe cases of COVID-19 and often experience no symptoms whatsoever. That doesn't mean that there's no risk—some kids clearly get severely ill, and some have died. But if the risks of reopening schools were based only on the symptoms experienced by children, then the evaluation would be relatively simple. But the risk evaluation is substantially more complex than that, since children can potentially spread the virus, even if they themselves do not experience symptoms. And those to whom they spread coronavirus, such as teachers and school support staff, may be at much higher risk of severe illness.</p>\n<p>Some studies of the virus' spread early on in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/tracking-covid-19s-spread-through-an-italian-town/\">children resisted infection</a>, but that hasn't been seen in every study. Now, some new reports are complicating matters even further. Two studies show that children may actually carry higher levels of the virus than adults. And another one indicates that the virus spread rapidly in a youth summer camp, an environment that may have some semblance to schools.</p>\n<h2>Lots of virus</h2>\n<p>While there are many factors that go into determining viral spread, the presence of the virus is an essential one. So a couple of groups has decided to look at how large a viral load children carry. One of these groups involved researchers who cooperated with people running testing centers in Germany, examining the <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125484v1\">3,300 people who tested positive</a> for SARS-CoV-2 out of 78,000 tests the groups had run.
