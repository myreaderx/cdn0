Although the masterpiece of such theming is probably New Orleans Square, one early and elaborate effort, the one that probably more than any other made the idea stick, was the Adventureland Bazaar across from the Jungle Cruise. Like Tomorrowland's Art Corner or New Orleans Square's One-of-a-Kind shop, the Bazaar was as much an interactive exhibit as it was a shopping experience, a chance to see some unique items and immerse in an environment. Featured areas included Polynesia (hawaiian shirts and dresses), India (etched brass), Asia (exotic imported items), and the Guatemalan Weavers.<br /><br />Magic Kingdom would both expand and repeat much of the success of these Disneyland shops, and indeed had its own Adventureland Bazaar and more. But the Bazaar still stands at Disneyland - or, at least, the shell of it is still there, although it's now filled with the same Disney stuff everywhere else sells. But the Bazaar, and practically all of the original Adventureland shops at Magic Kingdom are gone, and have been gone for nearly two decades now. That's a long time, long enough for many fans who never set foot inside the House of Treasure to grow to adulthood.<br /><br />We are dedicated as always to attempting the stem the tide of forgetting on this blog, and having been made aware that many not too much younger than I don't even know what the shape of these original Adventureland pseudo-attractions were like, the time to assemble and preserve this information was upon us. So set your time machines to the early 70s and let's discover those forgotten shops of Adventureland!<br /><br /><b>The Bazaar Complex</b><br /><br />We're going to begin with the most difficult of these areas to mentally reconstruct, which was the central Adventureland Bazaar, in the center of Adventureland near the Sunshine Tree Terrace. This area was destroyed for good back in 2001 when The Magic Carpets of Aladdin was installed, totally changing the relaxed vibe of central Adventureland. The Bazaar complex was made up of five shops surrounding a central open air courtyard.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pAgKCvKaO0Q/WrUpuzDHW5I/AAAAAAAAIYg/XgxpcpnLt-w-ljJawmeSOopB8pEeKlSngCLcBGAs/s1600/AL1191-07.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"496\" data-original-width=\"750\" height=\"263\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pAgKCvKaO0Q/WrUpuzDHW5I/AAAAAAAAIYg/XgxpcpnLt-w-ljJawmeSOopB8pEeKlSngCLcBGAs/s400/AL1191-07.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://disneypix.com/\">DisneyPix.Com</a></td></tr></tbody></table>Also included was a tall, pink covered area very much like the glass canopy over by the Adventureland Veranda that today acts as the entrance area to the Skipper Canteen. This was the original home of J.P. and the Silver Stars, Adventureland's steel drum band. When the drums were not set up, this was the de facto entrance to the Bazaar courtyard. In later years, as the steel drum band was more frequently seen in Caribbean Plaza, this area became home to exotic bird displays and, inevitably, merchandise.<br /><br />Here's J.P. and the Silver Stars doing their thing in 1971. This is the Band Stand / Gazebo on the left of the picture above.

The room was gutted, repainted blue, and became a computer office for Merchandise managers.<br /><br />That's all of the original Bazaar shops, but our story doesn't end here, because in the 80s a few of the shops changed theme.<br /><br /><b><u>The Zanzibar Shell Company</u></b><br />Opened: 1988<br />Closed: 2000<br />Became: Zanzibar Trading Company<br /><br />A conversion of Tropic Toppers, Zanzibar Shell Company came into being with the retirement of ticket books at Magic Kingdom and the conversion of the Adventureland ticket booth into a shop selling all of the Jungle Cruise-related hats and wares that Tropic Toppers used to specialize in. Instead, shells and shell-based jewelry and wind chimes became this shop's stock in trade.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-srTW_EPfGTk/WrZ4nsTQBDI/AAAAAAAAIbo/1BaeUAGn-Wwl68sw5gu0qwXHLvTiU0DEQCLcBGAs/s1600/Zanzibar%2BShell%2BTraders%2B01%2B%25281992%2529.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"576\" data-original-width=\"859\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-srTW_EPfGTk/WrZ4nsTQBDI/AAAAAAAAIbo/1BaeUAGn-Wwl68sw5gu0qwXHLvTiU0DEQCLcBGAs/s400/Zanzibar%2BShell%2BTraders%2B01%2B%25281992%2529.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Here's our only good view of the original interior, probably only lightly changed from its days as Tropic Toppers.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4BCf2Dgf_1M/WrZ5CPivZBI/AAAAAAAAIbs/yI7NwohHw64lBocbvfP7bzL_GbPkTxniwCLcBGAs/s1600/Zanzibar%2BShell%2BTraders%2B02%2B%25281992%2529.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"552\" data-original-width=\"848\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4BCf2Dgf_1M/WrZ5CPivZBI/AAAAAAAAIbs/yI7NwohHw64lBocbvfP7bzL_GbPkTxniwCLcBGAs/s400/Zanzibar%2BShell%2BTraders%2B02%2B%25281992%2529.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />In the late 90s with the rise of Paul Pressler and the then-new insistence that every part of Magic Kingdom individually turn a profit, out of the way shops like Zanzibar Shell Traders were converted into merchandise stock rooms. The existing merchandise was pushed out onto the shaded porch area of Traders, and the rear room became an offstage space. This new incarnation was called Zanzibar Traders and continued in operation until fairly recently, when it was turned entirely into shaded seating.<br /><br /><b><u>Elephant Tales</u></b><br />Opened: 1987<br />Closed: Early 2000<br />Became: Merchandise Stockroom<br /><br />In the 80s, Oriental Imports and The Magic Carpet were combined into the more explicitly safari-themed Elephant Tales. This mostly involved hanging props from the ceiling, converting the more modernistic light fixtures to a hodgepodge of \"themed\" ones, taking down the wall between the two shops, and stocking more of what Traders of Timbuktu was already selling.<br /><br />By the 90s, Elephant Tales had morphed into a catchall shop, selling Princess dresses and lots and lots of Aladdin and Lion King toys. Here's a shot Mike Lee took in 1994, taken from NEARLY the same location as the shot of Oriental Imports:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c8ccfd8IIi8/WrZ7Sz4J3cI/AAAAAAAAIb8/g9M1lXqz5AQE1z_XwormJgtIGpDHu_G-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Elephant%2BTales%2BOct1994.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1090\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c8ccfd8IIi8/WrZ7Sz4J3cI/AAAAAAAAIb8/g9M1lXqz5AQE1z_XwormJgtIGpDHu_G-ACLcBGAs/s400/Elephant%2BTales%2BOct1994.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />You can see that some of Oriental Imports' old merchandise has been repurposed.

Birnbaum describes the shop in 1982 as being \"summer stuff\", and by the early 90s when I remember it it was selling rainforest-themed items and small garden fountains. By the late 90s it had switched to selling swimwear and \"beach\" themed items.<br /><br />The shop did receive the same ludicrous \"beach\" overlay that Tiki Tropic did, included the well-remembered game of hopscotch printed on the floor called \"Island Hop\". With the exception of the blue ceiling and beach theme, this interior was basically unchanged since its days as an arcade:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H_7DxZswVKs/WrZ-sI6nKyI/AAAAAAAAIcI/hALfdtvOGI4sO1vnDbHaAyoKxhoX_X0RgCLcBGAs/s1600/island_supply_company_003.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"501\" data-original-width=\"969\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H_7DxZswVKs/WrZ-sI6nKyI/AAAAAAAAIcI/hALfdtvOGI4sO1vnDbHaAyoKxhoX_X0RgCLcBGAs/s400/island_supply_company_003.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />In early 2015, Island Supply was converted into a Sunglass Hut location. As we've seen earlier in this article, selling vaguely themed \"beach\" stuff is not a new concept in Adventureland. The interior is still basically the same as it always was.<br /><br /><b><u>Bwana Bob's</u></b><br />Opened: 1985<br />Closed: 2000<br />Relocated Elsewhere<br /><br />The original Adventureland ticket booth, Bwana Bob's was repurposed in the 80s to sell vaguely Jungle Cruise-related knick-knacks.

A lot of this has been chipped away today and many have forgotten how nice Caribbean Plaza was supposed to be, so let's move on from Adventureland to its neighbor for a quick look at what was there originally.<br /><br /><b><u>Plaza Del Sol Caribe</u></b><br />Opened: 1973<br />Still in Operation<br /><br />The Plaza Del Sol, today simply known as the \"Pirates Shop\", may have been the original gift shop that an attraction exited into, but it was once quite different than it is today. Originally as much of an atmospheric area as a gift shop, it sold Sombreros, silk flowers, pirate heads carved into coconuts, pirate swords, hats, as well as wind chimes and other \"patio\" pieces.<br /><br />There were very few freestanding merchandise display racks, with the merchandise overflowing from carts, similar to the visual presentation of the Plaza De Los Amigos at EPCOT Center. Indeed, the overall impression was as much an inviting plaza, similar to the one the attraction enters through, as it was a gift shop.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XH0CBmjibkY/WrfNg6UKrHI/AAAAAAAAIcY/xqyx_DIRYWQeFgqZGj8RVlS1ZsmdmAolACLcBGAs/s1600/Plaza%2BDel%2BSol%2B74.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"851\" data-original-width=\"1452\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XH0CBmjibkY/WrfNg6UKrHI/AAAAAAAAIcY/xqyx_DIRYWQeFgqZGj8RVlS1ZsmdmAolACLcBGAs/s400/Plaza%2BDel%2BSol%2B74.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Inevitably, this could not last forever, and by the time the 90s has rolled around, the Plaza shop was becoming increasingly cluttered with both Pirate and faux \"caribbean\" items, making it more of a true shop and less of an atmospheric walk past a trickling fountain.

This high ceilinged, atmospheric shop had three entrances: the high traffic one from the Plaza Del Sol Caribe, one facing north that spit out by the Caribbean Plaza pay phones and a shaded porch, and a rear exit that flowed into the secluded courtyard alongside the Pirates of the Caribbean queue, with the Fuente de Cielo azul.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13R5UyeUCyo/WrfP1bHuBPI/AAAAAAAAIcs/jXztmZP96684UOHUXNiSO3yxu0SZ_FUFQCLcBGAs/s1600/House%2Bof%2BTreasure%2BInt.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"434\" data-original-width=\"771\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13R5UyeUCyo/WrfP1bHuBPI/AAAAAAAAIcs/jXztmZP96684UOHUXNiSO3yxu0SZ_FUFQCLcBGAs/s400/House%2Bof%2BTreasure%2BInt.jpeg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pYtc5XcVVyo/WrfP80b3dzI/AAAAAAAAIcw/Un0A47GEPhsSYwq-lJ4npO5Z3lz1rT2JQCLcBGAs/s1600/FuenteCieloAzul.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"864\" data-original-width=\"1536\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pYtc5XcVVyo/WrfP80b3dzI/AAAAAAAAIcw/Un0A47GEPhsSYwq-lJ4npO5Z3lz1rT2JQCLcBGAs/s400/FuenteCieloAzul.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />When it was in operation, this was probably my favorite shop in Magic Kingdom.

I await the day when somebody in merchandise with real vision will turn this back into a shop that's accessible to everyone. Given that asking Disney to open a shop is something they'll happily do at any time, this evocative space shouldn't be closed off the way it is today.<br /><br /><b><u>The Pirates Arcade / Laffite's Portrait Deck</u></b><br />Opened: Late 1974<br />Closed: Late 90s<br />Became: Merchandise Stock Room<br /><br />Many of you know about or remember the House of Treasure, but have you thought of the gift shop on the other side of the Plaza recently? In late 1974, this small space, tucked between the main walkway of Caribbean Plaza and the restrooms, had replaced The Safari Club and become Adventureland's main arcade. Around 1978, the Pirate Arcade changed names, and was now known as Caverna De Los Pirates. By 1980, the arcade games were cleared out.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WT4qSzIR7BI/Wr0G5_579oI/AAAAAAAAIdg/YrzXJOV5xvw8rMP-Nte6eHOsWM5pF_mQACLcBGAs/s1600/caextlpd.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"577\" data-original-width=\"823\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WT4qSzIR7BI/Wr0G5_579oI/AAAAAAAAIdg/YrzXJOV5xvw8rMP-Nte6eHOsWM5pF_mQACLcBGAs/s400/caextlpd.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />What replaced it was an uncharge experience where guests could don pirate garb and get their photos taken in front of two backdrops: a tropical beach overflowing with treasure, or the deck of a sailing galleon. Similar to a photo experience on Main Street and frankly probably \"inspired\" by Knott's Berry Farm, Lafitte's Portrait Deck hung around at least until the early 90s.<br /><br />Originally featuring sculpted pirates, the location later began printing cartoon characters on top of photos, such a pirate Mickey and the Little Mermaid.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rwEhK6QXUcc/Wr0HJ27-cpI/AAAAAAAAIdk/U440bXuTb3olkmGesYI3rezE8-JPacrswCLcBGAs/s1600/caext2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"551\" data-original-width=\"880\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rwEhK6QXUcc/Wr0HJ27-cpI/AAAAAAAAIdk/U440bXuTb3olkmGesYI3rezE8-JPacrswCLcBGAs/s400/caext2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />By the mid-90s, Lafitte's Portrait Deck had become an unnamed side-adjunct to the Plaza Del Sol Caribe, selling pirate swords, hats, and other stuff. In the late 90s, it was closed and became a merchandise stock room.<br /><br /><b><u>The Crow's Nest</u></b><br />Opened: 1988<br />Closed: 2010<br />Became: A Pirate's Adventure Game<br /><br />A tiny little shop that opened next to the Frontierland Train Station and survived its demolition and relocation, The &nbsp;Crow's Nest offered film and disposable cameras, as well as being a drop-off spot for the park's in-house express photo developing service (such things did exist!).<br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6jV9Dw26EWI/Wr5aTxb7_9I/AAAAAAAAIeo/KdI9x5w7tlwOwbW7r1ZE36syosX8xERhwCLcBGAs/s1600/SS%2B-%2BThe%2BCrow%2527s%2BNest%2B%2528January%2B2010%2529.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"554\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6jV9Dw26EWI/Wr5aTxb7_9I/AAAAAAAAIeo/KdI9x5w7tlwOwbW7r1ZE36syosX8xERhwCLcBGAs/s400/SS%2B-%2BThe%2BCrow%2527s%2BNest%2B%2528January%2B2010%2529.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.mainstgazette.com/\">Main Street Gazette</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2mAaMeuXu5o/Wr5ad7VYHQI/AAAAAAAAIes/yYyKJ5Yk_qM9zR4metS72Ezid04gWEn4QCLcBGAs/s1600/115a%2BThe%2BCrows%2BNest.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2mAaMeuXu5o/Wr5ad7VYHQI/AAAAAAAAIes/yYyKJ5Yk_qM9zR4metS72Ezid04gWEn4QCLcBGAs/s400/115a%2BThe%2BCrows%2BNest.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />It had a tiny interior, with a register on the rear wall in front of a number of backlit photos of Magic Kingdom such as the castle and Splash Mountain. With the decline of film cameras and the exit of Kodak from the park as sponsors, the little hut became a quick stop for autograph books, toys, and toy guns. In 2010 it closed and became the \"headquarters\" for a Jack Sparrow themed interactive game, A Pirate's Adventure: Treasures of the Seven Seas.<br /><br /><b><u>The Golden Galleon &amp; La Princesa de Cristal</u></b><br />Opened: Early 1974<br />Closed: 1998<br />Became: El Pirata Y El Perico Seating<br /><br />The two most obscure Caribbean Plaza shops may be so for good reason. The area across from Pirates of the Caribbean was originally intended to be a shopping complex with a snack bar in front; the snack bar would eventually grow to take over its neighboring shops. In 1982, Steve Birnbaum describes El Pirata Y El Perico as offering \"ham and cheese submarine sandwiches, hot dogs, burritos, hot pretzels, brownies, and ice-cream bars\" - fairly standard for Disney snack stands of the era, where everything came directly out of a fridge or warming tray.<br /><br />Just past the main entrance to El Pirata, near the large arch that anchors the rear of Caribbean Plaza, is a large planter with walkways on either side of it as well as an open space that leads directly back towards an isolated courtyard that sits between the original locations of The Golden Galleon and La Princesa de Cristal. Today, this space is jam packed with tables, but imagine for a moment if instead it was an open space, with signs in the planter directing you back to the courtyard where you would discover yet more quaint and interesting shops. This is how it was in 1973, and how it remained until, along with so many other interesting features of Walt Disney World, was tossed out unceremoniously in the late 90s.<br /><br />The shop on the left was the Golden Galleon, home to gold, brass, and jeweled decorative fixtures. Anchored by an antique diver's helmet, the shop sold brass fittings, door stops, wall plaques, mirrors, ship's wheels, and spyglasses. It also featured a large number of authentic ships in bottles and, at least in the early 70s, was home to a large collection of authentic and reproduction scrimshaw!<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sR2ZLg0xtZs/Wr0PVKiIn7I/AAAAAAAAId4/GzSXq_KQ4oMHrf4zLjO_Bf9pG1qHXYYuwCLcBGAs/s1600/Golden%2BGalleon%2BInt.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"675\" data-original-width=\"834\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sR2ZLg0xtZs/Wr0PVKiIn7I/AAAAAAAAId4/GzSXq_KQ4oMHrf4zLjO_Bf9pG1qHXYYuwCLcBGAs/s400/Golden%2BGalleon%2BInt.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Across the way, La Princesa de Cristal was another Arribas Brothers location, very much like the ones that still exist on Main Street, in the Mexico Pavilion, and elsewhere. La Princesa was notable for specializing in crystal reproductions of sailing ships, ranging in size from a few inches to a few feet long. I haven't ever found anybody who took a photo of this location.<br /><br />Here's a view looking into Golden Galleon:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jYKYlecxNJQ/Wr5bBr3qB9I/AAAAAAAAIe0/QEO9PAwoyRMLhg-kw0hFQ8M75UXu5rPvgCLcBGAs/s1600/Princessa%2BDe%2BCristal%2BExt.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"891\" data-original-width=\"690\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jYKYlecxNJQ/Wr5bBr3qB9I/AAAAAAAAIe0/QEO9PAwoyRMLhg-kw0hFQ8M75UXu5rPvgCLcBGAs/s400/Princessa%2BDe%2BCristal%2BExt.png\" width=\"308\" /></a></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>That door and arch still exists, below the Caribbean Plaza arch. Modern park goers will be confused by a sunlight coming in the rear of the shop, but the 1998 expansion of Pecos Bill in Frontierland swallowed up a sunny courtyard that used to sit between Frontierland and Caribbean Plaza.<br /><br />That 1998 expansion of Pecos Bill is what finally sealed the fate of Golden Galleon &amp; La Princesa. Foods took over pretty much the entire western end of the west side of Magic Kingdom, filling in all of the space surrounding Pecos Bill which used to be open patio seating, and pushing into The Mile Long Bar at the exit of Country Bear Jamboree in the process. La Princesa was \"upgraded\" to a green-fringed cart which sat just outside its former digs, while El Pirata expanded to fill what was previously two shops. The crystal shop became home to a topping bar and restrooms, and Golden Galleon was converted to seating and connected directly to Pecos Bill via a ramp.<br /><br />The timing of the conversion for El Pirata was not fortuitous. Park attendance was already slipping following years of eroding fan goodwill during the 90s, and the opening of Animal Kingdom did not grow attendance as expected but instead cannibalized the other three parks. Following the dip in tourism following the 2001 terror attacks, El Pirata went on seasonal operation and has never really came back.<br /><br />In late 2005, Magic Kingdom toyed with offering El Pirata as a buffet location. Catered by the Contemporary, the buffet was operated for a few weekends. The topping bar was cleared out of the La Princesa space, hot food was brought in, and steaks were grilled in the courtyard. It never returned.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vq7sTo3XaOA/Wr0VD7D95AI/AAAAAAAAIeQ/whPxKI8PVRIvQjGM2ZdYuB7aAPnmRExjgCLcBGAs/s1600/P4010056.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"640\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vq7sTo3XaOA/Wr0VD7D95AI/AAAAAAAAIeQ/whPxKI8PVRIvQjGM2ZdYuB7aAPnmRExjgCLcBGAs/s400/P4010056.JPG\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BKLYtQE7Ktw/Wr0VK2EO0TI/AAAAAAAAIeU/_aUWnnOqu7YTUgCpATuzd4Dqrns6gUzoACLcBGAs/s1600/P4010055.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"640\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BKLYtQE7Ktw/Wr0VK2EO0TI/AAAAAAAAIeU/_aUWnnOqu7YTUgCpATuzd4Dqrns6gUzoACLcBGAs/s400/P4010055.JPG\" width=\"300\" /></a></div><br />In February 2011, El Pirata Y El Perico received a name change and new theme: Tortuga Tavern, with a vaguely defined tie-in with a line of Captain Jack Sparrow young adult novels being published at the time. The cosmetic overhaul did nothing to change the location's fortunes. This \"restaurant\" has rarely been open two months out of the year for nearly 20 years now.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5w83m4cRY7Q/WsG0jCZKarI/AAAAAAAAIfg/IOtywmZb9lgdlE69NqSFMtu67KHMrEfrwCLcBGAs/s1600/g4205.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1402\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5w83m4cRY7Q/WsG0jCZKarI/AAAAAAAAIfg/IOtywmZb9lgdlE69NqSFMtu67KHMrEfrwCLcBGAs/s400/g4205.png\" width=\"350\" /></a></div><br /><br />There's no reason that Disney needs to waste all of this valuable real estate - it's hard to imagine that clearing out The Pirate's League and reopening it as a store would make that location any less profitable than it is now. La Princessa de Cristal is never coming back, given that it now houses two restrooms, but the former The Golden Galleon space sometimes isn't even open when Tortuga Tavern is. Merchandise across Walt Disney World has been experiencing something of a renaissance lately, and specialty shops like Memento Mori or the Dress Shop regularly set social media ablaze with new and exclusive merchandise offerings.<br /><br />It's hard to see that a new line of Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise offered in either of those two spaces wouldn't do well. More importantly, reclaiming House of Treasure and Lafitte's for merchandise sales would both help traffic move through the exit of Pirates of the Caribbean and restore much of the charm of the area that's been lost.<br /><br />As for the Adventureland Bazaar, it's safe to say that for now removal of the Magic Carpets of Aladdin is unlikely. However, there's still the old Magic Carpet / Elephant Tales space sitting right behind and connected to the operating Adventureland shops. Again, an exclusive line of Jungle Cruise and Tiki Rom merchandise in this location could do well, adding some prestige to this very compromised area and the semi-hidden nature of the location wouldn't matter much in the era of social media marketing.<br /><br />Given that Disney just spent the better part of a decade rebuilding Downtown Disney into the high-end retail mecca of Disney Springs, it seems strange that so little attention is being paid to underutilized areas of their keystone park that were intended to offer the kind of varied, exclusive, themed shopping experience that Disney can deliver. These spaces are sitting there, just waiting for somebody to come along with the imagination to use them properly.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Special thanks to Mike Lee, Todd McCartney, Whit Elam, and many others who contributed to this article.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Want more <a href=\"http://passport2dreams.blogspot.com/2016/01/walt-disney-world-history-hub.html\">vintage Walt Disney World history</a>?
