But I just learned that I can whip out Google Maps to find my way around the airport (by searching the airport name and terminal number), so I no longer waste time running around looking for my snack of choice.</p>\n  <p>For two decades, Google has built products that make my life more useful. Eight of these products now have a billion users, and with all that extra time at the airport, I got to thinking—how many other unknown tips and tricks are out there? Since Google is celebrating <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/marking-20ish-years-google/\">its 20th birthday this month</a>, I present a party favor: tips on Google’s most-used products, straight from the people who helped build them.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3></h3>\n  <h2>Search</h2>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><b>For lovers of covers:</b>Try searching for a song and then tapping “other recordings” for different renditions.<br /></li>\n   <li><b>Don’t burn daylight:</b> Make the most of your daylight hours by knowing when the sun will go down. Search [sunset] to get the time the sun will set today.<br /></li>\n   <li><b>For content connoisseurs:</b>If you’re a fan of bingeable TV shows or a movie buff, you can see all the places to stream any show or film by searching [watch] followed by the title.

Much to their surprise, they didn’t have to fix an issue for us. <br /></p>\n  <p><b>What’s one thing you wish people would do before they came to IT?</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: Basic troubleshooting, like restarting a machine. You’d be surprised how many problems are resolved with a simple reboot.</p>\n  <p>Charles: Another tip would be to clear your cache and cookies before stopping by. This can help if you force a shutdown while a program is trying to update. If the program closes before it saves whatever it was doing, it can cause issues—clearing cache can help sometimes.</p>\n  <p><b>If you could wave a wand and eliminate a recurring problem that you deal with, what would it be?</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: The blue screen of death when machines don’t run on a modern OS. It causes disruption and takes entirely too long to remediate. I wish it would just go away.</p>\n  <p>Charles: Resetting passwords or sign-in credentials, in general. I’d love it if we didn’t have to do this, but I understand that people forget.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>What’s your favorite Google product hack or tip?</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: If you type “chrome://restart” into your Chrome browser, it’ll restart your browser and re-open tabs. I use this if my connection is slow or if my browser doesn’t load properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Charles: I like to save time with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594\">Gmail shortcuts</a>. If you want to learn what shortcuts are available, click <b>Shift + ?</b> and you’ll see a list of shortcuts appear on your screen. Just make sure to enable keyboard shortcuts in your Gmail settings first! If you’re working on a Chromebook with Chrome OS, you can click <b>CTRL + ALT + ?</b> and they’ll appear.</p>\n  <p><b>What's the weirdest or funniest laptop mishap you've encountered at Google?</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: I once had someone come in with a clicking noise on their laptop. I opened the bottom case of their computer and found a piece of a plastic arm from a toy stuck within the base. The person laughed and said, “oh kids…”</p>\n  <p>Charles: Do you know those little silicon packets that come in packaging or new clothing items? We’ve had dozens of people come into Techstop because their headphone ports stop working. Apparently, these packets get left within backpacks, the beads burst and they jam headphone jacks. Look out for those pesky things.</p>\n  <p><b>If you could describe working in IT in just 3 words, what would they be? (Feel free to make them fun!)</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: Unpredictable. Exciting. Gratifying.</p>\n  <p>Charles: Fluid. Inquisical. Magical.</p>\n  <p><b>What do you think your job will look like in 5 years?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Emma: In five years, almost all of our IT systems will be cloud-based. Since troubleshooting systems will be a thing of the past, I think we’ll work tighter with product and data analytics teams to suggest and test new systems and environments.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Charles: We help thousands of employees fix IT issues, and we're able to do this efficiently by focusing on how to address problems that happen over and over again. We call this \"root reduction.” Root reduction helps us scale our IT services, and it also frees up our schedules so that we can focus on more strategic work. In five years, I think we’ll use the time we save through root reduction to become internal IT consultants for teams. We’ll embed with individual departments to help them solve trickier problems or workflows specific to their needs.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>From resetting our passwords to debugging and fixing a system crash, we salute you “IT guy” (or gal!). Thanks for keeping us online, even when we drown our computers in coffee.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 16:30:00 +0000","feedId":2491,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_20190725_161852.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"1348684829ada8e4c67cb7f6c2d531a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-23-21-325_9ee03fedd93fea71.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":750,"sourceBytes":1406403,"destBytes":146564,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_20190725_161852.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/15-23-21-325_9ee03fedd93fea71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OfficialGmailBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-23-21-167_f695eb70b3ce7626.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OfficialGmailBlog?i=j6bid0wl4M0:sfgCeehRv3M:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-23-49-702_a187a781f6ed7ac4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialGmailBlog/~4/j6bid0wl4M0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/15-23-49-749_8a6c86b9ccd1071a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282600988},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:23:20","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:23:20","title":"Helping enterprises stay competitive with new updates in G Suite","link":"https://blog.google/products/g-suite/helping-enterprises-stay-competitive-with-new-updates-in-g-suite/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In 1958, U.S. corporations <a href=\"https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2016/7/4-ways-drive-business-value-start-speed\">remained</a> on the S&amp;P 500 index for an average of 61 years, according to the American Enterprise Foundation. Fast forward to today and companies are being replaced approximately every two weeks. In this rapidly changing market, traditional companies are looking for ways to stay competitive and more and more enterprises, including Nielsen, Colgate and Airbus, are turning to G Suite to help them reimagine how they work to keep pace.</p>\n  <p>We know that enterprises want to move to cloud-first collaboration to transform how they work, but, understandably, they have questions about how to make it work in a business of their size. What happens with email security? How can they manage their data? How does G Suite work with the tools and systems they already have in place?</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/work-reimagined-new-ways-to-collaborate-safer-smarter-and-simpler-with-g-suite\">we announced</a> new products to help businesses reimagine how they work, and today we’re sharing additional solutions we’ve built to address these concerns.</p>\n  <p>Here’s a snapshot of what we’re announcing today. Read on for more detail.</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><p>New Gmail (Redesigned security warnings, Snooze, Offline Access and more generally available for G Suite users)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Cloud Search (being deployed by an initial set of customers)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Google Voice for G Suite (available in our Early Adopter Program*)</p></li>\n   <li><p>Drive Enterprise Sku (available for purchase)</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>Keeping businesses (and emails) secure</h3>\n  <p>Keeping your data secure is our top priority, which is why we use machine learning to analyze threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. Machine learning helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute.</p>\n  <p>Today, <b>we’re making the new Gmail generally available to G Suite customers</b> so that, in addition to these baked-in security features, more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze, offline access and more. You can learn more <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/new-gmail-ga.html\">in this post</a>.</p>\n  <h3>Bringing the best of Google Search to enterprise data</h3>\n  <p>Searching through your company’s data should be as easy as doing a web search. But the reality is most companies’ information is spread across different silos and systems that don’t talk to each other, which makes finding things a lengthy chore. We <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-google-cloud-search-g-suite/\">introduced Cloud Search</a> last year to make it easy to find information across G Suite in a way that’s intuitive and assistive. Today, we are announcing <b>new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite</b>, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-prem.</p>\n  <p>Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. Using Cloud Search’s new SDKs, APIs and connectors for third-party connectivity, Whirlpool created a custom app called Whirlpool SearchPro that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-prem and cloud systems and returns results in 100s of milliseconds on average. Moreover, search results reflect the specific permissions and access controls from each of the source systems to ensure that individuals only see the information they should.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Whirlpool Cloud Search - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Whirlpool-cloud-search-1280x720_PVn7Rir.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Cloud Search’s new functionality will be available to G Suite Enterprise customers as well as &nbsp;any company looking to power their enterprise search needs as a new standalone offering.

Aside from bringing the best of video conferencing to businesses, we also want to create better telephony solutions so that employees can be more productive over the phone. For close to a decade, millions of consumers have used Google Voice to connect with folks across the globe. <b>Now we’re bringing an enterprise version of Voice to G Suite</b>.</p>\n  <p>On top of the existing features that users love, Google Voice is tightly integrated with G Suite apps, like Hangouts Meet and Google Calendar, and provides administrator capabilities best suited for the enterprise. Admins can manage users, provision and port phone numbers, access detailed reports and set up call routing functionality. Voice also lets you deploy phone numbers to employees, or even entire departments, at once, and assigns a &nbsp;number that’s not tied to a specific device.

But for a lot of us, that’s where the understanding ends. With <a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/\">Next ’19</a>, Google Cloud’s annual customer conference, this week, it’s a good time to ask: What is this cloud, anyway?</p>\n  <p>Before cloud, businesses maintained fleets of computers (known as “servers” in tech speak) to create websites and apps, and to equip employees with the software needed to build them. Those computers stayed in a server room or a nearby data center, connected by an internal network and to the broader internet. A company’s IT team had to monitor all those computers, network cables and other equipment—and keep it all working for employees, under budget. So that meant that every few years, the IT team bought new computers and took care of any maintenance and upgrades, like adding a new networking line or new software.</p>\n  <p>Cut to today: we have faster computing speeds and better internet connectivity, and these have made it easier for computers around the world to connect quickly. It’s no longer necessary for businesses to own servers and data centers. Since Google already has a massive global network—made up of things like <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/expanding-our-global-infrastructure-new-regions-and-subsea-cables\">our own data centers and undersea cables</a>—we can provide that infrastructure to businesses so they can build products and services. In a nutshell, that’s what Google Cloud is—access to Google’s global infrastructure and all the state-of-the-art tools we’ve created over time to serve Google’s billions of users.</p>\n  <p>This new way of <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/A-history-of-cloud-computing\">building in the cloud</a> has resulted in changes to the way that companies use computers and other technology.</p>\n  <p><b>Why is the cloud such a big deal?</b></p>\n  <p>The cloud took the tech world by storm, and it keeps growing for consumer and business uses. Companies want to use the newest, fastest technology, which isn’t possible when you’re only buying new computers every few years.</p>\n  <p>Public cloud providers allow companies to use the newest technology without having to buy and maintain it themselves. Google Cloud, for example, maintains complicated networks that can quickly move data around the world. Keeping information secure, a challenge for businesses, is also easier with the cloud, since encryption is built in. Plus, the huge scale of cloud means it can run apps faster.</p>Cloud companies \n  <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/projects/machine-learning/\">can also be more efficient</a> with space and power. At Google, we \n  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/renewable-energy/\">buy enough wind and solar</a> to offset the electricity we use, so our customers can \n  <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/why-building-environmentally-responsible-cloud-matters/\">get sustainability benefits</a> they might not get on their own.\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Cooling towers at a data center in Belgium.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Cooling_towers_at_a_data_center_in_Belgium.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p><i>Cooling towers at a data center in Belgium</i></p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>How does cloud affect your everyday life?</b></p>\n  <p>When businesses started using the cloud, their customers started using the cloud, too. It makes lots of what we do on our phones, tablets, and laptops possible. For example, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/hitting-send-on-the-next-15-years-of-gmail/\">Gmail became popular pretty quickly</a>, because it offered a lot more storage so you could keep all your emails—even ones with large attachments. Gmail works because instead of storing emails on one limited server somewhere, a giant network of servers stores those emails. When you check your email, a server in one of those data centers is finding and downloading your newest emails and routing them to your computer or phone. Plus, because Gmail is cloud-based, this opens up opportunities for machine learning to help you in ways you might not notice, like <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/ridding-gmail-of-100-million-more-spam-messages-with-tensorflow\">blocking phishing and spam attempts</a> to your inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>What do people talk about at a cloud conference?</b></p>\n  <p>When 30,000 or so people converge in San Francisco at <a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/\">Google Cloud Next ’19</a> this week, they’ll be choosing from hundreds of sessions, panels, and tutorials to learn about cloud computing. Some attendees may be just getting started with the cloud and need to learn the basics, while others are exploring advanced concepts like AI and machine learning. Lots of the sessions explain how Google Cloud-specific products can be used. There are sessions on connecting products from outside of Google Cloud into ours and showing business users how to move their data into the cloud.</p>\n  <p>That’s your start to understanding cloud.

In typical Google fashion, we’re helping you connect with the world around you (and having a bit of fun) across our products:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>In Google Maps, this year's parade routes are paved with rainbows.<br /></li>\n   <li>You'll find rainbow \"easter eggs\" scattered through Google Search and G Suite, and you can join the fun from your desktop by switching your Gmail to a Pride theme for the month of June.<br /></li>\n   <li>Google Play Newsstand has a special feature page for Pride-related coverage.<br /></li>\n   <li>On YouTube, we're celebrating the LGBTQ+ creators who are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGPAYvve1A\">#ProudToCreate</a> a better future with their imagination, creativity, talent, and truth through our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBR8-60-B28hp2BmDPdntcQ\">YouTube Spotlight Channel</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouTube\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/youtube/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>.<br /></li>\n   <li>We continue to help businesses declare their establishments \"LGBTQ+ Friendly\" or \"Transgender Safe Space\" on their business listings in Google Maps and Google Search.<br /></li>\n   <li>One year on from our <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/google-org/remembering-stonewall-1969/\">initial donation</a> to the LGBT Center of New York in collaboration with the National Parks Foundation, Google.org is contributing another $500,000 (for a total of $1.5 Million) to the Center to help with the digitization of LGBTQ+ history. The project is called <a href=\"http://stonewallforever.org\">Stonewall Forever</a>, and <a href=\"https://stonewallforever.org/contribute/\">we need your help</a> to find, preserve, and share the untold stories of LGBTQ+ history.<br /></li>\n   <li>Google Arts &amp; Culture has a <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/pride\">dedicated Pride collection celebrating LGBTQ+ history</a>, with 20 exhibits and over 2,700 artifacts, part of which comes from the Stonewall Forever project.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Ballasts, like families, help us stay steady amidst commotion.

Yet email has largely stayed the same with static messages that eventually go out of date, or are merely a springboard to accomplish a more complex task. If you want to take action, you usually have to click on a link, open a new tab and visit another website.</p>\n  <p>Starting today, we’re making emails more useful and interactive in Gmail. Your emails can stay up to date so you’re always seeing the freshest information, like the latest comment threads and recommended jobs. With dynamic email, you can easily take action directly from within the message itself, like RSVP to an event, fill out a questionnaire, browse a catalog or respond to a comment.</p>\n  <p>Take commenting in Google Docs, for example. Instead of receiving individual email notifications when someone mentions you in a comment, now, you’ll see an up-to-date thread in Gmail where you can easily reply or resolve the comment, right from within the message.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"gmail_comment.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/gmail_comment_0gWZkHB.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Businesses have also already started using dynamic email to make their emails more actionable and relevant, like Booking.com, Despegar, Doodle, <a href=\"https://www.ecwid.com/blog/e-commerce-email\">Ecwid</a>, Freshworks, Nexxt, <a href=\"https://medium.com/oyotech/amp-for-email-making-interactive-and-dynamic-email-experiences-at-oyo-ed7a6d8754b3\">OYO Rooms</a>, Pinterest and redBus. Check out examples below—you’ll start to see these dynamic emails in the next few weeks.</p>\n  <p>First, Pinterest has made it easier to discover new ideas and save them to boards:</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"gmail_Pinterest.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/gmail_Pinterest_WirhvSL.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Next, with OYO Rooms, you can browse recommended hotels and rentals, and view details in fewer clicks right from the email:</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"gmail_oyo.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Dynamic-Mail_Oyo.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>And with Doodle’s dynamic email, you can respond to meeting&nbsp;without opening another website:</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"gmail_doodle.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Dynamic-Mail_Doodle.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Like the rest of Gmail, dynamic email is safeguarded by best-in-class privacy and security protections.

Mobile support is coming soon. If you’re a G Suite customer, you will be able to <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/03/dynamic-email-in-gmail-beta.html\">enable dynamic email for your organization</a> in the <a href=\"https://admin.google.com/AdminHome?hl=en#AppDetails:service=email\">Admin console</a> in the next few days.

But in a few short months, working together took on a whole new meaning, and meetings became about so much more than getting things done. From doctor check-up meetings, to meetings with financial advisors, to study meetings, workout meetings, and birthday meetings. They may not look or feel like traditional meetings, but they’re the most important meetings happening right now.</p>\n  <p>That’s why we’ve re-engineered Google Meet, originally built for secure business meetings, to make it free and available to all. Since making Meet's advanced features free for all G Suite and G Suite for Education users in March, we've seen daily usage grow by 30x, with Meet hosting 3 billion minutes of video meetings daily. Last month, we were adding roughly 3 million new users every day. That's why we're expanding the offering to more people around the world.</p>\n  <p>Now that the rollout <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/\">we announced</a> two weeks ago is complete, anyone with an email address can sign up and get started at <a href=\"http://meet.google.com\">meet.google.com</a>, for free. And to make meetings even more accessible and helpful, in the coming days you’ll also be able to use Meet directly in Gmail.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_1_Meet_in_Gmail_highlight.max-2000x2000.png);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Gmail 1 Meet in Gmail highlight.png</span>\n       </div>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Gmail-2.-Start-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">[Gmail]-2.-Start-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif</span>\n       </div>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Gmail-3-Join-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">[Gmail]-3-Join-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif</span>\n       </div>\n      </figure></li>\n    </ul>\n    <div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics=\"{\n            &quot;event&quot;: &quot;page interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;category&quot;: &quot;interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;action&quot;: &quot;image carousel&quot;,\n            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;arrow - left click&quot;\n           }\" data-glue-pagination-label=\"Previous\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\">\n     <div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\">\n      <svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left\" role=\"img\">\n       <use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use>\n      </svg>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics=\"{\n            &quot;event&quot;: &quot;page interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;category&quot;: &quot;interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;action&quot;: &quot;image carousel&quot;,\n            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;arrow - right click&quot;\n           }\" data-glue-pagination-label=\"Next\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\">\n     <div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\">\n      <svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right\" role=\"img\">\n       <use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use>\n      </svg>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__navigation\">\n    <div class=\"glue-pagination-page-list uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics=\"{\n            &quot;event&quot;: &quot;page interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;category&quot;: &quot;interaction&quot;,\n            &quot;action&quot;: &quot;image carousel&quot;,\n            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;arrow - dot click&quot;\n           }\"></div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Click “Start a meeting\" and a new window opens with a unique, secure meeting for you to join and then share with others. You can also easily join meetings shared with you by entering a meeting code. And you can plan video meetings and invite others directly from Google Calendar.</p>\n  <p>Because video meetings have never been more important, we’ve been fast-tracking the most requested features for Meet, and are now making them available to all. Anyone can use Meet’s simple scheduling and screen sharing, real-time captions, and layouts that adapt to your preference, including an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/productivity-collaboration/introducing-tiled-view-and-other-top-requested-features-in-google-meet\">expanded tiled view</a>—all built on Google’s secure, reliable global infrastructure. Speaking from my own experience, the new features in Meet are already making our team (and my family) meetings better. We love how tiled view makes us feel more connected—and the occasional surprise visits from kids and family pets!&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>And we’re continuing to look for ways to make Google Meet more accessible and useful. For example, we know video meetings can be challenging to follow&nbsp;for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, which is why we made sure AI-powered automatic live captioning was available to everyone. One of the most meaningful emails I’ve received was from a parent whose child was able to feel more included thanks to live captioning. Google AI has also made it possible to provide helpful features like low-light mode, which can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P4p6CdOhkvQ\">automatically adjust your video</a> to make you more visible to others.</p>\n  <p>Meet is available for free for everyone at <a href=\"http://meet.google.com\">meet.google.com</a> and on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1013231476\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings\">Android</a>. If you have an existing Google Account (for example, if you’re a @gmail.com user), you can sign in at <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/\">meet.google.com</a> to get started. If you don’t have a free Google Account, it only takes a minute to create one using your work or personal email address of choice (we require this step as a security measure, and you’ll only need to do this once). Or look for Meet right in Gmail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We hope Meet will help you connect to all your important meetings—from work meetings, to graduation meetings, to wedding meetings, and everything in between.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 May 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2491,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OfficialGmailBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"23543d8d1cca4c2f0cc129bfff1de3ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-23-21-167_f695eb70b3ce7626.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OfficialGmailBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-23-21-167_f695eb70b3ce7626.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OfficialGmailBlog?i=vR4TK60N57I:LT8aoG-C3yA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-23-50-696_8296351ec780ab47.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialGmailBlog/~4/vR4TK60N57I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-23-49-722_4d14ee675a067b09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282600986},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:23:20","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:23:20","title":"5 ways the new Gmail can help you get more done","link":"https://blog.google/products/gmail/5-ways-new-gmail-can-help-you-get-more-done/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We launched the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/stay-composed-heres-quick-rundown-new-gmail/\">new Gmail</a> earlier this year and packed it with features to help you prioritize and accomplish things right from your inbox.

For a recap on what’s happened in G Suite this year thus far, read on.</p>\n  <p><b>Communication is key.</b></p>\n  <p>Time flies. Earlier this year, we celebrated <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/15-years-and-counting-making-gmail-work-faster-and-smarter-for-businesses\">Gmail’s 15th birthday</a>. To commemorate the occasion, we introduced new features in your favorite email to help you <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/\">write emails faster</a> (with the help of machine learning), and also made it possible to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9214606\">schedule</a> when your emails go through to colleagues. Gmail also got <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/\">more dynamic</a> so that you can take action straight from within your inbox, like resolving Google Docs comments. Lastly, we gave Gmail’s mobile interface <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/making-gmail-on-mobile-better-for-you/\">a good sprucing up</a>—hello gorgeous!</p>Besides updating Gmail, we also brought businesses a secure (and intelligent) way to communicate no matter location or device: \n  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/helping-businesses-work-faster-smarter-and-more-collaboratively-in-g-suite\">Google Voice for G Suite</a>. Built in the cloud, Voice for G Suite is smart enough to transcribe voicemails for you and block pesky spam calls. Say goodbye to lengthy conference bridge numbers.\n  <hr />\n  <b>Take-home tip</b>: While we’re on the subject, if you accidentally click “send” on an email that you didn’t mean to, you can recall it by clicking “undo” at the bottom of your inbox. It appears after you’ve sent an email and stays on your screen for up to 30 seconds before disappearing. You can \n  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2819488\">choose the length</a> that it appears in your settings.\n  <p></p>\n  <hr />\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"G Suite Undo Feature\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/526-GS-UndoSendFeature-PM.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>Putting the team in “teamwork.”&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>People talk all the time about how collaboration is key, but nearly everyone defines collaboration differently.

Here’s our take: we think software can only be called collaborative if your tools are easy to use and if they help people stay productive. It’s called “<i>teamwork</i>,” after all.</p>In G Suite, we’re focused on making our apps intuitive and intelligent so that people can accomplish things quicker. That’s why we recently added things like \n  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/let-grammar-suggestions-in-google-docs-help-you-write-even-better\">intelligent grammar suggestions</a> in Docs. But we think all work tools should integrate together easily, no matter if they’re Google apps or apps outside of G Suite.

Fortunately, G Suite gives you the tools you need to stay focused and organized. Welcome to the Gmail edition of The Suite Life, a series that brings you tips and tricks to get the most out of G Suite. In this post, we’ll provide advice to help you save time and get more done—right from your Gmail inbox.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>Tip 1: Write now, send later with Schedule send</h3>\n  <p>Whether you’re firing off a reply outside of normal work hours, collaborating with teammates across time zones, or want to send your future self a reminder, there are lots of reasons to schedule an email instead of hitting send right away. With <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9214606\">Schedule send</a>, you can plan exactly when your email will be sent in Gmail. This means your emails can reach teammates at a time that's convenient for them.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqlCFCiej-I&amp;list=PLU8ezI8GYqs5zUuo096bI4_FFgeWAR1ug&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"the suite life - schedule send.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/the_suite_life_-_schedule_send.max-1000x1000.jpg\" /></a>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Here’s how:</p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><p>When you’re done writing your email, click the arrow to the right of the Send button in Gmail.</p></li>\n   <li><p>Select “Schedule send.”</p></li>\n   <li><p>Choose a date and time that works for you.</p></li>\n   <li><p>Once you’ve scheduled at least one email, you’ll see a new box called Scheduled where you can view emails set to be sent, change times, or cancel the send.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  <hr />\n  <p><b>Pro-tip:</b> Curious to know how Googlers stay on top of things?

Now, more than 4 million paying businesses are using our suite to reimagine how they work, and companies like Whirlpool, Nielsen, BBVA and Broadcom are among the many who choose G Suite to move faster, better connect their teams and advance their competitive edge.</p>\n  <p>In the past year, our team has worked hard to offer nearly 300 new capabilities for G Suite users.

Admins can identify which users are potentially infected, see if anything’s been shared externally and remove access to Drive files or delete malicious emails. Since the investigation tool makes it possible to review your data security in one place and has a simple UI, it makes it easier to take action against threats without having to worry about analyzing logs which can be time-consuming and require complex scripting. Investigation tool is available today as part of our <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/campaigns/index__investigation-security.html\">Early Adopter Program</a> (EAP) for G Suite Enterprise customers. <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/fix-security-threats-g-suite-investigation-tool.html)\">Learn more</a>.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Investigation Tool in Security Center - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Blog-investigation-tool-1920x1080_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In addition to giving admins a simpler way to keep data secure, we’re constantly working to ensure that they have the transparency and control they need. <b>That’s why we’re adding support for data regions to G Suite.</b> For organizations with data control requirements, G Suite will now let customers choose where to store primary data for select G Suite apps—globally distributed, U.S. or Europe.

It processes hundreds of millions of messages daily and already drives more than 10 percent of email replies. Today we’re announcing that <b>Smart Reply is coming to Hangouts Chat</b> to help you respond to messages quicker so you can free up time to focus on creative work.</p>\n  <p>Our technology recognizes which messages most likely need responses, and proposes three different replies that sound like how you typically respond. The proposed responses are casual enough for chat and yet appropriate in a workplace. Smart Reply in Hangouts Chat will be available to G Suite customers in the coming weeks.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Smart Reply in Hangouts Chat - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SmartReplyV2_in_Chat_cz4jjUr.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Smart Reply makes sending short replies easy, especially on the go. But we know that the most time-consuming emails require longer, more complex thoughts. That’s why we built <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/\">Smart Compose</a>, which you may have heard Sundar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWLcyFtni6U&amp;itct=CAsQpDAYCCITCLevpoL2_dkCFTLIwQod-1oGBTIHcmVsYXRlZEjvpNiYoPmEpIoB&amp;app=desktop\">talk about</a> at Google I/O this year. Smart Compose intelligently autocompletes your emails; it can fill in greetings, sign offs and common phrases so you can collaborate efficiently. We first launched Smart Compose to consumers in May, and now <b>Smart Compose in Gmail is ready for G Suite customers.</b></p>\n  <p>In addition to autocompleting common phrases, Smart Compose can insert personalized information like your office or home address, so you don’t need to spend time in repetitive tasks. And best of all, it will get smarter with time—for example, learning how you prefer to greet certain people in emails to ensure that when you use Smart Compose you sound like yourself.</p>\n  <p>Smart Compose in Gmail will be available to G Suite customers in the coming weeks.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Smart Compose - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/New_Smart-compose-2560x1440_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We’re also using AI to help people write more clearly and effectively. It can be tricky at times to catch things like spelling and grammatical errors that inadvertently change the meaning of a sentence. That’s why <b>we’re introducing grammar suggestions in Docs.</b> To solve grammar corrections, we use a unique machine translation-based approach to recognize errors and suggest corrections on the fly. Our AI can catch several different types of corrections, from simple grammatical rules like how to use articles in a sentence (like “a” versus “an”), to more complicated grammatical concepts such as how to use subordinate clauses correctly. Machine learning will help improve this capability over time to detect trickier grammar issues. And because it’s built natively in Docs, it’s highly secure and reliable. Grammar suggestions in Docs is available today in our <a href=\"http://g.co/GrammarEAP\">Early Adopter Program</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Grammar in Docs - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Spelling-grammar-1280x720.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Beyond writing, we’re also working to improve meetings. Last fall, G Suite launched <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/meeting-room-g-suite/\">Hangouts Meet hardware</a>, enabling organizations to have reliable, effective video meetings at scale. Many people still view connecting to video meetings as daunting, which is why we’re using Google AI to create a more inviting experience.</p>\n  <p>We're excited to see so many people actively engaged with Google Assistant through voice—managing their smart home and entertainment—and today, <b>we’re bringing some of that same magic to conference rooms with voice commands for Hangouts Meet hardware</b>so that teams can connect to a video meeting in seconds. We plan to roll this out to select Meet hardware customers later this year.</p>\n  <h3>Simplify work with G Suite</h3>\n  <p>One of the reasons why G Suite is able to deliver real transformation to businesses is that it’s simple to use and adopt. G Suite was born in the cloud and built for the cloud, which means real-time collaboration is effortless. This is why more than a billion people rely on G Suite apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive and more in their personal lives. Instead of defaulting to old habits—like saving content on your desktop—G Suite saves your work securely in the cloud and provides a means for teams to push the boundaries of what they create.</p>\n  <p>In fact, 74 percent of all time spent in Docs, Sheets and Slides is on collaborative work—that is, multiple people creating and editing content together. This is a stark difference from what businesses see with legacy tools, where the work is often done individually on a desktop client.</p>So that’s how we’re reimagining work.

And in a world where technology makes you more connected to work than ever before, how do you set ground rules to keep your energy up, your focus sharp and your sanity intact? As a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/inside-google/googlers/she-word/our-do-list-interview-googles-productivity-expert/\">productivity expert at Google</a>, I help Googlers use products like Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar to get more done during their busy days. Email in particular can be a source of stress, but it doesn’t have to be.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Gmail had <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gmail/hitting-send-on-the-next-15-years-of-gmail/\">its birthday earlier this week</a>, and for 15 years, it’s been a helpful sidekick for billions of people around the globe. Part of my job is sharing Gmail-related tips with fellow Googlers—here are my top 10 email management tips for you:</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><b>Cut down on notifications:&nbsp;</b>Don’t bother your brain with notifications for every new email—proactively check your email instead. On your phone, you can set up notifications for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1075549?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en&amp;oco=0\">certain emails</a>—say, the ones from your boss. This will help you identify important emails and disconnect when you want to.</li>\n   <li><b>Respond within 24 hours, even if it’s only to check in:</b>You probably can’t get to all emails within 24 hours, but you can avoid getting another follow up email from a coworker. Giving a status update—“Hi, I got this email but not going to get to it until later this week!”—is a great way to set expectations and show them you’re on it.</li>\n   <li><b>Close out your email 1-2 times a day:</b> Email is necessary to get your job done, but it’s also the ultimate distraction. Most people leave it open all day and check it every 30 minutes (if not more). Try closing your email tab when you have time to do deep work: the ability to focus without distraction on a demanding task.</li>\n   <li><b>Don’t click on an email more than twice:</b> If you read an email then mark it as unread, you’ll have to read it again to remember what to do with it. Read it once to scan and tag your future action (for example, labeling it as “must respond,” or “to do this week,”) then one more time when you answer it.</li>\n   <li><b>Sorting, reading and answering emails should be separate activities:</b>Most people bounce between sorting one email for later, reading one, answering one and repeating. We lose so much energy switching between these activities. Instead, tell yourself “right now I’m <i>sorting</i> everything.” Then when you’re done, <i>read</i> everything you need to read.</li>\n   <li><b>Keep emails that require clear action—otherwise archive or delete:</b>When your inbox contains emails without clear action items, it gives your brain the false sense of having too much to do. Be ruthless about deleting, archiving, or snoozing emails that don’t require an immediate action from you in some way.</li>\n   <li><b>Skip some emails:</b>&nbsp;Every email you see takes a tiny piece of your energy, so each item in your inbox should be something you <i>need</i> to look at. Gmail lets you <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en\">create filters</a> so that certain emails “skip your inbox” and won’t appear as new emails. For example, if you get a lot of email newsletters, set up a filter with “Has the words:unsubscribe”—now, those emails won’t distract you, but you can search for them later.</li>\n   <li><b>Don’t mix your read and unread emails:</b>Combining read and unread emails in your inbox is a recipe for anxiety. New emails should come into one section and emails that you’ve already read and require an action should be in a different section. You can create a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/18522?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Multiple Inbox</a> pane or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">“move” emails to different label</a> that denotes a specific action (such as “To Do” or “Follow Up”).</li>\n   <li><b>To stay focused, keep new email out of sight.</b> It can be hard to answer pressing emails when &nbsp;you’re constantly tempted to open the bright and shiny new emails that just came in. Open up a section like your “<a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Snoozed emails</a>” (emails that you’ve saved for later) or your “<a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/5904?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">Starred emails</a>” (your high-priority emails) so you can stay focused on those tasks, instead of getting distracted by new email.</li>\n   <li><b>To find what you need, just search:</b> Email labels can help you stay organized, but think about how Google got its start … Search! <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en\">Searching your email</a>—instead of digging through labels—is actually a faster way to find the email you’re looking for. You can search by date, sender, subject (and more) and you can get even more specific with queries like “has:attachment” or “older_than:6m” (m=months).</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>For those of you new to using G Suite, there are loads of ways to stay productive in email. <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/tips/gmail/#!/\">Learn more</a> or <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/signup/basic/welcome\">try it out</a> for yourself.

Inboxes were overtaken by spam, and there was no easy way to search your inbox or file messages away. Plus, you had to constantly delete emails to stay under the storage limit.

Gmail blocked spam before it ever reached your inbox, and created a way for people to report suspected spam when they saw it, to help make email safer. Over the years, we’ve enhanced our spam filtering capabilities with artificial intelligence and today, AI helps us block nearly 10 million spam emails every minute. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbmiQhuAhU\">Here's a throwback video</a> from 2007 where our team explains how Gmail fights spam.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>When Gmail launched, the first Android-powered smartphones were still years away. As mobile devices became ubiquitous, Gmail evolved from being desktop-only to also work on your phone or tablet, helping you get more done on the go. Gmail's tabbed inbox feature was the first of its kind, helping you organize messages by category, so you can see what’s new at a glance. AI-powered features like Smart Reply and Nudges helped you reply faster and stay on top of your to-dos.</p>\n  <p><b>What’s next for Gmail</b></p>\n  <p>Gmail has evolved a lot over the past 15 years.

You may have already used <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/\">Smart Compose</a>, an AI-powered feature that helps you write emails quicker. It’s already saved people from typing over 1 billion characters each week—that’s enough to fill the pages of 1,000 copies of \"Lord of the Rings.” Today, we’re updating Smart Compose to include more languages (Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese) and bringing it to Android (previously, it was only available on Pixel 3 devices), with iOS coming soon.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"SMART_COMPOSE_PERSONALIZED_GREETINGS_MOBILE.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SMART_COMPOSE_PERSONALIZED_GREETINGS_MOBILE.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Smart Compose is also getting, well, smarter.
