Among oxide materials, the layered tin oxides (SnO) attract\r\nraising attention in the electronic and optoelectronic field owing to their lone pair electrons. We\r\nhave investigated the thermoelectric properties of layered SnO structures through first-principle\r\ncalculations. SnO exhibits superior n-type thermoelectric properties and the metallicity of SnO\r\nbecomes stronger with the number of layers increasing. The lone pair electrons around Sn atoms are\r\nthe key factor to n-type properties and they will get bonded and anti-bonded in the case of\r\ninterlayer interaction. Monolayer SnO exhibits the best thermoelectric performances and the average\r\nn-type ZT value of monolayer SnO can achieve 0.90 at 500–700 K. Our results demonstrate that layered\r\nSnO will be the potential n-type two-dimensional oxide thermoelectric material.","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":11267,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"527c9323602f85ca7a947a40cfa87445","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Wei Cao, Ziyu Wang, Ling Miao, Jing Shi and Rui Xiong","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605686419609}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 16:00:19","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 16:00:19","feedId":11267,"fetchDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:19 +0000","fetchMs":41441,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":41447,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3b815f166924abacecf011ee14a8b2ba","hostName":"us-031*","requestId":"e5cb34efa8f142f7827782637a0c26a8_11267","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:36:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:22:17","id":11267,"name":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/?rss=1","subscriber":274,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn17@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-22-17-832_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605686378162,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":41442,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
