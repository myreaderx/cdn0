The gel-covered sutures are slippery and tough, reducing the damage caused by conventional sutures when used on soft tissues. Interestingly, the gel surface of the sutures may allow for advanced applications such as drug delivery, infection prevention, or even near-infrared imaging to aid suture placement and removal during minimally invasive surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suturing to close wounds and aid healing is an old technique, with centuries of history, but in all that time sutures haven’t advanced all that much. They are typically much stiffer than the soft tissues they are intended to repair, often resulting in tissue damage that leads to complications and patient discomfort. Additionally, aside from holding a wound together, conventional sutures usually don&#8217;t provide any specific functionality to help it heal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These researchers at McGill University have designed a new type of suture that could help to overcome some of these issues. For inspiration, they looked at tendons in the human body, which are tough but slippery, and so create very little friction as they move past other tissues in the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our design is inspired by the human body, the endotenon sheath, which is both tough and strong due to its double-network structure,” said Zhenwei Ma, a researcher involved in the study. “It binds collagen fibers together while its elastin network strengthens it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new sutures come with a tough but flexible gel coating that allows them to slide past tissues. To create the new sutures, the researchers coated commercially available braided surgical sutures with an alginate-polyacrylamide hydrogel that has excellent biocompatibility and toughness. The modified sutures demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties, including low stiffness and a slippery surface that reduces tissue friction during use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the sutures also exhibit significant versatility in terms of advanced applications, and the researchers can incorporate various substances into the gel coating for therapeutic functionality. These include microparticles that respond to pH changes in infected tissue, an antibacterial compound, and fluorescent nanoparticles. The fluorescent nanoparticles allow the sutures to be visualized through near infrared imaging, which could be helpful for suture placement during minimally invasive surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This technology provides a versatile tool for advanced wound management. We believe it could be used to deliver drugs, prevent infections, or even monitor wounds with near-infrared imaging,&#8221; said Jianyu Li, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;The ability to monitor wounds locally and adjust the treatment strategy for better healing is an exciting direction to explore.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science Advances</em>: <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/15/eabc3012\">Bioinspired tough gel sheath for robust and versatile surface functionalization</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/surgical-sutures-inspired-human-tendons-330261\">McGill University</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=J2mF_Bb4c5w:slj_kQtLmIE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=J2mF_Bb4c5w:slj_kQtLmIE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=J2mF_Bb4c5w:slj_kQtLmIE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=J2mF_Bb4c5w:slj_kQtLmIE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/J2mF_Bb4c5w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:02:20 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cut-suture-1.jpg","linkMd5":"2240031540921772b7aead673f9b0fdd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-54-096_54303a0cab5799de.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":412,"sourceBytes":122393,"destBytes":20508,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cut-suture-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-54-096_54303a0cab5799de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-43-58-093_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn5@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-43-58-154_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=J2mF_Bb4c5w:slj_kQtLmIE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-06-322_e116fd61fda81aa3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/J2mF_Bb4c5w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-58-078_cff61bed629788ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245790959},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:10","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:10","title":"mRNA Delivery System Protects Neurons After Stroke","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511723","description":"\n<p>Researchers at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University have developed a way to deliver therapeutic mRNA to the brain, in this case to produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which can protect neurons from ischemia. The researchers hope that the treatment could help patients who have suffered a stroke to achieve better outcomes by reducing cell death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>mRNA is enjoying a moment in the spotlight, with two of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines using it to produce an immune response against the virus. However, mRNA has significant therapeutic potential beyond vaccination, and this latest research investigates its potential to protect neurons in the brain from ischemia following a stroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mrna-for-stroke.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511827\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mrna-for-stroke.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mrna-for-stroke-300x136.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mrna-for-stroke-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This treatment is based on BDNF, a protein that can protect neurons and enhance their survival. In a stroke, neurons in the brain experience ischemia, but BDNF is too large to pass through the blood-brain barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These researchers came up with a cunning plan – rather than try to deliver the BDNF protein directly, they set out to deliver mRNA that codes for BDNF, which would be translated into the mature protein in the brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the mRNA is small enough to pass through the blood brain barrier, it is too delicate to just be injected straight into the blood stream unprotected. The solution turned out to be mRNA nanomicelles, consisting of a small amount of mRNA surrounded by a polymer package to protect it in the blood and allow it to pass into the brain intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As well as protecting the mRNA by providing containment, the polymer allows the release of the cargo to be controlled,&#8221; said Yuta Fukushima, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;By selecting polymers with particular properties, we can ensure the mRNA is released when and where it is needed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested their treatment in rats with cerebral ischemia. They found that the mRNA therapy increased hippocampal neuron survival and increased rat performance in a maze task. Interestingly, the treatment worked best when it was administered two days after the “stroke” rather than right away, suggesting that it might provide an extended window for effective therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are very encouraged by the performance of our system,&#8221; said Keiji Itaka, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;Our experiments not only demonstrated that the mRNA nanomicelles could prevent neuron death, but also that the potential treatment window could be extended. We expect these findings to have a significant impact on the development of practical clinical treatments.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Biomaterials</em>: <a
