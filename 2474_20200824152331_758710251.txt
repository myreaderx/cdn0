Ultimately, antiferromagnets could replace ferromagnets as the active spin-dependent element on which spintronic devices are based.

Although the jammed state concept is simple as it is determined by excluded volume interactions, describing this state of matter is highly challenging. The approach of Edwards is reviewed here which describes jammed granular materials using the volume ensemble of equally probable jammed states.

This result, which was meant to sharpen and make more precise the argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, lay invisible in plain sight for more than 70 years.

The key aspects of climate dynamics addressed here are the natural variability of the climate system, the deterministic and random processes that contribute to this variability, its response to perturbations, and the relations between internal and external causes of observed changes in the system. Tools are presented for the study of critical transitions in the climate system, which can help us to understand and possibly predict the potential for catastrophic climate change.</p>\n<img src=\"http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.035002.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"\\&quot;100\\&quot;\"><br /><p>[Rev.

Examples are hysteresis in magnets, aging and rejuvenation in glasses, shape memory in alloys, and echoes in spin systems and capillary waves. Once the material is fully equilibrated, memory of the system’s initial conditions or previous history is completely lost. Memory is thus intimately connected to out-of-equilibrium behavior.

The additional symmetry highly constrains correlation functions and imposes an infinite set of “crossing” relations between them. It has now become possible to calculate scaling dimensions, critical exponents, and other quantities by exploiting crossing symmetry. This bootstrap program has in some cases provided accurate predictions for critical phenomena. This review provides a state of the art picture of this program.</p>\n<img src=\"http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.015002.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"\\&quot;100\\&quot;\"><br /><p>[Rev.
