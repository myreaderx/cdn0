Though they can be frustrating to bump up against, you can help squash these sorts of problems quickly by identifying the issue you’re running into, reproducing it, and filing a bug report. At Apple, we provide an app and website called <a href=\"http://feedbackassistant.apple.com\">Feedback Assistant</a> for logging issues with Apple’s products or software.</p>\n<p>You should always file feedback for any bugs you find while developing on Apple’s platforms; after all, we can’t fix problems that we don’t know about. But how can you be sure that the information you provide is helpful for triaging the issue, rather than a bug-solving dead end? Here are some of our top tips for making sure your bug report is clear, actionable, and — most importantly — fixable.</p><h3>Step by step</h3><p>Whenever you log a new bug report, be clear and descriptive. Whether you’re providing specific feedback around a bug you’re running into or general feedback, describe your issue in detail.</p>\n<p>This starts with a clear title that describes both the issue and the inciting factor. “Calendar events are missing” tells the screener that there’s an issue with Calendar events, but not how or why. In contrast, “Calendar events on macOS 10.15.4 are missing after creating a quick event” provides more detail at a glance and potentially helps identify duplicate bugs sooner. </p><hr><p><em>Tip: It’s often helpful for bug screeners to understand how issues are affecting app development. If you identify a problem while developing your app, include the name and version of your app in both the title and description field — even if you can reproduce the problem in a sample project — and add a link to your App Store record or a TestFlight build.</em></p><hr><p>When writing up your problem, describe each step thoroughly — it’s often helpful to pretend that whoever reads it has never seen the app or system you’re writing about before. For example, if you were to write “When I create an event in Calendar, it disappears in a moment,” the screener lacks enough detail to reproduce the issue. Are you creating a Calendar event through the Quick Event button, or are you dragging to add a new event? How long is a moment? Did the event disappear after multitasking, or did you remain in the app? </p>\n<p>Whenever a bug screener has to pause and consider this kind of question, it reduces the likelihood that your problem can get fixed quickly. Instead, think about ways you can describe your bug in detail, like so: </p>\n<p><em>1. Click Quick Event button in the Calendar app.</em>\n<em>2. Fill out an event with any title.</em>\n<em>3. Hit Return.</em></p>\n<p><em>Actual Results: The event appears in the right place in my calendar but then disappears.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expected Results: The Calendar event should appear and stay on my calendar.</em></p>\n<p>After filling out your reproduction steps and expected result, it’s also worth considering additional factors that could influence the problem. Are you signed into iCloud? Do you have any Accessibility settings turned on? Does the issue reproduce in a similar fashion in other places around the OS? The more questions you can answer in the initial report, the faster someone reading it can triage it effectively and get it over to the right team or person for a fix.</p><h3>Add some visuals</h3><p>If you can reproduce the bug and capture video or a screenshot while it’s happening, this information can be invaluable to people for troubleshooting the issue. A screen recording can also help capture details that you may not have thought to provide in the description field. If your problem involves an issue with the UI, you should always include visuals. </p><h3>Log the crash</h3><p>Unfortunately, not all bugs are reproducible or have easy-to-follow steps. For trickier cases, consider providing logging information like a sysdiagnose: If you’re filing a bug on your iPhone or iPad, you can use the Feedback Assistant app to capture one automatically. If filing a bug via Apple’s web portal, you can install profiles that can help you manually gather a sysdiagnose.</p>\n<p>You can also provide any additional logging relevant to the issue. For example, if you’re experiencing a crash, you can include your app’s crash logs. If you’re reporting a performance regression, you can include an Instruments Trace on iOS or iPadOS, or a Sample on macOS.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2o2p68bq\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Enhance bug reports with debug profiles and logging</a></p><h3>Create a sample project</h3><p>Running into an issue while developing an app? Consider isolating the problem into a small sample project that compiles. Not only can it help you narrow down the specific bug you’re facing, but it’s one of the easiest ways for Apple’s bug screeners and engineers to triage the offending problem. If you can’t produce a sample project, sample code is also helpful — any additional information that can help narrow down the issue is valuable.</p><h3>Escalate your report</h3><p>If you’re a paid member of the Apple Developer Program, Enterprise Program, or MFi Program and you’re having a technical issue with one of Apple’s platforms on a production release, you should consider filing a Technical Support Incident. This is a request for code-level support for Apple frameworks, APIs, and tools when you cannot fix a bug, have trouble implementing a specific technology, or have other questions about your code.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Request technical support</a></p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about Feedback Assistant</a></p><p><a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/privacy\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about our privacy policy when filing bugs with Feedback Assistant</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 16:17:30 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5A53F2BA-53C6-45BB-869D-48FCD5DA01A3/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"73c96df4c469f1754a792100737d0bc3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-398_35165a4b1812ec09.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":55523,"destBytes":15002,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5A53F2BA-53C6-45BB-869D-48FCD5DA01A3/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-398_35165a4b1812ec09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Membership Fee Waivers Now Available in More&nbsp;Countries","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=02032020a","description":"<p>We’re pleased to announce that <span class=\"nowrap\">Apple Developer Program</span> membership is now available at no cost for eligible organizations based in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, and South&nbsp;Korea.

Long before the orchestra strikes its first chord, an intermixed whisper of invisible strings, brass and percussion lives within a composer’s mind. Transforming those melodic machinations into sheet music, however, is its own special challenge.</p>\n<p>The classical greats relied on the tried-and-true method of writing on sheet paper, letting their creativity flow unabashed onto the page. Once written, however, each part had to be painstakingly copied and reproduced for each musician — and revisions were far from easy.</p>\n<p>In contrast, modern digital composition software provides an incredible array of tools for composers and musicians. Despite the many benefits of these apps, however, they can come across as cold and complicated, creating unnecessary barriers between the music in someone’s mind and the notes that end up on a music stand.</p><p>“I was spending more time learning these notation programs... than I was actually writing the music,” composer and designer David William Hearn tells us. This dissonance provided him with the beginnings of a different sort of musical idea: an app that provided the inspirational and inviting structure of pen and paper with the powerful features of a digital notation app.</p>\n<p>“[It] started out as quite a selfish endeavor,” Hearn shares with a smile. “The dream app that I always wanted.” He envisioned something that would not only allow him to write music quickly and with ease, interfacing and interacting with other musicians, but also presented the opportunity to record and playback.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89130EF9-C1B5-4325-A93A-BC0E92D24A5E/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>With the help of cofounder and collaborator Dr. Matthew Tesch, Hearn’s dream app became <em>StaffPad</em>, an innovative approach to musical notation. Since its 2015 launch, StaffPad has continually evolved to take advantage of the latest technology, including a full rebuild and relaunch for iPad and Apple Pencil in early 2020.</p>\n<p>“Musicians and composers generally appreciate power through simplicity,” says Hearn. “They want to focus on one thing only — the music. Every aspect of StaffPad’s design, both invisible and visible, was built with a no-compromise approach to enable that focus.” Subtle design choices create a feeling of unity between the composer’s environment and the interface as they transition into the app. The main screen’s background even changes color based on the weather and time of day to provide a welcoming atmosphere for creativity.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>The paradox of choice is fascinating, but personally I feel being offered a couple of great choices beats having loads of potentially poor ones. You do need bravery in the design to believe the few choices you offer are the right ones.</p><cite>David William Hearn, cofounder of StaffPad</cite></blockquote><p>The composition interface is free-form and inviting. The team specifically decided against the idea of a fixed page layout, knowing that people could use StaffPad on a device in any orientation or zoomed at any size. Instead, the app presents composers with an infinitely scrolling digital canvas of sheet music. Rather than ask the creator to pick specific styles or sizes before writing a new composition, they can just start notating, then share the correct size on export.</p>\n<p>“There's certainly a place for having perfect pixel, perfect layout control over every layer,” Hearn says. “But whilst you're in a creative flow, you really don't want to be thinking about page breaks or line breaks.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/261BBB10-634B-43C6-82B0-AAEC514ECAAD/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>While StaffPad is quite powerful in the options it provides composers, the app intentionally uses adaptive toolsets to help declutter its interface and guide composers to the right tool at the right moment. “We designed the most common things you do to be the most natural,” Hearn says. If a composer is writing for piano, for example, the app won’t display tools designed for percussion instruments.</p>\n<p>That includes notational writing itself. StaffPad requires Apple Pencil — its precision is instrumental to interacting within the app. While the team considered alternative tools, they ultimately went with the methods that mapped accurately to how someone might write on paper. Pencil gives the composer differentiation, whereas touch is a complement to the overall process. “Touch to move. Pencil to draw. We make it very nuanced, but the dual concept is the key,” Hearn says.</p>\n<p>That exploration also helped identify one of StaffPad’s defining features: toggling the erase tool through drawing pressure. They knew it would break the creative flow to add an extra button to toggle the erase tool. Instead, they relied upon an otherwise unused feature in the app — Apple Pencil’s pressure sensitivity, which isn’t needed for writing notation — and designed an erase toggle when pushing firmly on the Pencil. “I knew it had to be light enough that it didn’t feel dangerous, but also strong enough that it didn’t trigger accidentally while writing,” Hearn says. “We kept trying until it felt right.\"</p><p>Another key feature of the app is its text recognition, which translates handwritten strokes or shapes into digital notes, rests, accidentals, articulations, and dynamics. \"It's actually consulting its own sort of music-theory brain,” Hearn says. Even with a scattering of scrawled notes, StaffPad is able to draw upon Core ML frameworks and models to decipher and craft digital orchestrations.</p>\n<p>Despite the app’s ‘selfish’ origins, StaffPad has found support from people across the musical world. “One of my favorite things about the app is that it's fostered this sense of kind of community ownership,” Hearn says. “People are really quite emotionally attached to it in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p>Hearn and team receive regular suggestions, feedback, and stories from their community. His favorite emails are those from teachers and students: “That raw inspiration that comes from the education sector is really amazing.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13E73672-6715-4ECA-81B0-8462A5D18CDE/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>StaffPad continues to explore new ways to support its audience, including its companion app, StaffPad Reader. The app allows musicians to digitally view and play scores from StaffPad, and even automatically turns pages in unison as they rehearse or perform. If the composer edits or transposes a score on StaffPad, the app also receives changes over the air, reformatting the parts in realtime.</p>\n<p>Hearn and Tesch have even begun the process of introducing another natural input interface into the app: voice. “I believe voice will become a primary input method for most apps in the near future,” says Hearn. “Voice provides a vector into a nearly unlimited command set — and one that we already know how to use.”</p>\n<p>Winning an Apple Design Award is just one note on the team’s musical journey. “There’s always more to do,” Hearn says. But over the last few years, he’s found joy in helping craft both the app and working with the team behind it. “A composer is a solitary animal,” he notes. An app-building team, less so. “[My] main learning has been how best to work to create a cohesive design and then explain that to a team of people.”</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.staffpad.net/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about StaffPad</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521731004\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about StaffPad on the App Store</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/staffpad/id1442074103\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Download StaffPad on the App Store</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 13:00:33 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A73FE0EF-110E-453F-BF9E-2B5C3F614343/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"44d2c10ebe6875f8aa97ec7901658b88","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-46-339_a774f0dfb1b1216d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":170765,"destBytes":37118,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A73FE0EF-110E-453F-BF9E-2B5C3F614343/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-46-339_a774f0dfb1b1216d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89130EF9-C1B5-4325-A93A-BC0E92D24A5E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-32-02-410_ae28e7c0d35a7c50.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/261BBB10-634B-43C6-82B0-AAEC514ECAAD/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn65@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-59-021_d350c0dbc76ae65d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13E73672-6715-4ECA-81B0-8462A5D18CDE/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-00-281_4f840709eaf6137e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Apple Push Notification Service Update","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11042019a","description":"<p> If you send push notifications with the legacy binary protocol, we recommend updating to the HTTP/2-based APNs provider API as soon as possible.

As part of that process, we offer beta software for developers as well as a Public Beta Software Program. This lets developers test apps on upcoming software, address pesky bugs, and provide information to engineering teams around upcoming software changes and improvements.</p>\n<p>While we encourage people to only install beta software on a secondary device, you may still find that some of your customers want to run your app while using a beta version of an operating system. Here are some of the ways to ensure your app’s stability for those people, get feedback from them, and provide some of your own to Apple’s engineering teams.</p><h3>Test early, test often</h3><p>When new beta software is released, we recommend downloading it as soon as possible to test with your existing apps. Not only is it an opportunity to ensure your app continues to work well, but it also puts you in a great position to experiment with our latest APIs and features.</p>\n<p>The earlier you test, the earlier you can identify possible bugs or issues and flag them to Apple engineers. It’s also your best opportunity to register feedback around new features and influence future operating system updates.</p><h3>Triage the trouble</h3><p>Sometimes, changes to an API or operating system updates in an early beta may seriously affect your app. This is never a great feeling, but don’t panic! Chances are, many of your fellow developers are in the same boat. First, do a bit of triage to identify the problem. Is this a system issue, or a latent bug in your own code?</p>\n<p>To troubleshoot, isolate your issue by creating a minimally-reproducible case in a new Xcode project. When you only focus on the code that causes the bug, the problem can often be easier to find — and this also gives you a smaller project that you can share with others to troubleshoot or attach to a bug report.</p>\n<p>If you find that the beta has revealed an existing bug in your code, you may be able to fix it immediately and provide an update that makes your app more stable for both people on production as well as those running beta software.</p><hr><p><em>Sometimes you may be able to isolate the code in such a way that you can reproduce the issue on shipping software. If that’s the case, and if you need help fixing it, submit a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/\">Technical Support Incident</a> for code-level support.</em></p><hr><p>If there’s an issue with the beta itself that’s preventing you from providing a fix, it’s time to file some feedback. Even if you think others have filed this bug before, you should always send in a report: Your reproduction steps and data could be the key that unlocks the problem, or pushes the issue to a higher level of prioritization.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vvrgkboh\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">How to file great bug reports</a></p><p>Amidst all the work you’re already doing on your app, you may be tempted to post a blanket statement to your website or within your app that you aren’t providing support for people who use beta software. We strongly discourage this approach: Your customers may be fellow developers or need to run beta software for another reason, and deterring them from running your app may make them feel shut out or lose trust in your software. Instead, if you’re running into a serious problem on a beta that may make for a sub-par experience that you haven’t been able to address in an update, consider sharing your issue on your website and social media channels, as well as the steps you’re taking to address it.</p><h3>Foster feedback</h3><p>Though people running beta software on their devices can’t leave reviews for your app in the App Store, they still might have valuable feedback for you. Consider creating an easy way for your customers to provide bug reports — they may find something you’ve missed!</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6A4A139-C806-438D-9928-C186A25E20BE/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Consider offering a way for people to submit feedback or bug reports inside your app. Carrot Weather provides two options for people inside the app’s settings screen.</p></div><h3>Connect with the community</h3><p>Are you struggling to fix an issue brought on by a beta update?

They can browse your app in full screen, put it next to another app in Split View, pull it up in Slide Over, or even view multiple instances of your app side by side. Here are a few ways you can improve the look and feel of your iPad app for multitasking and multiple windows.</p><h3>Make your app a multitasking master</h3><p>Whether your app is running by itself, in a Slide Over pane, or side by side in Split View, it should always support a great multitasking experience. People expect apps on iPad to seamlessly adjust between size classes as they add or remove apps on their screen. When you design an adaptive UI, you can ensure that your controls and views remain visible and useable, whether your app is full screen or displaying in a compact view.</p>\n<p>To make your view controllers and views responsive to changes in the iOS interface environment, override the <code>traitCollectionDidChange(_:)</code> method from the trait environment protocol.

Sam Rosenthal, creator of The Game Band’s <em>Where Cards Fall</em> on Apple Arcade, told us that his company name pays homage to the groups he listened to growing up. “A lot of the bands that I really loved… They didn't stick with one sound,” he said. Rosenthal has carried that philosophy into his work: “Every time we make something, it should be different from the last. It should surprise people.”</p>\n<p>Others, like writer and Shortcuts developer Federico Viticci, have built entire projects around a love of music. In 2019, the Italian native designed and built a shortcut, MusicBot, that helps people listen to more of their library and speed up common Music app interactions. </p>\n<p>“When developing MusicBot, I needed to test it with data that was easy to find in my music library,” he told us. Viticci's choice: His “all-time favorite band,” Oasis, whose myriad albums provided plenty of testing material.</p>\n<p>Several of the Swift Student Challenge winners also shared their appreciation for a little musical motivation. “While I was creating [my] Playground, I used the WWDC19 playlist,” Gloria Cretella told us. A two-time scholarship winner, Cretella attended the conference for the first time in 2019, and used the playlist to remind herself of the experience. “I was a bit nostalgic,” she said. “Programming with the songs that were in the background at the conference brought me back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone has their favorite tune or perfect mix. Brazillian Student Challenge winner Henrique Conte finds joy in French music while he codes, especially from his favorite Belgian singer Angèle. “Learning new languages is one of my passions because it allows us to connect with the world and understand cultures,” he told us. With this playlist, he said, he gets to improve his linguistic skills all while Angèle’s music focuses him on the task at hand.</p>\n<p>Others, like StaffPad developer and composer David William Hearn, prefer to find time in the quieter moments between projects. “I’m actually reconnecting at the moment with some of the classics,” he told us, which include works by 20th century composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Though some of those compositions are short by classical standards, Hearn is quick to highlight the years of artistry and care behind them. “It's someone’s life, you know?” he said. “I find that phenomenal.”</p>\n<p>Discover the perfect soundtrack for your next programming project on Apple Music or wherever you like to listen, and know that you’re enjoying something uniquely human. “Music transcends our differences and has the power to unite us,” Viticci said. “To make us feel connected no matter what's going on in the world.” </p><hr><p><em>You can tune in to the full WWDC20 playlist collection on Apple Music.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?fcId=1516383883&ls=1\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">WWDC20 on Apple Music</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:00:51 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C2128BCE-14A0-4D0B-A2B3-F0DE037D47E9/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"405222b169ad76cd79e1879ff8341fd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-45-426_594ee4225a7eddba.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":88825,"destBytes":26942,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C2128BCE-14A0-4D0B-A2B3-F0DE037D47E9/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn49@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-45-426_594ee4225a7eddba.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F1F6A358-BA7E-4B55-AD1E-DF7035DCBB18/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-32-01-265_893cd351477374f9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Meet the developer: Panic","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=t4n6e4wo","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A41B17CE-7A90-4913-8397-6D55EBE69463/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">How Panic manages to find beauty in FTP and SSH.</p></div><p>It may be cool to be a developer these days, but that wasn’t always the case—especially not in 1998, when Cabel Sasser and Steven Frank started Panic. Running a fledgling software company was daunting and exhausting, but the duo was having so much fun they didn’t care. </p>\n<p>“Steven once compared our relationship to that of R2-D2 and C-3PO,” Sasser says. “I roll around making strange noises and interfacing with things, while he stays the course, flapping his arms and fretting about protocol. But they need each other to succeed, right?”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4732A4C2-18A1-4E87-8374-E5C870360647/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Yes, even an FTP client can look great and be easy to use.</p></div><p>When Panic started, developers had to worry about more than coding a great app; they also had to figure out how and where they were going to sell it. The internet wasn’t the e-commerce juggernaut it is now. Developers needed to hit the streets.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost impossible to comprehend now, but back in the day, if you wanted to sell an app, you had to manufacture boxes, sign up with an expensive distributor, try to get your boxed app onto the shelves at the computer store, and pay extra for placement on the endcap,” Sasser says.</p>\n<p>With <em>Transmit</em>, the elegant FTP app Panic debuted in 1998, the company established what’s become a core principle: “Take a complicated thing and make it easy, beautiful, and powerful,” Sasser says. </p>\n<p>Acknowledging that file-transfer apps aren’t exactly the most exciting, Sasser says he’s well aware that a lot of customers would be satisfied if <em>Transmit</em> simply did the bare minimum. An FTP app doesn’t have to wow you. Nor do Panic’s other apps, like <em>Prompt</em>, an SSH client, or <em>Coda</em>, a file manager and text editor. </p>\n<p>But Sasser expects more. He wants Panic’s apps to appeal to your design sensibility as well.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>Take a complicated thing and make it easy, beautiful, and powerful.</p><cite>Panic cofounder Cabel Sasser</cite></blockquote><p>\"The matrix is really simple: Too much design and you can alienate power users. Not enough and you’ll intimidate new users,” Sasser says. Striking the right balance applies to functionality as well. “Balancing design and functionality is one of the most difficult parts of our job.”</p>\n<p>After decades spent developing software for the Mac, Sasser and Frank have earned the respect of customers and other developers alike. Sasser chalks this up to Panic’s core tenets: honesty, personality, and responsibility.</p>\n<p>“As humans, we always know when a company is selling us some PR flimflam. It never works,” he says. “So we are always absolutely honest and up-front.”</p><hr><p><em>Originally published on the App Store and Mac App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 09 May 2020 03:00:51 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A41B17CE-7A90-4913-8397-6D55EBE69463/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"2ea62f6955945ffda092cf8d6452e712","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-46-073_be5508d69d6334d8.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":176801,"destBytes":38766,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A41B17CE-7A90-4913-8397-6D55EBE69463/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn10@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-46-073_be5508d69d6334d8.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4732A4C2-18A1-4E87-8374-E5C870360647/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn81@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-59-979_deb3932d0252e2ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Ready your app for a localized launch","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=trcy3pi0","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/119F5757-7157-4DEE-9909-49393C65B45A/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Once you’ve localized your app, it’s time to get ready for an international and localized launch.

He was also the son of a single mother who’d lost her job to the recession. At times during his high school years, they were homeless. </p>\n<p>With graduation looming, Gray came to see college as a necessity, but one priced like a luxury item. Lacking internet access at home, he searched for scholarships at the library, one hour at a time, in keeping with the posted screen limits. He often wrote 500-word application essays on his phone — not a smartphone but a chunky 2008 model with a tiny keyboard. He did this for seven months.</p><p>“I saw a problem and I tried to fix it,” he says from a Hollywood office populated by a handful of coworkers and one very large dog named Milk. “My grandma always told me, ‘You have to work. You have to ignore whatever is going on around you, put your head down, and focus.’”</p>\n<p>When his first scholarship check arrived, he sensed his efforts paying off. By the time the last one came in, Gray had amassed $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>He used the money to study finance and entrepreneurship at Drexel University (and to cover his living expenses for all four years). But the process nagged at him. How, he thought, could it be so disjointed? How many students had it discouraged from going or even applying to college?</p>\n<p>“I realized there’s all this money looking for students,” he says, “and all these students looking for money.” </p>\n<p>Enter Scholly. Founded at Drexel by Gray and fellow students Nick Pirollo and Bryson Alef, it launched in 2015 with the simple goal of matching students with available scholarships: Input your age, interests, and other demographic information and Scholly would find potential fits.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/02CF36D1-E2DD-460F-9843-E62E663F9ECA/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">No matter what your interests are, Scholly can help find money to support them.</p></div><p>The idea, Gray says, was born from his desire to help others do what he did. “I got some scholarships because I was the only one who applied. A lot of times, students just don’t know they exist.”</p>\n<p>More good news was to come. His story soon reached the producers of Shark Tank, and the rest is Scholly history: Gray’s 60-second pitch resulted in a near-instant deal with Lori Greiner and Daymond John—and some viral offscreen dramatics. (Greiner offered Gray his requested $40,000 without even asking questions. “I don’t care how we monetize,” she said, prompting a minor meltdown in which a number of sharks basically stormed out of the studio.)</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>I realized there’s all this money looking for students, and all these students looking for money.</p></blockquote><p>Scholly Search is the classic example of a simple idea that exploded. Today, it has roughly 3 million users who have landed more than $110 million in scholarships. </p>\n<p>Actor and activist Jesse Williams is a member of Scholly Search’s board; Chance the Rapper has appeared at its Chicago-based initiatives. The company has relocated from Philadelphia to California, into a sprawling corner office with mountain views.</p><p>“The amounts are compelling,” Gray says, “but what’s just as powerful are the stories of people who get, like, the last $3,000 they need to enroll. I always wear my Scholly sweatshirt when I travel, and people come up to me and say, ‘Oh wow, you’re Scholly!’ Not ‘Oh, you’re Chris’ but ‘You’re Scholly!’ And they’ll tell me their story. It’s really powerful to experience that, because, OK, I was a homeless kid.”</p>\n<p>Still in his midtwenties, Gray has been named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for social entrepreneurship and Oprah Winfrey’s “SuperSoul 100” (who are basically her favorite people). He’s spoken at the Obama Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper summit and received the 2018 Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B931104E-0CDE-4C7F-9103-51E90E24146E/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Christopher Gray’s work got the attention of Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Jesse Williams.</p></div><p>In recent years, Gray has set about evolving Scholly into a full-service education app. Scholly Math is an AI-powered standalone app that helps students solve tricky problems (while showing its work, of course). There’s also Scholly Editor, a web-based proofreader. “We originally created it to help with essays,” Gray says, “but a lot of kids are using it to get better grades and learn English, especially in underserved schools.”   Mostly, he hopes to continue helping students reach dreams that circumstances might have once deemed impossible.   “This good thing happened to me,” he says, “and now maybe I can help people who otherwise may not be able to help themselves.”</p><hr><p><em>Originally published on the App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 17:26:43 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0B0CF5DF-678E-4FE1-95DA-7B1E66CE48CE/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"bffeecf1633b139fc0e7ce49c67bf8d3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-399_cb2df8fe58470df7.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":416499,"destBytes":117394,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0B0CF5DF-678E-4FE1-95DA-7B1E66CE48CE/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-399_cb2df8fe58470df7.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/02CF36D1-E2DD-460F-9843-E62E663F9ECA/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn26@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-01-183_80c820bab493a0a7.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B931104E-0CDE-4C7F-9103-51E90E24146E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-02-420_ef3e32dc94f119eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"All-new Apple Developer Forums Now Available","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06192020a","description":"<p>The Apple Developer Forums have been completely redesigned, so they’re more engaging to use, automatically surface the most relevant content, offer simpler navigation, and make it easier to categorize and search for content.

And with watchOS 6.2, you can further expand your customers’ experiences by offering in-app purchases and subscription flows directly on Apple Watch. </p>\n<p>These interactions use the same StoreKit APIs available for iOS app development, allowing you to quickly implement them in your watchOS apps, and they can be added to both independent watchOS apps (which can function fully independently of an iOS app) and dependent watchOS apps (which need an iOS companion app to function).</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at why and when you might want to offer purchases within your app, as well as some best practices around implementing a great flow for your customers.</p><h3>When to offer in-app purchases and subscriptions</h3><p>In-app purchases and subscriptions can make your Apple Watch apps even better by offering both additional content and purchasing flexibility.</p>\n<p>If you have an independent app, people can already download it directly through the Watch App Store, and in-app purchases and subscriptions build upon that independence. Apps dependent on the companion iOS app can benefit, too, as these give people more power to purchase additional content without having to reach for their iPhone.</p>\n<p>When deciding whether to bring an in-app purchase or subscription flow to your app, consider what you’re offering. Does this purchase or subscription unlock anything specific to Apple Watch? Fitness apps, for instance, might supply additional workouts, or let your customers subscribe to a monthly program.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve decided to add an in-app purchase or subscription, give some thought to when your app should display it. These prompts are most helpful when they provide a next step for your customers to unlock further functionality within your app.</p><h3>Best practices for a great in-app purchase and subscription experience</h3><p>Effective purchase flows on Apple Watch are concise and clear. Your messaging must be easily scannable, and your options must be easy to compare with each other on a small screen. Keeping things short and sweet will help ensure that people can evaluate the choices, make a decision quickly, and carry on with the task at hand. </p>\n<p><strong>Make your choices clear</strong>\nWhen offering one-time purchases and subscriptions alongside each other, ensure that every option is defined clearly. Adding written overviews can help people differentiate between the two and make an informed choice. </p>\n<p>We recommend including the following information in your overview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What this purchase enables on your Apple Watch app</li>\n<li>Whether it’s a one-time purchase or recurring subscription</li>\n</ul><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/900CF4E2-E9A0-4E9E-9B86-CBED593648D4/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p><strong>Restore the past</strong>\nWhenever you offer subscription or in-app purchase content, provide a way for people to restore their subscriptions or purchases. The same goes for Apple Watch: Make sure your app presents a button below the option to purchase that can check for previously purchased content and restore it.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget the fine print</strong>\nWhile reading your subscription’s terms and conditions on Apple Watch may not sound like the most fun way for someone to spend their time, it’s important that your customers know exactly what they’re getting when they purchase something within your app. Every time you include a purchase screen on Apple Watch, you must include an option to read terms and conditions. </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/52AD261D-B8AE-4C7E-A06D-45A9C6F9BEE6/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p><strong>Review the App Store guidelines</strong>\nThere are specific requirements you need to include in your Watch app before you make in-app purchases and subscriptions available to your customers; check the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/resources/\">App Store’s Guidelines and Resources</a> for more information.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps\">Watch “Creating Independent watchOS apps”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#subscription-offers\">Learn more about <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">auto-renewable subscriptions</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/\">Learn more about <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">in-app purchases</span></a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 15:00:41 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/52AD261D-B8AE-4C7E-A06D-45A9C6F9BEE6/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"6c5ee0f6a2c4e81dbe9d05e5f4614798","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-46-073_c4fd2acd2cf6c90a.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":767,"sourceBytes":83964,"destBytes":32284,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/52AD261D-B8AE-4C7E-A06D-45A9C6F9BEE6/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-46-073_c4fd2acd2cf6c90a.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/900CF4E2-E9A0-4E9E-9B86-CBED593648D4/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn57@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-59-031_f8b31c4a19bb991b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"How to localize your app","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jzqnn1av","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/ECC72997-C6C5-47AD-89AE-0DF1FE6C7DBE/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>When you deliver great localization in your app, you can support your customers in their native language and provide a better overall experience. Here’s how you can get started localizing your content quickly and effectively inside Xcode.</p><h3>Translate your app’s content</h3><p>Use the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app\">Xcode Export For Localization</a> feature to automatically extract all localizable content, including strings referenced from code, stringsdict files, and Interface Builder files, as well as any localized assets. This process shouldn’t require modifications to your source code, making it easy to work on translations in-house or with an external localization service. Be sure to also localize <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/requesting_access_to_protected_resources\">purpose strings</a> for a consistent app experience, and consider localizing your privacy policy so that all users have a clear understanding of how their data may be handled.</p><p><strong>Apple Services</strong> </p>\n<p>Use Apple APIs to automatically present localized buttons, payment sheets, errors, and more for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/\">Apple Pay</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/wallet\">Apple Wallet</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple\">Sign in with Apple</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Audiovisual Media</strong></p>\n<p>You can also provide localized support for audiovisual media in your app using AVKit and AVFoundation. These <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_assets_playback_and_editing/adding_subtitles_and_alternative_audio_tracks\">frameworks</a> provide built-in support for easily presenting subtitles and closed captions, and for selecting alternative audio and video tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Localization Services</strong></p>\n<p>If choosing an external localization service to help translate content, find out if they specialize in localizing for particular languages, cultures, or categories, and confirm the levels of quality assurance they provide. Providing the service with context about your app and content can help increase efficiency and minimize translation errors. Consider creating a guide with important details — for example, a playbook with character names and personalities, explanations of jokes or humor, a glossary of frequently used terms, and screenshots that show where the translations will be used. Avoid machine translation as your only translation method, since this can lead to inaccurate and low-quality translation because it does not account for context, cultural sensitivities or language nuances. For example, the “book” button in a hotel app might be incorrectly translated to be “novel” rather than “reserve”.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app\">Learn more about localizing your app in Xcode &gt;</a></p><hr><h3>Test your localization</h3><p>Configure test plans in Xcode to easily run tests with different settings and define your testing variants in one place.

CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication. This can be done dynamically in your UIApplicationDelegate by returning a configuration in application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession:options:, or ahead of time in your app's Info.plist in the Application Scene Manifest. </p>\n<p>The delegate must conform to CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate, where it will be given an instance of CPInterfaceController and CPWindow, as you've been used to with CPApplicationDelegate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to support CPTemplateApplicationDashboardScene, include a new key in your Application Scene Manifest to declare support for CarPlay Dashboard: CPSupportsDashboardNavigationScene with a value of true.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Define the dashboard delegate</strong></p>\n<p>Next define your delegate to the dashboard scene just like you would for the main template application scene. This delegate conforms to CPTemplateApplicationDashboardSceneDelegate and will be given an instance of CPDashboardController and UIWindow. </p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Draw your CarPlay Dashboard content</strong></p>\n<p>Use the provided window to draw navigation related content for display in the CarPlay Dashboard, similar to the CPWindow given to the main template application scene. You can also provide two instances of CPDashboardButton to CPDashboardController that appear in the guidance card widget while your app is not actively navigating.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Use your app in CarPlay Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>People can interact with your app through both the dashboard buttons as well as within your main app interface. When navigation begins in your app using CPMapTemplate and CPNavigationSession, CarPlay will automatically display maneuvers in the guidance widget. When navigation ends, it will revert to your currently set dashboard buttons.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/carplay\">Learn more about creating apps <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">for CarPlay</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/integrating_carplay_with_your_navigation_app\">Learn more about integrating CarPlay with your navigation app in the <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Developer Library</span></a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:53:07 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C75DE8B0-854D-4582-9506-EF587989D1A5/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"59a133c5108ed55ab633d0c8f06d5493","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-821_0b65e122578c3f94.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":139766,"destBytes":39952,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C75DE8B0-854D-4582-9506-EF587989D1A5/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-821_0b65e122578c3f94.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904642},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Xcode 12 is now available.","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=qbomldbb","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/70DFEB35-0C49-450D-85FF-8831E2A593A9/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>With an all-new design that looks great on macOS Big Sur, Xcode 12 has customizable font sizes for the navigator, streamlined code completion, new document tabs, and more.

To install a debug profile, download it to your device and follow the instructions to capture the requested information.</p>\n<p>So, the next time you go to file a new piece of feedback, please add a sysdiagnose or logging generated from a debug profile to your report. It can help engineers begin tracking down even the trickiest of bugs, and it increases the likelihood of your issue being fixed. As always, the sooner you submit a new problem — and the more information you provide — the higher likelihood you have of getting it resolved in a future software version. </p>\n<p>This is especially crucial when filing bugs against beta software, as prioritizations around fixes have to be made in early seeds.

The image of his body washed up on a beach in Lebanon devastated American startup veteran Shelley Taylor.</p>\n<p>“These migrants are coming into Europe, they get here, and they don’t know how to find the basic things—the supermarket, shelter, the doctor,” says Taylor, CEO of Trellyz, which creates software for cities and nonprofits. “And I thought, they all have smartphones, maybe I can create something that will let them find what they need when they need it.” </p>\n<p>Over a weekend she built <em>RefAid—Refugee Aid App</em> and launched it in the UK and Italy in February 2016. The app catalogs aid organizations’ services for migrants and refugees seeking to build a new life in Europe and, increasingly, the United States.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E5B75513-D37A-407A-B1F1-64DAFC1BE1DB/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The app reduces its language barrier with icons in addition to words.</p></div><p>These days, the app is evolving from one designed to meet the basic daily survival needs of refugees to one able to tackle the many challenges of the mounting migrant crisis at the U.S. border and provide information during COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Services have been added to address family separation, offering constantly updated intel about legal aid as well as geo-targeted push notifications with crucial on-the-ground information. For example, RefAid might send an alert with a phone number for free legal help in an area where migrants are being rounded up.</p>\n<p>The app (which is now available in 25 countries, with some 5,000 aid organizations contributing) will soon include services in most U.S. states. Taylor and her team are constantly reaching out to more nonprofits and public service providers to include them in the app. Through a web-based content management system, they can manage and update their offerings and communicate directly with people.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>These migrants are coming into Europe, they get here, and they don’t know how to find the basic things—the supermarket, shelter, the doctor.</p></blockquote><p>Available in English, Arabic, Farsi, Spanish, and soon French, the app directs refugees (using geolocation) to aid within a 100-mile radius. The services are sorted by categories like legal, food, education, work, media, faith groups, psychological, and more.</p><h3>Solving one problem at a time</h3><p>Before launching RefAid, Taylor—who was raised in Palo Alto, California, but lives in Europe—needed to contact aid organizations and have them provide a list of services that could help migrants in need. She started with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the British Red Cross but quickly ran into a roadblock: Most of them didn’t readily know all of the services they provided.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6D0C616-C873-4B47-BDFE-64787D5A544E/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The worldwide refugee crisis broke Shelley Taylor’s heart—so she made an app to help.</p></div><p>Taylor waited weeks for aid groups to get back to her. “We called them and said, ‘Did you change your mind? Where are your services? We just need a little spreadsheet.’” And they said, uniformly, ‘Oh, we have to call each of the offices to ask them because nothing is written down.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Taylor created what may be the first global database of nonprofit services. She doesn’t charge the organizations to use the app, covering the development and operating costs herself. “We didn’t want anyone to have an excuse to say no to putting their services on the app, because it’s such a huge problem and people really need help.” </p><h3>Help finding help</h3><p>Although RefAid doesn’t have the capacity to respond to real-time updates from refugees and migrants, Taylor has anticipated the needs of people arriving by either land or sea. </p>\n<p>“When you come into Greece, for example, the organizations don’t have the right to go to the beach directly. They have to stay in their offices — that’s the law. But, if somebody has told migrants to look at the app, those migrants can discover that around the corner there’s a Red Cross office and food vouchers, which they couldn’t have found otherwise.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/15FB0C62-FB8E-431C-9185-3E0B41A979BB/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Taylor in the French town of Calais, home to the notorious Calais Jungle refugee encampment where some 10,000 refugees sought shelter from 2015 to 2016.</p></div><p>The app is used primarily in the U.S., the UK, Belgium, France, Italy, and Greece. After the first attempted U.S. travel ban in January 2017, RefAid quickly deployed in 19 American cities, cataloging legal services nearby for those trapped at U.S. airports. In May 2018, 40 other cities—including Oslo, Athens, and Amsterdam—began listing their services. </p>\n<p>During the current U.S. migrant crisis, new services from different aid organizations are being added daily. Some large resettlement organizations in the U.S., such as the International Refugee Committee, have actually started preloading cell phones with the RefAid app and giving them to migrants.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting to see how it’s growing,” Taylor says, “but we still haven’t mapped the whole world. And that’s our goal: to map all of the services available to refugees and everyone else in the whole world. It’s just a step at a time.”</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on the App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 02 May 2020 02:05:39 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4C4EE2EB-C305-49BA-88A7-A83242CC525F/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"196e6056ab0f65cfbacb32f952b7c75e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn12@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-45-056_17220fdb20d8ea6d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":206563,"destBytes":47488,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4C4EE2EB-C305-49BA-88A7-A83242CC525F/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn12@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-45-056_17220fdb20d8ea6d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E5B75513-D37A-407A-B1F1-64DAFC1BE1DB/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-32-00-884_552ef257f518c77e.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6D0C616-C873-4B47-BDFE-64787D5A544E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-32-00-710_d3ab620f5ff8309a.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/15FB0C62-FB8E-431C-9185-3E0B41A979BB/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn54@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-59-049_a8aca17769b2a651.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"How to prepare your app for a global audience","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vdo2w6y4","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/483985DB-0734-442E-987E-8C5009F0EA5D/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The App Store is available in 175 countries and regions and 40 languages to make it easy for people around the world to discover and download your app. This week, we’re showing you how localizing your app can help make it more relevant to local cultures and languages and help you grow your business — and that starts with preparing your app for a global audience.</p><h3>Structure your app for localization</h3><p>Internationalization, the process of structuring your app’s code and UI for localization, is a fundamental first step in building apps for a global audience. With Apple’s powerful tools and technologies, including Xcode 11, Apple APIs, Auto Layout, and Unicode support, it’s easy to prepare your apps to support multiple languages and regions, even before you know which languages you’d like to add.</p>\n<p>In Xcode, make sure your user-visible text and images are separate from your executable code. When you translate these elements into other languages, you can integrate the content back into your app as separate localized resource files stored within the app bundle. </p>\n<p>Images — including image sets, Apple Watch complications, Apple TV image stacks, Sprite Atlases, and symbol sets — can be localized directly in your Asset Catalog. You can also use localized <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">SF system symbols</a> and set the directionality for custom symbols — for example, for right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/43D041DE-3FAB-4C0E-BCE7-D21E5C8E03DF/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Use Apple APIs to correctly express user-visible or dynamically-generated values, such as dates, lengths, weights, prices, and currency symbols, across different locales. Ensure your app accepts user-generated text in any language and in multiple languages at once, independent of the user interface language. This allows app content to appear in someone’s preferred language and format. </p>\n<p>You can also take advantage of Auto Layout to automatically adjust the dimensions and layouts of views, extensive Unicode support to work with text from any language, the powerful text handling technologies of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch to display, lay out, and edit text in many languages, and much more.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/403/\">Watch “Create great localized experiences with Xcode 11” &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing_your_app\">Learn more about localizing your app in Xcode &gt;</a></p><hr><h3>Investigate market factors</h3><p>Market-specific demographics, such as population, language, and purchasing power, can help you better understand areas that might have an affinity or need for your app. Every market has its own preferences for the types of apps or categories customers most enjoy. For example, games are popular worldwide, however strategy games may be more popular in a particular region. </p>\n<p>Consider selecting markets with similar attributes to those in which you have already established success, such as strong app downloads, sales, usage, or retention metrics, as this may make for easier growth. When selecting a market, assess how your app might fit in and how its value and functionality aligns with that market’s needs. You may even identify a need in the market that is not yet filled, allowing you to bring unique value to people with your app.</p><h3>Use App Analytics to determine potential markets</h3><p>If you offer your app worldwide but haven’t localized for particular regions, you can look at key performance metrics, such as Product Page Views, App Units, Sales, and Active Devices, filtered by territory. This can help you determine if your app is attracting people in a particular territory that might benefit from localization. For example, if your app is primarily in English and you see lower than average retention or Sessions per Active Device in Germany, you might consider adding German language support. Keep in mind that some markets may have greater proficiency with your app’s primary language, while others may require more significant localization work. Usage data such as active devices, sessions, and retention include only users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with you.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/analytics/?cid=developer80\">Learn more about gaining insights with App Analytics &gt;</a></p><hr><h3>Consider local culture and customs</h3><p>While your app and product page should each provide a consistent experience across all markets, it’s sometimes valuable to refine certain elements for cultural relevance. For example, you might try incorporating market-specific content or cultural moments, such as special holiday content or regional art styles. You may want to consider any local policies and market regulations, as well as any political or religious sensitivities, to increase the likelihood that your app is well received.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/localization/?cid=developer80\">Learn more about expanding your app to new markets &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/localization/resources/?cid=developer80\">Get more resources for localization &gt;</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 01:16:59 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/483985DB-0734-442E-987E-8C5009F0EA5D/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"941297753b387f68bee1f706e6c67f7a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn98@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-843_3e7aeaa9a88f3e93.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":147844,"destBytes":39850,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/483985DB-0734-442E-987E-8C5009F0EA5D/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn98@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-843_3e7aeaa9a88f3e93.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/43D041DE-3FAB-4C0E-BCE7-D21E5C8E03DF/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-59-175_5002a6d3a28a1f9c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Enhance SMS-delivered code security with domain-bound codes","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=z0i801mg","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C076D234-284F-449F-9EE8-D0C23D8555EE/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Many websites and apps offer additional login security in the form of SMS-delivered codes. On iPhone, Security Code AutoFill makes it easy for people to quickly supply these codes by offering them in the QuickType bar. On a Mac running macOS Big Sur, Mac Catalyst and AppKit apps can take advantage of this feature as well. </p>\n<p>Additionally, starting with iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur, we’re adding an extra layer of security to SMS-delivered codes by allowing you to associate codes with a specific web domain.</p><h3>How domain-bound codes work</h3><p>When you use a domain-bound code, AutoFill will suggest the code if — and only if — the domain is a match for the website or one of your app’s associated domains. For example, if you receive an SMS message that ends with <code>@example.com #123456</code>, AutoFill will offer to fill that code when they interact with example.com, any of its subdomains, or an app associated with example.com. If instead you receive an SMS message that ends with <code>@example.net #123456</code>, AutoFill will not offer the code on example.com or in example.com’s associated app. This makes it harder for an attacker to trick someone into entering one-time codes into a phishing site.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/29B5D7A0-ADBB-4D44-BE37-BEA231ACCA20/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>While iOS and macOS will also display regular SMS-delivered codes in addition to domain-bound codes, we encourage everyone employing this authentication method to adopt this standard to provide a more secure experience for people on your website or app. If a message contains no domain information, it will continue to be offered in all relevant fields through AutoFill.</p><h3>How to set up SMS domain-bound codes</h3><p>You can take advantage of domain-bound codes on both websites and apps with associated domains.</p><p><strong>Set up domain-bound codes for your website</strong>\nIn most cases, AutoFill should work automatically on Safari for iOS and macOS Big Sur, and requires no additional information from you. In cases where it does not, you can add the <code>autocomplete=one-time-code</code> attribute to your web page’s text field. This cues Safari to offer applicable codes in that field.</p><p><strong>Set up domain-bound codes for your app</strong>\nYou can support domain-bound codes by providing an associated domain for your app. If you support Universal Links for your domain, or if AutoFill is currently suggesting saved passwords for your domain in your app’s login screens, your app is already associated with your domain.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/supporting_associated_domains_in_your_app?language=objc\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about supporting associated domains</a></p><p><em>Note: If you’re running into issues when testing your app’s login flows, you may need to provide an additional hint about which fields in your app are one-time code fields. For iOS and Mac Catalyst apps, set the field’s <code>textContentType</code> property to <code>UITextContentType.oneTimeCode</code>. For AppKit apps on macOS, <code>NSTextField</code> has a <code>contentType</code> property that you should set to <code>NSTextContentTypeOneTimeCode</code>.</em></p><hr><h3>How to format SMS domain-bound codes</h3><p>Once your app or website is set up to receive domain-bound codes, you’ll need to provide a simple addition to the SMS messages you send through your backend service to include both the domain and code. Here’s what the text you’ll send looks like:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code>123456 is your Example code.\n\n@example.com #123456</code></pre><p>Everything above the last line of the message is freeform. You're free to customize this part however you like, but it should be something that makes sense to people receiving the code.</p>\n<p>The last line of this message gives AutoFill on iPhone, iPad, or Mac the information it needs to bind the domain and code together and suggest the code for the appropriate website or app.</p>\n<p>In order for domain-bound codes to work properly, you must include this information in the last line of the message, and it must contain the domain and code in the correct order. </p>\n<p><code>@example.com</code></p>\n<p>This is the first part of that last line, and contains the domain of the app or website where you want the code to fill in. Make sure to put a single space after your domain before you begin the segment with your one-time code.</p>\n<p><code>#123456</code> (represents the code 123456)</p>\n<p>The second part of the last line begins with # and contains the string with your app or website’s one-time code.</p><h3>Improve your SMS-delivered codes</h3><p>Domain-bound codes are straightforward for developers to implement, easy for people using your apps and websites to understand, and add more security to the SMS-delivered codes. You can also learn more about domain-bound codes and the development of the message format in the W3C’s Web Platform Incubator Community Group.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/sms-one-time-codes\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about domain-bound codes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Allowing Apps and Websites to Link to Your Content</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 13:45:08 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C076D234-284F-449F-9EE8-D0C23D8555EE/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"481291d9ea7d78399cc4852ea8b23c87","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn62@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-45-017_d83b7c968077f34a.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":45467,"destBytes":12096,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C076D234-284F-449F-9EE8-D0C23D8555EE/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn62@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-45-017_d83b7c968077f34a.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/29B5D7A0-ADBB-4D44-BE37-BEA231ACCA20/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-905_5142a9cd4d227edd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Introducing App Clips.","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=na4c37vj","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4B67EB07-CE50-446C-BF87-4D908B316F80/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Easily discoverable and quick to launch at the moment it’s needed, an app&nbsp;clip is a small part of your app that lets users start and finish an experience in seconds.

In 2009, just a year after the iOS Software Development Kit launched, AssistiveWare released its breakthrough product: <em>Proloquo2Go</em>.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89685241-78D2-4F01-828E-A2C994CBCBD5/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">*Proloquo2Go* is a symbol-based keyboard to aid people with difficulties in speaking.</p></div><p><em>Proloquo2Go</em> gives a voice to those who have difficulty speaking (proloquo is Latin for “to speak out loud”). Paired with an iPhone or iPad, it also made this assistive technology more widely available. “It enables people to start learning to use it much earlier. It used to be that you’d get an expensive machine when you were 7 or 8 years old,” says Niemeijer.</p>\n<p>“With an iPad or iPod touch, you can start around 2 or 3 years old, which makes a huge difference, because some kids then can go to regular schools and are not reliant on special education.” </p>\n<p><em>Proloquo2Go</em> presents a variety of simple drawings; tap them to create sentences that the app will read aloud. Instead of providing only a limited number of predetermined sentences and phrases, <em>Proloquo2Go</em> lets you combine words in infinite ways.</p><p>“It offers users total communication,” says Niemeijer. “It allows people to not just use utilitarian language, such as asking or answering questions, but also to share stories or emotional anecdotes. It allows them to tell a joke.”</p>\n<p>AssistiveWare currently has a half dozen apps available across iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. <em>Pictello</em> lets users create storybooks using text-to-speech and the photos on their iOS device. <em>Keeble</em> is a highly customizable keyboard app that supports users with motor challenges, low vision, and dyslexia. And <em>News-2-You</em> publishes a weekly newspaper, written with both text and symbols, for beginning readers. </p>\n<p>Nijhuis is proud of what Niemeijer has managed to build. “I love having seen David’s works grow from the software he made just for me to the company it is today, serving so many people all over the world.” </p>\n<p>The designer continues to influence AssistiveWare’s evolution: He created the company logo and the app icon for <em>Proloquo2Go</em>.</p><hr><p><em>Originally published on the App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 23 May 2020 01:44:16 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/200D3575-A203-42A5-A03E-7412EE4E3BAC/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"3cbd4c580bbc3424a906687f2c340523","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-47-056_447602a5ea6d21d4.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":627,"sourceBytes":164724,"destBytes":45154,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/200D3575-A203-42A5-A03E-7412EE4E3BAC/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-47-056_447602a5ea6d21d4.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6EF977AD-5A23-495C-BDAB-F8929292E72E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-02-180_1bd63d473c7b9782.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/89685241-78D2-4F01-828E-A2C994CBCBD5/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn33@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-32-01-330_e18795d159eb1ca7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Updated Certificate for Game Center Authentication","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09132019a","description":"<p>A new certificate for server-based <span class=\"nowrap\">Game Center</span> verification is available via the publicKeyUrl property of <span class=\"nowrap\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayer/1515407-generateidentityverificationsign\">generateIdentityVerificationSignature</a></span>.

He started writing the first version of the software back in 1989 because he needed an editor that could handle “large” files—something north of 32 KB.</p>\n<p>“One of the limitations of Macintosh Pascal was that source files couldn’t be more than 32 kilobytes,” he explains. </p>\n<p>Over a quarter century has passed since BBEdit’s commercial debut, and the app has become a favorite among developers, scientists, web designers, and writers alike for its sheer power and speed. (Siegel regularly tests 12 GB files these days.)</p>\n<p>Siegel remains BBEdit’s principal architect and lead engineer, and the caffeine molecule tattooed on his arm says a lot about his work ethic. We spoke with him from his Bare Bones Software headquarters north of Boston, which Siegel shares with a pair of African gray parrots.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AC00999C-26CF-4096-9325-2F058066B538/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><hr><p><em><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/\">Developers, do you have an interesting story to tell? The App Store‘s editorial team would love to hear it!</a></em></p><hr><p><strong>What were the early days of BBEdit like?</strong></p>\n<p>Back then, the way to put Mac software out in the world was to submit it to the Info-Mac Archive, an FTP repository hosted by Stanford. So that’s what I did, and word started to spread pretty fast online. </p>\n<p>I had mentioned that if anyone wanted a copy on disk, they could mail a floppy and a self-addressed return envelope to me at my home. I was inundated with floppies.</p>\n<p><strong>BBEdit has been around for a lifetime by software standards. How have you seen the user base change?</strong></p>\n<p>Our base started as Mac software developers, scientists, system administrators, and other technical users. The first big change was popularity among HTML authors and web back-end developers. As word spread, we were able to help folks understand that the internet was built with text—that you could treat text as data or you could treat it as a document. So the next wave brought in internet architects, cryptanalysts, and scientists from unexpected disciplines.</p>\n<p>The third wave has been mostly writers and other content creators—folks who see their text not as data but as words, and who want as little as possible between them and their words.</p>\n<p>However, as many changes as we’ve seen, there has been a delightful constancy to our customers: They’re people who simply want to get work done. They’re not distracted by shiny things in their software tools. </p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the more surprising projects you’ve seen people create with BBEdit?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been so much! Our customers have used BBEdit to create novels, doctoral theses, and other long written works. One customer has used BBEdit as part of the development workflow to fly UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] the size of an F-16; the flight control system sends data to BBEdit in real time, where the engineers examine it, change it, and send it back to the aircraft in just a few seconds. And the Human Genome Project even uses BBEdit to help analyze long sequences of DNA.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C3DDA113-1489-486E-AF99-0657F57C7B2B/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Version 3.0 of BBEdit, “accelerated for Power Macintosh,” from 1994.</p></div><p><strong>How has the software evolved over the years?</strong></p>\n<p>BBEdit has undergone one huge technical transformation after another. First there was the port to PowerPC. We developed an OpenDoc component, and some of the internal architecture work we did for that is still in use.</p>\n<p>Then came a nearly complete rewrite of its internal architecture, followed closely by a port to Mac OS X—BBEdit was the first third-party application to run natively on that new OS—and then the port to Intel. Last year we finished rewriting BBEdit again, this time as an AppKit application. </p>\n<p>In between PowerPC and OpenDoc, there was another development: the emergence of the World Wide Web. BBEdit had a plug-in model at the time, and two of our customers—one in the UK and one in Spain—independently wrote HTML markup tools. This was 1995, and we had no idea what HTML was, but we could tell that it was going somewhere. So we evaluated the tools, chose a set of them to bundle with BBEdit, and off we went. Little did we know...</p>\n<p><strong>BBEdit is one of the most beloved apps out there. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve always had the utmost respect for the user. Every internal decision about look and function answers the questions “What does the customer need?” and “How can we help them be more productive?” (Not “How can we give them what they’re asking for?” because that isn’t the right question to answer.) The Macintosh was introduced to help anybody do great things. It’s something we believe in completely.</p><p><em>Originally published on the Mac App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:47:37 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E914381A-67BB-4236-8645-48483C67B47A/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"1f303c553adf6b53a26767b4f7e4ab3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-790_bcdf774460e3693f.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":627,"sourceBytes":172529,"destBytes":49856,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/E914381A-67BB-4236-8645-48483C67B47A/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-790_bcdf774460e3693f.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AC00999C-26CF-4096-9325-2F058066B538/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-32-01-830_35dd8b989d154580.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C3DDA113-1489-486E-AF99-0657F57C7B2B/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-01-068_db7e5c56e7932e9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Behind the Design: Shapr3D","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i6qdbzn9","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0EA2828B-5B6C-419B-8A62-75ACFDEA8CD0/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Five years ago, István Csanády hung a piece of paper on the wall of his nascent company’s all-too-small office. Scrawled upon it: “Easy should be easy. Hard must not be impossible.”</p>\n<p>Though this phrase was written on sheet paper, it might have well been etched into stone. It became the founding principle for Csanády’s app, Shapr3D — a reinvention of computer-assisted design (CAD) systems, created exclusively with Multi-Touch and Apple Pencil in mind.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F1E2EDE1-B89A-4C56-9369-B58368517EF3/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>While inspirational phrases have spawned many a weightless office poster (and a smattering of snarky variations), this one was weighted in truth by the frustrating real-world digital design experiences of Csanády’s family. “We have eight or nine architects in three generations in the family,” he says. </p>\n<p>As a child, he remembers his mother grousing over the arduous multi-month process of getting new CAD software, which often involved enrolling in a costly school to understand how the program worked. “Instead, eventually, she [would just hire] a couple of CAD draftsmen.” </p>\n<p>As both a 3D modeling enthusiast and a budding software engineer, Csanády was instantly drawn to the problem. “A great product is characterized by a minimal tool time,” Csanády says. “Nobody really wants to [take time to] learn to use their software.“</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EE53A4E9-D6B2-45C3-9AB1-F1697EA379C7/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>He founded his first CAD startup in 2010 after a brief stint as an iPhone developer. While this first venture was unsuccessful, Csanády kept thinking. He took long bike rides. He pondered the problem in the late hours of the night. And he began creating the first prototypes of a touch-based 3D modeling system for iPad.</p>\n<p>“I got obsessed,” he confesses. In 2014, out of pure faith in the endeavor, Csanády quit his job as a senior software engineer and got to work. While iPad Pro and Pencil had at the time yet to be introduced, he started exploring what a touch-and-stylus interface might look like.</p>\n<p>“The best interactions are always the ones that have physical analogies,” Csanády says. He drew inspiration from tactile tools, creating digital controls for each modeling operation that mimicked their real-world counterparts. And when iPad Pro and Apple Pencil launched, Csanády and team quickly brought the drawing tool into their planning. </p>\n<p>\"What makes the Apple Pencil and its stylus interaction super powerful is that both are metaphors for the real world,” he says. “And because they are metaphors for the physical world around us, we just don't have to educate [someone] about the function of these input devices… That radically shortens the learning curve.”</p>\n<p>Csanády and his newly-growing team used Multi-Touch and Apple Pencil to build a solid foundation for Shapr3D. Perfecting it, however, was a years-long affair. “There are no shortcuts,” he says. “We did hundreds of prototypes.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F8875605-C29A-4AC3-96C2-DF92D6EB983F/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The team interviewed professional 3D modelers and architects, running case studies and inviting them to use — and sometimes break — their software. “You need to see them fail a thousand times,” he says. “And based on those failures, we can tweak tiny little things, and step-by-step get to the right solution.”</p>\n<p>Csanády has more than a few lessons he and his team have learned when it comes to designing a professional multitouch interface. “Explicit is always better than implicit,” he says. As an example, he references Shapr3D’s push-pull interface, which displays arrow-handles on items that people can ‘grab’ to move something around the screen. “Until a couple of years ago, we didn't show those arrows,” he says. “That was one of the greatest learnings of all time… if we explicitly show these handles, that increases the success rate by two orders of magnitude.”</p>\n<p>Four years after launch, Shapr3D maintains this obsessive focus on building the perfect tool for its professionals. “What works for Shapr3D works because we have a very specific audience in a very specific context,” Csanády says. “The product works for our audience because we designed it with them in mind.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1CFF9D96-C834-4D5E-B29D-75EB3850340F/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The Shapr3D team has grown significantly since its early days in that cramped office. Csanády employs a staff of 55 in Budapest, all of whom are working tirelessly to keep iterating and improving upon the app to make it an even better tool for professionals. They’ve added exhaustive tutorials, contextual and adaptive controls, keyboard shortcuts, and continue to adjust the workflow to be an even smoother process for everyone who uses the app. ”It's about always raising the bar and always being a little unhappy,” he says. “You can always do 10 percent better… Never be satisfied with what you have built.”</p>\n<p>In addition to field studies, the team incorporates analytics, usage data, and App Store reviews into its long-term product planning. They continuously evaluate opportunities, identify the gaps where the company is now, and look at where they want to be in the future. It’s a complex multidimensional puzzle, but Csanády’s vision is clear — and just a little bit ambitious. “We want to become a verb, like Xerox.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4587B663-534E-4BA4-AC9F-7A7EF9B77132/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.shapr3d.com/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about Shapr3D</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521733404\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Read about Shapr3D on the App Store</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shapr-3d-cad-modeling/id1091675654\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Download Shapr3D on the App Store</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 15:35:08 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0EA2828B-5B6C-419B-8A62-75ACFDEA8CD0/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"bbfe6c7147af92082a12f2d11b8affbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn97@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-026_03507fca84422284.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":163498,"destBytes":57482,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0EA2828B-5B6C-419B-8A62-75ACFDEA8CD0/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn97@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-026_03507fca84422284.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F1E2EDE1-B89A-4C56-9369-B58368517EF3/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-02-688_f9df3129cbe8fa82.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EE53A4E9-D6B2-45C3-9AB1-F1697EA379C7/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-02-023_821a636b1c0132e9.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F8875605-C29A-4AC3-96C2-DF92D6EB983F/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn1@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-02-100_b35350d7862108a5.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1CFF9D96-C834-4D5E-B29D-75EB3850340F/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn81@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-00-518_eea37a3b15ef2465.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4587B663-534E-4BA4-AC9F-7A7EF9B77132/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn62@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-59-423_7dca7edf31f4d295.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Augmented reality updates now available.

Whether someone is tapping on your app icon for the first time or returning from elsewhere, they should be able to get started immediately. A launch screen lets you provide that seamless and adaptive experience while your app loads any pertinent information in the background, and you can create it directly in Xcode.</p>\n<p>Designing the right storyboard for your launch screen can make a world of difference in how quickly you can immerse people into your user interface. Here are a few recommendations and tips to help you create great launch screens for your app.</p><h3>Support all device screen sizes by creating launch screen storyboards in Xcode</h3><p>Although people won’t be able to interact with your launch screen, you should always build your screen using an Xcode storyboard. Storyboards are flexible and adaptable and support all device screen sizes, which allows you to use a single storyboard to manage your launch screens for every platform you support.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Don't use a static image for your launch screen. Static images have been deprecated and all App Store apps must use an Xcode storyboard to provide an app’s launch screen by June 30, 2020. Learn more <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03262020b\">here</a>.</em></p><h3>Mirror your main screen</h3><p>The fastest way to convince someone your app is responsive and ready to go is to show them the same interface in your launch screen that they expect on your app’s main screen. </p>\n<p>When an app first starts up, it shows its launch screen before transitioning to the main interface. When someone switches away, the app automatically saves an App Snapshot of its interface so that it can return to where they left off; if an app can’t restore its state in this way, however, it will display the launch screen instead.</p>\n<p>As such, you want to make sure your launch screen storyboard looks close to identical to your main interface. If you include elements that look dramatically different, it may be confusing or jarring when your app shifts to the main screen. If you have an app that might take a bit longer to load, like a game, and you’d like to provide any kind of animated experience during that time, we recommend using a solid color background; from there, the app can move gracefully to the game’s first screen.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13281207-EE0F-4F4E-9216-E52E4C92AB2D/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\"></p></div><h3>Consider the light and the dark</h3><p>When someone launches your app, you want them to feel immersed — no matter their appearance settings. We’ve already addressed how to create adaptive launch screen storyboards, but it’s also important to think about a device’s appearance. If your app supports Dark Mode, your launch screen storyboard should as well. Make sure that your storyboard uses adaptive colors, and set the background of the view to the System Background Color.</p><h3>Assess your assets</h3><p>Anything you add to your launch screen storyboard should be optimized appropriately. If you want to add an asset to your storyboard, such as a static image that normally appears as part of your app’s user interface, make sure that its image dimensions are no larger than the view it's going to be placed in. Your storyboard may not display if you use assets at larger resolutions.</p><h3>Launch with a global audience in mind</h3><p>Unlike your app’s interface, your app’s launch screen can’t be localized into other languages: Any text you display in your storyboard will remain in the original language you select. As such, it's best to avoid including any text at all.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/423/\">Watch “Optimizing app launch”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html\">Learn more about designing with storyboards in the <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Developer Library</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen/\">Learn more about launch screens in the Human <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Interface Guidelines</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/dev31645f17f\">Learn how to create a Storyboard using <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Interface Builder</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/responding_to_the_launch_of_your_app\">Learn more about responding to app launches in the <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Developer Library</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/dev62c993289\">Learn more about storyboards, scenes, and connections in the <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Xcode guide</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface\">Learn more about supporting Dark Mode in your interface in the <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">Developer Library</span></a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 18:08:10 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4BA466BD-84A5-48AB-BB84-F97AB8164464/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"c7fe7b5c726c021dedfb7d7d40aac1df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn69@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-395_e0568e63b0b51b7b.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":70705,"destBytes":16186,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4BA466BD-84A5-48AB-BB84-F97AB8164464/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn69@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-395_e0568e63b0b51b7b.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/13281207-EE0F-4F4E-9216-E52E4C92AB2D/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn38@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-01-561_2d74474e1e3d646d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Submit Your iOS Apps to the App&nbsp;Store","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09102019a","description":"<p>With iOS&nbsp;13, your app can take advantage of Dark&nbsp;Mode, a dramatic new look for iPhone, Sign&nbsp;in&nbsp;with&nbsp;Apple, the fast, easy way to sign in to apps, and the latest advances in ARKit&nbsp;3, Core&nbsp;ML&nbsp;3, and Siri.

These different core types allow you to deliver apps that have both great performance and great battery life. To take full advantage of their performance and efficiency, you can provide the operating system (OS) with information about how to execute your app in the most optimal way. From there, the OS uses semantic information to make better scheduling and performance control decisions.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore some best practices to help you get the most out of Apple Silicon and create faster, more efficient apps. Discover how to adapt your code for asymmetric multiprocessing, adopt Quality of Service classes, and find out more about Grand Central Dispatch APIs.</p><h3>Adapt your code for asymmetric multiprocessing</h3><p>Unlike traditional symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems which use many identical cores, asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) systems have cores that are not all equal.</p>\n<p>Apple Silicon Macs are AMP systems, having both performance cores (P cores) and efficiency cores (E cores). Even though E cores are optimized for high efficiency, they offer significant compute resources for apps to take advantage of.</p>\n<p>An app may execute threads on both P and E cores over a period of time. The OS places threads on P or E cores based on the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information your app provides</li>\n<li>Observation of the app’s workload</li>\n<li>Observation of the system as whole</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Apple Silicon Macs, the system observes applications and daemons separately from each other. This allows the system to execute them with individual efficiency and performance characteristics. As an example, an app running in the background may have its threads placed on E cores to optimize battery life while the foreground app is taking advantage of P cores.</p><h3>Use Quality of Service classes to categorize work</h3><p>Quality of Service (QoS) classes are the primary way for you to categorize work performed by your app and provide the OS with semantic information on the nature of that work and how it affects someone using your app.</p>\n<p>On AMP systems, the operating system uses the energy-efficiency information conveyed by QoS classes to influence placement of threads on P or E cores. You can use the following QoS classes on Apple platforms:</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9A85BC1B-B3AB-4F1C-97E7-49EDD69A6E51/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>For instance, you can use the QoS class Background to categorize all of your app’s background processes in order to maximize battery life.</p>\n<p>For more details on Quality of Service, watch “Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD” from WWDC15 and explore the energy efficiency guide. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"grid activity\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"column large-4 small-4 no-padding-top no-padding-bottom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc15/718\" class=\"activity-image-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"actiity-image medium-scale\" width=\"250\" src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/images/2/588/588_wide_250x141_2x.jpg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"column large-8 small-8 padding-left-small padding-top-small padding-bottom-small no-padding-top no-padding-bottom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"activity-tags\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"activity-tag event\"><span class=\"smaller\">WWDC15</span></li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc15/718\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"no-margin-bottom activity-title\">Building Responsive and Efficient Apps with GCD</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"activity-description\">watchOS and iOS Multitasking place increased demands on your application's efficiency and responsiveness.

This is because not all cores are equal and so worker threads will not make identical progress. Instead, subdivide parallel problems into a large number of pieces and use a work-stealing algorithm to balance these pieces across threads to keep all workers busy.</p>\n<p><code>GCD</code> is the recommended API for expressing concurrent and parallel workloads in your application. Parallel workloads should use the <code>concurrentPerform</code> / <code>dispatch_apply</code> API to execute parallel instances of a block on multiple cores simultaneously. Set the number of iterations to at least three times the total number of cores on the system. This enables the work-stealing algorithm inside GCD to appropriately balance iterations.</p>\n<p>If you have an existing codebase that cannot adopt GCD and uses a custom pthread worker pool, you may benefit from implementing a work-stealing algorithm to achieve optimal performance.

If you have a question about building watchOS apps with SwiftUI, for example, you might tag that post <strong>SwiftUI</strong> and <strong>watchOS</strong>, and people searching either topic would get it in their search results.</p>\n<p>Tags are listed on every post in the forums: You can view all of the most recent questions filed under a given tag by clicking or tapping on it — as well as check out any relevant technical documentation or information for that tag.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/forums-tags\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">See all available tags on the forums</a></p><h3>Search swiftly</h3><p>Available on every forums page, the search bar lets you look for questions, tags, and profiles. You can supercharge your search queries with a few quick tips — here’s how.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyword search</strong>\nType in a word that’s three characters or longer and hit return to get question titles or descriptions related to the word (or words) you’ve typed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag search</strong>\nWant to search for a tag? Type it in brackets, like so:</p>\n<p><code>[mac]</code></p><p>This query will return information on tags with the word “mac” in them. Type in the name of a specific tag, and you’ll go straight to the tag’s landing page, which contains a brief description of the tag and a list of recently tagged questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Combination searches</strong>\nIf you know the name of a specific tag or multiple tags, you can combine them with a keyword to further refine your search. For example:</p>\n<p><code>[macOS][Beta] Catalyst</code></p><p>This search will return all questions that have “Catalyst” in their title or description and are tagged with both “macOS” and “Beta.” </p>\n<p><strong>Find a person</strong>\nWant to take a look at someone’s profile? Use the following:</p>\n<p><code>user:username</code></p><p>Replace “username” with the person’s username that you’re looking for to get a list of matching people (or, if you’ve entered an exact match, you’ll visit that person’s profile).</p><h3>Quickly spot Apple Recommended answers</h3><p>When browsing forum threads, you can use colors and shapes to quickly learn a bit more about that post. If using a mouse or trackpad, you can also hover your pointer over any box to get more information about that post.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/548ECE61-FFBB-4D8C-ACF2-A43944D3522A/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Each question displays a color-coded square to indicate status. Blue squares are unsolved issues, green are solved, and green-bordered questions are solved with an Apple Recommended answer.</p></div><p>All unsolved questions appear with a <strong>blue</strong> box to the left of the thread title, with the number of replies inside that box.</p>\n<p>Once a question has been marked “solved,” that box turns <strong>green</strong>. And if an Apple Developer Forums admin has marked that answer “Apple Recommended,” the post’s green box gains a darker border around it.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Tip: Be a problem-solver</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Our community has a wealth of knowledge of both Apple platforms and products. If you spot a question on the forums that you think you can answer, you can reply to that post with your suggested solution. If it helps the author of the post, they can mark your answer as the solution to their problem, and you get reputation points for providing the best answer. If one of the Apple staff members agrees, they may promote your answer to Apple Recommended — netting you even more reputation.</em></p><hr><p>When you're viewing threads themselves, you can spot answers marked as Apple Recommended along the left side of the screen: They’re represented with a black circular icon with a white Apple logo inside of it.</p><h3>Rep your reputation</h3><p>Great community members are key to a great experience — and on the Apple Developer Forums, you can help your community surface important questions and earn reputation through constructive participation in threads. Moderators may review forum posts to ensure a safe and secure platform for you and other developers. Once a post has been approved, however, the community can rank and promote posts to the front page or top of a tag.</p>\n<p>The forums use a points-based system: Participating in threads and constructively providing answers can help you gain points and privileges.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the perks you can gain on the forums for participating actively:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you solve problems, you get a “solved” badge on your profile that lists the number of questions you’ve solved.</li>\n<li>When you provide a solution that admins mark as “Apple Recommended,” you receive an “Apple Recommended” badge on your profile.</li>\n<li>You can report posts for being duplicates or spam. (Requires at least 50 points reputation)</li>\n<li>You can downvote questions or replies. (Requires at least 100 points reputation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gain points by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing a reply that gets marked as “Apple Recommended”: 25 points</li>\n<li>Providing a reply that gets marked as \"Solved\" by the author: 15 points</li>\n<li>Asking a question that gets upvoted: 5 points</li>\n<li>Providing a reply that gets upvoted: 5 points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lose points by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having an upvote rescinded for your question or reply: -5 points (neutralizes the previous upvote)</li>\n<li>Providing a question or reply that gets downvoted: -2 points</li>\n<li>Having spam or inappropriate/ abusive content that you posted removed: -15</li>\n</ul><h3>Share replies within a post</h3><p>Want to link out to a forum thread in Messages, email, or elsewhere? You can share the original post or any reply by going to a thread and tapping or clicking on the Share button, found inline to the right of the post.</p><h3>Post like a pro</h3><p>Ready to ask a question or share your thoughts? Here’s how to make your post look great.</p>\n<p><strong>Content is crucial</strong>\nWhen posting a question, consider what you can provide as background to help people understand your issue. Try to mention any limitations, assumptions, or simplifications. If you forget something or make a typo, you can edit your content for up to 15 minutes after posting.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag it up</strong>\nYou can add up to four tags to any post. Pick tags that relate directly to your question, and consider whether you’d want to see your post listed within that tag if it were being made by someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Mark it down</strong>\nThe forums take advantage of the Markdown language to quickly and easily style your text without cumbersome formatting, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headers</li>\n<li>Ordered lists, tasks, and unordered lists</li>\n<li>Bold and italic text</li>\n<li>Links</li>\n<li>Code and syntax highlighting</li>\n<li>Blockquotes, code, and text quotes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Attach a log</strong>\nIf your post would benefit from attaching log content, click or tap on the attachment icon in the text editor. Add a title, paste your log content, and click Add Text. This text will be linked in the body of your post. (Note: Image attachments are not currently supported.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mark as solved</strong>\nIf someone provides you with a great answer on the thread, don’t forget to mark your question as solved by clicking or tapping on the checkmark icon next to the reply in question. You can only mark one reply as solved, and it can’t be unmarked. (You also can’t solve your own question.)</p><h3>Event excitement</h3><p>At WWDC20, the forums are offering several event-specific tags to explore.</p>\n<p>Everyone can view and read all WWDC-tagged posts. When you sign in with your Apple ID, you can also share your thoughts using the <strong>WWDC20 Community</strong> tag or request help around conference logistics with the <strong>WWDC20 Support</strong> tag. </p>\n<p>Additionally, if you’ve been a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program since June 11, 2020 or you won the Swift Student Challenge, you can post on session-specific conference tags by signing in with the Apple ID associated with your developer account. Use these tags to ask questions about the technology within any given session and connect directly with Apple engineering teams.  </p><hr><p><em>Have more thoughts on the forums?

Ha ha, just kidding. It’s raining.”</p>\n<p>A smack-talking to-do list app might not seem like the big idea that would let you quit your day job. In fact, Carrot’s success caught even Mueller off guard. “For some reason, people have responded to this. I still can’t believe sometimes any of this caught on,” he says.</p>\n<p>Working out of a spare room in his Philadelphia-area home, the former aspiring screenwriter has penned thousands of lines of dialogue for his apps, which he constantly updates to nod to current events.

I love to write and create characters and tell stories, but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.” </p>\n<p>Mueller’s first instinct was to hire a developer to realize his vision. “I didn’t want to sound like a jerk when talking to a programmer, so I bought a book on iOS programming for beginners, just to know what terms to use,” he says. As he read <em>iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>, Mueller was surprised by how easy it is to make an app. By January 2013, <em>Carrot To-Do</em> had launched on the App Store. It took him about a month to create.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>I love to write and create characters and tell stories, but I had no real idea of what I would do with my life.</p><cite>Brian Mueller, Carrot creator</cite></blockquote><p>Initially, sales were tepid. It took a couple of years, and a few more apps, before <em>Carrot</em> found a broad-enough audience for Mueller to quit his day job and become a full-time developer. </p>\n<p>The <em>Carrot</em> universe continues to expand. Mueller has built seven iOS apps and an iOS sticker pack, as well as Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac versions of <em>Carrot Weather</em>. With the arrival of AR (augmented reality) technologies on iOS, Mueller taught himself how to add an AR component to <em>Carrot Weather</em>.

You can enable or adjust either in the Settings app or on your iPhone’s Watch app at any time. \n We recommend testing your Watch app with these options enabled to make sure your app is fully accessible. You may also want to consider testing your interface with Bold Text, Reduce Transparency, and Reduce Motion. </p>\n<p>For each test you run, ask yourself a few questions: How does your interface change? Are there aspects of your design that are no longer being well-represented? Take detailed notes and screenshots — these can help you go back and address potential issues in both your designs and your app’s Xcode project.</p><h3>Scale up, scale down</h3><p>Compared with other Apple products, the small size of an Apple Watch display means far less space for presenting text. As such, it can be tempting to consider specifying fixed smaller font sizes so that more text can be shown on screen at once.</p>\n<p>Despite this, it’s important to use legible font sizes and support Dynamic Type. Displaying more text on screen, while helpful in principle, won’t help anyone if it’s too small to read. Instead, let text scale naturally, and use Apple Watch’s swipe gestures or rotate the Digital Crown to read longer text.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A963C9F9-AEC9-4ACB-999B-7ED2A1B7D29D/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">In watchOS 5, four large type sizes were added to the built-in styles on Apple Watch. Each column in this table is manifested as a type size option, which people can set on Apple Watch in **Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size**. </p></div><p>The quickest way to support Dynamic Type and text scaling is to use built-in text styles, which set type using Apple Watch’s system font: SF Compact. This font is specifically designed for optimal legibility at small sizes, offering nine built-in styles in a range of sizes and weights to help make text in your app as readable as possible.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, all text in your app should scale appropriately when people adjust their text size. Fixed text sizes should be used only for information that is clearly legible at its default setting. For example, the Podcasts app uses built-in text styles to display the podcast title at a consistently large size, and enables its smaller text elements to scale.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/03ECC669-0B59-4702-A8E3-1126B7291D26/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">When text is set to the smallest size, the Podcasts app displays two full episode rows on a 44mm Apple Watch. At the largest size, there are fewer rows displayed but the episode title, date and duration are much larger. </p></div><p>If you plan to use a custom font within your app, you’ll need to take a few additional steps to ensure that it works with Dynamic Type, including adding the font to your project and configuring text styles.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app\">Learn more about adding custom&nbsp;fonts&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/scaling_fonts_automatically\">Learn more about scaling fonts using Dynamic&nbsp;Type&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Support VoiceOver with accessibility labels</h3><p>VoiceOver is a gesture-based screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your Apple Watch, and helps you navigate it without the need to see the screen. You can add support for VoiceOver in your app with accessibility labels, which help people using the feature understand how your interface is constructed. </p><hr><p><em>Fun fact: If you want to quickly test VoiceOver in your app, you can use Siri. Just enable Siri and ask it to “Turn on VoiceOver.”</em></p><hr><p>When someone looks at your interface on Apple Watch, your app can rely on common visual paradigms like button shapes and lists to communicate information and actions. For VoiceOver, think about how you might translate that experience to someone hearing the interface of your app: Start by designating a clear reading order of your interface elements, and make sure that you label your interface elements with brief and clear descriptions.</p><p>There’s one more step to consider when implementing VoiceOver: Your audience may want to hear your interface in another language. VoiceOver supports more than 35 languages, and you can make sure your app is ready for use in all of them by localizing your text strings so that all accessibility labels and hints are read in the appropriate language. </p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v56qu1b3\">Learn more about crafting a great VoiceOver experience in your app &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel\">Learn more about adding accessibility labels to your app &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1417694-localizedstring\">Learn more about localizing your text strings &gt;</a></p><h3>Watch and learn</h3><p>Apple Watch is our most personal device, and it’s important to provide flexibility for people to experience their apps in the way that best suits them. For everything you create, it’s worth taking the time to test your app and make any adjustments. Whether you’re adding scalable text or incorporating a better VoiceOver experience, these changes have a big impact on people who need or want accessibility features on Apple Watch, and they’ll likely also help you craft better overall designs for everyone who enjoys your app. </p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/introduction/\">Learn more about designing with accessibility in&nbsp;mind&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/254/\">Watch “How to write great accessibility&nbsp;labels”&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/\">Learn more about designing type for your&nbsp;apps&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">Download SF&nbsp;Compact&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/\">Download design templates for Apple&nbsp;Watch&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/supporting_voiceover_in_your_app\">Learn more about supporting VoiceOver in your&nbsp;app&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.apple.com/iphone/11/#/iph3e2e2281\">How to use VoiceOver on Apple&nbsp;Watch&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 22:01:27 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/890D50EB-A43A-4C1A-8FF2-0919A9ADC3E9/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"55d6883b5a61952b7faa600108b477be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-44-999_10b0bb95da72e878.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":38241,"destBytes":10830,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/890D50EB-A43A-4C1A-8FF2-0919A9ADC3E9/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-44-999_10b0bb95da72e878.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/522672F5-6313-4D44-8B5C-061819DC37D2/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn33@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-561_200ec4560dccf443.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A963C9F9-AEC9-4ACB-999B-7ED2A1B7D29D/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn38@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-32-10-318_5bc6d3aad1962240.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/03ECC669-0B59-4702-A8E3-1126B7291D26/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-00-249_be1145a2d78688da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Measuring Subscription Performance","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1w6gezsv","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F7F0EE39-F9A1-450E-ABD4-307C7E3EF25B/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\"></p></div><p>View and analyze subscription data to better understand how your subscriptions are performing.

And yet, Sam Rosenthal dealt himself a winning hand with his studio’s game, <em>Where Cards Fall</em> — one more than nine years in the making. “<em>Where Cards Fall</em> was a labor of love for the better part of my life,” he says. Originating as a student project while Rosenthal attended USC, the game evolved over years of late-night coffee shop sessions into a 2020 Apple Design Award winner.</p>\n<p>“We wouldn’t let [<em>Where Cards Fall</em>] go,” he says. “We had confidence that we were making something special and different and interesting.” Despite early rejections from publishers, Rosenthal and his collaborators cut through a deck stacked against them to make the kind of game they wanted to see more of in the world.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B99BAD58-265F-45C8-B311-BAA7BA640BD1/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Growing up, Rosenthal had an early passion for games and game design. But he found little he could share with his friends or family, who weren’t as interested in the medium. “There weren’t many experiences that they could really relate to,” he says. So Rosenthal set out to create some. In college, he dreamed up the idea for <em>Where Cards Fall</em> — a story about growing up and “the messiness of life” — while listening to Radiohead’s “House of Cards.”</p>\n<p>The game mechanics are intentionally simple, using common system gestures on each platform to explore the story and its card-based puzzles. It’s both a core part of <em>Where Cards Fall</em> and the founding principle of Rosenthal’s studio The Game Band: Make beautiful games that resonate with the world.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/488DF477-DCE8-4FA2-99A8-93E195FCC21A/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>“We're creating these little boxes of exploration for people,” Rosenthal says. “Little places for them to discover something that might delight them, or might teach them something about themselves.” In <em>Where Cards Fall</em>, people explore the memories of the protagonist, an aspiring architect. Those memories are wordlessly described through sound, music, and exquisitely crafted 3D spaces, along with the game’s eponymous cards — which provide glimpses into the past as you build them into structures, doorways, reconstructed spaces, and bridges.</p>\n<p>The game's architectural motif, in many ways, illustrates Rosenthal’s entire philosophy around game design, which he describes an invisible art. “When you go into a beautifully designed building, the way that you navigate through the space is not an accident,” he says. Game design, too, provides the player with that structure — giving them the framework to experience feelings, ideas, and interactions within a living story.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>Often the invisible arts are the ones that affect us the most, or they just change our perception.</p><cite>Sam Rosenthal, creative director of Where Cards Fall</cite></blockquote><p>When crafting the mechanics and design of <em>Where Cards Fall</em>, Rosenthal and his team took inspiration from both gaming and the larger art world. Games like <em>Portal</em>, <em>The Witness</em>, and the <em>Zelda</em> series helped the studio as they explored onboarding, pacing, and the game’s puzzle structure, while <em>Inside</em> and <em>Journey</em> brought the team new ideas on crafting an “unforgettable atmosphere.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1B0A1A8A-9133-475D-A4F6-95573FB40213/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Art director Joshua Harvey designed the game’s moody, moving artwork, which is partially influenced by the Bauhaus movement — a celebration of the mathematical underpinning in shapes and lines. The art is designed to work in tandem with the game’s interface, blending everything together to create the perfect atmosphere while still providing helpful guidance for the player. </p>\n<p>“We often think of UI as this separate layer on top of the game’s art style, but a successful art style is simultaneously beautiful and functional,” Rosenthal says. In <em>Where Cards Fall</em>, the grass nibs in the forest and the tiles in the city are specifically arranged to help the player see the grid for planning their structures, while the brickwork on the sides of certain platforms provides subtle cues to help players discern heights.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DF5B30A4-5CEA-4B49-AC27-99C7C9E8B48E/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EA7C02A6-E35C-46E3-972C-770D3B4DA0EB/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The game’s icon further stylizes the protagonist of Where Cards Fall during the story’s present-day winter forest. “It’s not somebody that is lost in the past, but somebody that maybe has learned from what happened, has reflected, and is looking towards what could be,” says Rosenthal.</p></div><p>The game’s hand-drawn aesthetic also ties back into the main character's interest in art and architecture. “Drawing is [their] way of processing the world and imagining what it could be,” Rosenthal says. “It gives the player a stronger connection to the protagonist and the passion that drives them.”</p>\n<p>Despite the many influences the team drew upon to craft *Where Cards Fall, the game has its own unique style and tone, in part due to the work they put in to stay aligned across game mechanics, sound, music, and art design. “We found it crucial to create a set of internal rules so that we could stay cohesive,” Rosenthal says. </p>\n<p>The cards and their puzzles were a big part of creating these guidelines. “I originally thought big, sprawling puzzles would be intriguing, but quickly realized that smaller ones created the most interesting challenges,” he explains. “Once I had an overarching style, I began to develop smaller rules: A pile of cards should be used in at least two different places, otherwise it feels extraneous. And players should never have to restart a puzzle, since that discourages experimentation.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/159ECC9C-DEF4-45C6-AB8A-02C3BEDA6C16/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F745B88C-6B1C-4930-BE4E-6D99180E9700/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DA385E51-2750-41A5-A92D-B629648396E6/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The card interactions themselves went through multiple revisions during the game’s development. The team used a physical deck to experiment with the physics and interaction of card-based structures, exploring both single-card draws and a multi-card spread — the latter of which became the game’s core mechanic. (It even had precedent within iOS: At the time, the Photos app allowed people to skeuomorphically splay their images from a stack with a pinch and spread gesture.)</p>\n<p>“Players tend to interact with the platforms in the ways that they’re used to, especially if they don’t play many games,” Rosenthal says. They followed that same philosophy when moving <em>Where Cards Fall</em> over to Mac and Apple TV, identifying platform-specific gestures that would be easy for a player to adopt. </p>\n<p>One downside of platform-specific adaptation: the player needs to relearn how to interact with the game. Fortunately, Rosenthal and his team had thought through an excellent tutorial and gameplay system. They created a hand-drawn overlay to animate paths, controls, and future actions, and used the main character to physically communicate possible destructive interactions — a shake of the head when attempting to tear down a card structure, for instance.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/CFDAD680-1BED-488C-B375-1099CC6CAEB0/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The music and the soundscape provide their own cues as the player works their way through the game. The cards have distinctive, fluttery sounds as they’re built and collapsed — audio director Kristi Knupp purchased stacks of card stock to find the perfect tone — while the background blends the naturalistic and physical noises of the forest and cityscape environments with Torin Borrowdale’s score. “It’s very easy to manipulate people’s emotions with music,” Rosenthal says. “But we wanted the experience to be the main thing that was setting the emotional weight.”</p>\n<p>Instead, <em>Where Cards Fall</em> tells its story through the player’s journey. It eschews audible dialogue or on-screen text for similar reasons. “There's a lot of empty space for reflection,” Rosenthal says — a core theme of the game.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/F08E0F6E-CD5A-4A06-BD64-673E0DAD7C00/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Now, Rosenthal, The Game Band, and their publishing partner Snowman have the opportunity to reflect on winning an Apple Design Award. “It [was] beyond my wildest expectations,” he says. “There are so many different hands that touched it, and every one of them put their personal stamp on it.”</p><p>His advice to fellow creators?

Ever-shifting gameplay and an electrifying beat capture the stages of reflecting on a broken relationship, illuminated by a psychedelic canvas of bright rainbow colors and geometric shapes. </p>\n<p>“This is a game that is very much about the music,” says Simon Flesser, who along with his co-founder Gordon Gardebäck makes up the game company Simogo. While the two have often created playlists of brainstorm music and scoring for their games, the conceit for <em>Sayonara</em> was unique: What if you could take the ubiquity of the breakup album and make it interactive through the best tropes of 80s and 90s arcade games?</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0DFE72E0-0E52-4796-849B-922B639E71CC/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>“We wanted everything in the game to echo that sense of approachability,” Flesser says. “[And] we naturally fell into the idea of wanting to make something that felt like the arcade games we great up with and played when we were young.” Games like <em>Star Fox</em> provided inspiration for the team, as did the musical integration through titles like <em>Rez.</em> “We [also] often try to find inspiration in things we don’t necessarily like, but see the potential in,” Flesser says. “We looked at games that use video a lot… where those game fail in interactivity, they really succeed in spectacle. So we wanted to try and capture that feeling, while not losing the feeling of being in constant control of the game.”</p>\n<p>To capture the musical foundation for the game, Simogo began with a large playlist of music that represented the essence of the project. “It started very differently, with a much more sinister tone,” Flesser tells us. The game’s prototype reflected this darker style — until, one day, an overly energetic pop song from the playlist came into rotation during a playtest. </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1DA4E53F-F7B7-4DA7-B10B-B03F9A20D7AC/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Early concept art for Sayonara Wild Hearts.</p></div><p>“It just clicked,” Flesser says. “I literally said [to the team], ‘This is it.’” They began writing original pop songs around this new tone the very next day. And as the new songs came into focus, the prototype’s color scheme began to shift as well. “[The songs] were in hues of purple and pink and blue,” Flesser says. “It painted the game for us, the music.”</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>Go with what your heart tells you and what your gut tells you… Because I think that's the only way that you will get something that feels like it has something to say or that it's an honest piece of work… once you start thinking too much about what you're making and what you're trying to say with it, then there's some kind of intangible magic lost because the project needs to tell you what it is instead of you telling the project what it is.</p><cite>Simon Flesser, Simogo</cite></blockquote><p>Simogo continued playing with recognizable themes and objects as the team refined characters for <em>Sayonara.</em> “[Characters] are all based on cards from the Major Arcana deck,” Flesser says. The tarot cards also influenced some of the broader conceptual designs and bigger items like the vehicles driven by various game characters.</p><p>Within the tarot card frame, <em>Sayonara</em>’s distinctive colors and geometric shapes create contrast between characters and the background, providing crisp views as people play through the game’s chapters with taps and swipes. “We needed to work with very simple shapes and distinctive colors because it's just swooshing by… you can't have much detail,” says Flesser. “We worked a lot with the contrast between dangerous stuff, positive stuff, characters, vehicles.” Each of these items was both differently colored and shaped to provide the maximum best possible contrast.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0C649A08-28DA-453F-8E5B-224C38C38051/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Because the game moves so fast, it was imperative to create controls both easy to follow and intuitive to use. As such, the team intentionally kept the controls platform agnostic. This also helps the game live equally at home on a touchscreen, third-party game controller, or Apple TV remote. “We opted for a more swiped base input for gameplay so that the player avatar moves when the player actually moves their finger,” Flesser says. </p>\n<p>Swipe controls continued to evolve as the team tested prototypes, with the game’s constant camera movements and zooms being a particular challenge. \"We definitely learned a lot about  feedback in 3D space versus 2D space,” Flesser says. “The same type of movement will feel radically different depending on how far away the camera is [and] how much the camera moves versus how much it rotates around its own axis or around the player avatar axis.”</p>\n<p>To smooth the experience, Simogo adjusted swipe responsivity and feedback to the camera’s active perspective and zoom level, while keeping the character in the same relative space.</p>\n<p>Together, this kind of care and design work in harmony to make <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> a standout game on Apple platforms. Flesser had this to say about the game’s journey to Apple Design Award-winner:</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>We always just want to make something that you enjoy yourself.

Take this article, for instance: You may be reading this text visually; however, if you’re a developer who uses VoiceOver, you’ll hear this paragraph (and the rest of the article) spoken to you along with verbal descriptions of any important elements you might need to know about. And if you’ve opened this article in the Developer app, you’ll also hear about navigational elements in the app.</p>\n<p>Whether you personally use VoiceOver or not, here’s how you can put yourself in the mindset of those who do to help design a standout experience.</p><h3>Master accessibility elements in your app</h3><p>When someone enables VoiceOver on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or tvOS, it begins describing all of the labeled elements on screen. To decide what to read, VoiceOver looks for accessibility elements — individual or grouped visual elements within a view — as well as whether someone can interact with these elements. As it describes an element, VoiceOver also highlights it on screen by displaying a black rectangle around the content.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Tip: Explore VoiceOver on your own device</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>While Xcode provides you with several tools to test your app’s accessibility, you can learn a lot about VoiceOver and how various apps have implemented it by taking a test drive on your own iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV. You can enable VoiceOver in the Settings app or System Preferences on your Mac, and if you want to have easy access to the feature, you can even enable a hardware-based Accessibility&nbsp;Shortcut.</em></p><hr><p>VoiceOver also adds a few specific multitouch gestures and taps to help people navigate their device. Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen will navigate to the next element in the view, while swiping to the left will navigate to the previous one. Each time VoiceOver lands on a new element, it speaks details like its accessibility label and value aloud, along with hints or traits if the element has any. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, people may tap directly on a visual element to navigate to it. If it’s within the bounds of an accessibility element, VoiceOver will focus on it. Otherwise, VoiceOver will emit a “boink” sound.</p>\n<p>By default, all standard UIKit controls are accessibility elements. To flag a custom control or view as an accessibility element, you can use <code>isAccessibilityElement</code>:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> isAccessibilityElement: <span class=\"syntax-type\">Bool</span> { <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">get</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">set</span> }</code></pre><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement\">Learn more about accessibility&nbsp;elements&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Group and declutter accessibility elements</h3><p>When navigating by swiping, VoiceOver visits each element in order of its appearance on the screen. That said, this isn’t always the most efficient way for someone to absorb information: If your app has too many accessibility elements, it may take someone a very long time to understand it. Instead, look for opportunities to group your accessibility elements together and create a simplified hierarchy. </p>\n<p>When you group your accessibility elements, VoiceOver will describe them together, which can speed up navigation through your app. For example, you might group a view that contains a title, text, and a time stamp label, as with Health’s Heart Rate title, heartbeat reading, and time of latest reading.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6954D51F-116E-43BC-ACC5-967FD8EC4DF3/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The Health app uses grouped elements in the Summary view to provide a streamlined experience for people using VoiceOver.</p></div><p>This also helps provide context for someone using VoiceOver that would otherwise be present in a visual interface: By grouping them and having them read together, this lets people know that the time and text are associated with the title, rather than three unrelated items.</p><h3>Add custom actions </h3><p>You can assign any accessibility element custom actions, which provides extra functionality. For example, if you use Mail without VoiceOver enabled, you can tap on a message inside the inbox to view it, but you can also swipe left or right on an individual message to access other features like deleting, flagging, or moving a message. Custom actions let people who use VoiceOver have access to those same features in a different manner: When VoiceOver focuses on the message element, it speaks the hint “Actions Available: Swipe up or down to select a custom action.” Once you arrive at the action you want, you can double-tap to perform it.</p><hr><p><em>Fun fact: When you implement leading or trailing table view swipe gestures in your app, you automatically get VoiceOver actions for these buttons in your project.</em></p><hr><p>Custom actions are very powerful when combined with grouped elements and can help simplify your navigable hierarchy. If you have a view as an accessibility element that has multiple buttons as subviews, for example, you aren’t always able to navigate to those buttons with VoiceOver. While it might be tempting to break up this up into smaller elements and allow buttons to become individually focusable, this may add clutter. </p><p>We strongly recommend using Custom Actions to expose these button actions, letting you keep the element’s organization while still providing full controls to someone using VoiceOver.  When you carefully group your elements and add custom actions, it creates a better overall navigation experience and will make your app far more enjoyable for people who rely on VoiceOver.</p>\n<p>To set a <code>UIAccessibilityCustomAction</code> on your accessibility elements, you can use <code>accessibilityCustomActions</code>:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">var</span> accessibilityCustomActions: [<span class=\"syntax-type\">UIAccessibilityCustomAction</span>]? { <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">get</span> <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">set</span> }</code></pre><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitycustomaction\">Learn more about custom&nbsp;actions&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Flag layout changes</h3><p>Your app may change its layout visually to indicate the result of an action or event. In the Shortcuts app, for example, tapping the + button brings up components that will help someone build a shortcut. For people who use VoiceOver, you can use the “screen changed” or “layout changed” notifications to guide their focus to the new elements. </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EDD3C039-FA6C-440D-AF32-CE6C8F0C0849/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The Shortcuts app plays a “screen changed” notification after someone selects the + button.</p></div><p>It’s best to use “layout changed” only when there’s a major change to your interface, as pulling focus too often can make people confused and lose context inside your app.</p>\n<p>To post an accessibility notification, you can use <code>post(notification:argument:)</code> on <code>UIAccessibility</code>:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"syntax-function\"><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"syntax-title\">post</span><span class=\"syntax-params\">(notification: UIAccessibility.Notification, \n        argument: <span class=\"syntax-keyword\">Any</span>?)</span></span></code></pre><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/1615194-post\">Learn more about accessibility&nbsp;notifications&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>When you make these improvements to your app, you’re not only unlocking better VoiceOver support, you’re also laying the groundwork for our other assistive technologies like Switch Control and Full Keyboard Access. So go, explore, and make your app’s accessibility experience a great one — because technology is most powerful when it empowers everyone.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/learn-voiceover-gestures-iph3e2e2281/ios\">Learn more about VoiceOver&nbsp;gestures&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/254/\">Watch “Writing Great Accessibility&nbsp;Labels”&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/\">Watch “Making Apps More Accessible With Custom&nbsp;Actions”&nbsp;&gt;</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 May 2020 19:37:56 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FC409D0E-DF2A-47D6-9688-D01E0CCD1181/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"d10dec83508c3965bda52d11de960b41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn42@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-45-038_563d4d582f739a1e.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":55639,"destBytes":17992,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FC409D0E-DF2A-47D6-9688-D01E0CCD1181/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn42@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-45-038_563d4d582f739a1e.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6954D51F-116E-43BC-ACC5-967FD8EC4DF3/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-868_41c8b32c4fae21ca.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/EDD3C039-FA6C-440D-AF32-CE6C8F0C0849/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn29@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-145_58acc5f9dc5b969d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Meet the developer: Philip Lam","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wk9cj822","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B6FFF57A-FA47-47FB-AE68-BFF6C95533CD/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The A.I.-powered app has revolutionized basketball practice.</p></div><p>HomeCourt is quite possibly the biggest thing to happen to basketball practice since the invention of the sneaker. </p>\n<p>The app uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) and augmented reality (AR) to create and shape on-court basketball drills.

A recent feature update also lets coaches create a virtual team roster in the app, so players, coaches, and parents can participate in remote workouts, drills, and competitions. The company is also working on other ways it can support basketball players and coaches while school activities, practices, and tournaments are being cancelled or postponed.</p>\n<p>Cofounder Philip Lam says the company’s shot-tracking prototype kicked everything off. “Even though it could only track shots in a few specific situations,” he says, “it made us believe it was possible to use a single smartphone camera to track complex basketball activities.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/03454FE9-B553-45AC-892A-BAA37B6A761D/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Get instant feedback right on the court.</p></div><p>Today the company has 22 employees in Hong Kong and San Jose, California, and players across the globe. </p>\n<p>Here Lam explains how HomeCourt got into the game:</p>\n<p><em>”Before we launched, we played pickup basketball every week, and we started talking about how great it would be if we could get our stats — who hit the most shots, who got the most rebounds, all that stuff. And the idea just came up: Can we actually use the camera on the phone to do that for us? That’s how it started.</em></p>\n<p><em>We built HomeCourt on mobile to make it affordable to players around the world. We came up with the idea of simulating the Stephen Curry tennis-ball drill with an interactive AR experience. That turned out to be the foundation of HomeCourt’s dribble workout. Everyone on the team was really excited to try it and compete with each other.”</em></p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C8E799E1-3C62-445E-8D1F-5A80D845C5ED/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Yes, the app keeps track of this many stats.</p></div><p><em>”Most other basketball training applications are content-based — no other mobile solution provides this system of proven training techniques combined with real-time A.I.-powered analysis.</em></p>\n<p><em>In mid-2018, we built a prototype that could track advanced metrics, like release angle, release time, and vertical jump. We named this feature Shot Science. At that time, the iPhone X was the latest iOS device. It was powerful, but it still wasn’t fast enough to run Shot Science in real time and enable players to hear audio shot analysis during a live practice.</em></p>\n<p><em>The new iPhone series came in September 2018, and it was a much more powerful device for running machine-learning algorithms. We found our algorithm [ran] six times faster in the iPhone series with the A12 Bionic chip. With the optimization in our algorithm, we could finally offer Real-Time Shot Science.

And with the latest versions of iOS and macOS, people can have even more control by choosing languages on a per-app basis. For example, someone may set their iPhone’s language to English, but want to use a social media app in Arabic.</p><p>Good news: If your project is built with iOS 13 or macOS Catalina and localized into more than one language, you won’t have to add any additional code to your app. Simply build and deploy your app to test.</p>\n<p>Here’s how someone might check per-app language switching for a specific app, using AllTrails as an example.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Open</strong> the Settings app.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>AllTrails &gt; Preferred Language &gt; Language</strong>.</li>\n<li>Change the preferred language to <strong>Spanish</strong>.</li>\n<li>Launch <strong>AllTrails</strong> from your home screen (or from the App Switcher, if the app is already open).</li>\n</ol><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/488F508F-597F-41E3-AC19-D498DFBB2DC0/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Once someone has set their preferred languages for an app in Settings, it will then render accordingly in your app.</p></div><p>AllTrails will now render in Spanish, while the rest of the device continues to display the system language.</p><h3>Restore your state after a change in the language setting</h3><p>If someone decides mid-activity that they’d like to view your app in a different language, you can make the experience even smoother for them by restoring their previous state when they return. For example, say you’re living abroad and looking for food using a restaurant delivery app. By default, you use English, but might want to switch the app’s language when viewing a certain restaurant’s menu so that you can better understand its native dishes.</p>\n<p>If that app supports state restoration, you can exit to the Settings app and return to the restaurant you were viewing — now in the new language. If not, you’ll have to start from the app’s main screen and find that restaurant again.</p>\n<p>If your app supports scene-based state restoration, you can implement <code>stateRestorationActivity(for scene)</code> and return an <code>NSUserActivity</code> that encodes the scene state. (And if you still support view controller state restoration, you can enable state restoration on your app delegate.)</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4ixc0yxs\">Learn more about implementing state restoration &gt;</a></p><hr><h3>How to load custom content in the correct language</h3><p>If you need to load content from other sources, such as a server, you can do so and ensure that you match the app’s language with a few bundle APIs.</p>\n<p><code>Bundle.main.preferredLocalizations.first</code> will get the system’s current language in priority order.</p>\n<p>If you need to check against a custom set of available languages (say, from a server or other source), you can do so with a simple modification to the previous API call. First, find out what available languages there are:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-keyword\">let</span> availableLanguages = <span class=\"syntax-type\">Server</span>.requestAvailableLanguages()</code></pre><p>Then, use the <code>preferredLocalization</code> API with those languages:</p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-type\">Bundle</span>.preferredLocalizations(from: availableLanguages).first.</code></pre><p>If it’s not possible to have ongoing communication with the server due to connectivity or other constraints, you can also send the output of <code>Bundle.main.preferredLocalizations.first</code> to the server; that way, it will know which language the app has been launched in and deliver content accordingly.</p><h3>How to transition away from a custom language selector in your app</h3><p>With systemwide support for in-app language selectors, you no longer need to provide a way to select languages within your app if you support iOS 13 or macOS Catalina or later. If you currently offer such a UI, you should remove it to avoid customer confusion and potential conflict with the system.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to guide people to the system settings for language selection, you can replace your app’s custom UI with a flow that launches directly into the Settings app on iOS.</p>\n<p>On iOS, add the following: </p><pre class=\"code-source\"><code><span class=\"syntax-type\">UIApplication</span>.shared.<span class=\"syntax-keyword\">open</span>(<span class=\"syntax-type\">URL</span>(string: <span class=\"syntax-type\">UIApplication</span>.openSettingsURLString)!)</code></pre><p>On macOS, direct people to <strong>System Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Region</strong> to add a per-language setting for your app.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/403\">Watch “Creating Great Localized Experiences with Xcode 11” &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/localization/?cid=developer80\">Learn more about expanding your app to new markets &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/localization/resources/?cid=developer80\">Get more resources for localization &gt;</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 19:35:23 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2C304568-8FDD-4BF9-9CDD-6F2C086010DE/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"7c1490b0ad610ffcaec83a1923e7556e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn64@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-088_e41035e5e6204eaa.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":145908,"destBytes":43480,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2C304568-8FDD-4BF9-9CDD-6F2C086010DE/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn64@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-45-088_e41035e5e6204eaa.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/488F508F-597F-41E3-AC19-D498DFBB2DC0/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-00-562_42d5570bff3d4394.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Promoting Your In-App Purchases","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e66b71be","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/7CBBBED4-12B6-41FF-AAE1-465F13903744/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>With iOS, users can browse in-app purchases directly on the App Store and start a purchase even before downloading your app. Promoted in-app purchases appear on your product page, can display in search results, and may be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs. </p>\n<p>Learn how to effectively increase discoverability for content previously only found inside your app.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/?cid=developer80\">Promoting Your <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">In-App Purchases</span></a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:50:25 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/7CBBBED4-12B6-41FF-AAE1-465F13903744/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"6569841ffdd366a70c1f621efb612911","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn94@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-517_3470e4abd156cb89.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":99706,"destBytes":30366,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/7CBBBED4-12B6-41FF-AAE1-465F13903744/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn94@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-517_3470e4abd156cb89.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904642},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Exchange Rate Changes Will Affect App&nbsp;Store Prices in Certain Regions","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09302019a","description":"<p>When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the <span class=\"nowrap\">App Store.</span> In the next few days, prices of apps on the <span class=\"nowrap\">App Store</span> and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) will increase in Kazakhstan and Sweden due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Some images are so abstract that you have to make up your own interpretation. To help the game communicate on every available channel, it was important to give it another sense... from the haptic vibrations, it helps you to understand if this is an active scene or a calm one — you get a really nice sense for the mood.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A045F85A-FCC7-4A4D-A4AC-32D238680A96/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><h3>Sam Rosenthal, Where Cards Fall</h3><p>“A lot of the game feels very melancholic but at the same time — it's a hopeful game. So the app icon is our main character in the winter — which is the present day — looking up... It is not somebody that is lost in the past but somebody that maybe has learned from what happened, has reflected and is looking towards what could be next.”</p><hr><p><em>Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on Apple Newsroom and the App Store.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-honors-eight-developers-with-annual-apple-design-awards/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on Apple Newsroom</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/story/id1517413678\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Read more about the Apple Design Award winners on the App Store</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:59:55 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2570602C-9E0F-4304-82F2-1E48A40B8D9E/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"57a57963072595d4a2d7c5e3a1b615b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-064_fec8de05a0c4e91e.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":46112,"destBytes":12918,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2570602C-9E0F-4304-82F2-1E48A40B8D9E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-064_fec8de05a0c4e91e.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/images/49/3884/3884_wide_250x141_2x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn90@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-58-998_63a8d647579b5654.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/images/49/4610/4610_wide_250x141_2x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn54@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-03-457_3cb7a0bd0cd48f57.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3C9D1511-7FD1-4115-BB22-E884F9D7D52B/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn74@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-32-00-092_2d7859bbbd981593.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/0923DBD6-4FD8-42FC-9F22-4EE6B58656FB/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn30@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-01-857_9f5993bd24016f1b.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/6B303CFE-A9A5-418F-B5C9-C85922E28BA7/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-01-905_7388401524dcd276.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/D6EEE6D7-9094-4B62-BE73-ADE98122A761/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-01-195_5e5c93eff901991f.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DDF0B61B-60A6-4B85-BDE2-224FBFCC35AC/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-31-59-001_d5e114fa72e160c3.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/716DB87C-9F4A-4F3F-90E6-7BFE90EF99D3/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-00-237_80e7e59b199dfe38.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/71CCE30A-277B-4285-BB0B-D8379F298C08/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn61@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-31-59-006_4a4f3218e1348952.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A045F85A-FCC7-4A4D-A4AC-32D238680A96/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-59-379_4cef0549c672687e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"How to debug your SwiftUI previews in Xcode","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8vkqn3ih","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/76AFFD7A-ACC8-4FA4-B63B-26EEE2510BEC/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>With SwiftUI and Xcode 11, it’s much faster to create great user interfaces for apps on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Consoles are expensive, and families generally only have a single piece of hardware and a few controllers within their household. In contrast, almost everyone owns a mobile device — it was the perfect platform for a multiplayer game that was open to all.</p>\n<p>The transition from console to iPhone and iPad was a challenge for the entire studio. When the team began working on <em>Sky</em> in 2012, they were limited by the mobile hardware and screen sizes of that era — a far cry from the powerful Playstation infrastructure supporting their previous titles.</p>\n<p>“Today, the iPhone is actually more powerful than the PlayStation that we developed for in the past,” Chen says, and <em>Sky</em> runs beautifully on both it and iPad. But to get there, the team had to iterate over multiple years of hardware and software updates. They were constantly refining the game’s look and feel, including developing a custom Metal engine to render <em>Sky</em>’s ethereal scenes, all while making sure the game would perform well and preserve battery life on device.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/605C3AD5-669E-441B-8770-61B2BF06E898/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>While engineers worked on the technical challenges, the game’s designers got to work creating the right control mechanisms and interface. “There are many, many barriers and design principles [on mobile] that are quite alien to console developers,” Chen says. </p>\n<p>Chief of these was the touch screen: Players needed to traverse a three-dimensional space without physical buttons, triggers, or joysticks, and without on-screen controls blocking the game’s graphics or interface. “You're trying to find the right combination of design and feedback that is actually better than a real controller,” Chen explains.</p>\n<p>A player’s past gaming history was also an important factor in designing the controls. While console gaming often requires players to interact with a physical controller using both hands, that wasn’t the case for casual gamers. “Players without a console controller experience would never put two hands on the screen at the same time,” Chen says.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A3D23329-F522-42D4-B51E-91172D919993/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>After several years of experimentation — including, at one point, a fully-functional flight simulator — the team landed on a simple set of familiar controls designed to appeal to everyone. For extra guidance, Chen and team even provided subtle interface rings in each corner, which expand and contract to indicate range and speed control.</p>\n<p>That wasn’t the last of the controller changes, however. After Sky’s initial release and feedback from players, the team also added a two-hand mode to the game for those who wanted more of a console-like feel. “This is the first time I’ve made a game where the control scheme was not finite,” Chen says. But he also acknowledges the beauty in creating a game on a living platform. “We are actually making changes because the habit of how people use their phone is changing.”</p>\n<p>It’s this relationship between player and creator that Chen finds fascinating about games. As with any artistic medium, the creator has the power to help amplify feelings and guide people through a story — its rises and falls, surges and sudden stops. “For design and for entertainment, it is all about that change of acceleration,” Chen says. “That pulse is what touches us emotionally.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/365FDB19-7AC4-4AE6-882F-412C0D31A346/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B08C0BF1-CBAA-4707-82BD-FCD42CAD82C4/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/01BBBC8C-A14A-4624-B874-99F74C49109F/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>The interactivity of a game, however, creates a unique challenge for designers not to weigh too heavily upon the frame — to guide, but not to restrict. “The best design is a nudge, rather than a leash,” he says. “We want to make whomever is experiencing the [game] feel they are in control... We are not here to distract you. We are not here to force and bully you to do anything. We want to let you to make that [step]... and 100 percent own that experience.”</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>The designer is a powerful influence of what happens between the player who touches your interface and interacts with your game. With very small changes in the design, you can change how this person behaves, how they treat each other in your game. It's your responsibility... how are these players going to interact with your app, with your game, on a daily basis?</p><cite>Jenova Chen, creative director of Sky: Children of the Light</cite></blockquote><p>It’s this balance and fervent commitment to storytelling and inclusivity that makes <em>Sky</em> a joy for all to play — and a 2020 Apple Design Award winner. “Hearing from people that they appreciate the work that we've done is the best reward, really,” says Chen. “Ultimately, we are serving others.”</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://thatgamecompany.com\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about thatgamecompany</a></p><p><a href=\"https://thatgamecompany.com/sky/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about Sky: Children of the Light</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-children-of-the-light/id1462117269\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Download Sky: Children of the Light</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/story/id1521580255\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Read more about Sky: Children of the Light on the App Store</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:55:56 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1D9F24DC-2226-40B2-AD63-17A62D51BA2E/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"3ddd512aa2ee5edd036245aa286fcc26","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn18@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-447_2ac3a78cbaf039b0.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":173121,"destBytes":33874,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/1D9F24DC-2226-40B2-AD63-17A62D51BA2E/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn18@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-447_2ac3a78cbaf039b0.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C270D324-D052-4272-BD71-6BAE022B2848/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-02-795_2bc0dd739c901e92.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C1891445-B4AE-4EC0-8C3E-EA0DCF695789/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-00-263_af3a3623fc57c996.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD03EB11-0201-4551-B158-63A8136877AD/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-01-653_d2607c23410fb6e0.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/605C3AD5-669E-441B-8770-61B2BF06E898/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn50@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-03-086_c55e9a65cc391302.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/A3D23329-F522-42D4-B51E-91172D919993/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn18@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-307_ff1f6c16cce897de.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/365FDB19-7AC4-4AE6-882F-412C0D31A346/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-31-59-370_53e962ada687a025.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/B08C0BF1-CBAA-4707-82BD-FCD42CAD82C4/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn66@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-59-037_3edeb5f2d720b675.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/01BBBC8C-A14A-4624-B874-99F74C49109F/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-02-641_082a33ca3ebd818a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Introducing Teams for Feedback Assistant.","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i9a2mmd3","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/BFB71CAD-F403-4CDE-9FEE-69FD04087C4D/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>You can now view and respond to feedback filed by your team members if you’re part of an organization in the Apple Developer Program, the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, Apple School Manager, or Apple Business Manager.

The Apple Design Award-winning puzzle game is enigmatic and ever-shifting, with a series of layered and intertwined levels that invite people to tap, shake, draw, and explore their device.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/DE8FBCAA-B972-4FEA-9243-F3DF7A341E2F/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Song of Bloom’s puzzles range in style, design, and execution.</p></div><p>“It's an abstract game [that develops] into something more understandable with time,” says Stollenmayer. “The more you get in the story, the more you discover and the more the interaction changes.”</p>\n<p>This concept is a core part of his philosophy around game design: create an instantly graspable idea, then keep thinking, pushing, and inviting players go further. There’s no true ‘goal’ beyond the exploration of the narrative and the puzzles — in Stollenmayer’s words, the game is “user experience in its truest form.”</p>\n<p><em>Song of Bloom</em> grew from one of Stollenmayer’s vacation experiments. Having taken a looping video of waves on the beach while in Italy, he decided to try and add a new aspect to it with device rotation: when the video flipped, the water would fall out of frame. From there, “it just became a process of triggering new ideas and new experiments,” he says.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/325FE0DE-F1F3-47C2-9D72-5DDCB11E5111/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The milk carton from Song of Bloom, made real.</p></div><p>Unlike Stollenmayer’s other games, nothing is constant in <em>Song of Bloom</em>. “Not the elements, not the interaction, and not even remotely the style,” he says. One puzzle might look like a rough sketch, while others include hyper-realistic popcorn kernels. His favorite puzzle of the series? A stop-motion risograph-inspired milk carton.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>There is always this doubt in the back of the mind if what you are seeing is real. This contributes a lot to the mood I am trying to convey.</p><cite>Philipp Stollenmayer</cite></blockquote><p>Every image in <em>Song of Bloom</em> is computer-generated, the result of experimenting with code — sometimes with unintended results. “As a designer who isn’t the greatest programmer, my code usually creates visual errors,” says Stollenmayer. “On the way, I would let myself [be inspired] by my own faults.”</p>\n<p>That included manipulating items to make them look more like how they might in a real-world setting. For example, one puzzle, which requires someone to virtually knit an item, includes the sort of stray holes and tiny offshoots that you might expect from a newer knitter. “Making digital versions without these faults is much easier,” Stollenmayer says. “But copying the faults creates moments where you ask yourself: Could this be real?”</p>\n<p>He drew inspiration from immersive installations and puzzle games alike, including multimedia artists Laure Prouvost and Franz West and games like <em>Blackbox</em>, <em>Device6</em>, and <em>Prune</em>. “I look at a lot of art to get a sense for color, composition — but also how to control and transform surroundings,” he says.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>I am interested in the between, where it all comes together, because in our world, nothing exists without context.</p><cite>Philipp Stollenmayer</cite></blockquote><p>Each visual, haptic, motion, and verbal cue within the game is designed to get the player to explore that space and interact with its imagery. Because the puzzles are often highly abstracted, Stollenmayer used haptics to help guide people through the game — using them to signify mood in higher- or lower-stakes scenes or aid someone in evaluating potential solves. “Like in the real world, the player expects a reaction from every action,” Stollenmayer says.</p>\n<p>One of his earliest concepts for transitioning between puzzles in <em>Song of Bloom</em> was that of someone blinking their eyes: Solve the puzzle or move to the main screen, and the entire screen blinks in and out.</p>\n<p>Stollenmayer experimented with several multitouch gestures around that concept, including a pinch gesture, before settling on a button — a single curved line — in the corner. “I had to get it into the player’s mind,” he says. That meant creating something easily findable and understandable, and not adding gestures that might get triggered by chance during the exploration of a puzzle.</p>\n<p>That thin curved line is one of the only pieces of consistent, persistent interface amidst <em>Song of Bloom</em>’s many artistic changes. “Like the home bar on full screen iPhones, it’s just there to remind you that [it] exists, without disturbing the running scene with any content or contrasting style,” Stollenmayer says.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/132EA8D1-4801-480B-8AB5-E080619EA875/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Stollenmayer with an early version of the Song of Bloom tree.</p></div><p>On tap, it allows people to return to the game’s main screen and view the branching tree of puzzles they’ve helped grow. This tree also serves as the game’s sole hint mechanism, letting people use long presses to peek at possible areas to focus on within the game. The more you play around with it, the more the story (and tree) grows and the more hints you discover. Along with original music, it’s this fertile combination of forces that earns the game its name. </p>\n<p>With so many different art styles and creative influences, it’s amazing how effortlessly they all blend together in Song of Bloom. The story is important, of course, but for Philipp design is really about how it feels. Call <em>Song of Bloom</em> what you will — a game of personal discovery, a provocative tale of art and clues — for Philipp Stollenmayer, the goal is simply to play; to make people feel at once captivated and liberated all in the same hour-long session.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>In Song of Bloom, you just play for the sake of playing.

Whether they’re switching from app to app, bringing together apps on iPad using Slide Over or Split View, or creating multiple windows of the same app, they should be able to pick up right where they left off — and UI state restoration is a core part of making that experience seamless.</p>\n<p>When your app goes out of view, the app’s process is typically put on pause; it’s not given any more CPU time, which keeps the processor free for other tasks. If your app has background processes that are running, the system can even terminate those if an active app needs more resources than currently available.</p>\n<p>Restoring the state of your UI is a crucial part of making your app feel responsive — and it’s especially important if you plan to support multiple windows in your iPadOS app. If you have a note-taking app that has four different notes open in different Split View pairings, for example, state restoration helps preserve each note, rather than returning someone to the main screen when they open one of the windows.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD4008A5-831B-4D78-9AA9-1D8059D4BB33/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Two different types of scenes can be backgrounded and processes halted. These scenes’ states should be saved to restore later.</p></div><h3>Meet NSUserActivity</h3><p><code>NSUserActivity</code> is a core part of modern state restoration with <code>UIScene</code> and <code>UISceneDelegate</code>: It provides a lightweight way to capture the state of your app and put it to use later, holding key information for both view controllers and important view states — information that can also be used when constructing view controllers for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/task_management/implementing_handoff_in_your_app\">Handoff</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content\">Universal Linking</a>.</p>\n<p>While what you store in <code>NSUserActivity</code> is up to you, we recommend collecting only the bare minimum so that your app can quickly restore itself. Think of the most unique and simple way you can identify your view controller, like a clear identifier or URL. Include that information, and make sure you can identify where the view controller lives in your navigation and how content should appear within it. For example, when using an Xcode storyboard you may want to store and retrieve view controllers using restoration IDs.</p><h3>Get started with UI state restoration</h3><p>The best way to implement UI state restoration is to make your app scene-based, which requires iOS 13, iPadOS 13, Mac Catalyst 10.13, or tvOS 13 or later. (For more information on working with scenes in your app, check out the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes\">Developer Library</a>.) Here’s how to get started with scene-based state restoration: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a <code>NSUserActivity</code> object to save the app's state. This can be created in your scene delegate.</li>\n<li>In this <code>NSUserActivity</code>, store relevant information (like the current navigation’s state, and view controllers that have been presented or pushed) along with your user’s intent.</li>\n<li>Return this <code>NSUserActivity</code> within <code>stateRestorationActivity(for:)</code> in the scene delegate.</li>\n</ol><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4E81D37-61B8-4384-ADF9-B825B1AA59E2/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">You need to collect the right information in each UIScene to pick up where someone left off.</p></div><p>This <code>NSUserActivity</code> will now be stored inside the scene’s <code>stateRestorationActivity</code> property. When your app needs to restore its state, it should do so by looking for this saved <code>NSUserActivity</code> under <code>scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)</code> in the scene delegate.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the older view controller-based state restoration APIs?</strong> </p>\n<p>If you need to support older versions of iOS, macOS, or tvOS, you can use older view controller-based APIs for state restoration via restoration classes and the app delegate. This also means if you want to update your app to adopt UIScene as well as implement UI state restoration across multiple versions of iOS, you will need to implement both scene-based and view-controller based APIs. However, we highly recommend building scene-based UI state restoration.</p>\n<p>Compared to the older APIs, modern state restoration requires a different approach to how you define, save, and restore your UI state and your user’s intent. With a scene-based app, you have to separate events in an application’s life cycle and the scene’s life cycle, which means tracking changes also differs. Having multiple scenes means there are many more windows to track, each with unique user actions and navigation history. For some of those windows, you may choose not to restore state depending on their function, requiring state restoration to be more flexible and dependent on how you define the user’s intent.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4AA05114-11D2-4E36-B59C-EC89461A6763/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Prior to the introduction of UIScene, each app had a singular life cycle.</p></div><p>If you can update your app to scene-based restoration and take advantage of <code>NSUserActivity</code>, you’ll also unlock easier pathways to implementing features like Spotlight search, Handoff, enabling Universal Links, and creating new scenes as primary or auxiliary windows. And you’ll provide a smoother and frictionless experience for people using your app, too.</p><hr><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/258/\">Watch “Architecting your app for multiple windows”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/259/\">Watch “Targeting content with multiple windows”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/246/\">Watch “Window management in your multitasking app”</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/preserving_your_app_s_ui_across_launches\">Learn more about restoring state in non-scene <span class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright nowrap\">based apps</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/restoring_your_app_s_state\">Explore sample code for restoring your app’s state</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 18:37:15 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C093FF5F-7F32-4ABF-8BB5-B0C2AF6A1703/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"9067506b6d6f8e96a4c1d777fa7dfaf9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-45-000_0f7610bc4590522d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":47275,"destBytes":10826,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C093FF5F-7F32-4ABF-8BB5-B0C2AF6A1703/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-45-000_0f7610bc4590522d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/AD4008A5-831B-4D78-9AA9-1D8059D4BB33/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn61@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-02-460_872564df55c6385c.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4E81D37-61B8-4384-ADF9-B825B1AA59E2/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-02-760_dd26c48409414a8b.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4AA05114-11D2-4E36-B59C-EC89461A6763/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-03-259_7bf54d8249a5b0a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904641},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Universal Purchase for Mac Apps Now Available","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03232020b","description":"<p>The macOS version of your app can now be included in a universal purchase, allowing customers to enjoy your app and in‑app purchases across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS by purchasing only once.

Haddad’s road to get here crossed many borders, but it started that night in the garage.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2F486A03-D982-406C-A6AF-C1FEA1A97CF8/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">*Turo* makes it possible to rent the kind of cars that you’d normally associate with spy movies.</p></div><p>After the bomb hit, things moved fast. Haddad’s family decided to to leave Lebanon and stay with relatives in Cyprus, but Haddad took a different path. Prior to the blast he’d been chatting with a cousin in Paris, one who’d asked him a question he’d never considered. “He said, ‘It’s your senior year of high school, what are your plans? What do you want to do?’” Haddad said. “I thought, wow, nobody’s asked me those questions. When you’re in those conditions, there’s not much of a vision for the future. It’s a mechanism of self-defense.” </p>\n<p>The day after the shell landed on his balcony, Haddad called that cousin, and before long he had a ticket to Paris and a plan to get into business school. Seventeen years old and on his own, Haddad also found his way into the French music scene and became a DJ — he claims to have seen Daft Punk before the helmets — but there was a problem: His music had all been obliterated in the blast.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/54AD7979-F456-4339-BFCB-6A5E517300F4/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Haddad, a former DJ in Paris, keeps a well-stocked music collection.</p></div><p>“I was looking for ways to rebuild my collection,” he says, “and I discovered eBay.”</p>\n<p>The selection was incredible, but the more he bought, the more he wanted to sell — and the shipping charges were piling up fast. To address both problems —and using his speedily developing business instincts — he founded <em>iBazar</em>, which launched as a way to swap music and became one of Europe’s largest online marketplaces. <em>iBazar</em> grew large enough that it was eventually purchased by <em>eBay</em> for more than $100 million. Just like that, everything had changed.</p>\n<p>Haddad spent the next decade in tech jobs, occupying positions with <em>eBay</em> and serving as CEO of <em>Shopping.com</em>. In 2011, ground down by the workload, he was planning on taking a sabbatical when a friend approached him about a car-sharing idea called <em>Turo</em>. “I got to really appreciate the creativity, the scrappiness, the hunger,” he says. Plus, he was well familiar with the notion of using the internet to connect real people. “Turo was built on trust, which made me feel very comfortable with it,” he says.</p><blockquote class=\"article-quote\"><p>It’s an incredible highlight to see the power of humanity.</p><cite>Andre Haddad</cite></blockquote><p>Today, <em>Turo</em> has more than 14 million members. “There are users who are barely 18, and some in their 80s,” he says. The app offers everything from standard sedans to exotic high-end imports, often for less than the price of a traditional rental. </p>\n<p>In addition, after some initial hesitation, Haddad has become more vocal about immigration issues. “At first, I didn’t want any public involvement with this kind of noble cause to be misinterpreted as personal publicity — or even worse, corporate publicity,” he says. Plus, he adds, it hadn’t been easy to turn the page.</p>\n<p>Today, he’s becoming more and more outspoken, both out loud and in writing. He’s spent years on the board of Immigration Equality, an organization designed to bring equality to LGBTQ+ immigrants. And he’s signed amicus briefs and open letters aimed at protecting immigrants. “It’s the right thing to do,” he says. “It helps the economic development of the United States. But the fact is, people are here because they chose to come here. It’s a very, very hard thing to do. If you’re willing to do that, it means there’s some exceptional traits of character.”</p><p><em>Originally published on the App Store.</em></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 21:43:06 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FC1411E9-E930-43C5-8780-C2FA94B1D068/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"3170670101df4066a58d15d2d4275bd3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-565_261f67126fb71d0d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":627,"sourceBytes":214960,"destBytes":74280,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/FC1411E9-E930-43C5-8780-C2FA94B1D068/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-46-565_261f67126fb71d0d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/2F486A03-D982-406C-A6AF-C1FEA1A97CF8/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-31-59-286_818cb515c02a3125.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/54AD7979-F456-4339-BFCB-6A5E517300F4/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-32-02-436_09bc72d07b9c8e55.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Introducing Billing Grace Period for Subscriptions","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019c","description":"<p>We’ve worked closely with leading developers to create a solution for reducing customer churn while improving the experience for auto-renewable subscriptions.

Students from 60 different countries and regions brought their talents to the table, using the challenge’s three-minute limit to stretch their imaginations and explore Apple’s frameworks and technologies. The resulting 350 Swift Student Challenge winners have created AR experiences, projects powered by machine learning, educational material, virtual musical instruments, 8-bit games, and so much more. </p><h3>Swipe to unlock</h3><p>In 2019, after having studied just one month at the Apple Developer Academy in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Henrique Conte submitted his first Swift playground project. While he didn’t win a WWDC Scholarship that year, the experience drove him to continue exploring and refining his code.</p>\n<p>“This year I felt that, after reading and studying about so many different Apple frameworks, I should try to accomplish the WWDC19 main phrase: ‘Write code. Blow minds,’” he told us. And he did. His winning submission, a three-minute game designed for MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, excels in both its technical acuity and creativity.</p>\n<p>Within the playground, players have to help Eleanor, a young developer, escape from a cave. The twist: The “cave” level is entirely located within the Touch Bar. “I chose to use unusual frameworks to show that it is possible to do amazing things with them,” Conte said. “I feel that [the Touch Bar] has so much potential yet to be discovered, and I wanted to demonstrate some of its capabilities.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9224C2B2-8900-441B-97B7-2BCF27DD98F8/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Henrique Conte’s winning submission, “ESCape, Eleanor!”</p></div><p>Though he had never previously developed for macOS, Conte immediately took to the challenge. Like learning any new development concept, he ran into a few initial obstacles — “when I received the message “No such module 'UIKit’ [after trying to add it to my project] I noticed things would get interesting,” he joked — but he quickly picked up the fundamentals of Mac programming, using AppKit and SpriteKit to build a fully-interactive experience, including taps, slides, keyboard integrations, and multi-screen storytelling. He also paid close attention to the design, something that has become increasingly important to him.</p>\n<p>“I am definitely not a designer,” says Conte, “But in the past few years I noticed how essential it is to follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and to provide a great experience. There is no point in creating a perfect code if people will have trouble using your application!”</p>\n<p>You can find more of Conte’s work on the App Store: In the last year, he’s created four apps, including one to help children with autism communicate. He’s currently at work on his next project, which he’s building for both iOS and macOS, that addresses the problem of food waste. And — he’s happy to report — the macOS version will incorporate the Touch Bar. </p><h3>The world turned upside-down</h3><p>Louise Pieri, 21, fell in love with computer science at a young age in her native Lyons, France. She’s since gone on to study at École 42, the programming school founded by French businessman Xavier Niel. Pieri’s winning project, Meep, drew inspiration from an article she read in a scientific journal about the possibility of parallel universes, as well as her own personal journey as a transgender woman. </p>\n<p>“Meep is a game with two levels: the first is a level where everything is reversed and upside-down and the second is where everything is normal,” says Pieri. “The story is about a little blue transgender monster who wants to reach the final level and turn pink... it's a beautiful metaphor for what happens in the life of a trans person.”</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5BF1B7E8-9B77-427C-84C8-CCA2E23492DC/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Louise Pieri’s winning submission, “Meep”</p></div><p>Though Pieri had never previously used SpriteKit or AVKit, she knew she wanted to build a game for her Swift playground submission. She spent two days brainstorming ideas before landing on the concept for Meep and diving into the frameworks and interface. Initially, she’d hoped to show both of Meep’s universes on-screen at once before deciding on a multi-level experience, including an entire level upside-down. </p>\n<p>In addition to designing and coding the game, Pieri also created her own 2D artwork for each level in Adobe Illustrator and a story for the game — all in under two weeks.</p>\n<p>Pieri has been tuning into WWDC20 this year from France, and is especially keen to learn more about the future of Apple platforms. “I can't wait to get to know iOS 14,” she says. That will come in handy for her next project — bringing a version of Meep to the App Store.</p><h3>A robot of one’s own</h3><p>Devin Green’s love of development stemmed from a lifelong fascination with thinking machines. “I have always been in awe of artificial intelligence,” he told us. Out of that idea, the 18-year-old’s winning project — an AI bot named Stanny — was born. </p>\n<p>“With everything that is going on in the world right now, I thought people stuck in isolation might find it beneficial to their mental health to talk to a capable AI companion,” he said. Green, who will attend Stanford this fall for computer science and engineering, took about a week to build his playground — most of that time dedicated to refining machine learning models that created Stanny’s ‘intelligence.’</p>\n<p>“The model was trained on a data file made up of all the things you could possibly say to Stanny,” Green said. After researching how others had trained chat bots, Green created his own model in TensorFlow, then brought it to his Xcode playground through Core ML Converters.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/70482B7A-F878-4FF2-8BFD-DF6A08377281/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Devin Green’s winning submission, “Polar Patterns”</p></div><p>While no stranger to experimenting with machine learning models, Green used this project to get to know more of Apple’s ML offerings. “I wanted to make it as simple as possible to go from data to usable Artificial Intelligence,” he told us. He worked with NSLinguisticsTagger to build a working model, then created a generated Core ML model to predict the person’s intent from their query and architected his playground in SwiftUI.</p>\n<p>Green sees Swift as the future of machine learning and AI applications. “Swift is not only a really simple and easy to use language, it’s also really expansive,” he told us. “It can be built on in such a way that [it] is capable of doing just about anything.”</p>\n<p>Stanny isn’t quite as full-featured: His joke-loving AI is limited to only 63 different intents. But Green has big plans — and he can’t wait to incorporate some of the technology announced at WWDC20. “The Natural Language framework is astounding,” he told us. “If I had any doubts about using Swift for machine learning, they quickly disappeared while watching a natural language processing application understand text with about five lines of code... projects I’ve created, like Stanny, are about to get 100x better!”</p><h3>Code as design</h3><p>For first-time winner Renata Pôrto, the challenge gave her a chance to confront her own self-doubts. “As a designer, I have always felt insecurity regarding my ability to code more complex ideas,” she said. After two unsuccessful Swift playground submissions in previous years, the 21-year old student from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil had once again decided to submit. But after a few days of work, she scrapped the project.</p>\n<p>“I was not satisfied with my own decision to continue with a ‘safe’ idea,” she told us. Instead, she began considering concepts she’d wanted to learn about but hadn’t yet explored — including generative art. “One of the things I always thought was fantastic about programming is the possibility of transforming lines of code into visual and interactive experiences,” she said. Just six days later, she emerged with Polar Patterns, a Swift playground that helps people learn more about mathematical roses and generate their own visual art.</p>\n<p>“With SpriteKit, I was able to convert the polar equation of mathematical roses into SKShapes, transforming the results from the formula into visual elements,” she said. Pôrto designed just two images herself, relying on her algorithmic code and a few UIKit elements to create the entire visual experience. </p>\n<p>Designing an entirely programmatic art interface was a departure for Pôrto. “I am very used to prototyping before programming,” she told us. This project, however, involved creating an experience that would dynamically shift and change depending on what actions someone took within the playground, making it important for Pôrto to visualize and experiment constantly to perfect her interface.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3D8EBEA1-483B-4844-A2E0-A92FDF019632/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Renata Pôrto’s winning submission, “Polar Patterns”</p></div><p>The result brings the beauty and complexity of polar roses to a Swift playground — and landed Pôrto a winning submission. “It’s a great joy learning about development, even though I am a design student,” she told us. “Studying design helped me to practice my empathy for [people] and to know what resources to use and how to work with them to achieve better results.”</p>\n<p>That empathy continues through her work with a local developer group, creating educational tools for new developers in her community. “I always try to pass on my design knowledge to developers, and my developer knowledge to designers,” she said. “And hopefully one day they will make products that make a difference in other people’s lives.”</p><hr><p><em>Learn more about the Swift Student Challenge winners.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zvqmpiak\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Swift Student Challenge winners determined to shape the future</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1517413279\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">App Store: Meet the Swift Student Challenge winners</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:00:02 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/8B3B0EB0-739F-44E9-BF02-99CE803CA6B8/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"5e54fb03b98b7a43d4f0d6d18ac7ab64","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-406_ccfe10e4bc390f4d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":48972,"destBytes":14476,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/8B3B0EB0-739F-44E9-BF02-99CE803CA6B8/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-46-406_ccfe10e4bc390f4d.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/9224C2B2-8900-441B-97B7-2BCF27DD98F8/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn70@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-32-01-544_dd7e9e739418f82c.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5BF1B7E8-9B77-427C-84C8-CCA2E23492DC/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn90@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-02-912_8f91f98000717136.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/70482B7A-F878-4FF2-8BFD-DF6A08377281/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-31-59-339_d796a2a8a13740e1.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/3D8EBEA1-483B-4844-A2E0-A92FDF019632/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn49@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-32-00-376_5ab630a8c36ecfa1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"WWDC20 Daily Digest","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=cigjat1u","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/D7C5087B-1B34-4F0B-BAC9-E0234944A2C8/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Welcome back to day two of WWDC.

If and when something goes awry, your app automatically gathers crash reports from people who have opted in to send you anonymized crash data. And you can view that data using the Xcode Organizer on your Mac. </p>\n<p><em>Note: While there are several third-party analytics tools that can also provide information on crashing threads when incorporated into your app, you may not always be able to see the full backtrace.

Browse all of your crashes at a glance, and check out statistics to see how crashes break down across OS versions and different devices. </p>\n<p>And if you want to start troubleshooting on the spot, you can even open a crash report and jump right to the affected line in Xcode by simply choosing the <strong>Open In Project</strong> option.</p><h3>Review your app’s crash logs</h3><p>To check out individual crash logs in detail, you’ll need to engage the power of your Control key.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Control-click</strong> on the crash in question.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Show in Finder</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the Finder window, <strong>control-click</strong> the highlighted .xccrashpoint file.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Show Package Contents</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the folder that displays, go to <strong>DistributionInfos &gt; all &gt; Logs</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Inside the Logs folder, you’ll find each individual crash report, which you can browse and troubleshoot accordingly.

The HIG is full of information for designers that can help them create more compelling, intuitive, and beautiful experiences and design better apps. </p>\n<p>If you’re an engineer, the HIG can be equally useful as a guide during the entire development process. It offers a high-level and comprehensive view of key UI elements and associated APIs, and best practices to help you implement features into your app.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a few common scenarios to show you how the HIG can help you throughout app design and development.</p><h3>Where to start</h3><p>The HIG is organized by platforms and technologies, each with its own index. If you’ve never explored the HIG before, consider starting with the platform you’re currently developing for.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/91F5A51B-A232-4F2F-B597-6F11D34517F6/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Each platform is broken up into multiple sections that cover topics like app architecture, interaction, views, controls, and system capabilities. If you’d like to implement custom UI elements for your Apple Watch app, for example, you could reference the SpriteKit and SceneKit page of the System Capabilities section and gain perspective on some of the user experience considerations of implementing textured and 3D imagery in your app, as well as find a link to the WKInterfaceSCNScene and WKInterfaceSKScene framework over on the Developer Documentation website. </p><h3>“I want to include a new UI element.”</h3><p>The HIG offers guidance for all interface elements, with a focus on the element’s intended use. When including any new piece of UI into your app, consider using the HIG to review how you should present the intended element on screen. Explore recommendations, learn about the rationale for styling, and understand the various ways in which you can achieve a presentation that expresses your brand and feels familiar to people who use your app. </p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/495EDD2C-180E-45DB-B055-3994039F4D81/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Even for something as simple as adding a button to your interface, the HIG provides recommendations for how to place, label, and align it within your app — along with guidance on presenting and using these elements. </p><h3>“I want to introduce a new feature into my app.”</h3><p>When Apple releases new features, you can often find additional insight and best practices around adoption within the HIG.</p><p>Say that you add Augmented Reality (AR) content to your app. Inside the HIG, you can find information on AR interactions and address common problems with interface patterns. You can learn how to guide people into an AR experience, for example, or how people expect to interact with real and virtual content on screen. This guidance can also help you have discussions with your design and development teams as you plan out feature inclusion, and lead to better implementation.</p><h3>Get started with Apple design elements</h3><p>Apple’s ever-growing resources library makes it easy to explore the design side of our platforms. These downloads are great for prototyping concepts, finding specifications, and learning the language of design elements.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4956C5B-2DC0-4C61-8B8D-DD3F6BB7ED21/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>There are templates and libraries for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Sketch, and Keynote, and each of these is filled with ready-to-use iOS UI elements — toolbars, tab bars, buttons, and much more. You can also explore resources like the SF Symbols app, which contains thousands of symbols in a wide range of weights and scales. These symbols integrate nicely with Xcode, they're simple to align with text labels, and they support accessibility features like Dynamic Type and Bold Text.</p><h3>The helpful HIG</h3><p>The HIG is one of the best places you can start when you’re making design and engineering decisions about your app. It lays out the principles that define design across all Apple platforms, and it makes recommendations to help you anticipate and implement what most people want when using software.</p>\n<p>Best of all, the HIG is continually updated to reflect changes and improvements across Apple’s platforms. So you can count on implementing features that keep pace with people’s evolving expectations. </p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Human Interface Guidelines</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Apple Design Resources</a></p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\" class=\"icon icon-after icon-chevronright\">Learn more about SF Symbols</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 17:55:05 +0000","feedId":7458,"bgimg":"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/707766E0-F97F-42BF-93B1-3A3956D8C752/1024.jpeg","linkMd5":"df95898b20b9b02a679998d6263522d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn70@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-45-033_85e259da927bad2c.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":93353,"destBytes":22550,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/707766E0-F97F-42BF-93B1-3A3956D8C752/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn70@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-31-45-033_85e259da927bad2c.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/91F5A51B-A232-4F2F-B597-6F11D34517F6/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn22@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-32-01-999_c3c646f24a8ca014.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/495EDD2C-180E-45DB-B055-3994039F4D81/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn6@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-02-713_8d26462924e3ae48.webp","https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/C4956C5B-2DC0-4C61-8B8D-DD3F6BB7ED21/1024.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn70@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-32-00-392_1d2e296ad008b342.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311904636},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:31:44","title":"Meet the developer: Shine","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=iqeu33mh","description":"<div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/467E4D0D-435A-4678-AA39-FB8116DE3BB4/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">The secret of their self-care app’s success?

The two started getting coffee, then lunch, then after-work drinks, creating what Lidey calls a “safe space to process the tough stuff.”   Over time, they came to see the “tough stuff” in a new light. “What we were going through wasn’t weird — it was human,” says Lidey.  Shine grew out of their desire to make that safe space bigger, to help others with issues ranging from building a credit score to dealing with giving feedback to employees.</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/68535756-CCBF-4F94-BCCC-63B2C57190B8/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Check in with Shine via its chat interface and the app will serve up articles based on your responses (front).

(Hirabayashi, for her part, is a “Caring Critic” prone to “extending compassion outward, but often struggling to bring that compassion home,” she says.)</p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/4116B84D-F165-4100-B0A1-D6E98426BC15/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"><p class=\"typography-caption\">Shine co-CEO Naomi Hirabayashi</p></div><p>Today the app is rich with features. <em>The Daily Shine</em> is a podcast that Hirabayashi describes as a “secular sermon.” Challenges are short, multiday audio courses on specific goals like “Be More Direct” and “Let Yourself Have More Fun.” “Nightcap” is a collection of sleep stories that double as winking retellings of 2000s rom-coms (“The Devil Wears Pajamas”). “They’re meant to be boring and also a little cheeky,” Lidey says.  Through all the growth, the pair’s goal has remained the same.

They’re the right color, they’re designed impeccably, and you can’t wait to get them delivered and on your feet. Except, wait — they’re only made in size 7. And sadly, while you might be able to cram your feet in and wear them on occasion, they won’t be comfortable enough for daily use. </p>\n<p>Now, most shoe manufacturers don’t offer their shoes in just one size. Instead, when they create a new shoe model, they offer a range of sizes with the same design and functionality so that the customer can enjoy the one that fits best.</p>\n<p>It’s the same for really great apps: When developing, you want to create an interface that adapts to a range of screen sizes with the same design and functionality for all. That way, whether someone uses iPhone SE or iPad Pro to view your app, they still get to have an enjoyable and comfortable experience. </p>\n<p>Below, we’ve collected some of the best ways you can adapt your app’s interface so that it looks great, regardless of device.</p><h3>Universal design</h3><p>While you can design solely for specific platforms like iPhone, iPad, or Mac, consider creating a universal version of your app that supports multiple devices. This lets your customer choose how your app fits into their life, and it’s the most adaptive experience you can provide. Whether you’re creating apps designed for a single platform or multiple devices, however, they should support all available screen sizes and size classes for those devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to launch</strong></p>\n<p>A great app experience starts with a universal launch screen: Designing the right one can make a world of difference in how quickly you can immerse people into your user interface. Use Xcode to create a launch screen storyboard — they’re flexible and support all device screen sizes, allowing you to use a single storyboard to manage your launch screens on every platform you support. </p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=voseytot\">Learn more about designing launch screens for seamless&nbsp;starts&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/5E103D81-48D2-4711-8041-F9AAC6C56950/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p><strong>Get into Auto Layout</strong></p>\n<p>When crafting your interface, Auto Layout can help you adapt to any screen size. It provides guidelines for your app that relate the positioning of one piece of content to any other content or views. This lets your content scale and reflow in the manner you intend it. Avoid using absolute screen coordinates, as those may result in off-center buttons or awkward content flow on different screen sizes.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilayoutguide\">Learn more about Auto Layout in the Developer&nbsp;Library&nbsp;&gt;</a> </p><p><strong>Explore SwiftUI</strong> </p>\n<p>If your app is built for iOS 13, iPadOS 13, watchOS 6, tvOS 13, or macOS Catalina, you may want to also consider implementing SwiftUI. The declarative nature of SwiftUI ensures that your content is adaptable out of the box, and that code is also often reusable when building apps for other Apple platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Master multitasking</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re developing an app that supports iPad, remember that people can use it in a variety of ways: They can browse the app in full screen, put it next to another app in Split View, pull it up in Slide Over, or (if your app supports it) even view multiple windows side by side. Consider each of these size classes and how your interface can successfully adapt to provide the best experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/multitasking/\">Get started with&nbsp;multitasking&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Keep your content readable</h3><p>It can be challenging to design for a great reading experience on all devices if you have text- or image-heavy content in your app. Let the Readable Content Guide do the heavy lifting for you: The layout guide defines an area that can easily be read without extra effort.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622644-readablecontentguide\">Learn more about the Readable Content&nbsp;Guide&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/965793EB-9368-42C7-B147-5CE594943CDE/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Additionally, make sure your reading experience is accessible. Many people prefer to change their text size to something other than the default. Supporting Dynamic Type ensures your text scales to what your customer has indicated they want. It also ensures that as the text gets larger or smaller, other on-screen elements dynamically move to accommodate these changes.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility/overview/text-size-and-weight/\">Learn more about designing with text weight and size in mind &gt;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifontmetrics\">Learn more about scaling text set in a custom&nbsp;font&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"inline-article-image\"><img src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/692B58BE-9755-468C-B146-52E234F3B1C2/1024.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\"></div><p>Use safe areas when designing your interface to ensure your views will never over or underlap other content or hardware elements, regardless of device.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/2891102-safearealayoutguide\">Learn more about safe areas and <code>safeAreaLayoutGuide</code>&nbsp;&gt;</a></p><h3>Craft your queries effectively</h3><p>While it’s helpful — and often critical — to know the device capabilities on which your app is currently running, be mindful to avoid checking for a known set of devices and collating behaviors based on those results.
