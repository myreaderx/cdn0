She was given the nickname because, as she puts it, she does her best to make sure “people feel seen and heard.” One way she does that is through her role as an ambassador for Women Techmakers, a Google group committed to providing resources, visibility and community to women in tech, in her town of Waterloo, Canada. “I’m focused on enabling diversity, inclusion and belonging.”</p>\n     <p>Hana is also the founder of <a href=\"https://www.blackmaple.io/\">Blackmaple.io</a>. Blackmaple.io helps people gain access to equitable employment and networking opportunities, as well as supports tech companies that want to diversify their hiring and develop inclusive frameworks.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n     <p>I recently had the chance to talk to Hana about this work, and why she feels it’s important to bridge the tech industry’s gender gap.</p>\n     <p><b>What impact has Women Techmakers had on you?</b></p>\n     <p>Seeing the various ways other Ambassadors around the world are tackling equality in tech has equipped me with so much insight and knowledge. It’s also provided me with a community of women in Waterloo that’s helped me navigate the tech scene here.</p>\n     <p>Kitchener-Waterloo is Canada’s top startup ecosystem, and home to Google Canada. Running a Women Techmakers chapter here allows us to provide visibility, community and resources for women in technology here. We want to make sure there’s gender equity in this booming tech ecosystem by supporting and celebrating the diverse women-identified techmakers here.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p><b>What problem are you hoping to solve with Blackmaple.io?</b></p>\n     <p>I founded Blackmaple.io five years ago to support tech companies in diversifying their talent pipeline and give them resources for becoming more inclusive. As a two-sided marketplace—meaning that our platform is for companies hiring as well as people looking for jobs—our talent platform helps people gain access to equitable employment opportunities and community, as well as address many challenges of diversity in tech.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>Right now, our talent platform, which is available to those looking for work, is in closed beta. But the goal is to&nbsp; streamline the recruitment process and remove some of the barriers of entry to employment.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>I also want to help tech companies gain competitive advantages through their workforce by understanding the value of employees as people first. With a diversity lens, I want to help pair the best tech companies with the most talented people across the globe.</p>\n     <p><b>What career obstacles did you have to overcome?</b></p>\n     <p>There’s a&nbsp; Nelson Mandela quote, \"lead from the back and let others believe they are in front,\" that resonated with me when I founded Blackmaple.io. I was often referred to as a \"CEO of one,\" which was dismissive, and to which I always responded, \"but a champion of many.\"</p>\n     <p>Because I am one of the few women of color in the space, I often encounter and have had to overcome assumptions about me. People are surprised when they learn about my ability to build and solve things, the positions I hold, the spaces I take up and the people in my network.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p><b>What advice do you have for other women who want to start tech companies?&nbsp;</b></p>\n     <p>Trust your abilities, find your community and don’t give up, because what is meant for you will come to you.</p>\n     <p><b>What do you think are the barriers that exist in tech for women of color?</b></p>\n     <p>Access to resources and opportunities is definitely an issue, specifically for women of color.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>These barriers persist because there’s a lack of representation in leadership. You can only solve for what you know so having a diverse leadership team is key.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>Google's Black Founders fund is an example of moving in the right direction, especially given its global reach and impact. There’s also the Generation Google Scholarship, Google Lime Scholarship and Women Techmakers Scholars programs that drive equitable educational opportunities for underrepresented groups by removing some financial burdens. These are all opportunities I uplift so other underrepresented groups may learn more about them and apply.</p>\n     <p><b>What else would you like to share about being a woman in tech?</b></p>\n     <p>In Somali, we say: “Buundada waxaa la hagaajiyaa oo keliya kadib marka qof ku dhaco biyaha,” which means “the bridge is repaired only after someone falls into the water.”</p>\n     <p>2020 has been a year of firsts and “yet agains,” sadly. As a Black woman in tech, I’m expected to be the subject matter expert, I’m expected to be co-signed, I’m expected to justify the space I take up, I’m expected to explain myself, I’m expected to prove myself.&nbsp;</p>\n     <p>I build, drive and make change as well as celebrate all humans, everyday, in an industry not designed for us, but rather that’s adjusting to us.</p>\n     <p>Thankfully, though, I am one of many—and the industry is starting to notice.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":4755,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/C_DesignersTable_CC.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"53bd56ec05f4ae18bb607dcc5eeb0f22","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-08-15-799_2de16aa1173c2af3.webp","destWidth":349,"destHeight":216,"sourceBytes":11861,"destBytes":5892,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/C_DesignersTable_CC.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-08-15-799_2de16aa1173c2af3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306895406},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","title":"Boost your bass and share your sounds, with Pixel Buds","link":"https://blog.google/products/pixel-buds/bass-boost-sharing-detection-new-pixelbuds-features/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Today, we’re dropping new features for Pixel Buds to help you customize your sound experience, find your earbuds more easily if you misplace them and get more done with your earbuds—including an experimental feature that alerts you to what's going on around you even when you have your Pixel Buds in.</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Personalize your audio experience</h3>\n  <p>When Pixel Buds launched earlier this year, we heard people wanted more control and customization over their audio experience.

You can enhance your bass directly in the Pixel Buds settings, and if you decide to share one of your earbuds with someone, you no longer have to sacrifice your volume preferences thanks to sharing detection. When on, sharing detection automatically detects when you're sharing an earbud with someone and you can both individually swipe on your respective earbud to control your own volume.

With a new color-mapping algorithmic technique, we’re able to take this imagery and translate it into an even more comprehensive, vibrant map of an area at global scale. Exploring a place gives you a look at its natural features—so you can easily distinguish tan, arid beaches and deserts from blue lakes, rivers, oceans and ravines. You can know at a glance how lush and green a place is with vegetation, and even see if there are snow caps on the peaks of mountaintops.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>With this update, Google Maps has one of the most comprehensive views of natural features on any major map app—with availability in all 220 countries and territories that Google Maps supports. That’s coverage for over 100M square kilometers of land, or 18 billion football fields!</p>\n  <p>This update is visible no matter what area you’re looking at—from the biggest metropolitan areas to small, rural towns.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Mapping the rainbow 🌈</h3>\n  <p>How exactly does this color-mapping technique work? First, we use computer vision to identify natural features from our satellite imagery, looking specifically at arid, icy, forested, and mountainous regions. We then analyze these features and assign them a range of colors on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\">HSV color model</a>. For example, a densely covered forest can be classified as dark green, while an area of patchy shrubs could appear as a lighter shade of green.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Iceland_Resize.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">iceland_resized</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>Iceland’s rich landscape is now much easier to visualize.

The blend of practical experience with scientific and social research has yielded simple and actionable safety messages that people can trust in the event of an emergency like an earthquake, wildfire, hurricane or flash flood. Sometimes these are simple actions like listening for more information from local authorities or following evacuation orders. Other messages are practical things like moving valuables to safety if you’re near an area that may flood or preparing an emergency kit to keep nearby.</p>\n  <b><br /></b>\n  <p><b>How do you ensure these safety tips are relevant for people across multiple countries?</b></p>\n  <p>We work with a network of 192 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the globe—each one operates in its own language, and understands unique local challenges and needs. We gave each partner a set of standard, evidence-based messages for 20 different hazards across 6 different time scales (mitigation, seasonal forecast, watch, warning, immediate, and recovery). This localization process included consultation with their government partners to finalize the messages that we’re sharing with the public.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How, if at all, have these recommendations changed with the impact of COVID-19?</b></p>\n  <p>As one example, safety tips now advise having additional items in emergency kits—such as hand sanitizer and cloth face coverings. It will be important to have these on hand so that people can continue being safe, and keeping their neighbors safe, in case they need to evacuate their homes and stay in close proximity to others.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What are some of the top challenges in communicating disaster safety information to the public?</b></p>\n  <p>Trust and consistency are two of the biggest challenges. Every person accesses information through&nbsp; many different channels. There’s a high volume of content to navigate, which can leave people confused or even unaware of what to do when there is an emergency. With the Red Cross safety messages that can be delivered through Google SOS alerts and by an API to other channels, we’re offering consistent, evidence-based safety messages prepared by a trusted source.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Now that we’re in hurricane and wildfire seasons, what’s the number one piece of advice you can give to readers to stay safe?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>The most important thing is to have a plan and make sure you and your loved ones know what to do when there’s an emergency. This includes identifying a trusted source of information, knowing and practicing the steps you will take in an emergency and identifying the items and must-haves you may need for your recovery.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":4755,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"0d50f8f1f518f847da633bd244437d19","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-08-15-704_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp","destWidth":471,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":203690,"destBytes":49570,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-08-15-704_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306895406},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","title":"Mapping wildfires with the power of satellite data","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Ten years ago, I was inside the Google office in Haifa, Israel when the devastating Carmel Mountain fire started blazing not far from us.

Plenty of activities momentarily kept my interest over the last five months, but one thing that isn't going anywhere? Video calling. While I miss visiting in person, for me, the next best thing has been video calls. Nest Hub Max and Google Assistant already offer a host of ways to stay connected with Duo and Google Meet. And soon you’ll have one more option to use the video calling service of your choice: Zoom is coming to Assistant-enabled Smart Displays, including Nest Hub Max, by the end of the year.</p>\n  <p>We want everyone to be able to keep in touch while staying safe, and that's why we want you to be able to use the video calling option of your choice. Here's a quick run-down of some of the various ways you can use your Nest Hub Max and Google Assistant to stay in touch:&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3><br />Gather for group calls</h3>\n  <p>It’s easy to start or join a group video call on your Nest Hub Max. You can say “Hey Google, start a meeting” to connect with up to 100 people with <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/assistant/hey-google-make-group-call-now-available-nest-hub-max/\">Google Meet</a>, and soon, anyone with a Zoom account—whether it’s free or paid—will also be able to join a video call from their Hub Max or other Assistant-enabled Smart Display. With Meet or Zoom, you can easily move from one call to the next. To join your next meeting, say \"Hey Google, join my next meeting\" to easily connect to the next call on your personal Google Calendar.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>You can easily invite others to join your Meet group video call from your phone with the Assistant app for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant\">Android</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-assistant/id1220976145\">iOS</a>. Beta support for G Suite accounts is also available to sign up for at <a href=\"http://g.co/gsuiteassistantbeta\">g.co/gsuiteassistantbeta</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>With Duo, simply create groups in the <a href=\"https://duo.google.com/about/\">Duo mobile app</a> and then ask your Hub Max, “Hey Google, make a group call,” and tap on the Duo group you want to connect with.

For me, sometimes it’s the easiest way to send a quick note to my friends and family. You can now send audio messages with Google Assistant on Android smart phones--without holding down the little mic icon. To get started, just say, “Hey Google, send an audio message” or “Hey Google, send an audio message to Paul saying I’m on the way.” The feature is available in English-speaking countries around the globe, as well as in Portuguese in Brazil.</p></li>\n   <li><p><b>Get help reading web articles:</b>Between staying informed and entertained, I find myself reading a lot of content on my phone these days. With Google Assistant, your browser can <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/assistant/easier-access-web-pages-let-assistant-read-it-aloud/\">read web articles out loud</a>. Whenever a web article is displayed on your browser in your Android phone, you can say, “Hey Google, read it” or “Hey Google, read this page” and it will immediately read aloud the content of the web page.</p></li>\n   <li><p><b>Find restaurants offering delivery or takeout:</b>Some days, it feels like I blink and it’s suddenly 5 p.m. On days when I don’t have time to cook dinner but need to get a meal on the table, I say, “Hey Google, find restaurants that deliver near me” or “Hey Google, show me restaurants with takeout.”</p></li>\n   <li><p><b>Snap a selfie:</b>I recently took a trip to Yosemite and wanted to quickly capture the perfect family photo during our hike—including the deer behind us. By saying, “Hey Google, take a selfie,” Assistant will open your phone’s front-facing camera and snap a picture on the count of three.&nbsp;</p></li>\n   <li><p><b>Call or text your best friend:</b>I have a standing call with my best friend every other week. When it’s time to hop on the line, all I need to say is “Hey Google, video call Taylor.” And if I’m running late to our call, I can always just ask Google to send her a text by saying, “Hey Google, tell Taylor I’m running late.”</p></li>\n   <li><p><b>Share your favorite content:</b>You can easily share things from your phone with friends using your voice, like articles or photos. Simply say “Hey Google, share this with Taylor” and Google Assistant will share that link or image with the person you chose.&nbsp;</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":4755,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Assistant_audio_message.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"572247ca2f00572c29e6f69688d891bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-08-15-658_8dec6a398503468a.webp","destWidth":471,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":262346,"destBytes":73856,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Assistant_audio_message.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-08-15-658_8dec6a398503468a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306895407},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","title":"Finding live TV shows and sports just got easier in Search","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/finding-live-tv-shows-and-sports-just-got-easier-search/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Sports around the world look a little different this year, with important new measures to keep players, officials and fans safe.

She later watched her parents put away savings for years to be able to afford college tuition for their daughters. From a very young age, she came to understand the meaning and importance of a good education.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Today, as the VP of <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/\">Google for Education</a>, Avni works every day to help build tools that make a&nbsp; high-quality education available to everyone. That mission is especially important now as widespread school closures from the COVID-19 pandemic have challenged schools and families to quickly adjust to distance learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Through it all, Avni remains optimistic about the future of education and the role technology can play in shaping it. She says that over the past few months the resiliency of teachers and students alike has inspired her, and that there have been “bright spots” of positivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How do you explain your job at a dinner party?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p>My team builds tools for teachers, students, and education leaders to help improve teaching and learning at scale. One thing that’s great about working at Google is that describing my job is pretty easy, and always a great conversation starter—I get lots of feature requests (and bug reports 🙂) wherever I go.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>The use of technology in education is especially important now. What are you most excited about?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p>It’s been amazing to see the role technology has played to keep learning happening, no matter what. As I look ahead to the next six to twelve months, I’m excited about working alongside teachers, education leaders and students to build tools that can really meet their needs, both now—in this ever-changing situation—and for the future.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>What we’ve seen in the past few months is an unexpected acceleration towards the digitization of education and learning. As that shift continues to happen, I see an opportunity longer-term to unlock even more of the potential of technology and the role it can play in being helpful to teachers, students and families. While tech is only part of the solution and there’s still a lot of work left to do, it’s clear that technology will have a unique part in shaping the future of education.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What has surprised you the most over the past six months?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p>The adaptability and resiliency of everyone, especially teachers. Teachers, schools and entire governments across the world had to quickly adjust to huge changes when schools started closing, and in many cases, the shift to distance learning happened in a matter of days.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>I saw it with my own daughter. Back in March, her school closed on a Thursday, and by Monday, the whole school was up and running with a full virtual curriculum. They literally went from zero to distance learning in seventy-two hours. And that story isn’t unique—we hear stories like this from our teachers and students all over the world.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>What’s more is that my daughter’s class continued to adapt and adjust. I remember their first video call and hearing twenty second graders talking all at once—it was definitely a bit chaotic. But the students, teachers and administrators quickly adapted. And now my daughter is teaching me things like what online classroom etiquette looks like.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How have you and your team stayed motivated?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Over the past few months, my team started a weekly tradition called “bright spots” where we share inspiring stories about how teachers, students and families use our tools.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We’ve heard creative ways teachers turn their homes into virtual classrooms—including one teacher who used their shower as a whiteboard surface. There was also a family in New Zealand who sent a photo of a distance learning classroom they built on top of a hill so they could have access to satellite Wi-Fi; it was made out of a generator-powered farm trailer!&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Who has been a strong female influence in your life?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p>My mom. She’s incredibly hardworking and approaches life with this calm, yet tireless, optimism. When she and my dad moved to the U.S. from Mumbai, she worked multiple jobs to help make ends meet and taught herself English by watching Nick at Nite on TV. Later on, she worked full time while she studied (and passed) the CPA exam, and she moved in to help me when my first child was born—while still working herself.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>I started keeping a list of all the positive things that wouldn’t have happened if COVID wasn’t here to remind myself that there are nuggets of good. Getting to see my mom every day is definitely on the list. She lives in Alabama and I live in California, but since the pandemic, my kids video call her every day.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What advice do you have for women starting out in their careers?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Careers are not linear, and things that feel like sideways or downward movement can still be progress. Be open to opportunities that might be surprising or sound scary because that's usually where learning and growth happen.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>I’ve been at Google for seventeen years and moved around the company quite a bit, working on Search, Maps, Chrome and now Google for Education. Some transitions were harder than others. For example, there was the time when I moved to Zurich, took on a new role, became a manager for the first time, and got married—all within the span of three weeks. Every time I made a transition, I had to learn about an entirely new product, industry and team, and where I could fit in. But every transition helped me get used to feeling uncomfortable and learning new things again. And, in hindsight, I can see how each of those moves was extremely valuable.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":4755,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e66d2c430222d96101c4aeb81a1bd668","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306895408},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:08:15","title":"Google teams up with news publishers on a new product","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-teams-news-publishers-new-product/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In late June, we launched a <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/licensing-program-support-news-industry-/\">licensing program</a> to pay for quality content from publishers for an upcoming news experience. The goal of this project is to create something that gives readers more context and journalistic perspective on news stories as well as helps publishers’ distinct editorial voices shine through. Today, we wanted to update you on how we're working alongside our publisher partners to achieve this.</p>\n  <p>This licensing program and upcoming product both build on our broader commitment to support the news industry in its drive towards a more sustainable future. And as we expand licensing to more publishers in more countries, we’re also working closely with 10 different news outlets from Germany and Brazil on an early access program, &nbsp;testing features and gathering feedback to shape the product direction ahead of full launch later this year. Publishers taking part in this early access program including international brands as well as local household staples like <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de\">ZEIT ONLINE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/\">Der Spiegel,</a> <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/\">Tagesspiegel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ippen-digital.de/\">Ippen Media Group</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://rp-online.de/\">Rheinische Post</a> in Germany and <a href=\"https://em.com.br/\">Estado de Minas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.agazeta.com.br/brasil\">&nbsp;A Gazeta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/\">Correio Braziliense</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uol.com.br/\">UOL</a> in Brazil. These partners are helping us test features and gather feedback ahead of a full launch later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>At Google, we know the best products are built when a diversity of knowledge, insight and expertise are brought into the mix, and this early access program is a major phase in our progress. Participating publishers are testing publisher tools, evaluating technical integrations and ensuring different templates enhance the ways they bring stories to their readers.&nbsp; We’re also discussing paywall integrations, where Google would pay for free access to allow readers to read articles on a publisher’s site. This will help paywalled publishers grow their audience and deepen their relationship with readers.</p>\n  <p>But the success of this product will rest on how good the experience is for readers, so bringing in experts from the news industry to understand their insights and hear their feedback is critical. That’s particularly appealing for Sebastian Horn, Deputy Editor of <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de\">ZEIT ONLINE</a>, one of Germany’s leading publishers and one of our partners. \"Collaborating with Google on this new project allows us to bring the best of ZEIT ONLINE’s journalism to new audiences across Google's products and to do what our readers trust us to do best–provide them with the most relevant news and the best in-depth analysis on current topics.“&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We also want to make sure readers know who is behind the news and find publications they respect. That’s why we’re making sure this&nbsp; product strongly reflects the publishers’ brand, while still creating a cohesive news experience.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>“This new collaboration opportunity adds further value to the essence of our mission, which is to forge a very close bond with our community through quality journalism and a first rate product experience,” says Aglisson Lopes, the Performance Editor for<a href=\"https://www.agazeta.com.br/brasil\">A Gazeta</a>, one of Brazil's leading local and regional publications. “We are a regional publisher that strives to be at the leading edge of digital trends and our continuing work with Google leads the way in getting us closer to this goal.\"</p>\n  <p>Google has long been invested in supporting news businesses and we believe the work we do through the <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\">Google News Initiative</a> alongside the traffic from News and Search–24 billion visits a month–are hugely valuable.

I was particularly excited for this year’s prompt, given how critical kindness is today. To me, showing kindness means doing your best to practice empathy always, and doing the right thing—big or small— to make someone feel seen, heard and valued. This includes being kind to ourselves as well as thinking beyond our own experiences and circumstances to show kindness to each other and our world.</p>\n  <p>We received tens of thousands of entries from talented students across the country and were blown away by the thoughtfulness and creativity they poured into their artwork. Now, we’re announcing our 54 state and territory winners. From promoting respect and inclusion, to showing empathy to friends, family and community, to treating the environment with care, each of our winners demonstrated a unique commitment to spreading kindness.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We were incredibly inspired by all of the submissions. To celebrate our talented winners, we sent each of the 54 students an exciting prize box full of Google hardware and swag—as well as a very special congratulatory video message from the Doodle for Google team.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Doodle for Google vot\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Voting_reminder_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Head to <a href=\"https://doodles.google.com/d4g/vote/\">our website</a> to see the full gallery of all 54 state and territory winners.

These aren’t props from the set of a Sci-Fi movie, they’re a few of the finalist projects presented in New Orleans during the <a href=\"http://uist.acm.org\">ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology</a> (UIST), the premier venue for innovations in human-computer interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>UIST’s Student Innovation Contest is a forum where university students demonstrate how novel input, interaction, actuation and output technologies can create interactive experiences. UIST partnered with two teams from Google Research, <a href=\"http://coral.ai\">Google Coral</a> and Bio Interfaces, to sponsor the event, the theme of which was Interactive Systems for Social Impact: See, Feel, Hear the Invisible.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Google Coral’s mission is to build beneficial and privacy preserving AI by providing a platform to strengthen society, improve the environment and enrich lives. One way we do this is by giving students access to the same machine learning hardware and toolchains used by AI researchers and industry practitioners. The Bio Interfaces team focuses on developing AI hardware to help people better communicate and interact with their world.&nbsp;</p>Our two teams worked together to provide contest participants with 15 pre-release hardware kits that embed machine learning into custom electronics. Students then used \n  <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/lite\">TensorFlow Lite</a> and an assortment of sensors to build machine learning-powered experiences that could use various inputs, such as camera feeds, temperature, atmospheric pressure, ambient light and humidity sensing.\n  <p></p>\n  <p>The nine finalist teams had three months to use these kits to create interactive experiences with cardboard prototypes,&nbsp;and the contest had two types of awards: The People’s Choice awards were based on votes from the conference attendees. The Jury’s Choice awards were determined by Jessica Cauchard (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev), Alexandra Ion (ETH Zurich) and myself (Google Research).&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/3.Visionaires.93-95.gif);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">ACM UIST Jury's Choice Award winners</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>The Jury’s Choice Award went to Team Visionaries, Dennis Dietz, Stefan Langer, Kyrill Schmid, Daniel Neumann and Felix Dietz from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who developed a haptic vest with a camera. “The vest is intended for visually impaired people,” the team explained. “We have vibration sensors in the back, and it detects objects in front of the person wearing it so that they can then navigate around these obstacles.”</p>\n        </div>\n       </figcaption>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/4.MountainSoil.132-134.gif);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">ACM UIST Team MountainSoil</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>Team MountainSoil, Keitaro Tsuchiya, Hiroo Yamamura and Daisuke Yamamoto from Keio University Graduate School of Media Design in Japan, received a Jury’s Choice Honorable Mention award for a system that monitored a person’s facial expression and used a robotic arm to draw it as a manga character on a transparent pane in front of their face.

She’d been working in data processing at a tech company for six years but recently found herself wanting “something more meaningful.” “I felt like the long nights and weekends, the overtime and stress, didn’t contribute to making anyone’s life better,” Nikiya says. “Especially my own.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Nikiya decided to leave her job in tech and pivot toward a career in academic research, beginning work at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences College of Public Health. “I built a web-based application that disseminated county-level health data for the state of Arkansas,” she says. That led to more work creating systems for public health and institutional research. Today, she still supports that very first project, as well as works on creating new web and mobile applications focused on digital health and access for people in underserved areas.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Nikiya is also a Women Techmakers Ambassador in her town of Little Rock, Arkansas. <a href=\"https://www.womentechmakers.com/\">Women Techmakers</a> is a Google-created community that works to promote the visibility and opportunities for women in tech. I recently caught up with Nikiya to learn more about her career in making public-facing tech applications, as well as how Women Techmakers has helped her find community.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What do you get out of the Women Techmakers community?</b></p>\n  <p>I feel so empowered, included and supported as part of Women Techmakers. Everyone deserves to be valued and heard and to have access to opportunities that help us grow as developers or any industry. The group gives us amazing tools to be able to uplift women and support them in their careers. There’s something about being part of a community that helps you when you feel like giving up; that encourages you to keep going.</p>\n  <p>Community organizing takes a lot of effort. It means reaching out to people who tell you “no” sometimes. Starting a community like this is an incredible experience in teaching, leadership, perseverance and organization. I learn a lot. Not just about tech, but also about people and how to figure out what the community needs.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>What inspired you to enter the public health space?</b></p>\n  <p>I want to be a technologist for social good. I get to work with students, epidemiologists, data scientists, researchers and clinicians with different areas of expertise and different areas of research and be a part of their amazing work. I believe the pandemic has shown us the importance of looking out for others. I’m hopeful that by combining my love for education, science and technology, I can be a part of making our community better.</p>\n  <p><b>What is the tech industry in Little Rock like?</b></p>\n  <p>There’s a lot of opportunity for tech here, although many may not realize this at first. Major employers like Walmart, Sam's Club and Tyson Foods are located here. There’s also a small tech community in the central area around Little Rock, as well as a few startups.</p>\n  <p><b>There are a lot of misconceptions about the tech industry. What do you wish more people knew?</b></p>\n  <p>Sometimes when we think about tech, we think about “big tech.” I’m challenging myself and others to think about how we can use tech in traditionally non-tech spaces. I ask myself, how can we use tech to improve education, fair housing, healthcare? To reduce poverty, prejudice and racial injustice?&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Do you have any advice for other women in tech?</b></p>\n  <p>As a woman, it has been a lot to juggle a career, raise a family, pursue more education and take care of myself. My call to action is to show yourself some grace. Be kind to yourself, too. There are days when it’s not all going to get done. You will probably drop a ball or two.

For many this led to a heightened period of dread and anxiety, but also creativity and heroism. During lockdown artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tomcroftartist/?hl=en\">Tom Croft</a> created #portraitsforNHSheroes to galvanize artists across the country to celebrate workers on the frontline. Tom collaborated with the charity <a href=\"https://www.paintingsinhospitals.org.uk/\">Paintings in Hospitals</a> to give the collection a more permanent home, as it closely aligns with the values and ethos of their mission to improve health through art. As a result of the collaboration, Google Arts &amp; Culture created an<a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/preview/project/healthcare-heroes\"></a><a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/healthcare-heroes\">online exhibition</a> of over 700 contemporary portraits that were submitted as part of Tom’s #portraitsforNHSheroes initiative.</i><br /></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><i>Sandra Bruce-Gordon, director of Paintings in Hospitals spoke to artist Tom Croft about the exhibition and their collaboration.</i></p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: We know that art can help meet challenges in health and social care around ageing, loneliness and mental health. What will be the main benefit of the exhibition for our audiences?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: I hope it gives the frontline workers a sense of how valued they are and how indebted we feel toward them. I wanted to raise their status through portraiture as this crisis has really highlighted and reminded everyone of their critical work. If the exhibition can help artists, healthcare workers or the audience process this appalling time, then that will be a good thing.</p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: You must be really proud of what you and the other artists have achieved. How do you think this exhibition will be received?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: Firstly, I am so grateful to Paintings in Hospitals and Google Arts &amp; Culture for creating this space and a permanent record for these amazing NHS portraits. I hope everyone will take the time to view this virtual exhibition, which at the moment is the best way to get the widest and most inclusive audience for an exhibition. I am super excited for it to launch and proud of what everyone has achieved. &nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: For me, the portraits get behind the anxiety and stress that the frontline workers must have been feeling. I hope the exhibition will help improve communication between patients and carers. What were the relationships between artists and frontline workers like?</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: Since we couldn’t meet up with our subjects, we based the portraits on images sent over social media. Some artists worked from video call sittings, so we all had to be flexible in our practices. I asked <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/2QUhsxm3Xtvq-g\">my subject Harriet</a> lots of very direct questions about her <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/FwWxn9IjY-1QmA\">experience on the frontline.</a> She was so generous to share her thoughts and feelings with me and we got to know each other well pretty quickly. I know from hearing from other artists that the bond between artist and sitter, forged in this unusual and very emotional set of circumstances, was really strong. Tears were shed on both sides when the portraits were revealed.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Harriet_Durkin_-_Tom_Croft.max-1800x1800.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Harriet Durkin -

For G Suite customers, Meet lets you use your phone for audio while still using your computer’s camera and web browser to share and see video and presentations in the meeting. This can be done by <a href=\"https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9518557\">dialing into the call directly</a> or by having Meet call your phone directly. If you’re in a meeting, click <b>More options</b> (three dots on the lower right of your screen), then <b>Use a phone for audio</b>.

Plus, we’re adding new features that make it easier to take the next step, whether it’s buying something useful, preparing a meal or finding a new job.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <h2>Shopping</h2>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>When you’re shopping on the web, product reviews and news articles can be an important part of deciding what to buy. And when you’re doing your research, you might use Search to check for updates about a certain product and make sure you’re getting a good deal. With the shopping activity card, Search will show you products you’ve been researching, even if they were featured in an article you were reading.
