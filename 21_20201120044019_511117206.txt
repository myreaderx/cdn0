The Searchlight Pictures film involves a young boy who invites a mysterious man into his house, which in turn results in &#8220;disturbing things.&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;ll happen. The movie originated as a pitch from <em>The Last Witch Hunter</em> writer Cory Goodman, with Gregory Levasseur now handling the script.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646745\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline broke the news on <em>Elijah</em>, the new horror movie from <em>Crawl</em> and <em>The Hills Have Eyes</em> director Alexandre Aja. The story &#8220;follows a young boy who invites a mysterious man into his home, believing the stranger to be the key to saving his sick mother. As increasingly disturbing things start to happen around his home, the boy soon realizes that the sinister stranger is not the savior he claims to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How mysterious! What&#8217;s this stranger&#8217;s deal? Is he a vampire? That was my immediate thought, what with the whole &#8220;invited into the home&#8221; thing. But that&#8217;s just wild speculation on my part. Perhaps this stranger is a Wolfman, or even a Frankenstein. I&#8217;ll let the big shots in Hollywood figure this one out. David Goyer and Keith Levine of Phantom Four are producing the movie along with Adam Goldworm of Aperture Entertainment. Aja was recently announced as a director of a Quibi series based on the Japanese horror manga <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tomie-tv-series/\"><em>Tomie</em></a>, but since Quibi is now dead and buried I&#8217;m guessing that project is dead, opening the door for Aja to jump into <em>Elijah</em>.</p>\n<p>Aja&#8217;s credits include <em>Crawl, The Hills Have Eyes, High Tension</em>, <em>Piranha 3D</em>, <em>Horns</em>, <em>The 9th Life of Louis Drax</em>, and the upcoming <em>O2</em>, and if I&#8217;m being honest, I have to say that <em>Crawl</em> is the only movie he&#8217;s made that I genuinely liked from start to finish. I liked <em>parts</em> of <em>Hills Have Eyes</em>, <em>High Tension</em>, and <em>Piranha</em>, but in the end, none of those titles fully coalesced. <em>Crawl</em>, however, was genuinely fun monster movie entertainment – a B-movie that took itself seriously enough to make the entire thing worthwhile. With all that in mind, I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic about <em>Elijah</em>. One thing I&#8217;ll say: when Disney bought Fox I was worried that they might try to water down adult-driven movies through banners like Searchlight. But so far that hasn&#8217;t happened. The Disney-owned Searchlight has already released the great R-rated horror-comedy <em>Ready or Not</em> and they also have the R-rated Guillermo del Toro-produced, Scott Cooper-directed <em>Antlers</em> on the horizon.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/elijah-alexandre-aja/\">&#8216;Elijah&#8217;: &#8216;Crawl&#8217; Director Alexandre Aja Helming New Horror Movie For Searchlight Pictures</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iSBYqk9GnXs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:15:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Elijah-Alexandre-Aja-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"77ab2d8f155d486baba338414f0e9db8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-48-367_a667e5a846b73555.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":40607,"destBytes":25462,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Elijah-Alexandre-Aja-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn9@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-48-367_a667e5a846b73555.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-18-551_60a96a5f05244149.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iSBYqk9GnXs:FIR9dDLNLAo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn32@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-483_bbfd67a45e756800.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iSBYqk9GnXs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-417_489a2ac1820265e3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘Halloween Kills’ Was Screened For a Terminally Ill Fan, and Jamie Lee Curtis Officiated Their Wedding","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646601","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-585646 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/halloween-kills-first-look-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"halloween kills first look\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/halloween-kills-first-look-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/halloween-kills-first-look-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/halloween-kills-first-look-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/halloween-kills-first-look.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Halloween</em></strong> franchise has brought us plenty of horror over the years, but this year, it brought joy to a terminally ill super fan who was given a bittersweet blessing by director <strong>David Gordon Green</strong> and slasher icon <strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Anthony Woodle is a horror super fan and aspiring director who was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer in 2019. That means he wasn&#8217;t going to be able to see <strong><em>Halloween Kills</em></strong>, the next installment of the reinvigorated franchise that was supposed to be released in theaters this year, but ended up being pushed to October 2021. But thanks to the efforts of a close friend, Woodle was not only able to screen <em>Halloween Kills</em> before he passed, but his final moments were made even more special by Curtis herself.<span id=\"more-646601\"></span></p>\n<p>Woodle and his girlfriend were engaged on Halloween in 2016, but he received some very bad news in 2019 when he found out he had Stage IV esophageal cancer. Knowing that he only had a short time before this battle would be over, Woodle&#8217;s employer and friend, a movie theater owner in Charleston, South Carolina named Paul Brown, reached out to Rough House Productions, the company formed by David Gordon Green, Jody Hill and Danny McBride, producers of the new <em>Halloween</em> sequels. Brown hoped that his friend might be able to see <em>Halloween Kills</em> after the movie was delayed to October 2021. Not only did he get his wish, but Jamie Lee Curtis did something more for him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/local_state_news/charlestons-biggest-halloween-fan-stricken-with-cancer-gets-made-for-movies-ending/article_3c3bb0d4-237f-11eb-916f-53c19fb0eb35.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Post and Courier</a> (via Deadline) learned that after Rough House Productions screened <em>Halloween Kills</em> early for Woodle and his longtime girlfriend Emilee, they connected the 29-year-old with Jamie Lee Curtis, and the two had a lovely conversation about the new movie, his struggling health, and his intent to get married before it was too late. In addition to sending a package that included an autographed knife from the movie, Curtis, who is an ordained minister, offered to marry Woodle to the love of his life.</p>\n<p>Though Woodle and his wife intended to be married on Halloween, the ceremony was scheduled for September 13, which unfortunately was day when Woodle&#8217;s health had deteriorated significantly, leaving him unconscious in bed but surrounded by his loved ones. The ceremony proceeded at 10:30 P.M. that night, and Curtis offered these beautiful words over the phone:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anthony and Emilee, all anyone is promised is this moment. We live and we love in this moment. May the blessings of God rest upon you, may his peace abide with you, may her spirit illuminate your heart now, in this moment. With the power vested in me by the internet, it is my great pleasure to tell you that you are now married people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>With his final wishes granted, Woodle passed away at 11:17 P.M.</p>\n<p>This year has been brutal when it comes to losing loved ones. These kind of touching, bittersweet stories are nice to hear when so many others aren&#8217;t always as fortunate to share such experiences when death comes knocking at their door. David Gordon Green and Jamie Lee Curtis don&#8217;t have to do things like this, but these are the kind of good deeds that shine in a weary world.

Set on the planet Batuu, where Disney&#8217;s theme park expansion Galaxy&#8217;s Edge exists in franchise canon, players get caught up in adventure that sees them taking on dangerous pirates, running into familiar faces, and really feeling like a part of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. Watch the new <em>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#8217;s Edge</em> trailer for a new peek at the VR gameplay.<span id=\"more-646611\"></span></p>\n<h2>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#8217;s Edge Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_qd-wGga7M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In case you missed it, /Film was lucky enough to play <em>Tales from the Galaxy&#8217;s Edge</em> before its release today, and we have an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extensive review of the gameplay and experience</a>. Though VR is still in the nascent stages of figuring out its full potential, this is an entertaining way to immerse yourself in <em>Star Wars</em>, even if it&#8217;s a rather simple game with a short story. Unlike the previous <em>Star Wars</em> VR game, <em>Vader Immortal</em>, this is more of a swashbuckling smuggler adventure with lots of laser blasting.</p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re craving more Jedi action, half of this trailer focuses on the extra Jedi adventure that you can go on in addition to the primary game. Created in conjunction with the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/star-wars-the-high-republic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">High Republic publishing initiative</a> that launches in January 2021, it&#8217;s essentially a short story that puts you in the shoes of a Jedi Padawan who has to confront the dark side taking over a Jedi Temple.

You assume the role of a droid repair technician operating near the planet, but when a group of Guavian Death Gang pirates attack you’ll be forced to jettison the ship’s mysterious cargo and head for the escape pods. After crashing on the planet, you’ll encounter never-before-seen areas of Batuu and discover that anyone can become a hero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#8217;s Edge</em> is available now <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3484270071659289/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Oculus devices for $24.99</a>, and a second adventure is already in the works for 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-trailer-shows-off-the-vr-video-game-available-today/\">&#8216;Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy&#8217;s Edge&#8217; Trailer Shows Off the VR Video Game Available Today</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rYxY-SRrSqQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:30:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-talesfromgalaxysedge-blaster-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"d0b7b130251f9910f55083fc6e2f3704","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-46-374_1beedfc875c52122.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":53762,"destBytes":38502,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-talesfromgalaxysedge-blaster-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn18@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-46-374_1beedfc875c52122.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-17-393_f0d7269636862655.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYxY-SRrSqQ:enajUJsiVXA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn40@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-18-498_b36b0ade283e9ec9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rYxY-SRrSqQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn2@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-18-444_db44ade4e04d541d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘Giving Voice’ Trailer: Viola Davis, Denzel Washington Pass on August Wilson’s Legacy to Students in Netflix Documentary","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646610","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646617\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-700x320.jpg\" alt=\"giving voice trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-700x320.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;August was that one writer who saw me.

And Davis, who won an Oscar for her performance in the feature adaptation of <em>Fences</em> and is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ma-raineys-black-bottom-early-buzz/\">earning buzz for her turn</a> in the upcoming Netflix adaptation of <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em>, is now using her platform to make sure that Wilson&#8217;s legacy lives on in young Black students across the country, who are at the center of this documentary.

Stern and Fernando Villena, <em>Giving Voice</em> had its world premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Sundance Favorite Award, earning it Netflix&#8217;s attention and money. The streamer acquired the documentary, which pairs nicely with its upcoming release of the highly anticipated <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em>, a feature adaptation of Wilson&#8217;s play directed by George C. Wolfe and starring Davis as well as <strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong> in his final feature role.</p>\n<p>The documentary is a rousing tribute to Wilson through the lens of a yearly August Wilson monologue competition, in which thousands of high school students enter for the chance to perform on Broadway — a connection which Davis cherishes, having gotten her breakthrough on the Great White Way in the 2001 Broadway production of Wilson&#8217;s <em>King Hedley II</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Giving Voice</em> features the song &#8220;Never Break&#8221; from John Legend, and is produced by James D. Stern, Karen Bove, Fernando Villena, Schoen Smith, and Craig Piligian. Its executive producers include Davis, Julius Tennon, John Legend, Mike Jackson, Ty Stiklorius Dan Cogan, Jenny Raskin, Geralyn White Dreyfous, Gretchen Stockdale, Nicholas Caprio, and Constanza Romero.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Giving Voice</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A new generation of performers is discovered in “Giving Voice,” which follows the emotional journey of six students as they advance through the high-stakes August Wilson Monologue Competition, an event which celebrates one of America’s preeminent playwrights. Every year, thousands of students from twelve cities across the United States perform the Pulitzer Prize winner’s work (&#8220;Fences,&#8221; &#8220;Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”) for a shot to perform on Broadway. Directors Jim Stern and Fernando Villena capture students discovering themselves and the world around them through Wilson’s “Century Cycle,” a canon of ten plays portraying the 20th century African American experience. Executive producer Viola Davis, along with “Fences” co-star Denzel Washington, share the impact that Wilson’s timeless artistry and legacy has had on their careers and their hopes for the young people carrying it forward. Giving Voice is an Endgame Entertainment and Pilgrim Media Group Production in association with Endeavor Content, Impact Partners, Get Lifted Film Co and JuVee Productions.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Giving Voice</em> hits Netflix on <strong>December 11, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/giving-voice-trailer/\">&#8216;Giving Voice&#8217; Trailer: Viola Davis, Denzel Washington Pass on August Wilson&#8217;s Legacy to Students in Netflix Documentary</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eRu_kLUy4r0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:30:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-700x320.jpg","linkMd5":"7c84c143ca26836abe9ba3569b685bcd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn27@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-28-374_35e301dfdfdfd14e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":20273,"destBytes":11444,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Giving_Voice_00_08_37_07-e1605807087655-700x320.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn27@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-28-374_35e301dfdfdfd14e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eRu_kLUy4r0:_6tyktt2KYc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-17-689_fbea5b7f82881ad6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eRu_kLUy4r0":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"Watch: Oprah Winfrey Interviews Barack Obama During the Pandemic Using Incredible Green Screen Technology","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646665","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646673 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oprah-Obama-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Oprah Obama\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oprah-Obama.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oprah-Obama-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has ripped through our society, leaving death and disruption in its path. One of the least important changes it has caused is that pretty much every interview now has taken on the same dull, boxy aesthetic because they&#8217;re almost always captured using programs like Zoom.</p>\n<p>Leave it to <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, arguably the most famous interviewer in the world, to liven things up. In a new episode of her AppleTV+ series <em><strong>The Oprah Conversation</strong></em>, Winfrey interviewed former President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> about his new book, his reaction to Joe Biden winning the presidency, and much more, and through the magic of green screen technology, it appears as if they&#8217;re both seated in Oprah&#8217;s home.

I mean, it&#8217;s not exactly up to the level of something like <em>The Mandalorian</em> in terms of pushing the envelope – people like George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez have been doing stuff like this on the big screen for decades – but this is more akin to &#8220;David Fincher in <em>Zodiac</em>&#8221; usage of green screen technology, in which the end result is fairly seamless. Aside from that, on a pure gut level, I still find peeks behind the curtain at things like this to be really entertaining.</p>\n<p>And thank God we&#8217;re not just seeing yet another pair of floating heads trapped in Zoom windows here. I know the pandemic has opened the world&#8217;s eyes to how much work can be accomplished remotely, but I think when this is all over, we&#8217;re all going to want to take a break from the Zoom aesthetic for a good while.</p>\n<p>The full episode premiered a couple of days ago on AppleTV+, and will be accessible to anyone for free (not just subscribers) from now until <strong>December 1</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/oprah-obama-interview/\">Watch: Oprah Winfrey Interviews Barack Obama During the Pandemic Using Incredible Green Screen Technology</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9ux7pyInn3A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 23:00:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oprah-Obama-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"cd9e73ff14549e23266e6f6900b1d785","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-46-350_1fd1c1f5782c3367.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43187,"destBytes":28374,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Oprah-Obama-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-46-350_1fd1c1f5782c3367.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-17-409_de566502709bf964.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9ux7pyInn3A:MzPKn22KXKc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-455_63896f6a41cd502d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9ux7pyInn3A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-528_a5164353a0380bb6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167913},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ Theater Rental Program in the Works, ‘Stargirl’ Finds Jakeem Thunder & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646628","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-646709 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xmen-ultimatexpanse-transformers-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men X-Jet Transformers Figure\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xmen-ultimatexpanse-transformers.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xmen-ultimatexpanse-transformers-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Are you interested in the <strong>Kate Bishop</strong> expansion for <strong><em>Marvel&#8217;s Avengers</em></strong> coming in December?

Anderson</strong>, will now open on Christmas Day. That puts it directly up against <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>, but <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> is <em>also</em> debuting on HBO Max that same day, so Sony might figure this is their chance to corner big theatrical numbers for that day. Of course, all of that hinges on the idea of movie theaters actually being open.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646727\"></span></p>\n<p>Any other year, I might be over the moon at the idea of going to the movies on Christmas Day to watch <em>Monster Hunter</em>. This year, though, is another story. The coronavirus continues to be a very serious problem, and in many places, things are getting worse, not better. As a result, many 2020 movies have been pushed back to 2021 – but Hollywood isn&#8217;t ready to throw in the towel just yet. Which is why Sony is deciding to drop <em>Monster Hunter</em> into theaters on December 25, putting it up against <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>, which will also hit HBO Max the same day.</p>\n<p>At one point, <em>Monster Hunter</em> was supposed to open in September of 2020. Then it got pushed to April 2021. Then, curiously, it got moved back – to December 30, 2020. Now, it&#8217;s arriving in theaters and IMAX on Christmas Day. If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say Warner Bros.&#8217; decision to release <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> on HBO Max is what gave Sony the confidence to move in on that December 25 date. The logic being that even though <em>Wonder Woman</em> will be at the box office, most people will <em>probably</em> watch it at home, while <em>Monster Hunter</em> remains exclusive to theaters. &#8220;You want a big movie you can only see on the big screen?&#8221; Sony is essentially asking. &#8220;Well, here&#8217;s your chance!&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <em>Monster Hunter</em>, &#8220;When an unexpected sandstorm transports Lt. Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and her unit (<strong>TI Harris, Meagan Good, Diego Boneta</strong>) to a new world, the soldiers are shocked to discover that this hostile and unknown environment is home to enormous and terrifying monsters immune to their firepower. In their desperate battle for survival, the unit encounters the mysterious Hunter (Tony Jaa), whose unique skills allow him to stay one step ahead of the powerful creatures. As Artemis and Hunter slowly build trust, she discovers that he is part of a team led by the Admiral (<strong>Ron Perlman</strong>). Facing a danger so great it could threaten to destroy their world, the brave warriors combine their unique abilities to band together for the ultimate showdown.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sony also shuffled around some other release dates – <em>Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway</em>, which was set for January 15, 2021, has now moved to April 2, 2021; and <em>Fatherhood</em> is moving to April 16, 2021 from its original date of April 2, 2021.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/monster-hunter-release-date/\">&#8216;Monster Hunter&#8217; Will Now Hunt Monsters in Theaters on Christmas Day</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/E_UVHBxcKkk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:30:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/monster-hunter-release-date-christmas-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"c11ba316f7e5beb01cab2b6260a86293","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn29@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-58-494_7726b1254408a54c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":28288,"destBytes":16672,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/monster-hunter-release-date-christmas-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn29@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-58-494_7726b1254408a54c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-18-538_ba772d42a1aabff8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=E_UVHBxcKkk:76Z5x-wP7gQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn99@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-17-456_a021888e1ada36df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/E_UVHBxcKkk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-18-279_3cb1f3094f4d504e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘DMZ’ Limited Series, Based on the Comic Book About a Modern-Day Civil War, Ordered by HBO Max","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646639","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646657\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"dmz limited series\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dmz-limited-series.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the American experiment hurdles wildly towards oblivion with each passing day, HBO Max has decided what we all need right now is a limited series about a modern-day civil war. The streaming service has ordered a <strong><em>DMZ</em></strong> limited series, based on the comic series of the same name. The show hails from <strong>Roberto Patino</strong> and <strong>Ava DuVernay</strong> and stars <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong> and <strong>Benjamin Bratt</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646639\"></span></p>\n<p>Back in 2019, when we were all so young and naive, HBO Max <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dmz-tv-series/\">ordered a pilot</a> for <em>DMZ</em>, based on the comic originally created by writer Brian Wood and artist Riccardo Burchielli, with Ava DuVernay at the helm. Now, HBO Max has gone ahead and given the show a limited series order, with Roberto Patino serving as writer and showrunner. Patino and DuVerany also serve as executive producers, with production expected to begin in 2021.</p>\n<p>The story deals with a second American civil war, something that feels less and less like speculative fiction every single day. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the near future, America is embroiled in a bitter civil war, leaving Manhattan a demilitarized zone (DMZ), destroyed and isolated from the rest of the world. Leaping off the pages of the popular comic, “DMZ” chronicles the harrowing journey of fearless and fierce medic Alma Ortega (series star Rosario Dawson), who sets out on a harrowing journey to find the son she lost in the evacuation of New York City at the onset of the conflict. Throwing gasoline on the flames of that conflict is Parco Delgado (series star Benjamin Bratt), the popular — and deadly — leader of one of the most powerful gangs in the DMZ. He wants to rule this new world — and will stop at nothing to secure that outcome. In this adrenalized and expansive drama which examines a stark political and cultural divide in American society, Alma must contend with the gangs, militias, demagogues and warlords that control this lawless no man’s land. In doing so, she becomes the unlikely source of what everyone here has lost…hope.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I couldn’t be more thrilled to bring this epic to the screen with my boundary-pushing partners at WBTV and HBO Max, a sublime cast led by Rosario and Benjamin, and my partner and friend, the inimitable and ever-inspiring Ava DuVernay,&#8221; said Roberto Patino. &#8220;<em>DMZ</em> offers up an explosive playground which, more than anything else, exalts the resilience of community and the human spirit. I can’t wait to welcome the die-hard fans of the comic books and new viewers alike to this intoxicating, haunting and inspiring world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sarah Aubrey, head of original content, HBO Max, added: &#8220;<em>DMZ</em>s&#8217; unflinching story of a country torn apart resonates eerily and profoundly amid our current state of the union. With the powerhouse visionary team of Ava and Roberto at the helm, bringing this critically acclaimed DC gem to life promises to entertain and inspire hope.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to Dawson and Bratt, the series stars Hoon Lee, Freddy Miyares, and Jordan Preston Carter. I haven&#8217;t read the comic, but I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s very good. And the material here certainly sounds like it could make for some compelling TV. But with America currently embroiled in non-stop insanity and hopelessly deadlocked tribalism, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll have the stomach to ever watch this anytime soon.

Initially, it seemed like it was a new, original premise from the director, utilizing as much green screen technology as possible to bring it to life. But earlier this week, we learned the movie <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/we-can-be-heroes-sharkboy-and-lavagirl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">takes place in the same universe</a> as <em>The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D</em>, and both of the superheroes are returning all grown up. But they wont be in action for long.</p>\n<p><em>We Can Be Heroes</em> finds alien invaders kidnapping all of Earth&#8217;s superheroes, leaving their superpowered kids to be protected in a government safe house. But rather than sit by and let their parents suffer at the tentacles of these nasty aliens, these rugrats take matters into their own hands to save their parents and the world. It&#8217;s basically <em>Spy Kids</em> with superheroes, and it all looks quite ridiculous, and you can watch the <em>We Can Be Heroe</em>s trailer below to see for yourself.<span id=\"more-646616\"></span></p>\n<h2>We Can Be Heroes Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmupQ6LJiJY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Along with the return of <strong>Taylor Dooley</strong> and <strong>JJ Dashnaw</strong> stepping into the role of Sharkboy that Taylor Lautner is apparently too good for now, <strong>Pedro Pascal</strong>, <strong>Christian Slater</strong>, <strong>Boyd Holbrook</strong>, and more all play superhero parents. But it&#8217;s <strong><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">Yaya Gosselin</span></strong> who steps up as the young leader of these super powered kids, played by mostly unknown young actors, each with their own unique abilities, which include super elasticity, manipulating time, and seeing the future.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is something that kids will have a great time with. But from a filmmaking perspective, I can&#8217;t help but note how cheap this still looks. Much like the <em>Spy Kids</em> movies and<em> The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</em>, this movie was clearly made with a lot of visual effects that look cheaper than your average blockbuster. Sure, technology has progressed a lot since those movies came out, but when compared to the evolution of other big budget VFX, it just feels like bargain bin movie.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\">When alien invaders kidnap Earth&#8217;s superheroes, their kids are whisked away to a government safe house.

Missy teams up with the rest of the superkids to escape their mysterious government babysitter, Ms. Granada (Priyanka Chopra Jonas). If they&#8217;re going to save their parents, they&#8217;ll have to work together by using their individual powers — from elasticity to time control to predicting the future — and form an out-of-this-world team.<br />\n</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>We Can Be Heroe</em>s arrives on Netflix on <strong>January 1, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/we-can-be-heroes-trailer/\">&#8216;We Can Be Heroes&#8217; Teaser Trailer: Sharkboy and Lava Girl Are All Grown Up and Their Kids Need to Save Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AsawIuBLQtw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 19:30:34 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wecanbeheroes-littlegirl-watershark-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"79072b5028de8ced4b055aa3334a1208","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-31-827_99b0e191d5f31c15.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":53601,"destBytes":40676,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wecanbeheroes-littlegirl-watershark-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-31-827_99b0e191d5f31c15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-18-498_d1cf2c2eb0a76a45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AsawIuBLQtw:0NfKOgYVw6g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AsawIuBLQtw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn97@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-439_a314d8607491f98d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"Lady Gaga Climbs Aboard ‘Bullet Train’, Adding Even More Star Power to the Assassin Thriller","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646725","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646748 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Gaga-Bullet-Train-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga Bullet Train\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Gaga-Bullet-Train.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Gaga-Bullet-Train-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, who won an Oscar for Best Original Song with &#8220;Shallow&#8221; from <em>A Star is Born </em>a couple of years ago, has found her follow-up project.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s the latest performer to hop on board Sony&#8217;s <em><strong>Bullet Train</strong></em>, an assassin thriller that&#8217;s set to be directed by <strong>David Leitch</strong> (<em>Atomic Blonde</em>, <em>Deadpool 2</em>) with <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> in the lead role.<span id=\"more-646725\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/lady-gaga-brad-pitt-movie-bullet-train/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a> reports that Lady Gaga (real name: Stefani Germanotta) has officially signed on to appear in <em>Bullet Train</em>, although there are no details about which role she might be playing. Don&#8217;t expect her to be a huge part of the story, though: Collider&#8217;s source explains that Gaga will be playing &#8220;a smaller supporting role rather than a lead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film is based on Kotaro Isaka&#8217;s Japanese book <em>Maria Beetle</em>, which centers on multiple assassins with conflicting motivations boarding the same bullet train in Tokyo. Pitt is reportedly playing an American hitman named Ladybug, and actors like <strong>Joey King</strong> (<em>The Kissing Booth</em>) and <strong>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</strong> (<em>Kick-Ass</em>) are also playing assassins. <strong>Andrew Koji</strong> (Cinemax&#8217;s <em>Warrior</em>), <strong>Brian Tyree Henry</strong> (<em>Joker</em>, <em>Atlanta</em>, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>), <strong>Zazie Beetz</strong> (<em>Joker</em>, <em>Atlanta</em>, <em>Deadpool 2</em>), and <strong>Masi Oka</strong> (<em>Heroes</em>) are also in the mix somehow, though exact plot specifics remain a bit murky.</p>\n<p>Lady Gaga is the second big name in two days to be added to this film&#8217;s cast.

(Neither of those movies is really all that great, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there.) She&#8217;s also acted in <em>Muppets Most Wanted</em> and had an extended run on the FX horror series <em>American Horror Story</em>, but her most famous big-screen work is unquestionably as rising music star Ally in Bradley Cooper&#8217;s excellent take on <em>A Star is Born</em>, which earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination and a win for Best Original Song. Since 2018, though, she&#8217;s been putting her focus back on her music career.</p>\n<p>Once her work on <em>Bullet Train</em> is completed, she&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gucci-cast/\">expected to eventually star</a> in Ridley Scott&#8217;s upcoming fashion drama <em><strong>Gucci</strong></em> as Patrizia Reggiani, the woman who tried to orchestrate the assassination of her ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, the one-time head of the Gucci fashion house.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lady-gaga-bullet-train/\">Lady Gaga Climbs Aboard &#8216;Bullet Train&#8217;, Adding Even More Star Power to the Assassin Thriller</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Lq5DizSBehI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:22:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Gaga-Bullet-Train-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ca78956086afabfb45641a0d0327ec7d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn26@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-44-535_90c7f57f57430fa3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":26332,"destBytes":15876,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Lady-Gaga-Bullet-Train-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn26@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-44-535_90c7f57f57430fa3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-477_c1d357939b6caa85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Lq5DizSBehI:YE5WSpGQ_Y8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn85@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-455_20b63977b0dfe650.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Lq5DizSBehI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-18-298_85b589042c9382d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167913},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"Taron Egerton’s ‘Tetris’ Movie Lands at Apple","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646615","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646633\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"tetris movie apple\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>After slowly dropping from a great height and rotating in the air a few times, the<strong> <em>Tetris</em></strong> movie has fit snugly into place at Apple. To be clear: this isn&#8217;t a film based on the game itself. Rather, it&#8217;s about the creation of the game and its licensing around the world. <strong>Taron Egerton</strong> is set to star as Henk Rogers, the Dutch video game designer who was the first to secure the rights to distribute <em>Tetris</em> on consoles.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646615\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop on the <em>Tetris</em> movie heading to Apple. <strong>Jon S. Baird</strong> is directing the movie, which is based on the true story of Henk Rogers, who is known for &#8220;securing the rights to distribute Tetris on video game consoles where the game found popularity, and as the founder of Bullet-Proof Software (now called Blue Planet Software) and The Tetris Company, which licenses the Tetris trademark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Henk&#8217;s story was covered in the 2016 book <em>The Tetris Effect: The Cold War Battle for the World&#8217;s Most Addictive Game</em>. Here&#8217;s a synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>21 February 1989. Three men fly into Moscow, representing software giants from Britain, America, and Japan. Each of them is determined to undercut the others in order to secure a technology so powerfully addictive it has brought the government department that created it to a standstill. In a country on the brink of seismic change, where spycraft is about to give way to cut-throat capitalism, Tetris has become the grand prize. Featuring corporate espionage, unmarked government organizations, courtroom drama and international conspiracies, the origin of the world’s most popular video game is a gripping, fast-paced thriller of the highest order.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This video goes into even more detail.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fQtxKmgJC8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, there were plans to make a big sci-fi movie trilogy based on the <em>Tetris</em> games, but I have to say I&#8217;m much more excited for this behind-the-scenes story instead. It sounds a lot more interesting than a CGI-filled spectacle. Deadline adds that they&#8217;re still trying to round out the cast of the film, looking for actors to play &#8220;Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov, who first created the game, and the businessmen Robert and Kevin Maxwel.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Matthew Vaughn</strong>&#8216;s Marv Films is producing and financing the project, while<strong> Noah Pink</strong> penned the screenplay. This is yet another high-profile title for Apple, who also have Martin Scorsese&#8217;s <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, Antoine Fuqua‘s Emancipation, and more on the horizon. When Apple TV+ first launched it felt like a missed opportunity – none of their original shows seemed buzzworthy. But since then they&#8217;ve been building up a solid list of upcoming movie titles to look out for.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tetris-movie-apple/\">Taron Egerton&#8217;s &#8216;Tetris&#8217; Movie Lands at Apple</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lr33l4Th-eo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 21:00:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"36119238acb8ee077274a03b10b46905","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-28-430_3e17fb27b3070e41.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":53477,"destBytes":37372,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tetris-movie-apple-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-28-430_3e17fb27b3070e41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn71@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-594_6284d3453254bded.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lr33l4Th-eo:OvJU9_Y2BpU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-722_27cc9411901364fd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lr33l4Th-eo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn79@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-18-232_98cacacf7673aa36.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167913},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"The Quarantine Stream: The New ‘Supermarket Sweep’ is the Perfect Pandemic Relief","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646548","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-646549 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/supermarketsweep-lesliejones-produce-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Supermarket Sweep\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/supermarketsweep-lesliejones-produce.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/supermarketsweep-lesliejones-produce-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Series</strong>: <em><span class=\"aCOpRe\">Supermarket Sweep </span></em><span class=\"aCOpRe\">(2020)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It</strong>: Hulu</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch</strong>: Leslie Jones hosts the revival of this classic game show that first started in the 1960s, returned in the mid-1990s, and came back one more time in the early 2000s. Three teams of two ultimate shoppers compete in a variety of brand name trivia and puzzles before racing around a perfectly polished and organized grocery store for the most fast-paced shopping spree you&#8217;ve ever seen. The grand prize? A whopping $100,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: Look, things are getting bad out there. We just hit over 250,000 deaths because of the coronavirus pandemic, North Dakota has the worst COVID-19 death rate in the entire world, and coronavirus numbers are on the rise all across the United States. It&#8217;s only going to get worse as people ignore warnings in favor of gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas. But if you&#8217;re smart, you&#8217;ll find a way to distract yourself and stay at home as much as you can, and the new <em>Supermarket Sweep</em> is the perfect way to do that, especially if you&#8217;re only having your groceries delivered to your house at this point. Live vicariously through the grocery game show!<span id=\"more-646548\"></span></p>\n<p>Normally, <em>Supermarket Sweep</em> would be the kind of thing you put on while the grandparents are around because they find <em>Elf</em> to be just a little too much, but honestly, this show is such a blast that I will watch it by myself and have a grand ole time testing my knowledge of brand names and groceries like a good little consumer. I don&#8217;t want to brag, but this is a game show where I&#8217;m finding myself dominating the trivia section, and I might just have to see if I can get on the show as a contestant (<a href=\"https://supermarketsweep.castingcrane.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which you can do right here</a>). I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d fare at the physical shopping side of the competition, but I&#8217;d be more than happy to try.</p>\n<p>Leslie Jones is a fantastic host for the show. Her boisterous enthusiasm gets everyone excited, and she makes the contestants loosen up and have a great time. Her commentary during the fast-paced shopping spree is top notch, and it reminds me of the <a href=\"https://gameshows.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon_Super_Toy_Run\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nickelodeon Super Toy Run</a>. Is that still a thing? Probably not. I always wanted to do that too. But I digress.</p>\n<p><em>Supermarket Sweep</em> is the kind of show where you might find yourself shouting at the contestants as they dawdle in the aisles when they should be shoveling meats into their carts. Stop wasting your time with the appliances! They&#8217;re too big and they&#8217;re not as expensive as you think! Why aren&#8217;t you going for the over-the-counter medications, protein shakes or beauty products?! They&#8217;re small and expensive! These are the things I sometimes shout out loud while watching the show, and I&#8217;m not ashamed to say it.</p>\n<p>Now is the time for junk food television, and if you&#8217;ve run out of episodes of the 1990s version of <em>Supermarket Sweep</em> (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-help-ive-started-watching-supermarket-sweep-and-i-cant-stop-please-kill-me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which our own Jacob Hall got caught up in</a> earlier this year), then shift over to Hulu and keep up with this new version of the show. If you want to start with a bang, I&#8217;d like to recommend kicking it off with the fourth episode, which features two hilarious drag queens as contestants, and not only are they lively, but they&#8217;re damn good at the competition too. Trust me, you won&#8217;t be disappointed in this show, though you may end up being disappointed in yourself.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-the-new-supermarket-sweep/\">The Quarantine Stream: The New &#8216;Supermarket Sweep&#8217; is the Perfect Pandemic Relief</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/j9fw5LTBe7g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:00:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/supermarketsweep-lesliejones-produce-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"0f2f0f23fd971f3a63ba0e0a169da0c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-42-494_907e506ad2ca2754.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":74522,"destBytes":60296,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/supermarketsweep-lesliejones-produce-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn33@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-42-494_907e506ad2ca2754.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn39@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-17-425_f790e6867089d6f8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j9fw5LTBe7g:d8QRaBr2dVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn1@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-17-465_eb870fea275bcdf9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/j9fw5LTBe7g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn67@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-17-372_7a46e58498f6ea3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167913},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘Hitman’ Filmmaker Xavier Gens Explains Why He Turned Down a Marvel Movie","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646670","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646674\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-700x343.jpg\" alt=\"xavier gens marvel\" width=\"700\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-700x343.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-360x176.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-768x376.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Marvel Studios</strong> has no shortage of directors who would gladly work for them — and vice versa, as there&#8217;s no shortage of directors who would quickly turn them down. Directing a Marvel movie might offer a great boost for many filmmakers, but <em>Hitman</em> director <strong>Xavier Gens</strong> doesn&#8217;t want to be one of them. The French director behind genre films like <em>Frontier(s)</em> and Gareth Evans&#8217; currently-airing crime series <em>Gangs of London</em> revealed that he was in discussions with Marvel to direct a project, but turned down the studio after he realized he &#8220;would be there to take care of only the direction of the actors.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646670\"></span></p>\n<p>In an interview with  French outlet, <a href=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/pop-culture/xavier-gens-gangs-of-london-c-est-l-anti-marvel-16-11-2020-2401219_2920.php#\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Le Point (opens in a new tab)\">Le Point</a> (via <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/xavier-gens-marvel-studios-directing-20201118/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">The Playlist</a>), Gens revealed that he was in brief discussions with Marvel Studios about an unnamed project. But he was quick to turn it down, after realizing that he wouldn&#8217;t have complete creative control over the entire filmmaking process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was in discussion [with Marvel], but I understood that the previews of the digital effects and action scenes were done by a box in London, and that I would be there to take care of only the direction of the actors. It is not very interesting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gens clarified with The Playlist that he was in &#8220;discussion with different studios,&#8221; one of them being Marvel. He expanded that &#8220;the previews of the digital effects and action scenes are done by VFX companies like the Third Floor in London, and that I would be there to take care of only the direction of the actors.&#8221; This would not do for Gens, who wanted full directorial control over the entire process of the film. He added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As director living in Europe, we are in charge of the entire process of the film. This is, I believe, why most of the European directors decline U.S. studio movies. Because at one point, on these productions, you are reduced to just directing fields/reverse fields on actors in front of a green background. In Europe, we are responsible for the film from the beginning to the end.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gens is not the only director, European or otherwise, to decline Marvel. Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel turned down <em>Black Widow</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-director-lucrecia-martel-marvel-action-scenes/\">for the same reasons</a> that Gens gives, and Edgar Wright famously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/edgar-wright-wont-watch-ant-man/\">walked away from <em>Ant-Man</em></a> well into pre-production. Gens speculates that this divided way of filmmaking — between the directors, the second-unit directors, the VFX artists — is partially what led Wright to leave <em>Ant-Man</em>. &#8220;This is, I believe, why Edgar Wright declined ‘Ant-Man,’ because at one point, on these productions, you are reduced to just directing fields/reverse fields on actors in front of a green background,&#8221; Gens said.</p>\n<p>He continued, &#8220;Directing a Marvel film can make a great calling card, but I’m not even sure that the names of the directors of Captain Marvel are remembered today… I have already had a catastrophic experience with a studio, Hitman, and I don’t want to do it again, especially at 45&#8230; Besides, I refuse all American orders.”</p>\n<p>Aside from hilariously saying he &#8220;refuses all American orders,&#8221; Gens is probably right to be suspicious of working in Hollywood again after his 2007 adaptation of the <em>Hitman</em> video game franchise was a massive box office bomb and critical failure. And, while Marvel can afford rising filmmakers a nice platform, Gens kind of has a point: Marvel&#8217;s formulaic approach can prevent its films from forming a real identity, leading them to start to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-movies-look-ugly/\">bleed together in their sameness</a>. Though with directors like Taika Waititi and James Gunn ensuring that their own personal stamps remain on their films, that might be changing.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/xavier-gens-marvel-reject/\">&#8216;Hitman&#8217; Filmmaker Xavier Gens Explains Why He Turned Down a Marvel Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ppx3yi_iBnY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:00:13 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-700x343.jpg","linkMd5":"d984ced9ba1dd80504bd75b823103a76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-39-42-814_74aae64fc74b9a67.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":343,"sourceBytes":34613,"destBytes":20716,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/xavier-gens-e1605814740748-700x343.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-39-42-814_74aae64fc74b9a67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-40-17-533_5cab49527919de2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ppx3yi_iBnY:45917l12_-s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-18-497_327226c97a76ee7a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ppx3yi_iBnY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-18-376_13d8527d30a712ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘The Christmas Chronicles 2’ is Playing In Cinemark Theaters For One Week","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646697","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646724\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"christmas chronicles 2 theatrical release\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Happy Holidays!

Many theaters remain closed, and as the coronavirus numbers continue to spike, it seems unlikely they&#8217;ll be reopening anytime soon. Further complicating things is the big news that Warner Bros. is completely obliterating the theatrical-to-streaming window by <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max-release/\">releasing</a> <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> on HBO Max on Christmas Day, the same exact day it&#8217;ll open in select theaters. Once upon a time, that window was roughly three months. That changed this year with the coronavirus and the streaming release of <em>Trolls: World Tour</em>.</p>\n<p>And Warner Bros. isn&#8217;t the only studio shrugging off that theatrical-to-streaming window. Now it looks like Netflix is doing the same, albeit not on such an extreme level, with <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em>. Per Deadline, the Kurt Russell sequel will play in select Cinemark theaters for a week before it hits Netflix on <strong>November 25</strong>. AKA: now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In light of the current operating environment, we are making near-term booking decisions on a film-by-film basis. We are pleased to collaborate with Netflix on this limited three-market test and show <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em> in select Cinemark theatres,&#8221; a Cinemark rep said. Those three markets include Dallas and San Francisco. Whether or not people are going to venture to a movie theater to watch something they can watch from the safety of their own homes in a few days is another story. Especially when that movie is <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2.</em></p>\n<p>In <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em>, &#8220;It’s been two years since siblings Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis) saved Christmas, and a lot has changed. Kate, now a cynical teenager, is reluctantly spending Christmas in Cancun with her mom’s new boyfriend and his son Jack (Jahzir Bruno). Unwilling to accept this new version of her family, Kate decides to run away. But when a mysterious, magical troublemaker named Belsnickel threatens to destroy the North Pole and end Christmas for good, Kate and Jack are unexpectedly pulled into a new adventure with Santa Claus (Kurt Russell).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release/\">&#8216;The Christmas Chronicles 2&#8217; is Playing In Cinemark Theaters For One Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OqLK82xSzW8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 01:00:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"a0017ebd591d4912ec87300b60ef8e4a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn42@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-44-934_4526b3fc394277d0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":71052,"destBytes":56190,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christmas-chronicles-2-theatrical-release-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn42@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-44-934_4526b3fc394277d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn35@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-18-405_15b7f91b1342206f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OqLK82xSzW8:4R2AJIqCjnU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn47@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-40-17-451_c8aee28e353c4995.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OqLK82xSzW8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-340_ca5b68b02ca2abac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘The Underground Railroad’ Teaser: Speak Upon the Ashes","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646664","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646694\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the underground railroad teaser new\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-underground-railroad-teaser-new.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Barry Jenkins</strong> has unveiled another <strong><em>The </em><em>Underground Railroad</em></strong> teaser, and like the two teasers released before this, it&#8217;s gorgeous, haunting, and affirms that this is going to be the very definition of must-see TV. The series is set in an alternate history where the Underground Railroad was a real, physical secret railroad, with actual tracks and tunnels tucked away underground. Watch the latest teaser, subtitled <em>Speak Upon the Ashes</em>, below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646664\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Underground Railroad Teaser </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/481277944?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Underground Railroad - &#38;quot;Speak upon the ashes.&#38;quot;\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Man oh man do these <em>Underground Railroad</em> teasers do a great job. So far none of them have been heavy on plot, or even specific details. They&#8217;re mostly mood pieces, featuring various cast members of the show gazing into a camera that pushes in on them, all scored to <strong>Nicholas Britell</strong>&#8216;s gorgeous music. Sometimes, vagueness like this can be maddening. But here, it works, and it works well. It&#8217;s impossible not to become entranced by the footage here – it&#8217;s beautiful and haunting, and makes you want more. For reference, here are the previous two teasers.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/470453067?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Underground Railroad &#38;quot;Randall.

Truth, a Black woman who escaped slavery and became an abolitionist, was set to deliver a speech at a townhouse in 1861 in Angola, Indiana. When whites threatened to burn the townhouse down rather than let her speak there, Truth said, &#8220;Then I will speak upon the ashes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <em>The Underground Railroad</em>, &#8220;Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And in the universe this show exists in, the Underground Railroad is &#8220;no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a network of tracks and tunnels constructed in secret beneath the very Southern soil upon which they’ve been enslaved. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, a relentless slave catcher of mythic origin, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state-by-state, seeking true freedom in a heroine’s journey carved through the soil and soul of America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The series is based on Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, and comes from Barry Jenkins, who directed all 10 episodes.

But for those who skipped that theatrical reboot, they may recall a series of mystery movies from 1963 through 1993 that largely starred <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> actor Peter Sellers as the bumbling protagonist, a clueless Chief Inspector named Jacques Clouseau.</p>\n<p>Now, after more than a decade after Steve Martin&#8217;s 2009 sequel<em> Pink Panther 2</em> nearly killed the series for good, the Pink Panther franchise is set to continue again in a brand new movie from MGM. <strong>Jeff Fowler</strong>, who directed this year&#8217;s <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> film, is set to direct. Get more details below.<span id=\"more-646631\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-pink-panther-movie-in-the-works-with-sonic-the-hedgehog-director-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> brings the unexpected news that a new Pink Panther movie is in the works with Fowler on board to direct and <em>Bad Boys for Life</em> co-writer <strong>Chris Bremner</strong> tackling the screenplay.</p>\n<p>I remember watching the <em>Pink Panther</em> cartoon series when I was a kid and not learning until years later that the animated creature actually originated in the credits of the 1963 movie directed by Blake Edwards. Along with Henry Mancini&#8217;s iconic jazz score, that animated character became one of the standout elements of the film franchise, despite essentially serving as a mascot which only appeared during the credits.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0YI9c3jc90?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The movies were all live-action features centering on Clouseau, an idiotic detective who was tasked with solving various mysteries, including one about the theft of a pink diamond nicknamed the &#8220;pink panther.&#8221; The animated character never appeared in the main narrative, but that&#8217;s going to change with this new installment.</p>\n<p>THR says &#8220;the story will focus on a smooth operating inspector who, thanks to a traumatic event, now has a pink panther for an imaginary friend. The latter, although he doesn&#8217;t speak, does help solve the case.&#8221; Fowler, of course, has experience combining live-action and animated characters on screen, but as we all saw with the two Steve Martin-fronted films and with the Johnny Depp movie <em>Mortdecai</em>, this type of over-the-top comedy is tough to pull off for modern audiences, so Fowler has an uphill battle ahead of him.</p>\n<p><strong>Walter Mirisch</strong>, who executive produced the original 1963 movie, will serve as an executive producer here, while his son <strong>Lawrence Mirisch</strong> will produce alongside the great <strong>Julie Andrews</strong>, who was married to the late Blake Edwards, who directed most of the entries in this franchise. <strong>Dan Lin</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Eirich</strong>, who produced Disney&#8217;s live-action <em>Aladdin</em> remake, will also serve as producers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-pink-panther-movie-jeff-fowler/\">New &#8216;Pink Panther&#8217; Movie to Combine Live-Action and Animation, Will Be Directed By &#8216;Sonic the Hedgehog&#8217; Filmmaker</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/l6mDUGno2qU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 20:00:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Pink-Panther-movie-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"339e4e46945776af58d1a7cdacafe717","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn7@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-15-176_75fd76efd57968a5.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31942,"destBytes":21122,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Pink-Panther-movie-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn7@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-15-176_75fd76efd57968a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn90@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-719_b43c2bb0146818f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=l6mDUGno2qU:JNpBVAsk9-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-17-442_54df8e4aa0ceb6d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/l6mDUGno2qU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn47@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-40-18-446_f14f16a8c9704445.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"Awkwafina Joins Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris in Apple TV+ Drama Film ‘Swan Song’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646597","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646600\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/awkwafina-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"swan song cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/awkwafina-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/awkwafina-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/awkwafina-768x320.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/awkwafina.jpg 888w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Awkwafina</strong> is one of Hollywood&#8217;s brightest rising stars, capping off a stellar two years in both blockbusters and indie dramas with a Golden Globe win for her tremendous performance in 2019&#8217;s <em>The Farewell</em> – becoming the first woman of Asian descent to win the award. And it&#8217;s only looking brighter for her, as she is set to appear in a Marvel movie, a Disney movie, and now, an intriguing new movie for Apple TV+ that reunites <em>Moonlight</em> stars <strong>Mahershala Ali</strong> and <strong>Naomie Harris</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646597\"></span></p>\n<p>Awkwafina is set to join the cast of <strong><em>Swan Song</em></strong>, a genre-bending romantic drama set in the near-future to be directed by up-and-coming filmmaker <strong>Benjamin Cleary</strong>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/awkwafina-mahershala-ali-naomie-harris-swan-song-1234835106/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports. Cleary won the Oscar in the live-action short category in 2016 for <em>Stutterer</em> and makes his feature directorial debut with <em>Swan Song</em>, described as &#8220;a genre-bending drama set in the near future that explores how far someone will go, and how much they’ll sacrifice, to make a happier life for the people they love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awkwafina is set to play Kate, the &#8220;close friend and confidant&#8221; of Ali&#8217;s character Cameron, while Harris is playing Poppy, Cameron’s wife and true soulmate.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty impressive collection of talent in the cast for <em>Swan Song</em>: a two-time Oscar winner, an Oscar nominee, and a Golden Globe winner (and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2020-oscar-snubs-and-surprises/\">should&#8217;ve been Oscar nominee</a>). It reunites Ali and Harris after they both earned acclaim (and the aforementioned Oscar wins and nods) for their performances in Barry Jenkins&#8217; 2016 film <em>Moonlight</em>, and it brings Awkwafina into the fold as the actress is enjoying the most buzz of her career yet: stealing the scene in tentpoles like <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em>, starring in her own TV series for Comedy Central, <em>Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens</em>, and set to gain an even higher profile in Marvel and Disney projects like <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> and <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>. The only thing missing from her slate is a prestige drama, and on the heels of the acclaim she won for <em>The Farewell</em>, <em>Swan Song</em> seems like a great next step. From the very brief description, it sounds like a high-concept sci-fi drama in the vein of Spike Jonze&#8217;s <em>Her</em> that could make quite an impact, if done right.</p>\n<p>Cleary writes and directs <em>Swan Song</em>, which is produced by Apple Studios, Anonymous Content and Concordia Studio. Adam Shulman and Jacob Perlin will produce the film on behalf of Anonymous Content. Jonathan King will produce on behalf of Concordia Studio.

Basically — in a very <em>anime</em> twist on things — an experimental drug causes Gren to grow breasts. Despite the strangeness of Gren&#8217;s origins, the character would become informally recognized as an LGBTQ icon in anime. And the Netflix live-action series is taking it one step further: officially making the live-action Gren a nonbinary character.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646630\"></span></p>\n<p>Netflix revealed that nonbinary actor <strong>Mason Alexander Park</strong>, who starred in the National Broadway Tour of <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em>, has been cast as Gren in the <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> live-action series, and will officially play Gren as a nonbinary character who uses they/them pronouns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Revolutionary as the original anime was, the vocabulary we have today for LGBTQ+ people didn&#8217;t quite exist when it aired,&#8221; reads a tweet from Netflix. &#8220;For the upcoming live action adaptation, the character is being reimagined as nonbinary with a nonbinary actor.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Introducing Cowboy Bebop&#39;s Gren <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MasonAPark?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MasonAPark</a> ?

Park&#8217;s portrayal of the character runs the front of the house for Ana&#8217;s jazz club, and describes their version as &#8220;capable with their wit as a glock, as confident in a dress as a suit, they are a Bowie-esque embodiment of 22nd century handsome and seductive beauty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a nice update from Netflix on the anime, which is a medium that always played fast and loose with gender identity and sexuality anyways. (I can think of at least two animes where male characters are frequently turned into women, and vice versa — though usually for comedic effect.) But labeling Gren and cementing their LGBTQ status is a sensitive way of updating a character that existed in a kind of grey area until now.</p>\n<p>In the above video, Park calls Gren their favorite character from the anime and &#8220;a sexy nonbinary icon.&#8221; &#8220;Being a nonbinary actor who is given the opportunity to breathe new life into an existing nonbinary character has been the thrill of a lifetime,&#8221; they said in a video. &#8220;It&#8217;s remarkably meaningful to me because I didn&#8217;t grow up with a lot of gender-variant representation in the media. There weren&#8217;t a lot of other characters that spoke to my experience with gender or my experience with queerness, and representation matters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also joining the cast of <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>are Tamara Tunie as Ana, the &#8220;cool and intense&#8221; owner of &#8220;the hottest underground bluesy jazz club on Mars&#8221;; Geoff Stults (<em>Little Fires Everywhere</em>) as Chalmers, Jet Black&#8217;s (Mustafa Shakir) former co-detective in the ISSP&#8217;s Homicide Division; Rachel House (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>) as Mao, the Capo of the Syndicate&#8217;s White Tigers family; and Ann Truong (<em>Strikeback!</em>) and Hoa Xuande (<em>Top of the Lake</em>) as Shin &#38; Lin, the twin Syndicate henchmen of hitman Vicious (Alex Hassell).</p>\n<p><em>Cowboy Bebop</em> recently <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lord-of-the-rings-series-filming-resumes-cowboy-bebop/\">restarted production</a> after star <strong>John Cho</strong>, who plays the ultra-cool bounty hunter Spike Siegel, sustained a knee injury.

Coming to the streaming service in December is <em><strong>Godmothered</strong></em>, a new fantasy comedy in the same vein as Enchanted that finds <strong>Jillian Bell</strong> as a fairy godmother-in-training who sets out to prove that people still need fairy godmothers to make their dreams come true. But she has her work cut out for her when a lost letter from a 10-year-old girl in distress leads her to a 40-year old single mother (<strong>Isla Fisher</strong>) living a bit of an unfulfilling life. See how it plays out in the first <em>Godmothered</em> trailer below.<span id=\"more-646584\"></span></p>\n<h2>Godmothered Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYWzEqX-J-4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Feeling like a mix of <em>Elf</em> and <em>Enchanted</em>, there are some genuinely great laughs here, all coming from mixing the fantasy world with the real world. Jillian Bell is pitch perfect casting for a role like this, bringing the right amount of whimsy and comedy. Plus, it&#8217;s nice to see Isla Fisher finally working her charms in what appears to be an actually good movie.</p>\n<p><em>Godmothered</em> is set at Christmastime, so Disney+ is clearly trying to capitalize on the need for an uplifting holiday movie. Honestly, I&#8217;m surprised this one wasn&#8217;t slated to be released in theaters, though even if it was, it probably would have been relegated to Disney+ this year anyway, so it all worked out.</p>\n<p>Directed by <strong>Sharon Maguire</strong> (<em>Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary</em>), the film also stars <strong>Santiago Cabrera</strong>,<strong> Mary Elizabeth Ellis</strong>, <strong>Jane Curtin</strong>, <strong>June Squibb</strong>, <strong>Jillian Shea Spaeder</strong>, <strong>Willa Skye</strong>, <strong>Artemis Pebdani</strong>, <strong>Utkarsh Ambudkar</strong> and <strong>Stephnie Weir</strong>. The film is produced by <strong>Justin Springer</strong> (<em>Dumbo</em>) with <strong>Diane L. Sabatini</strong> (<em>Lady and the Tramp</em>), <strong>Tom Pollock</strong> (<em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>), <strong>Ivan Reitman</strong> (<em>Ghostbusters</em>) and <strong>Amie Karp</strong> (<em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>) serving as executive producers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set at Christmas time, “Godmothered” is a comedy about Eleanor, a young, inexperienced fairy godmother-in-training (Jillian Bell) who upon hearing that her chosen profession is facing extinction, decides to show the world that people still need fairy godmothers. Finding a mislaid letter from a 10-year-old girl in distress, Eleanor tracks her down and discovers that the girl, Mackenzie, is now a 40-year-old single mom (Isla Fisher) working at a news station in Boston. Having lost her husband several years earlier, Mackenzie has all but given up on the idea of “Happily Ever After,” but Eleanor is bound and determined to give Mackenzie a happiness makeover, whether she likes it or not.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Godmothered</em> hits Disney+ on <strong>December 4, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/godmothered-trailer/\">&#8216;Godmothered&#8217; Trailer: Jillian Bell is a Fairy Godmother-in-Training in the New Disney+ Original Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xvP3HkiKSbg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:30:34 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-jillianbell-magic-700x313.jpg","linkMd5":"30d22ad964eb791cca34e0bb950d3de8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-47-008_656df74cac931d8c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":313,"sourceBytes":21856,"destBytes":11572,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-jillianbell-magic-700x313.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-47-008_656df74cac931d8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-17-943_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn51@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-40-18-397_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xvP3HkiKSbg:EJ-lXsdvDfQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-17-574_f85610eb6a40e61e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xvP3HkiKSbg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-40-17-463_fcb3507c217e6572.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847167914},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:27","title":"‘Run’ Filmmakers on Their Cinematic Influences, the Film’s ‘Mission: Impossible’ Moment, and More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646084","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646270 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Run-interview-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Run interview\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Run-interview.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Run-interview-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Mission: Impossible</em> is <em>Searching</em> director<strong> Aneesh Chaganty</strong>&#8216;s favorite film franchise, so it&#8217;s not a surprise that he uses imagery from that movie to describe the centerpiece action sequence in his newest thriller, <em><strong>Run</strong></em>.

You’ve spoken previously about how she used to take you and your brother out of school so you could be first in line to see a new movie, so it sounds like you have a great relationship with her. But <i>Run</i> is about a young person rebelling against her overbearing mother. Were you consciously or subconsciously working through any of your own feelings in this story?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: No, but there’s a lot of my mom in the movie. Some of the behaviors and the things around the house, tiny little behaviors, the plants – there are a lot of tiny things that have been borrowed from her, but not the central problem that [Sarah Paulson’s character] Diane is facing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Me and my mom have a great relationship. During the press for <i>Searching</i>, we were traveling all the time and I got very sick. It was a stomach sickness, and this doctor told me to go on a very specific diet for four months. It was right when I started moving to Canada to shoot Run. I didn’t have the time to cook anything, so she flew out for all of prep and production for three and a half months and cooked every meal and every snack that I ate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Wow!</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: I never had catering on the set of this movie. It was all meals that my mom was giving me just to stay on this diet. Now I’m better, but it was because of that. So we’ve got a very good relationship, and I was happy to be able to trade that food for an insight into making movies, because she’s so into movies and stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: She became everyone’s favorite person on set, and everyone can attest, she is nothing like Diane.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Natalie, what was the toughest challenge that arose for you as a producer on this project?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: Oh man, I think the biggest thing was, we ended up going to Winnipeg in Canada. The schedule kept shifting, and we ended up there in the winter. This is a movie that takes place in the spring, technically. So the biggest thing was trying to adjust for the weather constantly. I remember on day 3 we had an exterior, and it started snowing. We were going back to that location for a couple more days, and [all three days had different weather forecast for them]. So at the beginning of the shoot, it was like, “Are we going to add snow to the movie? Are we going to take it out?” We didn’t even know which way to go because we couldn’t predict. That was one of the hardest things: creatively trying to pull off the look that Aneesh and [producer and co-writer] <b>Sev</b> [<b>Ohanian</b>] had written and had in mind, but not being able to even predict what the challenge was going to be on a given day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Did you guys end up using visual effects to get rid of some of that stuff in the final cut?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: We did. We mostly ended up getting rid of snow, but there was a fun moment where the VFX budget started as adding greenery to make it look like a springtime movie, but once the snow really hit in Winnipeg, that VFX budget quickly became, “OK, snow removal.” It totally shifted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I know you and Sev watched a ton of movies before <i>Searching</i> to get inspired in terms of tone but also studied why certain types of storytelling beats worked really well in certain contexts. What movies did you study for inspiration when you were developing <i>Run</i>, and what specific types of things were you on the lookout for this time?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: Totally. I think there are a lot of very clear inspirations for this movie, and we took them all from there. The top five are <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Rear Window</i>, <i>Misery</i>, <i>10 Cloverfield Lane</i>, and <i>What Happened to Baby Jane?</i> became one over the course of time and me even discovering this film while we were writing and after it, but as far as the main writing inspirations, it was those four. From a director’s standpoint, for visual inspirations, you can add in <i>Unbreakable</i> and <i>Signs</i> and <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i>. Those all inspired this film heavily.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>When <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/searching-aneesh-chaganty-interview/\">we spoke for <i>Searching</i></a>, you talked about how the test screening process was incredibly helpful and really let you guys shape that movie into its best form. Did you take that same approach and lean on test screenings in a big way for <i>Run</i>?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: We did. This is my first real live-action movie. This is the first movie we’ve made with a studio from the beginning of the film. <i>Searching</i> was made very isolated and by ourselves. So on Searching, we were able to look at our test feedback and completely have autonomy to do what we wanted based on the test feedback. Now, with a studio involved, you’re involving a whole other entity. Now you have two sets of people who are looking at the same thing. One group wants this thing, and the other group wants another thing. You’re trying to navigate, and at the end of the day, the studio’s the one that financed the film. I would say for the most part, we entirely involved feedback, but the ability to execute what we learned from the feedback was the area that was a little more contested this time than last time. That’s my very smiley way of answering that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: Yeah. I will say we did bring back a ton of people who watched <i>Searching</i> and gave us notes. We’ve created this brain trust of filmmakers and some non-filmmakers, too, that are just smart people. All those who watched <i>Searching</i> came out and they haven’t disowned us as friends yet, even though we keep them hostage for like five hours and grill them on the movie. But it’s exactly what Aneesh is saying: we made <i>Searching</i> independently, this one had a studio involved, so there were a couple more people in the room making decisions. But absolutely, we lean on trusted friends and filmmakers to guide us.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What were some of the things you guys learned as a result of that feedback? What were some changes that you made from the early versions of this movie?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: You can get a sense of it in – we’re putting a couple deleted scenes in the Hulu [bonus feature section], and some of them we fought heavily for. But I think the biggest difference between the most perfectly edited version of the script versus the most perfectly edited final version of the movie, is mom and daughter sentimentality. The first half of the original script was a lot more of investing in this relationship between a mom and her daughter, having conversations with them, the Cold War was a significantly longer process. The biggest note from Lionsgate was just, “Make it a thriller. If you don’t need the scene, it’s out.” I think what that turned it into is still an extremely effective barebones thriller that moves left to right and doesn’t stop. I think one of the biggest compliments about the film is that it just doesn’t stop. This is a process that every movie goes through, this negotiation, but what felt like started off as a family drama meets an intense thriller became an intense thriller.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: I think some of it is a testament to Sarah and Kiera’s performances, too. People in our friends and family feedback screenings, one of the first things everyone said was, “You get their relationship from just that opening montage.” While we love the scenes that followed, some of what we cut was – a lot of the notes we were getting were, “We’re getting that. In one look, Sarah conveys so much. In one look, Kiera conveys so much.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-645877 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"run\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>The pandemic impacted this movie’s release in a pretty significant way. I think you wrapped filming long before the world shut down, but did you take advantage of that extra time to continue to hone the movie into its final form?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: I think we literally finished mixing and coloring the movie four days before the lockdown. We barely got out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: We were talking about this thing, this coronavirus, during the mix. It was just like, “What’s it going to be?” March happened, and things started closing, and we were thinking, “May. Mother’s Day. We’ll be fine. The pandemic will work through the system and we’ll be out of it by May.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: But the marketing side of it had some time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Tell me about the rooftop sequence, which I think is one of the standout moments in the movie. What type of planning went into that, and how did you actually pull that off?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: Yeah, that’s like the signature set piece of the film. I think so much of why that sequence works is because of the stuff before it, and how contained it is before the movie explodes in this way where the character’s literally crawling on top of a roof. From the beginning, we were like, “If this was Tom Cruise or Margot from <i>Searching</i> on the roof, this is just whatever.” The whole element of setting this movie in a house was, how do we turn these very domestic objects that we see every day – if you put a character who uses a wheelchair in this movie, in this thriller having to escape this house, then suddenly, every single obstacle elevates itself into something a lot bigger. For us, that was intentionally supposed to evoke the pullout of Tom Cruise on the Burj Khalifa. It’s supposed to feel like, “Holy shit!” That level of scaling up at that moment was the goal, and to execute that was just such a complex series of shots on one day, moving into another day on this other thing, we’re going to switch Kiera out for a double for this part, we’re going to face replace her for this scene, we’re going to shoot this part on another set. It was a complex series of specifically planned sequences, and Natalie did most of the planning, so we were able to stitch something together and I’m really proud of it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: It was so fun because everyone brought their A game to make this happen. We have a lead actress who uses a wheelchair in real life, so there was that: how do we get her? We don’t just want it to be a stunt double, and the shots Aneesh had designed called for it to be on Kiera’s face. But it was really cool and a challenge. It was winter and cold, and we wanted to do as much practically as possible. We really had to fight to keep it authentic. The easiest thing to do would have been to move it on stage, but that wouldn’t have worked for what Aneesh had in mind. So it was us constantly pushing the studio to let us do it the way that would have the most “wow” factor, and really pushing our department heads. To their credit, our DP [<b>Hillary Spera</b>] and our production designer [<b>Jean-Andre Carriere</b>], they brought it. From day one of prep until the end of the shoot, we were figuring out how to make this. We actually started on day one with a portion of the roof scene, and wrapped the movie [with another part].</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: We shot the big shot pulling out on day one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Natalie: I’m incredible proud of that sequence. Everyone crushed it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Did you do a lot of storyboarding for that, or did you just know what you wanted it to look like in your head?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aneesh: Every single frame of this movie is storyboarded. Literally every single one. It was always supposed to evoke the style, and because it evoked the style of, I tried to mimic the process of Hitchcock and Shyamalan. They both storyboard everything. I still have in my room the binder of 300 pages of hand-drawn storyboard prints. One of the features we’re also going to do on Hulu is a comparison where we’re just showing the final scene with the drawings. It matches 1:1. So all this stuff was drawn out, but this sequence in particular was drawn and re-drawn and processed by pre-viz people to make animatic sequences, because so many departments had to nail everything at the right second to get this thing pulled off. And in frigid temperatures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>Run</em> lands on Hulu on <strong>November 20</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.
