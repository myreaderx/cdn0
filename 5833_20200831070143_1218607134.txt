Guards!</cite></a>.  You could\nstart here without missing too much, but starting with <cite>Guards!\nGuards!</cite> would make more sense.  And of course there are cameos (and one\nmajor appearance) by other characters who are established in previous\nbooks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCarrot, the adopted dwarf who joined the watch in <cite>Guards! Guards!</cite>,\nhas been promoted to corporal.  He is now in charge of training new\nrecruits, a role that is more important because of the Night Watch's new\nPatrician-ordered diversity initiative.  The Watch must reflect the ethnic\nmakeup of the city.  That means admitting a troll, a dwarf... and a woman?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTrolls and dwarfs hate each other because dwarfs mine precious things out\nof rock and trolls are composed of precious things embedded in rocks, so\nrelations between the new recruits are tense.  Captain Vimes is leaving\nthe Watch, and no one is sure who would or could replace him.  (The reason\nfor this is a minor spoiler for <cite>Guards! Guards!</cite>)  A magical weapon\nis stolen from the Assassin's Guild.  And a string of murders begins,\nmurders that Vimes is forbidden by Lord Vetinari from investigating and\ntherefore clearly is going to investigate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis is an odd moment at which to read this book.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Night Watch are not precisely a police force, although they are moving\nin that direction.  Their role in Ankh-Morpork is made much stranger by\nthe guild system, in which the Thieves' Guild is responsible for theft and\nfor dealing with people who steal outside of the quota of the guild.  But\n<cite>Men at Arms</cite> is in part a story about ethics, about what it means to\nbe a police officer, and about what it looks like when someone is very\ngood at that job.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSince I live in the United States, that makes it hard to avoid reading\n<cite>Men at Arms</cite> in the context of the current upheavals about police\nracism, use of force, and lack of accountability.  <cite>Men at Arms</cite> can\nindeed be read that way; community relations, diversity in the police\nforce, the merits of making two groups who hate each other work together,\nand the allure of violence are all themes Pratchett is working with in\nthis novel.  But they're from the perspective of a UK author writing in\n1993 about a tiny city guard without any of the machinery of modern\npolice, so I kept seeing a point of clear similarity and then being\nslightly wrong-footed by the details.  It also felt odd to read a book\nwhere the cops are the heroes, much in the style of a detective show.\nThis is in no way a problem with the book, and in a way it was helpful\nperspective, but it was a strange reading experience.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n    Cuddy had only been a guard for a few days but already he had absorbed\n    one important and basic fact: it is almost impossible for anyone to be\n    in a street without breaking the law.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nVimes and Carrot are both excellent police officers, but in entirely\ndifferent ways.  Vimes treats being a cop as a working-class job and is\ninclined towards glumness and depression, but is doggedly persistent and\nunable to leave a problem alone.  His ethics are covered by a thick layer\nof world-weary cynicism.  Carrot is his polar opposite in personality:\nbright, endlessly cheerful, effortlessly charismatic, and determined to\nget along with everyone.  On first appearance, this contrast makes Vimes\nseem wise and Carrot seem a bit dim.  That is exactly what Pratchett is\nplaying with and undermining in <cite>Men at Arms</cite>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBeneath Vimes's cynicism, he's nearly as idealistic as Carrot, even though\nhe arrives at his ideals through grim contrariness.  Carrot, meanwhile, is\nnowhere near as dim as he appears to be.  He's certain about how he wants\nto interact with others and is willing to stick with that approach no\nmatter how bad of an idea it may appear to be, but he's more self-aware\nthan he appears.  He and Vimes are identical in the strength of their\ninternal self-definition.  Vimes shows it through the persistent, grumpy\nstubbornness of a man devoted to doing an often-unpleasant job, whereas\nCarrot verbally steamrolls people by refusing to believe they won't do the\nright thing.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n    Colon thought Carrot was simple.  Carrot often struck people as\n    simple.  And he was.  Where people went wrong was thinking that simple\n    meant the same thing as stupid.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThere's a lot going on in this book apart from the profiles of two very\ndifferent models of cop.  Alongside the mystery (which doubles as pointed\ncommentary on the corrupting influence of violence and personal weaponry),\nthere's a lot about dwarf/troll relations, a deeper look at the\nAnkh-Morpork guilds (including a horribly creepy clown guild), another\nlook at how good Lord Vetinari is at running the city by anticipating how\nother people will react, a sarcastic dog named Gaspode (originally seen in\n<a href=\"https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-06-102063-X.html\"><cite>Moving Pictures</cite></a>), and Pratchett's usual\ncollection of memorable lines.  It is also the origin of the\nnow-rightfully-famous Vimes boots theory:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n    The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because\n    they managed to spend less money.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Take boots, for example.  He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus\n    allowances.  A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars.\n    But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or\n    two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about\n    ten dollars.  Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and\n    wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in\n    Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years.  A man\n    who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be\n    keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could\n    only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in\n    the same time and would still have wet feet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic\n    unfairness.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<cite>Men at Arms</cite> regularly makes lists of the best Discworld novels, and\nI can see why.  At this point in the series, Pratchett has hit his stride.\nThe plots have gotten deeper and more complex without losing the funny\nmoments, movie and book references, and glorious turns of phrase.  There\nis also a lot of life philosophy and deep characterization when one pays\nclose attention to the characters.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n    He was one of those people who would recoil from an assault on\n    strength, but attack weakness without mercy.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\nMy one complaint is that I found it a bit overstuffed with both characters\nand subplots, and as a result had a hard time following the details of the\nplot.  I found myself wanting a timeline of the murders or a better recap\nfrom one of the characters.  As always with Pratchett, the digressions are\nwonderful, but they do occasionally come at the cost of plot clarity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI'm not sure I recommend the present moment in the United States as the\nbest time to read this book, although perhaps there is no better time for\nCarrot and Vimes to remind us what good cops look like.  But regardless of\nwhen one reads it, it's an excellent book, one of the best in the\nDiscworld series to this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFollowed, in publication order, by <cite>Soul Music</cite>.

That is something that was traditionally done via the BIOS, but rebooting between each attempt is not really a great experience.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Linux kernel provides a large number of knobs that allow this at runtime.</p>\n<h1>Turbo</h1>\n<p>This is the most straightforward:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost\n</code></pre>\n<p>Re-enable with</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost\n</code></pre>\n<h1>CPU frequency throttling</h1>\n<p>Even though I haven’t mentioned it, I might as well add this briefly. There are many knobs to tweak frequency throttling, but assuming your goal is to disable throttling and set the CPU frequency to its fastest non-Turbo frequency, this is how you do it:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo performance &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<b>$n</b>/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <em>$n</em> is the id of the core you want to do that for, so if you want to do that for all the cores, you need to do that for <code>cpu0</code>, <code>cpu1</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>Re-enable with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo ondemand &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<b>$n</b>/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n</code></pre>\n<p>(assuming this was the value before you changed it ; <code>ondemand</code> is usually the default)</p>\n<h1>Cores and Threads</h1>\n<p>This one requires some attention, because you cannot assume anything about the CPU numbers. The first thing you want to do is to check those CPU numbers. You can do so by looking at the <code>physical id</code> and <code>core id</code> fields in <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, but the output from <code>lscpu --extended</code> is more convenient, and looks like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>CPU NODE SOCKET CORE L1d:L1i:L2:L3 ONLINE MAXMHZ    MINMHZ\n0   0    0      0    0:0:0:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n1   0    0      1    1:1:1:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n2   0    0      2    2:2:2:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n3   0    0      3    3:3:3:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n4   0    0      4    4:4:4:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n5   0    0      5    5:5:5:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n6   0    0      6    6:6:6:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n7   0    0      7    7:7:7:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n(...)\n32  0    0      0    0:0:0:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n33  0    0      1    1:1:1:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n34  0    0      2    2:2:2:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n35  0    0      3    3:3:3:0       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n36  0    0      4    4:4:4:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n37  0    0      5    5:5:5:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n38  0    0      6    6:6:6:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n39  0    0      7    7:7:7:1       yes    3700.0000 2200.0000\n(...)</code></pre>\n<p>Now, this output is actually the ideal case, where pairs of CPUs (virtual cores) on the same physical core are always <em>n, n+32</em>, but I’ve had them be pseudo-randomly spread in the past, so be careful.</p>\n<p>To turn off a core, you want to turn off all the CPUs with the same CORE identifier. To turn off a thread (virtual core), you want to turn off one CPU. On machines with multiple sockets, you can also look at the SOCKET column.</p>\n<p>Turning off one CPU is done with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<b>$n</b>/online\n</code></pre>\n<p>Re-enable with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<b>$n</b>/online\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Extra: CPU sets</h1>\n<p>CPU sets are a feature of Linux’s cgroups. They allow to restrict groups of processes to a set of cores.\nThe first step is to create a group like so:</p>\n<pre><code>$ mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup</code></pre>\n<p>Please note you may already have existing groups, and you may want to create subgroups. You can do so by creating subdirectories.</p>\n<p>Then you can configure on which CPUs/cores/threads you want processes in this group to run on:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo 0-7,16-23 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/cpuset.cpus</code></pre>\n<p>The value you write in this file is a comma-separated list of CPU/core/thread numbers or ranges. <code>0-3</code> is the range for CPU/core/thread 0 to 3 and is thus equivalent to <code>0,1,2,3</code>. The numbers correspond to <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> or the output from <code>lscpu</code> as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>There are also memory aspects to CPU sets, that I won’t detail here (because I don’t have a machine with multiple memory nodes), but you can start with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.mems &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/cpuset.mems</code></pre>\n<p>Now you’re ready to assign processes to this group:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo $pid &gt;&gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/tasks</code></pre>\n<p>There are a number of tweaks you can do to this setup, I invite you to check out the <code>cpuset(7)</code> manual page.</p>\n<p>Disabling a group is a little involved. First you need to move the processes to a different group:</p>\n<pre><code>$ while read pid; do echo $pid &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/tasks; done &lt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/tasks</code></pre>\n<p>Then deassociate CPU and memory nodes:</p>\n<pre><code>$ &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/cpuset.cpus\n$ &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup/cpuset.mems</code></pre>\n<p>And finally remove the group:</p>\n<pre><code>$ rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/mygroup</code></pre>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":5833,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"08baba54e36eafeff47510428d84ee81","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"glandium","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857276327},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","title":"Get A Command Line","link":"https://tookmund.com/2020/08/get-a-command-line","description":"<p>How to access a command line on your laptop without installing Linux.</p>\n\n<p>Linux is great, and I recommend trying it out, whether on real hardware\nor in a virtual machine, to anyone interested in Computer Science.</p>\n\n<p>However, the process can be quite involved, and sometimes you don’t want to\nchange your whole operating system or sort out installing virtual machines.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, these days you can try out one of Linux’s greatest features, the\ncommand line, without going through all that hassle.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mac\">Mac</h2>\n<p>If you have a Mac, all you need to do is open <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Terminal.app</code>, which is usually\nfound under <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Utilities</code>.

for manipulating PGP\nsignatures in Perl.  I'm trying to get the CPAN testing failures down to a\ndull roar.  This iteration fixes some testing issues with systems that\nhave only GnuPG v1 and tries to handle systems whose gpg is GnuPG v2 but\nis older than 2.1.12 and therefore doesn't have the <code>--pinentry-mode</code>\nflag that GnuPG uses to suppress password prompting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI handled the latter by skipping the tests if the gpg on the user's PATH\nwas too old.  I'm not certain this is the best approach, although it makes\nthe CPAN automated testing more useful for me, since the module will not\nwork without special configuration on those systems.  On the other hand,\nif someone is installing it to point to some other GnuPG binary on the\nsystem at runtime, failing the installation because their system gpg is\ntoo old seems wrong, and the test failure doesn't indicate a bug in the\nmodule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nEssentially, I'm missing richer test metadata in the Perl ecosystem.  I\nwant to be able to declare a dependency on a non-Perl system binary, but\nof course Perl has no mechanism to do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI thought about trying to deal with the Windows failures due to missing\nIPC::Run features (redirecting high-numbered file descriptors) on the\nWindows platform in a similar way, but decided in that case I do want the\ntests to fail because PGP::Sign will never work on that platform\nregardless of the runtime configuration.  Here too I spent some time\nsearching for some way to indicate with Module::Build that the module\ndoesn't work on Windows, and came up empty.  This seems to be a gap in\nPerl's module distribution ecosystem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn any case, hopefully this release will clean up the remaining test\nfailures on Linux and BSD systems, and I can move on to work on the Big\nEight signing key, which was the motivating application for these\nreleases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can get the latest release from CPAN or from  the\n<a href=\"https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/pgp-sign/\">PGP::Sign distribution page</a>.\n</p>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":5833,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f5dc1401e052f37ee250821ca1a69cc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Russ Allbery","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857276326},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","title":"The Debconf20 song","link":"http://flosslinuxblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-debconf20-song.html","description":"<p>The DebConf 20 song - a sea shanty - to the tune of \"Fathom the bowl\"<br /><br />Here's to DebConf 20, the brightest and best<br />Now it's this year's orga team getting no rest<br />We're not met in Haifa - it's all doom and gloom<br />And I'm sat like a lifer here trapped in my room<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />And I'm sat at my keyboard here trapped in my room<br /><br />Now there's IRC rooms and there's jitsi and all<br />But no fun conversations as we meet in the hall<br />No hugs for old friends, no shared wine and cheese<br />Just shared indigestion as we take our ease<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />And I'm sat with three screens around me in my room<br /><br />But there's people to chat to, and faces we know<br />And new things to learn and we're all on the go<br />Algo en espanol - there's no cause for alarm<br />An Indic track showcasing Malayalam <br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />And I'm sat with my Thinkpads and cats in my room<br /><br />With webcams and buffering, with lag and delay<br />It's as well that there's Debconf time all through the day<br />The effects of tiredness are hard to foresee<br />For the Debian clocks all are timezone UTC<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />And I'll sing out of tune as I'm sat in my room<br /><br />There's no social drinking, there's no games of Mao<br />Keeping social distance, we can't think quite how<br />This year is still friendly though minus some fun<br />We'll catch up next year when we'll all get some sun<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />I'm sat with my friends around here in my room<br /><br />There's loopy@debconf and snippets and such<br />To cheer us all up, sure, it doesn't take much<br />For we're all one big family, though we each code alone<br />And we sometimes switch off or just complain and moan<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's all doom and gloom<br />And there's space for us all in the debconf chat room<br /><br />This is my first DebConf - hope it won't be my last<br />And we'll meet up somewhere when this COVID is past<br />To all who have done this - we deserve the credit<br />Now if you'll excuse me - I've web pages to edit<br /><br />I'm sat in my room, it's not all doom and gloom<br />And we're met as one Debian here in my room<br /><br /><br /> </p>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":5833,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"27d9edc2220cc3912ddf48e4510959c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Andrew Cater","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857276325},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","title":"RcppSMC 0.2.2: Small updates","link":"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/08/30#rcppsmc_0.2.2","description":"<p>A new release 0.2.2 of the <a href=\"https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.smc.html\">RcppSMC</a> package arrived on <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org\">CRAN</a> earlier today (and once again as a very quick <em>pretest-publish</em> within minutes of submission).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.smc.html\">RcppSMC</a> provides Rcpp-based bindings to R for the Sequential Monte Carlo Template Classes (SMCTC) by Adam Johansen described in his <a href=\"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v030i06/‎\">JSS article</a>.

Many people have been meaning to do something similar for a long time, but it just didn’t work out yet. With many of us being in lock down due to COVID-19, and with the strong possibility looming that DebConf20 might have had to become an online event, we rushed towards organising the first ever Online MiniDebConf and put together some form of usable video stack for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could go into all kinds of details on the above, but this post is about a bug that lead to a pretty nifty feature for DebConf20. The tool that we use to capture Jitsi calls is called <a href=\"https://github.com/jitsi/jibri\">Jibri</a> (Jitsi Broadcasting Infrustructure). It had a <a href=\"https://community.jitsi.org/t/jibri-stop-recording-after-30s/22227\">bug</a> (well, bug for us, but it’s an upstream feature) where Jibri would hang up after 30s of complete silence, because it would assume that the call has ended and that the worker can be freed up again. This would result in the stream being ended at the end of every talk, so before the next talk, someone would have to remember to press play again in their media player or on the video player on the stream page. Hrmph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy solution on the morning that the conference starts? I was testing a Debian Live image the night before in a KVM and thought that I might as well just start a Jitsi call from there and keep a steady stream of silence so that Jibri doesn’t hang up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked! But the black screen and silence on stream was a bit eery. Because this event was so experimental in nature, and because we were on such an incredibly tight timeline, we opted not to seek sponsors for this event, so there was no sponsors loop that we’d usually stream during a DebConf event. Then I thought “Ah! I could just show the schedule!”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10643\" height=\"701\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/sched_cut.png\" width=\"1185\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stream looked bright and colourful (and was even useful!) and Jitsi/Jibri didn’t die. I thought my work was done. As usual, little did I know how untrue that was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silence was slightly disturbing after the talks, and people asked for some music. Playing music on my VM and capturing the desktop audio in to Jitsi was just a few pulseaudio settings away, so I spent two minutes finding some freely licensed tracks that sounded ok enough to just start playing on the stream. I came across mini-albums by <a href=\"https://cctrax.com/captive-portal/what-is\">Captive Portal</a> and <a href=\"https://cctrax.com/cinema-noir/children-kill-ants\">Cinema Noir</a>, During the course of the MiniDebConf Online I even started enjoying those. Someone also pointed out that it would be really nice to have a UTC clock on the stream. I couldn’t find a nice clock in a hurry so I just added a tmux clock in the meantime while we deal with the real-time torrent of issues that usually happens when organising events like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10640\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/mdcoloop1.png\" width=\"1025\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of issues, during our very first talk of the last day, our speaker had a power cut during the talk and abruptly dropped off. Oops! So, since I had a screenshare open from the VM to the stream, I thought I’d just pop in a quick message in a text editor to let people know that we’re aware of it and trying to figure out what’s going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10641\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/mdcoloop2.png\" width=\"1023\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, MiniDebConf Online worked out all right. Besides the power cut for our one speaker, and another who had a laptop that was way too under-powered to deal with video, everything worked out very well. Even the issues we had weren’t show-stoppers and we managed to work around them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>DebConf20 Moves Online</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For DebConf, we usually show a sponsors loop in between sessions. It’s great that we give our sponsors visibility here, but in reality people see the sponsors loop and think “Talk over!” and then they look away. It’s also completely silent and doesn’t provide any additional useful information. I was wondering how I could take our lessons from MDCO#1 and integrate our new tricks with the sponsors loop. That is, add the schedule, time, some space to type announcements on the screen and also add some loopable music to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://obsproject.com/download\">OBS</a> before in making my videos, and like the flexibility it provides when working with scenes and sources. A scene is what you would think of as a screen or a document with its own collection of sources or elements. For example, a scene might contain sources such as a logo, clock, video, image, etc. A scene can also contain another scene. This is useful if you want to contain a banner or play some background music that is shared between scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10652\" height=\"629\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/obs-scenes1.jpg\" width=\"845\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10653\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/obs-scenes2.jpg\" width=\"851\" /></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The above screenshots illustrate some basics of scenes and sources. First with just the DC20 banner, and then that used embedded in another scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For MDCO#1, I copied and pasted the schedule into a LibreOffice Impress slide that was displayed on the stream. Having to do this for all 7 days of DebConf, plus dealing with scheduling changes would be daunting. So, I started to look in to generating some schedule slides programmatically. Stefano then pointed me to the <a href=\"https://debconf20.debconf.org/schedule/current/\">Happening Now</a> page on the DebConf website, where the current schedule block is displayed. So all I would need to do in OBS was to display a web page. Nice!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately the OBS in Debian doesn’t have the ability to display web pages out of the box (we need to <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=893448\">figure out CEF in Debian</a>), but fortunately someone provides a pre-compiled version of the plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser/releases\">Linux Browser</a> that works just fine. This allowed me to easily add the schedule page in its own scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to display a web page solved another problem. I wasn’t fond of having to type / manage the announcements in OBS. It would either be a bit prone to user error, and if you want to edit the text while the loop is running, you’d have to disrupt the loop, go to the foreground scene, and edit the text before resuming the loop. That’s a bit icky. Then I thought that we could probably just get that from a web page instead. We could host some nice html snippet in a repository in salsa, and then anyone could easily commit an MR to update the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I went a step further, use an etherpad! Then anyone in the orga team can quickly update the announcement and it would be instantly changed on the stream. Nice! So that small section of announcement text on the screen is actually a whole web browser with an added OBS filter to crop away all the pieces we don’t want. Overkill? Sure, but it gave us a decent enough solution that worked in time for the start of DebConf. Also, being able to type directly on to the loop screen works out great especially in an emergency. Oh, and uhm… the clock is also a website rendered in its own web browser :-P</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10657\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/announcements-pad.jpg\" width=\"1063\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I had the ability to make scenes, add elements and add all the minimal elements I wanted in there. Great! But now I had to figure out how to switch scenes automatically. It’s probably worth mentioning that I only found some time to really dig into this right before DebConf started, so with all of this I was scrambling to find things that would work without too many bugs while also still being practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I needed the ability to switch between the scenes automatically / programmatically. I had never done this in OBS before. I know it has some API because there are Android apps that you can use to control OBS with from your phone. I discovered that it had an automatic scene switcher, but it’s very basic. It can only switch based on active window, which can be useful in some cases, but since we won’t have any windows open other than OBS, this tool was basically pointless.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10661\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/ass.jpg\" width=\"891\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After some quick searches, I found a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/WarmUpTill/SceneSwitcher\">Advanced Scene Switcher</a>. This plugin can do a lot more, but has some weird UI choices, and is really meant for gamers and other types of professional streamers to help them automate their work flow and doesn’t seem at all meant to be used for a continuous loop, but, it worked, and I could make it do something that will work for us during the DebConf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a chicken and egg problem because I had to figure out a programming flow, but didn’t really have any content to work with, or an idea of all the content that we would eventually have. I’ve been toying with the idea in my mind and had some idea that we could add fun facts, postcards (an image with some text), time now in different timezones, Debian news (maybe procured by the press team), cards that contain the longer announcements that was sent to debconf-announce, perhaps a shout out or two and some photos from previous DebConfs like the group photos. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to build anything substantial by the time DebConf starts, but adding content to OBS in between talks is relatively easy, so we could keep on building on it during DebConf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nattie provided the <a href=\"https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/7a45d119-af15-448b-ade6-b91d770e6c1c\">first shout out</a>, and I made 2 video loops with the DC18/19 pictures and also two “Did you know” cards. So the flow I ended up with was: Sponsors -&gt; Happening Now -&gt; Random video (which would be any of those clips) -&gt; Back to sponsors. This ended up working pretty well for quite a while. With the first batch of videos the sponsor loop would come up on average about every 2 minutes, but as much shorter clips like shout outs started to come in faster and faster, it made sense to play a few 2-3 shout-outs before going back to sponsors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here is a very brief guide on how I set up the sequencing in Advanced Scene Switcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10664\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/ass1.jpg\" width=\"942\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If no condition was met, a video would play from the Random tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10665\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/ass2.jpg\" width=\"999\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in the Random tab, I added the scenes that were part of the random mix. Annoyingly, you have to specify how long it should play for. If you don’t, the ‘no condition’ thingy is triggered and another video is selected. The time is also the length of the video minus one second, because…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10666\" height=\"578\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/ass3.jpg\" width=\"1016\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t just say that a random video should return back to a certain scene, you have to specify that in the sequence tab for each video. Why after 1 second? Because, at least in my early tests, and I didn’t circle back to this, it seems like 0s can randomly either mean instantly, or never. Yes, this ended up being a bit confusing and tedious, and considering the late hours I worked on this, I’m surprised that I didn’t manage to screw it up completely at any point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also suspected that threads would eventually happen. That is, when people create video replies to other videos. We had 3 threads in total. There was a backups thread, beverage thread and an impersonation thread. The arrow in the screenshot above points to the backups thread. I know it doesn’t look <em>that</em> complicated, but it was initially somewhat confusing to set up and make sense out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10667\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/ass4.png\" width=\"1014\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next event, the Advanced Scene Switcher might just get some more taming, or even be replaced entirely. There are ways to drive OBS by API, and even the Advanced Scene Switcher tool can be driven externally to some degree, but I think we definitely want to replace it by the next full DebConf. We had the problem that when a talk ended, we would return to the loop in the middle of a clip, which felt very unnatural and sometimes even confusing. So Stefano helped me with a helper script that could read the socket from Vocto, which I used to write either “Loop” or “Standby” to a file, and then the scene switcher would watch that file and keep the sponsors loop ready for start while the talks play. Why not just switch to sponsors when the talk ends? Well, the little bit of delay in switching would mean that you would see a tiny bit of loop every time before switching to sponsors. This is also why we didn’t have any loop for the ad-hoc track (that would have probably needed another OBS instance, we’ll look more into solutions for this for the future).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10669\" height=\"1003\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/kdenlive.jpg\" width=\"1911\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then for all the clips. There were over 50 of them. All of them edited by hand in kdenlive. I removed any hard clicks, tried to improve audibility, remove some sections at the beginning and the end that seemed extra and added some music that would reduce in volume when someone speaks. In the beginning, I had lots of fun with choosing music for the clips. Towards the end, I had to rush them through and just chose the same tune whether it made sense or not. For comparison of what a difference the music can make, compare the <a href=\"https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/c3c59c80-cb87-4a15-bf65-a096cd76f965\">original</a> and <a href=\"https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/2dc1a3df-ad30-471c-b567-d09e535776ee\">adapted</a> version for Valhalla’s clip above, or this <a href=\"https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/53265bf9-0d59-4d7c-875e-553f4ab6de08\">original</a> and <a href=\"https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/ae71bc08-c709-4b27-85d0-b23a687666ec\">adapted</a> video from urbec. This part was a lot more fun than dealing with the video sequencer, but I also want to automate it a bit. When I can fully drive OBS from Python I’ll likely instead want to show those cards and control music volume from Python (what could possibly go wrong…).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loopy name happened when I requested an @debconf.org alias for this. I was initially just thinking about loop@debconf.org but since I wanted to make it clear that the purpose of this loop is also to have some fun, I opted for “loopy” instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10670\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/loopy.png\" width=\"618\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really surprised by how people took to loopy. I hoped it would be good and that it would have somewhat positive feedback, but the positive feedback was just immense. The idea was that people typically saw it in between talks. But a few people told me they kept it playing after the last talk of the day to watch it in the background. Some asked for the music because they want to keep listening to it while working (and even for jogging!?). Some people also asked for recordings of the loop because they want to keep it for after DebConf. The shoutouts idea proved to be very popular. Overall, I’m very glad that people enjoyed it and I think it’s safe to say that loopy will be back for the next event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10675\" height=\"66\" src=\"https://jonathancarter.org/files/images/loopy-1.png\" width=\"109\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also throughout this experiment Loopy Loop turned into yet another DebConf mascot. We gain one about every DebConf, some by accident and some on purpose. This one was not quite on purpose. I meant to make an image for it for salsa, and started with an infinite loop symbol. That’s a loop, but by just adding two more solid circles to it, it looks like googly eyes, now it’s a proper loopy loop!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the progress we’ve made on this, but there’s  still a long way to go, and the ideas keep heaping up. The next event is quite soon (MDCO#2 at the end of November, and it seems that 3 other MiniDebConf events may also be planned), but over the next few events there will likely be significantly better graphics/artwork, better sequencing, better flow and more layout options. I hope to gain some additional members in the team to deal with incoming requests during DebConf. It was quite hectic this time! The new OBS also has a scripting host that supports Python, so I should be able to do some nice things even within OBS without having to drive it externally (like, display a clock without starting a web browser).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Loopy Loop Music</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two mini albums that mostly played during the first few days were just a copy and paste from the MDCO#1 music, which was:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://cctrax.com/captive-portal/what-is\">Captive Portal – What is</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cctrax.com/cinema-noir/children-kill-ants\">Cinema Noir – Children kill ants</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For shoutout tracks, that were later used in the loop too (because it became a bit monotonous), most of the tracks came from <a href=\"https://freepd.com/\">freepd.com</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Foam%20Rubber.mp3\">Foam Rubber</a> (used in Nattie’s and Urbec’s shoutouts, and other places) </li><li><a href=\"https://freepd.com/Page2/music/Metaltania.mp3\">Metaltania</a> (used in Luna’s shoutout)</li><li><a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Adventures%20of%20Flying%20Jack.mp3\">Flying Jack</a> (used in Pollo’s epic videoteam call for help)</li><li><a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Study%20and%20Relax.mp3\">Study and relax</a> (used in Rhonda’s poetry night announcement)</li><li><a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/City%20Sunshine.mp3\">City sunshine</a> (used in gregoa’s coffee shoutout and then in several more after)</li><li>Other tracks played in the loop from freepd.com included <a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Brothers Unite.mp3\">Brothers Unite</a>, <a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Ice and Snow.mp3\">Ice and Snow</a>, <a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Parhelion.mp3\">Parhelion</a>, <a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/Shining Stars.mp3\">Shining stars</a> and <a href=\"https://freepd.com/music/The Lagoon.mp3\">The Lagoon</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I have much more things to say about DebConf20, but I’ll keep that for another post, and hopefully we can get all the other video stuff in a post from the video team, because I think there’s been some real good work done for this DebConf.

It gradually started proposing merges in early\nDecember. The first set of changes sent out ran <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush\">lintian-brush</a> on sid packages maintained in\nGit. This post is part of <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html\">a series</a> about the progress of the\nJanitor.</p>\n<p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://jelmer.uk/janitor-update-3.html\">Last week’s blog post</a>\ndocumented how there are now over 30,000 lintian issues\nthat have been fixed in git packaging repositories by the\nJanitor.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that any fixes from the Janitor that\nmake it into a Git packaging repository will also need\nto be uploaded to the Debian archive. This currently requires\nthat a Debian packager clones the repository and builds\nand uploads the package.</p>\n<p>Until a change makes it into the archive, users of Debian\nwill unfortunately not see the benefits of improvements\nmade by the Janitor.</p>\n<p>82% of the 30,000 changes from the Janitor that have made\nit into a Git repository have not yet been uploaded, although\nchanges do slowly trickle in as maintainers make other\nchanges to packages and upload them along with the lintian\nfixes from the Janitor. This is not just true for changes\nfrom the Janitor, but for all sorts of other smaller improvements\nas well.</p>\n<p>However, the process of cloning and building git repositories\nand uploading the resulting packages to the Debian archive\nis fairly time-consuming – and it’s probably not worth\nthe time of developers to follow up every change from the\nJanitor with a labour-intensive upload to the archive.</p>\n<p>It would be great if it was easier to trigger uploads from\ngit commits. Projects like  <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://spwhitton.name/blog/entry/tag2upload/\">tag2upload</a>  will hopefully help, and\nmake it more likely that changes end up in the Debian archive.</p>\n<p>The majority packages do get at least one new source version\nupload per release, so most changes will eventually make\nit into the archive.</p>\n<p class=\"italic\">For more information about the Janitor's lintian-fixes efforts, see <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://janitor.debian.net/lintian-fixes/\">the landing page</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":5833,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8fbafad0ad23fbbcf69ad1e17d05a8c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jelmer Vernooĳ, Perry Lorrier","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857276326},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 15:01:16","title":"anytime 0.3.9: More Minor Maintenance","link":"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/08/28#anytime_0.3.9","description":"<p>A new minor release of the <a href=\"https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/anytime.html\">anytime</a> package arrived on <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org\">CRAN</a> yesterday.

Our last post <a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/07/03#028_rocker_rspm\">#28 introduced RSPM</a>, and just before that we also talked in <a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2020/06/22#027_ubuntu_binaries\">#27 about binary installations on Ubuntu</a> (which was also a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZnGEhtGBFaE\"><span class=\"math inline\"><em>T</em><sup>4</sup></span> video</a>). This post is joined with <a href=\"https://github.com/Enchufa2\">Iñaki Ucar</a> and mainly about work we have done with his <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=bspm\">bspm</a> package.</p>\n<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org\">CRAN</a> has been a cornerstone of the success of R in recent years. As a well-maintained repository with stringent quality control, it ensures users have access to highest-quality statistical / analytical software that “just works”. Users on Windows and macOS also benefit from faster installation via pre-compiled binary packages.</p>\n<p>Linux users generally install from source, which can be more tedious and, often, much slower. Those who know where to look have had access to (at least some) binaries for years as well (and one of us <a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/code/r4/\">blogged and vlogged about this at length</a>). Debian users get close to 1000 CRAN and BioConductor packages (and, true to Debian form, for well over a dozen hardware platforms). Michael Rutter maintains a PPA with 4600 binaries for three different Ubuntu flavors (see <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~c2d4u.team/+archive/ubuntu/c2d4u4.0+\">c2d4u4.0+</a>). More recently, Fedora joined the party with 16000 (!!) binaries, essentially all of CRAN, via a Copr repository (see <a href=\"https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/iucar/cran/\">iucar/cran</a>).</p>\n<p>The buzz currently is however with <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/products/package-manager/\">RSPM</a>, a new package manager by RStudio. An audacious project, it provides binaries for several Linux distributions and releases. It has already been tested in many RStudio Cloud sessions (including with some of our students) as well as some CI integrations.</p>\n<p>RSPM cuts “across” and takes the breadth of CRAN across several Linux distributions, bringing installation of pre-built CRAN packages a binaries under their normal CRAN package names. Another nice touch is the integration with <code>install.packages()</code>: these binaries are installed in a way that is natural for R users—but as binaries. It is however <em>entirely disconnected from the system package management</em>. This means that the installation of a package requiring an external library may “succeed” and still fail, as a <em>required</em> library simply cannot be pulled in directly by RSPM.</p>\n<p>So what is needed is a combination. We want binaries that are aware of their system dependencies but accessible directly from R just like RSPM offers it. Enter BSPM—the <em>Bridge to System Package Manager</em> package (also on CRAN).</p>\n<p>The first illustration (using Ubuntu 18.04) shows RSPM on the left, and BSPM on the right, both installing the graphics package <a href=\"http://cloud.r-project.org/package=Cairo\">Cairo</a> (and both using custom Rocker containers).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eddelbuettel.github.io/paper-r-binaries/RSPMvsBSPM.gif\" style=\"width: 98.0%;\" /></p>\n<p>This fails for RSPM as no binary is present and a source build fails for the familiar lack of a <code>-dev</code> package. It proceeds just fine on the right under BSPM.</p>\n<p>A second illustration shows once again RSPM on the left, and BSPM on the right (this time on Fedora), both installing the <a href=\"http://cloud.r-project.org/package=units\">units</a> package without a required system dependency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eddelbuettel.github.io/paper-r-binaries/RSPMvsFedoraBSPM.gif\" style=\"width: 98.0%;\" /></p>\n<p>The installation of <a href=\"http://cloud.r-project.org/package=units\">units</a> works for BSPM as the dependency <code>libudunits</code> is brought in, but fails under RSPM. The binary installation succeeds in both cases, but the missing dependency (the UDUNITS2 library) is brought in only by BSPM. Consequently, the package fails to load under RSPM.</p>\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n<p>To conclude, highlights of BSPM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>direct installation of binary packages from R via R commands under their normal CRAN names (just like RSPM);</li>\n<li>full integration with the system package manager, delivering system installations (improving upon RSPM);</li>\n<li>full dependency resolution for R packages, including system requirements (improving upon RSPM).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This offers <em>easy, reliable, fast</em> installation of R packages, and we invite you to pick all three. We recommend usage with either Ubuntu with the 4.6k packages via the Rutter PPA, or Fedora via the even more complete Copr repository (which already includes a specially-tailored version of BSPM called CoprManager).</p>\n<p>We hope this short note wets your appetite to learn more about <a href=\"http://cloud.r-project.org/package=bspm\">bspm</a> (which is itself on CRAN) and the two sets of Rocker containers shown. The <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-rspm\">rocker/r-rspm</a> container comes in two two flavours for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-bspm\">rocker/r-bspm</a> container comes in the same two two flavours for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, as well as in a Debian testing variant.</p>\n<p>Feedback is appreciated at the <a href=\"https://github.com/Enchufa2/bspm/issues\">bspm</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/issues\">rocker</a> issue trackers.</p>\n<p>If you like this or other open-source work I do, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/eddelbuettel\">sponsor me at GitHub</a>.
