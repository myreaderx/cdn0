Learning to live in the world without her by my side has been one of the greatest challenges of my life. So many times over the years, I have longed to talk to her, seek her guidance, and ask her what she thought about the life I have created for myself.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An unexpected discovery of a Ziplock bag of letters, written to me by my Mom and grandmothers, from the first time I went to summer camp at age nine, until I graduated from college, changed everything for me. While it took me a little time to finally have the courage to re-read the letters, I was blown away by what happened next. Reading the letters, I could “hear” the voices of my loved ones and get a fresh glimpse of their lives and personalities. I never thought I could feel so close again to my Mom and grandmothers, and this experience impacted me in a profound way. The letters brought back beautiful family memories, taught me many life lessons, and I was able to get a much needed dose of timely and relevant wisdom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also realized not all letters are created equally. This experience taught me there are three different kinds of personal letters, including “just because” letters, “special occasion” letters, and “legacy” letters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The “Just Because” Letter</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the letters in my ziplock bag fall into this category, and this is my favorite kind of letter to receive. Letters from my Mom and grandmothers were about what was going on in their lives: daily events and plans for the future. When I read their letters, I can hear them talking to me; I can visualize them smiling or laughing. What I love most about their letters is how real they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you think about writing a “just because” letter to your loved one, remember that you don’t have to wait for an important occasion. You can send a “just because” letter to a friend or family member to let them know your thoughts and to tell them you were thinking of them. There aren’t any rules and you aren’t striving for perfection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The “Special Occasion” Letter</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are letters written and given at life-cycle events, such as a graduation from school, marriage, confirmation, the birth of a child, a Bat Mitzvah or christening, a birthday, or a holiday. Special occasions or big life moments often prompt the writer to say something meaningful to the recipient. Frequently, these letters talk about how happy and proud the writer is and what they hope for the recipient; they contain well wishes in a deeper, more intentional way than “just because” letters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people like to buy a card to mark specific occasions, and there isn’t a shortage of Hallmark cards. Many people spend a lot of time picking out a card because they are looking for the exact words to say to their loved one to mark the occasion, rather than writing the words themselves. I love getting cards like this, but I like it more when a person takes the time to write me a note in addition to the words on the card. There’s just something about handwritten words that feel more meaningful to me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The “Legacy” Letter </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They might not be your favorite, but these are important letters, written to be given when the writer passes away, and they often contain meaningful and heartfelt words that the writer wanted to say to the recipient. These are often the last words the writer will convey to the recipient.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When my mom passed away, the morning of her funeral, my dad came into my room and gave me an envelope with a letter my mom had written to me. I can’t begin to tell you how much this meant to me, and how special it was. While I was sad to think my Mom thought about her death enough to write this letter, it was an incredible gift.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I encourage anyone who is remotely interested in saying something to their loved ones, upon their death, to take the time to think through what they want to say and do it. Don’t wait or get freaked out because you don’t want to think about your death. Make it less about you, and more about what you want to say to the people who will be left behind when you pass away. Write words to your loved ones that will wrap them in your love and remind them how much you cherished them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The letters taught me there is power in the written word, both in writing it and receiving it. For a letter writer, it feels good to sort through your thoughts about the recipient. For a recipient, it is good to know that someone cared enough about you to share their thoughts and feelings with you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though the convenience of technology has decreased the number of letters being sent, maybe after reading about my experience, you will feel inspired to write a “real” letter. While I love texting and sending emails just as much as the next girl, I make sure to take the time to tell the people I love how I feel, through the hand written word. The most important thing is to find a way to tell the people you care about how much they mean to you, in whatever way works best for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>DARA KURTZ, after being diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of forty-two, left her twenty-year career as a personal banker and financial advisor to focus on writing, speaking, and podcasting.

It will have you reaching out for your old pictures, recorded videos, or even school books. You can revisit the past if you have logged it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it was difficult earlier to record and sort, every memory, the technology today can help you with that. There are numerous ways to keep your memories safe and share it with the people for whom it matters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can now record family events and memories of your child as you see them grow up in front of your eyes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Be it first drawing or the first birthday bash, you’ll need exciting ways to record these events and keep it as a window to your past. Something for you and your partner to look back to and smile. Here are some ways you can do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>1. Photograph It. And Print It</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps, the easiest and the best way to record any family event is to picture it. You can grab a decent point and shoot camera if you think a smartphone is too flimsy for you or even opt for a D-SLR.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason behind creating such memories is to allow everyone to look back to good times. Most parents forget where the picture is after clicking it.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KZV_bm8xs3gf64hauP8O4Kwxe-Y0m9sSRBso4nGKTss1G1EXxrqQ863sjpQIyUPdkr-HveDLUtCuSZbA9SZFhsm1rUmb7WqfBIRG4EpSqTg4PNpFZ00g5o-pnPhhY898YQ\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/aV5xrpB0bwQ\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, do not rely on cloud storage entirely. Instead, get a printer to print these pictures. If you think that is too complicated, try Polaroid cameras and pin the best moments on a memory board. For digitally clicked pictures, you can store those in flash drives and connect it to your TV for easy viewing.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>2. Take Videos</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you look to time travel to the past, you also want to get a better sense of belongingness that pictures lack. The animations, those small movements, the voice of a person, and their mannerism goes missing from the pictures. That’s why you’ll need to take videos of family events when creating memories.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, it may happen that you will record a video on your phone or a camera, take it upon your hard drive and systems, and will have a hard time finding it when you want to watch it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, get a handy USB storage device or a dedicated hard disk. Save all your videos on a single device and you can connect it to your computer or a TV and have your full family to watch it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>3. Journal Events and Add Moments</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps a great way to record memories and also to store meaningfully. Get a journal diary and stick those Polaroid pictures here and write about it. Written words will have a lasting impact when accompanied by photographs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are journaling a birthday party, make sure you highlight when your child first blows the candles or cut the cake the first time. These are the little moments you will cherish when your child grows up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PhGSJkvZ5m7AvFOc4mW4DWcr0u5ZTXCG0fEucZ6P1bz_5ll-naZDYLW1R2NH8NBGKkOFRZ3_fBUNs8orCK25ThSzu-u8qve0nepmQw34Sj5TDl_mPKQsqf3mXRJ2mthFqw\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&#160;Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/z4KhbVhPP7s\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alternatively, you can download the <a href=\"https://www.lugelo.com/\">Lugelo app</a> or other such journaling apps that can help you with e-Journaling. With Lugelo, you can add moments to existing journal entries, making it easier for you to navigate the party's highlight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best part is that you can invite your friends and family over the app and share the journal with this closed group. This way, you are creating a lasting record of essential days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>4. Post It on Social Media</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, most of you would, but there’s a reason why should. <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/harness-power-social-media/\">Harness the power of social media</a> as they come with the ‘memories’ or ‘archive’ feature that reminds you of a special day and the moments you captured. And since you can tag the people who were present, it gets easy to make everyone the part of your memory.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, when your child grows up, s/he can revisit these memories on your social profiles and secure your precious memories last longer. This means you can always post it on Instagram and Facebook.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also upload the videos on YouTube and keep it private. Of course, you can share the link with the people you want and only those will be able to view it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Bottomline</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All your special events are essential for the child who will look back to the captured moments with some emotions. And when you are recording these moments, make sure you do it with the right intent of documenting it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sense of purpose in creating memories will help you navigate the specific event and the memory associated with it without much effort. Instead of just momentary clicking of pictures and recording videos, go for e-journaling and let your child participate in the process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember, this is not a task but a habit, and eventually, you must cultivate the art of documenting events with a sense of purpose, albeit with a dash of fun involved in it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Musa Mawanda, Ph.
