Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article, about the best Lucio Fulci horror movies, is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n<p>When it comes to cinema, masters of horror are a dime-a-dozen. That’s not meant to throw shade on auteurs like John Carpenter and Wes Craven, or even new macabre impresarios like Robert Eggers, but we’re so eager to give out that title the moment a horror film makes an impact that we begin to lose sight of what really constitutes a genius. Still, there are certain directors who absolutely warrant that lofty moniker, none more worthy than the Italian Godfather of Gore, <strong>Lucio Fulci</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A grandfatherly man with a knit cap and coke bottle glasses that rivaled George Romero’s own specs, Fulci did what so few horror directors ever even attempted: he created artistically impactful horror films that just so happened to be wrapped in gleefully sadistic sex and violence.</p>\n<p>He spun his inherent Artaudian sensibility into splatter flicks that are able to straddle the line between arthouse and grindhouse in a way other masters of horror were less inclined to do. Beneath the layers of sleaze and stomach-churning deaths, you can see Fulci’s visual eye veer more towards surrealist filmmakers like Luis Buñuel than his fellow Italo contemporaries like Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The arthouse horror movement that’s popular today just wouldn’t be the same if it wasn’t for Fulci’s contributions to the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulci’s output is as vast as it is diverse, so to cut through to the meat of his filmography, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/coffel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chris Coffel</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a>, and I have chosen the ten films that truly exemplify why Lucio Fulci has earned his title as master of horror.</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n<h2>10. A Cat in the Brain (1990)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-357755\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAT.jpg\" alt=\"Cat in the Brain Lucio Fulci\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAT.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAT-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAT-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAT-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A Cat in the Brain</em> opens on a remarkable image of a cat <em>literally eating a brain</em>, which is the level of subtlety you come to Lucio Fulci movies for. Essentially his own spin of Federico Fellini’s <em>8 1/2</em>, Fulci casts himself as himself, a disillusioned horror director who begins hallucinating that his gory creations are coming to life and driving him to murder.</p>\n<p>While not nearly as salacious as his other films, this latter career Fulci is admirable for both its unique cleverness (that is arguably emulated in Peter Strickland’s <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em>) as well as the director’s own charmingly quirky acting style. I’ve always loved his lackadaisical cameos as police investigators in <em>The New York Ripper</em> and <em>Aenigma</em>, but here his sleepy, detached performance works as the perfect – if not unintentional – counter to his proxy&#8217;s increasingly erratic behavior.</p>\n<p>A lot of horror fans consider <i>A Cat in the Brain </i>to be for Fulci purists only, but I find it offers a fascinating peek into a distinct facet of the director’s artistry that audiences who may be unfamiliar with his work can find engaging. This is a meta-fiction horror-comedy that I earnestly believe film majors should devour right alongside Fellini’s original masterwork. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n<h2>9. Aenigma (1987)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-357756\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aenigma.jpg\" alt=\"Aenigma Lucio Fulci\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aenigma.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aenigma-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aenigma-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Aenigma-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“My lips are numb, and my patients are waiting.” Look, even when Fulci is “not at his best,” he’s still more ghoulish and entertaining than everyone else in the room. There is a shot in this film where a rotting apparition of a supernatural coma patient fades to reveal a jubilant <em>Top Gun</em> poster. A girl is eaten alive by snails. A handsy calisthenics teacher strangles himself. What more could you ask for?</p>\n<p><em>Aenigma</em> tells of a teen whose boarding school peers inadvertently bully her so hard she has a near-fatal accident. Look, her mom is the janitor and she smells like garlic, which is enough cause for ridicule; you know how girls are!. Refusing to go quietly after slipping into a coma, the bullied girl possesses a mid-term newcomer at the school and begins exacting her telepathic revenge. This is the bastard child of <em>Phenomena</em> and <em>Patrick</em> – and if that doesn’t sound like a good time to you, we can’t be friends. (Meg Shields)</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n<h2>8. The Black Cat (1981)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"wp-image-357757\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlackCat.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Cat Lucio Fulci\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlackCat.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlackCat-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlackCat-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlackCat-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pairing of Fulci and Edgar Allan Poe is not the oil and water combination you might initially think it to be. The director&#8217;s uncontrollable desire to languish on the meat and the gore matches the emotional power behind the writer&#8217;s various acts of perversion. What would it actually feel like to be walled up inside a structure while still alive? Poe&#8217;s words get to the agony, but so do Fulci&#8217;s visuals. In the final moments of Fulci&#8217;s <em>The Black Cat</em>, the screams we see on the screen mimic the screams we imagined when we first read Poe&#8217;s fiction in school.</p>\n<p>Edgar Allen Poe was the deranged madman of his time, and so was Lucio Fulci the madman of his. Placed across from each other in a pub, these sickos would have one helluva delightful conversation. <em>The Black Cat</em> is as close as we&#8217;ll ever get to witness such a chat. (Brad Gullickson)</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n<h2>7. Don&#8217;t Torture a Duckling (1972)</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358580\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Duckling1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Duckling\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Duckling1-1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Duckling1-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Duckling1-1-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Duckling1-1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>A giallo steeped in paranoia and mysticism, <em>Don’t Torture a Duckling</em> is a rough watch even by Fulci’s standards. One of his first horror films to really engage in abject violence, <em>Duckling</em> centers on a string of child murders occurring in a remote Italian village. The crimes bring attention to the small town as investigators track down an assailant who may be closer to the children than any of them think.</p>\n<p>Fulci uses the insular, rural community to emphasize the split between science and superstition, the old world and the new, especially as the village grows hungry for a suspect and their rage turns towards a local gypsy woman (Florinda Bolkan) accused of witchcraft. This is only the tip of the iceberg in Fulci’s sweaty murder-mystery, but it’s perhaps most notable for being a departure from his latter horror career.</p>\n<p>This isn’t ooey-gooey demons and zombies, but rather a very real – and sadly still very relevant – look at the actual monsters that exist in our everyday. With sharp cinematography, a sustained bleak tone, and marvelously bonkers usage of gory special effects, <em>Don’t Torture a Duckling </em>is one of the most serious and mature works from Fulci. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n<h2>6. The New York Ripper (1982)</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358581\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYRIpper2.jpg\" alt=\"Nyripper\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYRIpper2.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYRIpper2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYRIpper2-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYRIpper2-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Fulci may have described this shocker as &#8220;Hitchcock revisited,&#8221; but a member of the UK&#8217;s censorship board at the time saw it differently as &#8220;the most damaging film I have ever seen in my whole life.&#8221; To that I&#8217;ll only add, why not both? I kid, although both takes are similarly exaggerated for effect. The film is a murder mystery of a sort that sees a sadistic killer brutalizing women throughout New York City, and much of the film was shot in the Big Apple offering a delicious snapshot of the city at its sleaziest.</p>\n<p>As grim and grotesque as it gets, though, Fulci keeps the tone as wobbly as possible with absurd attempts at humor including a killer who calls the police using a Donald Duck voice. Gone are the unnatural demons and zombies of Fulci&#8217;s other films, and in their place is a killer prone to graphic displays of cruelty. It&#8217;s those scenes that gave the film its notoriety, both for the critics and the fans, and they are absolutely not for the squeamish. Seriously. While flesh is mangled and mutilated throughout his filmography, here it&#8217;s captured with such glee and mean-spiritedness that the carnage can&#8217;t help but feel worlds apart from his usual horrors.

A young person fueled by self-doubt and curiosity finds the inspiration to step apart from the herd to save the day, and part of the reward is the promise of a first, true love. From <em>The Hunger Games</em> to <em>Divergent</em>, from <em>Percy Jackson</em> to <em>Ready Player One</em>, the beats are often similar from one franchise to the next even if the specifics differ. The best and most entertaining among them tweak the formula and fill in the gaps with rich characters, smart dialogue, and a hefty supply of thrills. <strong><em>Love and Monsters</em></strong> is one of the good ones.</p>\n<p>A meteor heading straight for Earth is bombarded with everything the human species can throw at it, but while the immediate impact is avoided a different threat emerges. The apocalypse zigs while humanity expects it to zag, and fragments fall to the planet&#8217;s surface altering the biology of numerous animal species &#8212; lowly lizards and bugs grow to enormous sizes and soon the human survivors are forced underground.</p>\n<p>Seven years later people are still in hiding. Joel (<strong>Dylan O&#8217;Brien</strong>) lost his parents in the initial onslaught and has spent his post-apocalyptic days in a bunker populated by others who&#8217;ve all found their niche and coupled up in the process. By contrast, Joel is the go-to guy when it comes to making minestrone, and he spends his nights alone. His hope is to reconnect with his girlfriend Aimee (<strong>Jessica Henwick</strong>) who he hasn&#8217;t seen since the world went sideways, and when he discovers she&#8217;s in another bunker just eighty-five miles away, he decides it&#8217;s time to face the world &#8212; and no monsters, mishaps, or mayhem can stop his quest for love. Well, in theory anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Love and Monsters</em> is an apocalyptic blast and a coming of age creature feature that entertains, thrills, and even manages to tug at the heart strings. Gone is the dour, dystopian future of so many sci-fi tales (YA or otherwise), and in its place is a colorfully rendered world that once belonged to us and now belongs to all manner of monsters. Ferocious frogs, burrowing bugs, and more bring a beastly menace to the world, and Joel is forced to learn along the way.</p>\n<p>Co-writer <strong>Brian Duffield</strong> creates a thematically familiar setup here but does some fresh and unexpected things with it making for a ride that hits some expected beats while still managing to surprise. That&#8217;s no surprise as Duffield&#8217;s previous films have demonstrated the same feats. From 2017&#8217;s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-babysitter-review-netflix/\"><em>The Babysitter</em></a> to this year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/spontaneous-movie-review/\"><em>Spontaneous</em></a>, he&#8217;s found his niche as a writer capable of blending fun, creativity, and recognizable themes into genre success. He delivers again with <em>Love and Monsters</em> even as he twists and tweaks some YA expectations.</p>\n<p>Joel&#8217;s journey through a monstrous landscape is powered by his love for Aimee, and the idea of reuniting with her sits in the air as something of a reward for his bravery. Other survivors even say as much, confirming his belief and the trope in general from years and years of fiction and film where the hero&#8217;s victory comes with a side of lady love. Of course, &#8220;Shit gets crazy in the apocalypse,&#8221; says Joel at one point, and that includes twisted expectations and unexpected outcomes.</p>\n<p>Director <strong>Michael Matthews</strong> delivers on from the promise of his 2017 debut, <em>Five Fingers for Marseilles</em>, by giving equal weight to both action set-pieces and character beats. The CG creations feel menacing and deadly, and the action sequences are both thrilling and suspenseful, but the human moments are every bit as important. Joel crosses paths with other survivors from a smart dog to a wandering pair forced together by circumstance. Clyde (<strong>Michael Rooker</strong>) has taken on a fatherly role to young Minnow (<strong>Arianna Greenblatt</strong>), and the two bring warmth and humor during their time with Joel and serve as a reminder that family&#8217;s are made as much through love as they are through blood.</p>\n<p>Every element is important, but the film rests on O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s shoulders as the lead character, the one we spend the entire film with, and the one whose voiceover narration enters our ear canals on a regular basis. Voiceover is often a death knell for a film, but rather than use it as a regurgitation of things we should be picking up visually it&#8217;s instead a window into Joel&#8217;s thought processes. He&#8217;s writing letters to Aimee recounting the ups and downs of his journey to her side, and what starts as the voice of someone saying &#8220;look at how brave I am for you!&#8221; shifts into something more honest. He&#8217;s challenged, he misses others in his life, and he comes to realize this trip is about far more than continuing a love from seven years ago.</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Brien is no stranger to YA genre fare having led <em>The Maze Runner</em> trilogy to both commercial and critical success, but he remains an under-appreciated talent outside those constraints. He&#8217;s immensely charismatic and moves effortlessly between physical action, emotional beats, and some solid comedic moments. Henwick also shines in a supporting turn and shows equally capable range. Her 2020 has already included appearances in both Duffield&#8217;s <em>Underwater</em> and Sophia Coppola&#8217;s <em>On the Rocks</em>, and she has even bigger titles on the horizon including <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> and <em>The Matrix 4</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Love and Monsters</em> challenges its lead character as it challenges its viewers. Sure, he faces death-dealing monsters and creatures, but viewers see the potential in what YA genre films can do. They don&#8217;t need to threaten a dark dystopia or promise that love awaits those who deserve it, and they can instead be bright, fun, scary, and affecting stories about what&#8217;s most important in life. Bring on <em>Love and Monsters 2</em>!</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-TwTfev8j4I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 20:49:35 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2ec0e27a9d39d35bfb0ad58675c369f3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-TwTfev8j4I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-04-43-257_7f58a289d9f5feb6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159462868},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:22","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:22","title":"‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’ Weaves Our Painful History With Jokes!","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358617","description":"<p><strong>Aaron Sorkin</strong> is not the man you go to for historical accuracy or reverence in your movies and television shows. It shouldn&#8217;t have to be said, especially as narrative films and television in general don&#8217;t &#8212; and can&#8217;t &#8212; fill that need, but Sorkin in particular is too often mistaken for a wannabe historian or educator when in reality he&#8217;s &#8220;merely&#8221; an entertainer. His latest work seemingly guaranteed to rile those on both the Right and the Left is the new Netflix film, <strong><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em></strong>. Its plea for liberty will upset some while its frequent liberties will annoy others, but if you can get past political leanings and Sorkin&#8217;s love for his own writing the film delivers where it matters most &#8212; as eye-opening entertainment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A Democratic convention is about to begin in a police state,&#8221; says a somber Walter Cronkite in archival news footage from 1968. &#8220;There just doesn&#8217;t seem to be any other way to say it.&#8221; The convention should have been home to conversation and peaceful protests, but it instead erupts into violence thanks in large part to the orders of a vindictive mayor and the actions of aggressively violent police officers. (Sorry, that&#8217;s redundant.) Richard Nixon&#8217;s incoming justice department orders the arrest and prosecution of several men to be charged under the untested and racially motivated Rap Brown Law which makes it a crime to conspire and cross state lines. The men were tagged as The Chicago 7 &#8212; or more accurately, The Chicago 8 &#8212; and it&#8217;s their journey through an imperfect and highly flawed legal system that finds life here.</p>\n<p><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> is Sorkin&#8217;s ninth feature as writer but only his second directorial effort. It&#8217;s a more cinematic outing than <em>Molly&#8217;s Game</em> (2017), but his director&#8217;s eye is still never the film&#8217;s strong suit. Instead, it&#8217;s his script, the cast, and the glimpse into one of the United States&#8217; less flattering chapters that makes for an entertaining watch that might just double as an informative one too. Audiences will laugh along with the wit and humor, and the odds are good that many of them will learn a thing or two along the way too.</p>\n<p>As mentioned at the top, Sorkin isn&#8217;t a filmmaker who feels bound by historical accuracy in his writing even while telling stories about real people and events. His last five films are fictional depictions of biographical accounts &#8212; <em>Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War</em> (2007), <em>The Social Network</em> (2010), <em>Moneyball</em> (2011), <em>Steve Jobs</em> (2015), and <em>Molly&#8217;s Game</em> &#8212; and while their entertainment value varies so do the facts on display. Sorkin champions wordplay and wit over those pesky facts, but that&#8217;s only a deal-breaker for viewers who let it be. To be clear, it&#8217;s an understandable deal-breaker, but if you can get past that, Sorkin&#8217;s latest offers a damning glimpse into our recent past that holds up a sad mirror to today&#8217;s tumultuous America. That it does so while being entertaining and laugh out loud funny is no small feat.</p>\n<p>The trial was an uphill battle for the accused and their lawyers (<strong>Mark Rylance</strong>, <strong>Ben Shenkman</strong>) &#8212; the judge (<strong>Frank Langella</strong>) was old, conservative, and possibly incompetent, the prosecutors (<strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong>, <strong>J.C. MacKenzie</strong>) were intent on sending a message, and the full weight of the U.S. government was pressing on their backs. They were on trial for carrying &#8220;certain ideas across state lines&#8221; with a law established to prevent African Americans from gathering in dissent, and the argument that these protestors were interested only in violence is a lie that&#8217;s still told today. Too many Americans are unaware of this, and as similar events unfold across our televisions in the year 2020 it&#8217;s a reminder that&#8217;s absolutely, and sadly, necessary.</p>\n<p>Sorkin&#8217;s script is vibrant and alive, and he&#8217;s assembled a talented pool of players to bring these real people to fictional life in <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em>. <strong>Jeremy Strong</strong> and <strong>Sacha Baron Cohen</strong> play Youth International Party leaders Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, respectively, and while both actors are ten to fifteen years older than their characters were at the time that detail doesn&#8217;t hurt the effect generated by their skill and charisma. Students for a Democratic Society leaders Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden are played by <strong>Alex Sharp</strong> and <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>, the latter with a slightly distracting actor affectation that sees his left shoulder constantly slumping, and <strong>John Carroll Lynch</strong> plays noted pacifist David Dellinger.</p>\n<p>Bobby Seale, the National Chairman of the Black Panther Party, played a supporting role in the real-world case as prosecutors added him into the mix despite there being no evidence he was associated with the others &#8212; hence the distinction for some between the Chicago 7 and the Chicago 8. Seale&#8217;s presence was of great importance, though, and that comes through in <strong>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</strong>&#8216;s performance. While other characters are a bit showy, Seale is a more serious man fighting for even greater stakes, and Abdul-Mateen delivers a charismatically imposing figure who reminds people that this nation&#8217;s sins started long before the 60s. Sorkin captures the moment in which Seale was literally bound and gagged during the trial, and while he shortens the true duration dramatically for more immediate effect it remains an unavoidably powerful sequence.</p>\n<p><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> plays fast and loose with minor facts and biographical details in exchange for a well-paced and entertaining watch. The big truths, though, are all here, and they paint a deservedly critical picture of a government terrified of dissent by its people and of losing control. It was a sad and bitter pill to swallow in the late 60s, but it&#8217;s a far more depressing truth to see how little things have changed over half a century later.</p>\n<img
