But all those irregular shapes tend to be inefficient when it comes to packaging. So what if you could buy your pasta of choice in a simple, compact 2D form and then watch it take on the desired final 3D shape as it cooks, thereby doubling the fun factor? Scientists at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) have figured out a simple mechanism to do just that, according to <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf4098\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>\n<p>\"We were inspired by flat-packed furniture and how it saved space, made storage easier, and reduced the carbon footprint associated with transportation,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2021-05/cmu-cll043021.php\">said co-author Lining Yao</a>, director of the <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/liningy/www/index.html\">Morphing Matter Lab</a> at CMU's School of Computer Science. \"We decided to look at how the morphing matter technology we were developing in the lab could create flat-packed pastas that offered similar sustainability outcomes.\" According to the team's calculations, even if you pack macaroni pasta perfectly, you will still end up with as much as 67 percent of the volume being air. The ability to make flat pasta for shipping that takes on a specific 3D shape when cooked is one potential solution.</p>\n<p>Yao and co-author Wen Wang, also at CMU, began experimenting with what they term \"transformative appetite,\" or shape-changing food, several years ago, inspired by their work with a bacterium that would shrink or expand in response to humidity—the same bacterium used to ferment soybeans to create <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D\"><em>natto</em></a>, a popular Japanese breakfast dish that frankly smells a bit like aged cheese (and hence can be an acquired taste).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762605#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762605&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 18:05:31 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"9349c00ce7c5b0dfe7866b025144af4a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn59@2020_6/2021/05/06/16-09-50-304_4d50ea5fb898fdf2.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn59@2020_6/2021/05/06/16-09-50-304_4d50ea5fb898fdf2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DM9h2_gfUjk:jsZrqT7c_Qk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn95@2020_1/2021/05/06/16-09-56-298_46a2a0e29bb32d6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-715_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-559_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620317381019},{"createdTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","title":"At trial, Epic and Apple squeeze Microsoft over Xbox, xCloud restrictions","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762866","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/xbox-walnut.jpg\" alt=\"The monkey wrench of the legal system.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">The monkey wrench of the legal system.

Shorts are 15- to 60-second videos that, on mobile, launch in a full-screen, vertical video interface that users can swipe between. Shorts are just an alternative interface for YouTube videos, and on the desktop site or on a channel page, Shorts appear as regular videos in the normal YouTube interface.</p>\n<p>A big draw for TikTok is the video editor, which comes with all sorts of effects, music, filters, and variable playback speeds. YouTube's Shorts editor doesn't have nearly as many features as Tiktok, but Google says that \"over the next year, we'll be releasing a ton of new filters and effects so you can get the vibe you want.\"</p>\n<p>Even if you don't want to watch Shorts, the most noticeable change from this rollout will be a new \"Shorts\" tab in the mobile app. The tab will live in the bottom app-wide tab bar. This will give users a dedicated space to explore all the TikTok-type content people have been creating, and it provides a blazingly bright app-wide advertisement for the new feature. The bottom tab bar is premium real estate in the YouTube app—it's present on nearly every screen of the app, and it elevates Shorts to the same importance level as \"Subscriptions,\" \"Library,\" and the home page. Previously, Shorts only appeared in an easily ignorable horizontal carousel on the home screen. Shorts will be taking the spot of the \"Explore\" tab, which shows trending videos. The Explore page has been demoted to the home page.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762710#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762710&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 16:11:21 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-980x1021.jpg","linkMd5":"80b133357771d1f045798c10fe111080","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_1/2021/05/06/16-09-53-526_6292e00e14e49aee.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":1021,"sourceBytes":115888,"destBytes":62482,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-980x1021.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_1/2021/05/06/16-09-53-526_6292e00e14e49aee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn27@2020_6/2021/05/06/16-09-56-382_729193bc68b57797.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=06CJ8Ikm0sg:SwaLSPgER8k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-385_8437a1031f929611.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-715_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-559_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620317381019},{"createdTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","title":"Fix for critical Qualcomm chip flaw is making its way to Android devices","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763019","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/phone-security-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Fix for critical Qualcomm chip flaw is making its way to Android devices\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/phone-security.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"668\" data-width=\"1000\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Makers of high-end Android devices are responding to the discovery of a Qualcomm chip flaw that researchers say could be exploited to partially backdoor about a third of the world’s smartphones.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability, discovered by researchers from security firm Check Point Research, resides in Qualcomm’s Mobile Station Modem, a system of chips that provides capabilities for things like voice, SMS, and high-definition recording, mostly on higher-end devices made by Google, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, and OnePlus.

Since then, the booster that put the component into orbit has been circulating in an unstable orbit, and various tracking organizations are indicating that it's likely to come back in a completely uncontrolled manner. It's a big-enough piece of hardware that some parts are likely to survive until they reach the ground. While odds are that will happen over the ocean, there's no guarantee re-entry won't happen over a populated area.</p>\n<p>As Ars' Eric Berger <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/large-chunks-of-a-chinese-rocket-missed-new-york-city-by-about-15-minutes/\">described last year</a>, the Long March 5B has an unusual design. Meant for heavy lifts to orbit, the rocket doesn't have an upper stage; instead, its main stage travels all the way to orbit with its payload. Once there, one option is to leave it in a stable orbit, where it would add to the increasing clutter in low Earth orbit. The alternative is to de-orbit the stage.</p>\n<p>Most countries have settled on a controlled de-orbit, in which control is maintained over the booster and enough fuel is retained to allow decisions to be made about when the hardware re-enters the atmosphere. That allows any material that survives re-entry to land harmlessly in the ocean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762950#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762950&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 10:45:42 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1249929721-800x500.jpg","linkMd5":"1ca9d3a5a779dd8a2326fc7366b679b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn66@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-55-377_768661e1934a4c03.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":117645,"destBytes":73798,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1249929721-800x500.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn66@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-55-377_768661e1934a4c03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_3/2021/05/06/16-09-56-316_60c62abec2df6580.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=cVI-1iNapNc:CuUmpkgiVsg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-449_ec1a3e68a357aac7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-715_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-559_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620317381019},{"createdTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","title":"Google tries to resurrect Android tablets with “Entertainment Space”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762752","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1._Blog_header.max-1000x1000-980x552.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Entertainment Space.

For media, you have this big custom interface on the left.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762752#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762752&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 22:29:52 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1._Blog_header.max-1000x1000-980x552.png","linkMd5":"4428e61fa443b2500a860699239dcd98","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_3/2021/05/06/16-09-53-455_a9c47008579f92fe.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":552,"sourceBytes":351156,"destBytes":43088,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1._Blog_header.max-1000x1000-980x552.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_3/2021/05/06/16-09-53-455_a9c47008579f92fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_2/2021/05/06/16-09-56-442_7cd3d6a463889338.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=2FS4bSHNBSI:mxuu9WkyoW0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn64@2020_3/2021/05/06/16-09-56-399_1631295a235e50f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-715_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-559_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620317381020},{"createdTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","title":"Appeals court allows parents to sue Snap over 100 mph car crash","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762775","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-687602330-800x513.jpg\" alt=\"Stock photo of extreme close-up of redline speedometer.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-687602330.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"3397\" data-width=\"5300\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?assettype=image&#38;family=creative&#38;license=rf&#38;photographer=Peter%20Dazeley&#38;sort=best#license\">Peter Dazeley / Getty Images</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p></p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right medium\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-1.03.24-PM.png\"><img alt=\"The Snapchat speed filter in action.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-1.03.24-PM-300x532.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-1.03.24-PM-640x1134.png 2x\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-05-at-1.03.24-PM.png\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Snapchat speed filter in action.</a> (credit: 9th Circuit opinion)</p></div>A California federal appeals court has <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf\">denied</a> legal immunity to Snapchat developer Snap for the 2017 death of two teens and a 20-year-old when their car crashed into a tree at 113 miles per hour (180 km/h). Parents of two of the boys sued Snap, arguing that Snapchat's \"speed filter\" encouraged the boys to accelerate their car to more than 100 miles per hour.\n<p>Last year, Snap convinced a federal trial judge that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shielded Snap from liability in the case. The once-obscure 1996 law has become a frequent source of controversy as technology giants have used it to disclaim responsibility for harmful content on their platforms.</p>\n<p>Snap argued that the law gave it immunity in the boys' death. Snapchat pioneered the use of image filters, a feature that has been widely copied by other apps. In 2017, Snapchat's offerings included a speed filter that displayed a user's current speed—either on its own or superimposed on the user's photo. Users could use this filter to show their friends how fast they were moving at the time of the post.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762775#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762775&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=JEcQWlUkO44:-f33-BgwbNw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 20:36:26 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-687602330-800x513.jpg","linkMd5":"946d96ac799430e5c701a69be30ae641","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn15@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-55-420_976630594aa0c2b8.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":55930,"destBytes":20146,"author":"Timothy B.

On Wednesday afternoon, the sport formally unveiled its new race car, called the Next Gen. It makes its racing debut in 2022, and it's a radical upgrade for a series that has earned a reputation—unfairly, as it happens—as a low-tech zone.</p>\n<p>As I found out in 2018, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/nascars-high-tech-world-leave-any-preconceptions-behind-for-this-deep-dive/\">stock car racing is no place for luddites</a>. But a casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that, based on the specs of the sport's current Gen6 car. Transmissions with only four speeds, wheels with five lug nuts, and a solid rear axle all seem highly anachronistic to fans of most other types of motorsport. But from next year, all that stuff is gone.</p>\n<h2>Now, that actually looks like a modern race car</h2>\n<p>At its core, the Next Gen car sticks with a steel tubeframe chassis with integrated roll cage. But it's clothed in composite body panels, not aluminum, and the bodies are now symmetrical. At the front, the most noticeable difference is that the cars from Chevrolet, Ford, and Toyota really do look like Chevys, Fords, and Toyotas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763026#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763026&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=MsThMCSXcaQ:Y121X0deHwM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 13:13:10 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1316505454-980x653.jpg","linkMd5":"1cf1012adbf67a628a8f3ad1d38b89c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn77@2020_2/2021/05/06/16-09-50-601_fab6aac5f958e5f2.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":653,"sourceBytes":89641,"destBytes":48316,"author":"Jonathan M.

We were the first to get our hands on the new Superpods, which retail at $159 apiece. Plume recommended four Superpods total for our 3,500-square-foot test house, so that's precisely how we tested.</p>\n<p>To give the Superpod design every chance to shine, we used a new Wi-Fi 6 enabled test fleet—one equipped with <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/130293/intel-wi-fi-6-ax201-gig.html\">Intel AX201</a> Wi-Fi 6 adapters in place of the 802.11ac <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/83635/intel-dual-band-wireless-ac-7265.html\">Intel 7265</a> adapters in our old test fleet. But replacing the test fleet means needing to generate new baselines. So rather than re-using old tests, we broke out our original 802.11ac Superpods and a three-piece 802.11ac <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33fabYD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Eero mesh kit</a> to serve as a competitive measurement baseline.</p>\n<p>All three of these kits are top performers—including the Amazon Eero, which routinely beats much higher-spec and higher-priced kits in our testing.

The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/blue-origin-teases-more-images-of-its-new-shepard-capsule/\">capsule itself</a> is relatively spacious and is equipped with large windows and cushy-looking seats, which are clearly meant to make flight a pleasant experience. The free fall is followed by a parachute-assisted landing, with the booster performing a powered landing separately.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like a compelling experience to you, your first chance to get in on it is via an auction for a single seat on its first crewed flight. You can get the process started now by submitting a bid at the Blue Origin website. On May 19, the highest bids will be unsealed, and any further online bidding will have to exceed an existing bid. On June 12, the auction will wrap up with live online bidding.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762790#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762790&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 May 2021 18:22:36 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blue2-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"029f0ec96179a455c2035515e7e8930f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-51-543_38f22e1349cea0b6.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":78986,"destBytes":50428,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blue2-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-51-543_38f22e1349cea0b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-436_974551d5e466f8b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=SLehY7Gk_Bo:gojTSkFUvcY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn53@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-385_52498ef2acbc3087.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/06/16-09-56-715_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_4/2021/05/06/16-09-56-559_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620317381020}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-07 00:09:41","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 16:09:41 +0000","fetchMs":91,"handleMs":370,"totalMs":26237,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bc1eecef1292254c09de6c1e66b750f3","hostName":"europe67*","requestId":"52404c2893eb451a8084eb3387662e32_2","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":861390,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":63,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":63,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":2,"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx7":3,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx10":3,"myreaderx4":2,"myreaderx32":2,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx11":2,"myreaderx12":2,"myreaderx2":2,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":2,"myreaderx18":2,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":3,"myreaderx27":2,"myreaderx21":2,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":2,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 13:47:33","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/05/05-47-27-309_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
