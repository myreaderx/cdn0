Though the universe contains innumerable galaxies flung across time and space, no two ever look alike. One of the most photogenic is the huge spiral galaxy UGC 2885, located 232 million light-years away in the northern constellation, Perseus. It's a whopper even by galactic standards. The galaxy is 2.5 times wider than our Milky Way and contains 10 times as many stars, about 1 trillion. This galaxy has lived a quiescent life by not colliding with other large galaxies. It has gradually bulked up on intergalactic hydrogen to make new stars at a slow and steady pace over many billions of years. The galaxy has been nicknamed \"Rubin's galaxy,\" after astronomer Vera Rubin (1928 – 2016). Rubin used the galaxy to look for invisible dark matter. The galaxy is embedded inside a vast halo of dark matter. The amount of dark matter can be estimated by measuring its gravitational influence on the galaxy's rotation rate.</p> </br></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 05 Jan 2020 20:15:00 +0000","feedId":17949,"bgimg":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/31984/STSCI-H-p2001a-f-9917x7438.png","linkMd5":"fd646c3a8cf0eb79ffdb9c730269fe90","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn62@2020_6/2020/11/18/06-31-59-306_e8b6586fa3d5da40.webp","destWidth":9917,"destHeight":7438,"sourceBytes":137274594,"destBytes":324864,"author":"outreach@stsci.edu (Space Telescope Science Institute)","enclosureType":"image/png","enclosureUrl":"//imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/31984/STSCI-H-p2001a-f-9917x7438.png","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/story/display_image/1330/low_STSCI-H-p2001a-k-1340x520.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn63@2020_5/2020/11/18/06-31-38-081_a62b0bb48be012a6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605681096803}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 14:31:36","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 14:31:36","feedId":17949,"fetchDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:31:36 +0000","fetchMs":1245,"handleMs":274,"totalMs":27855,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":1217,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ec8e5bf04681effb26c67cecccdf7deb","hostName":"europe65*","requestId":"7b7a904de4a04c7a923a60f3cf8bda7f_17949","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":14088,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx33":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:16:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:48:47","id":17949,"name":"Hubble - News feed","url":"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newscenter_rss.php","subscriber":185,"website":null,"icon":"https://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/collection/image_attachment/2/RSS_image_news.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/06/18-48-45-631_3a7d6e7bc0a840c8.jpg","description":"This news collection compiles news releases and supporting materials published by the Officeof Public Outreach of the Space Telescope Science Institute, to further your knowledge of astronomy.
