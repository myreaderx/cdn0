Nowadays,\r\ncolloidal particles can be fabricated to have shapes of knots and links with arbitrary complexity.\r\nIn liquid crystals, closed loops of singular vortex lines can be knotted by using colloidal\r\nparticles and laser tweezers, as well as by confining nematic fluids into micrometer-sized droplets\r\nwith complex topology. Knotted and linked colloidal particles induce knots and links of singular\r\ndefects, which can be interlinked (or not) with colloidal particle knots, revealing the diversity of\r\ninteractions between topologies of knotted fields and topologically nontrivial surfaces of colloidal\r\nobjects. Even more diverse knotted structures emerge in nonsingular molecular alignment and\r\nmagnetization fields in liquid crystals and colloidal ferromagnets. The topological solitons include\r\nhopfions, skyrm...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 Sep 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":12378,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8ed423555d06f782cfe63af190cce421","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Ivan I Smalyukh","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603192809339}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 19:20:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 19:20:09","feedId":12378,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:20:09 +0000","fetchMs":39502,"handleMs":20,"totalMs":39526,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bfdf66e8c15fccdb23d86275e6f5be02","hostName":"us-032*","requestId":"921b6117e44246bd9d7e2c9c8f9aa23d_12378","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:35","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 10:27:04","id":12378,"name":"Reports on Progress in Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/?rss=1","subscriber":250,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/19/02-26-54-176_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Reports on Progress in Physics","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603192769823,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":39503,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":20,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
