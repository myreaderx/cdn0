Sinopharm, a state-affiliated pharmaceutical company, launched large-scale human trials in the United Arab Emirates in June.</p><p>The same month, Sinovac, another Chinese vaccine maker, announced their own clinical trial program in Brazil. Both companies have <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005855/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-makers-are-going-abroad-for-human-trials\" target=\"_blank\">gone overseas</a> for clinical trials amid dwindling COVID-19 cases in China.</p><p>The purpose of introducing the vaccine on an emergency basis is to “build immune barriers” among medical workers and key staff to ensure that cities continue to function normally, Zheng said. He added that the scope of emergency use might be expanded in order to prevent a potential rebound in autumn or winter.</p><p>Last week, Sinopharm <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006071/china-will-have-a-covid-19-vaccine-by-years-end%2C-sinopharm-says\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> that China’s first vaccine against the novel coronavirus would be available to the public in December at a cost of up to 1,000 yuan ($145). In Saturday’s news segment, Zheng suggested that the price of such a vaccine would likely be lower than initially estimated.</p><p><em>Contributions: Ye Ruolin; editor: David Paulk.</em></p><p><em>(Header image: E+/People Visual)</em></p><p></p><div class=\"sharing sharing-news visible-xs visible-sm\">\n                </div>\n                    <div class=\"advertise-1\">\n                        <div id=\"dfp-horizontal-ads\">\n                            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                                googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n                                    googletag.display('dfp-horizontal-ads');\n                                });\n                            </script>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n<img class=\"img\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/86.jpg\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\">\n<img class=\"img\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/951.jpg\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\">\n<img class=\"img\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/964.jpg\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\">\n<img class=\"img\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/975.jpg\" width=\"426\" height=\"240\"></div>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":3345,"bgimg":"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/90.jpg","linkMd5":"bd02c18d4cbb292db37cf3339bc01c5a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-30-16-537_aa52d020d4d9b848.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":81853,"destBytes":44662,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/90.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-30-16-537_aa52d020d4d9b848.webp","http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/86.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-30-18-079_5728e6de97b7597a.webp","http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/951.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-30-18-089_717af2e37e0fc4ff.webp","http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/964.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-30-18-016_78d71073f1b74825.webp","http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/29/975.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-30-17-997_d86491a3ed81c370.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598304616220},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:30:16","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:30:16","title":"Bank Worker Slapped, Insulted for Not Drinking With Colleagues","link":"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006093/Bank Worker Slapped, Insulted for Not Drinking With Colleagues","description":"<div><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/80.jpg\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n                    <div class=\"advertise-2\">\n                        <div id=\"dfp-vertical-ads\">\n                            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                                googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n                                    googletag.display('dfp-vertical-ads-alt');\n                                });\n                            </script>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>A bank in Beijing has been chastised for its “revolting” workplace drinking culture after a new clerk was insulted and slapped for not drinking alcohol during an informal banquet.</p><p></p><p>In a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ATUCR3soWsaMMHwLO8Y0ZA\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Monday, the Beijing branch of Xiamen International Bank confirmed that some employees had “behaved inappropriately” and “caused harm” to the new hire, surnamed Yang.

Produced in partnership with Yitiao.tv</p>\n    </section>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>The 52-year-old says he feels a deep affinity for the old railways and their mostly blue-collar passengers. For him, they represent a part of China that’s often overlooked.</p><p>“The green trains are a metaphor for the life of the underclass,” Qian tells Sixth Tone. “They’re too slow to keep up with the pace of modernization.”</p><p>Qian’s obsession with the green trains began in the eastern city of Wuxi, where he was born in 1968. After high school, he found work as an electrician at the city’s first hotel to be established with foreign investment: the Wuxi Grand Hotel.</p><p></p><p>The job paid a working-class wage, but it had one big advantage: It gave Qian access to foreign television channels like Japan’s NHK, which were specially licensed to the hotel. Inspired by the sumptuous travel documentaries he avidly consumed, Qian started to dream of roaming the country as a backpacker.</p><p>Fate, however, had other ideas. Qian was diagnosed with nasopharynx cancer in 2000 and spent the next few years bouncing between hospital wards, undergoing endless checkups and tortuous courses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. </p><p>When he finally got the all-clear in 2006, Qian’s wanderlust returned with a vengeance. Aware of the possibility of a relapse, he felt he could no longer put his life on hold.</p><p>“Instead of spending money at the hospital, I’d rather spend it on the road,” Qian recalls thinking.</p><p>His first trip was reckless. China had just opened a new rail line connecting the northwestern province of Qinghai with the Tibet Autonomous Region in 2006, and Qian was determined to see Lhasa’s Buddhist temples for the first time. The doctor warned the high altitude could be life-threatening to someone with his condition, but Qian didn’t listen.</p><p>“I don’t worry about what will happen tomorrow, or what will happen next year,” says Qian. “I just need to go out and take a look while I still have the strength.”</p><p>From then on, Qian went traveling every time he could get a break from his job at the Wuxi Grand. Whenever possible, he rode the green train. </p><p>At first, riding the old railways was simply a way to reduce costs. The green trains are the cheapest transportation method in China, and to this day Qian only makes 2,000 yuan ($290) per month as an electrician.</p><p>Though onboard coal stoves keep the old trains warm during the winter, these trips were rarely comfortable. At peak times, green trains are often packed and noisy, the floors strewn with luggage, vendors’ merchandise, and piles of trash.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/37.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Train 3316 from Huaihua, Hunan province to Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Feb. 27, 2015.

Courtesy of Qian Haifeng</p></div><p></p><p>For the first few years, Qian would ignore the chaos around him and drink in the scenery through the carriage window, snapping away on his secondhand Nikon. He’d bought the camera soon after his daughter was born in 1995, and he’d gradually become a keen shutterbug — though he’s entirely self-taught.</p><p>The idea to train his lens on his fellow passengers came in 2008, when he saw Wang Fuchun’s famous photo series “<a href=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1819538\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese on the Train</a>.” Qian, whose work is now often compared to the legendary Chinese photographer, is frank about the influence Wang had on him.</p><p>“I thought to myself: ‘I could do the same as Wang Fuchun,’” he says. “Since then, I started to document life on the train.”</p><p>From the beginning, Qian showed a talent for capturing the inner lives of his subjects. He chalks this up to his blue-collar background, which gave him a sense of kinship with the often-impoverished people he encountered on winding rural lines. </p><p>“If you just try to be a hipster by occasionally seeing and feeling the hardness of life, it will only be a short-term memory,” says Qian. “It won’t reach into the heart.”</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/17.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Train L208 from Urumqi to Xuzhou, Nov. 14, 2013. Courtesy of Qian Haifeng\"><p class=\"image_desc\" style=\"text-align: center;  margin-top: 15px;  font-size: 12px;  color: #666;\">Train L208 from Urumqi to Xuzhou, Nov. 14, 2013. Courtesy of Qian Haifeng</p></div><p></p><p>The most memorable journey for Qian was a 58-hour cross-country ride from the northwestern city of Urumqi to Xuzhou, near China’s eastern coastline, in 2013. The carriage was crowded with cotton farmers returning to their hometowns in the central Henan province. Every seat was taken, and people were packed so tightly in the aisle that accessing the toilet was nearly impossible.</p><p>Qian spent the first night taking photographs, but by the second day he was exhausted. He spent the rest of the trip switching between three equally awkward positions: standing, squatting, and sitting on the floor.</p><p>“When you see the positions of these people on the train, you’re also seeing my experience — how I ate and slept in the aisle,” says Qian.</p><p></p><p>By this time, however, Qian had started to realize the Mao-era rail network was in terminal decline. In 2010, China had opened its first major high-speed railway connecting the eastern cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. The same year, the green train running between Shanghai and Beijing stopped operating.</p><p>“The development of the high-speed rail is actually eliminating the slow trains,” says Qian. “The first to disappear are the green trains, which don’t have air conditioning.”</p><p>In 2012, Qian began obsessively documenting the disappearing green trains. Pulling up information from ticketing websites like 12306 and train-spotting blogs, he created a map of China’s existing green train routes and tried to visit as many as possible. </p><p>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t keep up with the changes: Many lines silently stopped running before Qian got a chance to photograph them. Today, China has over 35,000 kilometers of high-speed rail lines, while only 80 of the ’50s-era green trains are still functioning.</p><p>For Qian, the lack of coverage this transition has received in Chinese media is frustrating. While mainstream titles often gush over the opening of a new railway, the retirement of old trains rarely gets mentioned.</p><p>Yet the phasing out of the green trains is quite literally marginalizing entire communities who can’t afford to ride the new high-speed network, Qian says.</p><p>In most major stations, the platforms are now reserved for high-speed trains at peak hours. People riding the slow train have to catch red-eyes in the middle of the night.</p><p>   </p><p>\n        <span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">\n            <div data-gallery=\"true\" class=\"gallery\">\n            \n           \n                <button type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#custom-modal-0\" data-backdrop=\"static\" data-keyboard=\"false\" class=\"btn-full-screen\"><span class=\"noodle-icon-full-screen\"></span></button>\n                <div id=\"custom-modal-0\" data-custom-modal=\"true\" class=\"modal custom-modal\">\n                    <button type=\"button\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" class=\"close-modal\">×</button>\n                    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n                        <div data-slider=\"true\" class=\"slider slider-for\">\n                        <div class=\"slider-item\">\n                                <figure>\n                                    <div style=\"background-image:url('http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/50.jpg')\" class=\"wrap-photo\"></div>\n                                    <figcaption class=\"slider-caption\">\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:15px; font-size:12px; color:#666;\">\n                                            <strong>1/6 </strong>\n                                            Train 3070 from Anqing, Anhui province to Beijing, Feb. 19, 2016.

A few years ago, the photographer met three migrant workers sleeping outside a station. After chatting with them, he discovered they planned to catch a green train due to depart in two days’ time. They didn’t have enough money to get home any other way.</p><p>On China’s prosperous eastern coastline, green trains have completely disappeared. They only return during the Lunar New Year holiday, when the government organizes additional long-distance trains to allow migrants to return to their hometowns.</p><p>Each year, Qian faithfully documents the annual travel rush: It’s the one time when this largely invisible underclass is acknowledged by the rest of society, he says. </p><p></p><p>“All you have to do is to board a green train … and you’ll understand how many people on low incomes exist in China,” says Qian.</p><p>The photographer above all worries about what will happen to the many rural communities in western China that rely on the old railways.</p><p>In 2014 and 2015, he took several trains in the southwestern Guizhou province, where he encountered many farmers who brought their produce to local markets by rail. While the fare on the green train was 3 yuan, a return bus ticket was 60 yuan — far more than the farmers made each day selling their vegetables.</p><p>“Preserving the green trains will preserve the freedom to travel for those underclass workers,” says Qian. “Or at least maintain their dignity.”</p><p>Over recent years, Qian’s growing success as a photographer has helped bring these issues wider attention. In 2015, the Wuxi native won the grand prize at the Lianzhou International Photo Festival, one of China’s top photography awards. His work now regularly appears in major Chinese media, galleries, and festivals.</p><p>Yet Qian acknowledges his dream of saving the country’s last green trains is unlikely to come true. At least it’s been a good ride, he shrugs.</p><p>“If my salary remains the same when high-speed trains become the only option, I’ll just have to stay at home, flipping through old photos,” says Qian.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/19.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Train 1470 from Xuzhou, Jiangsu province to Harbin, Heilongjiang province, July 21, 2008.

troupe.</p><p>Last August, the Canadian entertainment company launched its first resident show in Asia in years — a lavish production titled “X: The Land of Fantasy” — in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.</p><p>At the time, the premiere appeared to herald the start of a new era for Cirque, whose global showbiz empire already encompassed over 40 shows. China’s live events market was booming, surpassing 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) for the first time in 2019. Foreign franchises from “Mamma Mia!” to “Cats” were filling arenas across the country.</p><p>Then, COVID-19 happened.</p><p></p><p>The global lockdowns decimated the entertainment industries in China and across the world. By March, Cirque de Soleil had halted its entire roster of shows and laid off over 90% of its staff. Its Chinese adventure appeared to be on shaky ground.</p><p>Yet, somehow, the company’s new Hangzhou-based show has survived. It’s now one of only two Cirque productions operating worldwide.</p><p>The improbable feat owes much to the deep pockets of “X”’s Chinese backers, but also to the ingenuity of its cast. With key artists stranded overseas, the troupe faced a herculean task keeping the show on the road. </p><p><strong>Curtain Falls</strong></p><p>Acrobat He Guowei still recalls the anxiety he felt on Jan. 23, when word began to spread through the troupe that the creative director was calling an emergency meeting after that night’s show.</p><p>Up to that point, there had been no indication “X” was in trouble. Over the previous months, He had performed over 100 shows to a total of nearly 100,000 spectators. The high-tech arena specially built to host the circus act in downtown Hangzhou had attracted good crowds nearly every night.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/64.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"He Weiguo demonstrates his juggling skills backstage at the Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, July 8, 2020.\"><p class=\"image_desc\" style=\"text-align: center;  margin-top: 15px;  font-size: 12px;  color: #666;\">He Weiguo demonstrates his juggling skills backstage at the Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, July 8, 2020.</p></div><p></p><p>What’s more, “X” had always been designed as a long-term project. Cirque had been meticulously planning a new China base for years, opening talks with its local partner — real estate group Hangzhou Xintiandi — about a co-production as early as 2015.</p><p>The two sides had left nothing to chance. Xintiandi — which acted as the show’s investor, owner, and operations manager — oversaw the creation of a giant new venue to host the performances. Converted from a machinery factory in downtown Hangzhou, the state-of-the-art auditorium features a 100-meter-long stage and two seating areas, each capable of rotating 360 degrees.</p><p>In 2018, He had been hired along with a troupe of acrobats from the northern city of Tianjin. To prepare for their new roles, Cirque flew the Chinese performers to its Montreal headquarters, where they underwent three months of training.</p><p>“We learned a lot over there, from music to performance and creativity,” says He. “And our individual understanding of art really developed, too.”</p><p>After their return, they joined a team of over 200 people — about one-third of whom were non-Chinese — that created the new show together over the first eight months of 2019.</p><p>“X: The Land of Fantasy” was carefully crafted to blend Chinese elements into Cirque’s time-tested creative formula. The 75-minute performance followed the story of two heroes as they tried to bring about peace between their warring kingdoms, interspersed with battle scenes, operatic singing, and high-wire action.</p><p>And it seemed to work. Dressed as a “shadow warrior” — one of many dark, ninja-like henchmen who pursue the story’s heroes — He recalls the elation he felt on opening night as he emerged from a pit in the stage floor before 1,500 spectators.</p><p>“In my mind’s eye, I could see all those Cirque videos I’d seen before, flashing before me. But now, it was me in the frame,” says the 32-year-old, who started training to be an acrobat at the age of 12. “It was really like a dream come true.”</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/61.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"525\" align=\"middle\" alt=\"He Guowei (on the floor) trains with two fellow acrobats in his apartment in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province during lockdown.

Courtesy of He</p></div><p></p><p>But as soon as the director started speaking after the January show, He and his colleagues realized this dream was under threat.</p><p>The director said the Chinese government had issued a total ban on live performances to curb the spread of a novel coronavirus, which had emerged in the central city of Wuhan a few weeks earlier.</p><p>Cirque’s entire run of shows was called off indefinitely, with the expectation that the ban would last until at least mid-February. Across China, this ban would ultimately cause <a href=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_7798124\" target=\"_blank\">over 20,000</a> live shows to be delayed or cancelled during the first three months of the year.</p><p>The same day, Wuhan — a sprawling metropolis of 11 million people — was dramatically locked down, with all buses, trains, and cars prevented from entering or leaving the city.</p><p></p><p>He recalls feeling shell-shocked after the meeting. It was the day before Lunar Near Year's Eve — a major holiday in China, akin to Christmas in the West, when families traditionally gather. Yet the acrobat was stranded 1,200 kilometers from his hometown in northern China, uncertain what was about to happen.</p><p>“We were very low and fearful,” He tells Sixth Tone. “We didn’t have a clue what the virus was going to be like … and how long it would go on for.”</p><p>For the next two months, He found himself trapped in his apartment with two other acrobats. They only went outside once a week to stock up on food.</p><p>The performers didn’t know whether the show would ever resume, but they still needed to keep up an intense physical training regime. In one scene in “X,” He is required to lie at the bottom of a huge human tower, holding up four men with just his legs.</p><p>“What we do isn’t like other jobs, where when you’re resting, you can completely relax at home and do nothing,” says He. “We had to maintain our physiques at home, but we had no idea how long we’d be doing it, or what it was all for.”</p><p>Unable to go outside due to Hangzhou’s strict lockdown rules, the acrobats had to get creative. In the absence of weights, they lifted each other. </p><p>In the living room, they recreated a miniature version of the human tower, with He lying at the bottom and holding up the other two with his legs. These training sessions had to be done in the morning, otherwise the neighbors would complain about the noise, He says.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/65.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"An acrobat wearing a mask performs in Shanghai, March 5, 2020.

Zhu Weihui for Sixth Tone</p></div><p></p><p>Meanwhile, foreign troupe members including Mathieu Chouinard — a Canadian actor who plays a sage-like character named The Watcher in “X” — had scattered across the world. </p><p>Initially, Chouinard says he didn’t realize how serious the virus was, figuring it couldn’t be much worse than a seasonal flu outbreak. But in February, he decided to hole up in Thailand, to avoid being affected by Hangzhou’s tightening lockdown policies. </p><p>It was only in March — as COVID-19 began to spread globally and live events companies including Cirque announced dramatic cutbacks — that he realized the show might be under threat.</p><p>“When it spread worldwide, it became a real question of, ‘OK, are we still going to have jobs in two weeks?’” says Chouinard. “It really felt like the world was changing … Performing arts was changing.”</p><p>Still unsure whether “X” would survive, but seeing that China seemed to be getting the virus under control, Chouinard flew back to Hangzhou in March. His timing was perfect: Just two weeks later, China closed its borders to foreign nationals.</p><p><strong>Picking Up the Pieces</strong></p><p>By April, life in Chinese cities appeared to be returning to normal — albeit with mandatory face mask-wearing. Wuhan had finally reopened, and the country’s bars and nightclubs were thumping once more.</p><p>Theatrical shows like Cirque, however, were still firmly shut down.</p><p>Xia Xiaoyu, Xintiandi’s general manager, spent weeks in daily contact with the district government and local tourism bureau throughout this period, trying to secure authorization for “X” to resume performances.</p><p></p><p>According to Xia, local officials were very concerned about the welfare of the show — a project they hoped would be a long-term asset for Hangzhou’s already vibrant tourism sector. But a reboot required permission from China’s higher authorities.</p><p>On May 12, the national government <a href=\"http://zwgk.mct.gov.cn/ceshi/gztz/202005/t20200513_853312.html?keywords=\" target=\"_blank\">edict</a> finally arrived, allowing shows to open across the country provided they adhere to strict virus-control measures. Xia immediately sent over an application to the authorities, and the circus got the green light to open its doors.</p><p>For the troupe, the return to work felt surreal. All employees were required to wear masks and have their temperatures checked on arrival. The whole auditorium was disinfected twice daily and its ventilation systems altered to stop air being recycled. Attendance levels were capped at 50%.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/62.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Three acrobats practice a “trampowall” act backstage at the Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, July 8, 2020.

Kenrick Davis/Sixth Tone</p></div><p></p><p>These were necessary inconveniences, but the virus would also have a major impact on the show’s content.</p><p>In an opening routine, happy “villagers” — including a fisher with a giant octopus draped over one shoulder — run amok among the audience and perform magic tricks for individual spectators. But such interactions had to be scrapped for safety reasons.</p><p>Far more seriously, 22 of the show’s 28 foreign performers — many of whom were experts in highly specialized skills that take years to master — were still stuck abroad due to China’s border restrictions.</p><p>These travel bans have forced several touring productions to delay or cancel their runs, including a Korean-produced version of the musical “Jekyll &amp; Hyde.” But for Hangzhou Cirque, the show would go on.</p><p>The crew, however, faced a daunting task getting ready for the circus’s big reopening on June 3. Around 50% of the show’s content needed to be remade, according to acrobat He.</p><p>Over a manic three-week period, “X” hired over a dozen replacement actors and acrobats from troupes across China, who had to be trained and taught the show in its entirety.</p><p>Scenes containing foreign stars were replaced and re-choreographed. A duo of figure-skating Russians was swapped out for a group of Cyr wheel performers, who roll around the stage inside giant metal hoops. The high-flying bungee rope artists were substituted for a “water meteor” juggling act. Local trampoline specialists created a simplified version of the show’s original “trampowall” segment, in which the experienced foreign artists would flip and spin off of a high vertical wall.</p><p>Changing or cutting acts is routine during Cirque shows, but making so many changes while remaining faithful to the “X” storyline was a huge challenge, according to Chouinard.</p><p>“The show was built with a plot and a storyline,” he says. “The acts themselves have meaning in the heroes’ journeys.”</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/66.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Acrobats perform during the reopening night of the Cirque du Soleil show at Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, June 3, 2020.

Courtesy of Cirque de Soleil</p></div><p></p><p>The hardest-working crewmembers were the technical team, who had to adjust the music, graphics, lighting, and animations to fit with the altered show. Each change, meanwhile, had to be discussed and approved by Cirque’s headquarters back in Canada.</p><p>“It was almost like a new creation,” says Chouinard. “It was a tremendous amount of work, but people stuck together and helped.”</p><p>Finally, 130 days after it had been shut down, “X” gave its first performance to a special audience of Chinese medical workers and other staff who had served on the front lines during the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>For He, the reopening felt nearly as emotional as the premiere, the months of effort and training in isolation finally paying off.</p><p>“I felt excited and really moved,” says He. “I felt my efforts over those two months hadn’t been wasted, and the anti-virus measures had succeeded.”</p><p><strong>An Uncertain Future</strong></p><p>Since July 8, the troupe has returned to performing 21 shows per month, just as it did before the virus. Yet the show remains under huge financial pressure.</p><p>The Hangzhou show was created at enormous expense. In <a href=\"https://www.huxiu.com/article/366377.html\" target=\"_blank\">media interviews</a>, Xia has claimed the production costs for “X” were 50% higher than similar shows in China, as Cirque insists on everything being of the highest quality and sourced from vendors of their choice.</p><p>Between February and June, Xintiandi continued to pay staff wages, venue bills, financial payments, and maintenance costs, without earning 1 yuan in income.</p><p>The Chinese firm, meanwhile, still has to pay Cirque an annual licensing fee for the show. When Sixth Tone spoke with Xia in July, she said the company was currently negotiating this year’s payment with its Canadian partner, with a slight grimace.</p><p>The deep pockets of Xintiandi have enabled the show to absorb these losses, but the current 50% attendance limit means the show can’t run profitably.</p><p>Even if the cap is lifted, it’s possible “X” could be affected by the wider economic headwinds buffeting China, Xia admits. Hangzhou is one of China’s top tourist destinations, but visitor numbers have <a href=\"http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005585/chinas-travel-firms-brace-for-make-or-break-holiday\" target=\"_blank\">plummeted</a> this year.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;height:inherit\"><img src=\"http://image5.sixthtone.com/image/5/30/63.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Spectators watch a Cirque de Soleil show at the Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, June 3, 2020.

Courtesy of Cirque de Soleil</p></div><p></p><p>Then, there’s the uncertainty surrounding Cirque de Soleil itself. In late June, the company officially <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/business/cirque-du-soleil-bankruptcy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection. It has since reached an agreement with creditors providing $900 million in debt forgiveness and $375 million in new financing, and this week Canadian private equity firm Capital Catalyst Group succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/cirque-has-new-owners-same-covid-challenges-2099170/\" target=\"_blank\">winning control</a> of the company.</p><p>As it’s owned by Xintiandi, “X” has been shielded from this turmoil. The show recently celebrated its one-year anniversary with an outdoor circus carnival in Hangzhou. But Xia says the company still needs to find new sources of income.</p><p>Over recent months, Xintiandi has begun renting out the “X” auditorium for events. The arena has already hosted a press event for the Chinese car brand Geely, a taping of the reality TV show “Go Fighting!” starring Angelababy, and a children’s theater production.</p><p>The troupe is also exploring ways to repackage the show’s content to sell to other entertainment venues, such as Xintiandi’s holiday resorts.</p><p></p><p>Yet over the long term, the show’s survival will likely depend on China’s live events market finally recovering from its post-coronavirus depression.</p><p>Wei Jiayi, who runs a media and consulting firm focused on China’s theater industry, says the 50% attendance cap is preventing most Chinese shows from reopening. High theater rental costs mean most shows need at least 60% of seats to be occupied to make a profit.</p><p>Chouinard, however, says he remains optimistic. For him, nothing can replace the magic of live performance, and so the sector is sure to bounce back eventually.</p><p>“Yes, performing arts will have to adapt, and these kinds of big shows will also have to adapt,” he says. “But there’s been no time in the history of mankind when there was no performance. We always find a way.”</p><p><em>Editor: Dominic Morgan.</em></p><p><em>(Header image: Spectators watch a Cirque de Soleil show at the Xintiandi Group Sun Theater in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, June 19, 2020.
