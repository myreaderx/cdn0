Because of geohot&rsquo;s limera1n exploit, those with devices earlier than the iPad2 can test the 5.1 jailbreak waters if they really want to, using redsn0w 0.9.10b6.  Here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<ul><li><strong>This is a *tethered* 5.1 jailbreak for non-A5 devices.</strong>  You&rsquo;ll need to use redsn0w to &ldquo;Just Boot&rdquo; your device every time it power cycles, otherwise jailbreak apps won&rsquo;t work (neither will Safari).</li>\n<li><strong>If you use ultrasn0w for your carrier unlock, be sure to use a custom IPSW to get to 5.1 first!</strong>  Don&rsquo;t ever restore to a stock Apple IPSW!  Use redsn0w&rsquo;s &ldquo;Custom IPSW&rdquo; button to create a NO_BB_* version of the 5.1 IPSW and restore to that instead of the stock one.  (That option is available only to 3GS and iPhone4-GSM owners.)  <strong>ultrasn0w itself will be updated for 5.1 in the next few days (same baseband support, not 5.1&rsquo;s baseband).</strong></li>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an old-bootrom 3GS, this jailbreak is actually untethered (redsn0w will figure that part out automatically).</li>\n<li>While we were at it, we added @pod2g&rsquo;s steaks4uce exploit to support MC models of the iPod touch 2G (whose last firmware was 4.2.1).  So now redsn0w will auto-detect and jailbreak both MB and MC versions of that older device.</li>\n<li>iBooks won&rsquo;t work until a future update of redsn0w</li>\n</ul><div><strong>Update #1b: </strong>The OS X version of redsn0w has been updated to fix an issue for those running OS X 10.5.x or earlier.</div>\n<div><strong>Update #2: </strong>Version 0.9.10b7 of redsn0w adds a collection of useful features:  It finally implements the corona-A5 jailbreak for iPhone4S and iPad2 devices still at 5.0.1.  It can also re-install that jailbreak for those who accidentally uninstalled the untether.  When stitching an IPSW, it can now grab your blobs directly from Cydia.   It now shows a lot more info about your device (for instance, whether your iPhone3G has the vulnerable baseband boot loader, or whether your iPhone3GS has the old exploitable bootrom.   (And the next new feature to be added will be built-in restore support, to provide an alternative to iTunes restores.)</div>\n<div><strong>Update #3: </strong>redsn0w 0.9.10b8 adds the ability to backup arbitrary directories or files from your device into a zip file on your Mac or PC.  The new button is Extras-&gt;Even More-&gt;Backup and it requires your device to be jailbroken with the afc2 service enabled (most jailbreaks include that).  By default it will backup your activation records from /var/root/Library/Lockdown, which is useful for everyone taking advantage of today&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://laforeta.blogspot.co.nz/2012/04/how-to-spoof.html\" target=\"_blank\">SAM unlock using Loktar_Sun&rsquo;s trick</a> (more on that in a later post!).</div>\n<div><strong>Update #3b: </strong>The 0.9.10b8b update to redsn0w makes the zip files more compatible with the native Windows explorer (which doesn&rsquo;t like leading slashes in the filenames).</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Here are the redns0w download links:</div>\n<div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_mac_0.9.10b8b.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.10b8b for OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.10b8b.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.10b8b for Windows</a> (be sure to run in Administrator mode)</li>\n</ul></div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Mar 2012 17:30:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"512ef28e1d36878b7eddb867ae7c9662","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"5x redux","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/22834622159","description":"<p>What&rsquo;s old is new again!</p>\n<p>Jailbreakers with devices that pre-date the iPad2 will always be able to downgrade (with SHSH blobs) to previous firmware versions due to geohot&rsquo;s limera1n exploit, which allows us to bypass the restrictions that Apple places on restores.  But until now, that ability has been limited to those older devices (if you have an older device and don&rsquo;t know how to do that, check the popular tutorial sites or ask in the comments below).</p>\n<p>Starting with redsn0w version 0.9.11b1, those with newer devices (iPad2, iPad3, and iPhone4S) can join the downgrade fun too!  In a radical departure from previous versions of redsn0w, it now directly supports restoring IPSWs to your device.  <strong>The first use of this new feature implements a hack that allows A5 downgrades without a bootrom-level exploit</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some important points:</p>\n<ul><li>The new feature is at Extras-&gt;Even More-&gt;Restore</li>\n<li>You cannot downgrade without the personalized SHSH blobs for your device at that lower firmware.  You need to have fetched those blobs while the signing window was open, using either Cydia&rsquo;s built-in TSS@Home feature, or with TinyUmbrella.  The new Restore screen of redsn0w lets you choose either the remote blobs or local ones (for the earlier firmware).  If you don&rsquo;t know where TinyUmbrella put your blobs, TinyUmbrella has a button that will show you (copy them out of that folder and feed them to redsn0w).</li>\n<li>The A5 downgrade method actually <strong>updates</strong> to the latest firmware before downgrading to the earlier one. <strong>This process updates your baseband to whatever is newest.</strong>  <strong>DO NOT USE THIS METHOD IF YOU RELY ON UNOFFICIAL UNLOCKS</strong> of your iPhone4S.  Those who used the temporary SAM technique to unlock their iPhones to specific SIMs shouldn&rsquo;t be affected by this baseband update.</li>\n<li>This method can be fixed by Apple with a firmware update.  It&rsquo;s a (pleasant) mystery why they haven&rsquo;t fixed it yet, because reverse-engineering of the restore ramdisk indicates they do know about it.  It&rsquo;s possibly too niche to bother to fix right now.</li>\n<li>The least-tested devices with this method are the iPad2,3 and iPad3,2 (because we don&rsquo;t have those models).  If you do and you feel like experimenting, please let us know how it turns out in the comment section below!</li>\n<li>This update involves a bunch of new redsn0w code.  We recommend sticking to the previous version 0.9.10b8b unless you&rsquo;re specifically using this new feature, until all the bugs are worked out!  (Note: If redsn0w gets stuck at the &ldquo;Waiting for device&rdquo; stage for more than 30 seconds, you&rsquo;ve hit a pesky GUI bug&hellip;that will be fixed in an upcoming version!)</li>\n</ul><p>Of course all eyes are on @pod2g for his upcoming 5.1 untethered jailbreak.  Watch <a href=\"http://pod2g-ios.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">his blog</a> or twitter feed for the latest updates about that, but in the meantime if you accidentally updated your jailbroken A5 device to something later than 5.0.1, feel free to try this new A5 firmware downgrade feature of redsn0w!</p>\n<p><strong>Update #1: </strong><strike>We accidentally left out one of the two flavors (&ldquo;9A406&rdquo;) of 5.0.1 for iPhone4S.  It&rsquo;ll be in the next update, but in the meantime check if Cydia or TU saved your blobs for the other 5.0.1 for iPhone4S (&ldquo;9A405&rdquo;).</strike> Version 0.9.11b2 adds support for that second &ldquo;9A406&rdquo; flavor of 5.0.1 for the iPhone4S.</p>\n<p><strong>Update #2: </strong>Version 0.9.11b3 should fix the spurious &ldquo;Restore failed&rdquo; messages people were sometimes getting, and it behaves better with nearby devices that have wifi syncing enabled!</p>\n<p><strong>Update #3: </strong>Version 0.9.11b4 completes the tethered JB support for 5.1.1 on A4 devices and earlier, including proper &ldquo;Stitching&rdquo; and &ldquo;Custom&rdquo; creation of NO_BB IPSWs.</p>\n<p>Here are the redns0w download links:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_mac_0.9.11b4.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.11b4 for OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.11b4.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.11b4 for Windows</a> (be sure to run in Administrator mode)</li>\n</ul>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 May 2012 10:06:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a167fec1f49a5b77bff51f3bc3ef4417","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962784},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"jailbreakme times 3","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/7295551750","description":"<p>Once again, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/comex\" target=\"_blank\">@comex</a> has resurrected <a href=\"http://www.jailbreakme.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jailbreakme.com</a> for your jailbreaking ease and pleasure!</p>\n<p>@comex developed what is now the third installment (and his second) of jailbreakme.com, the easiest way to jailbreak your iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad (including the iPad2!).  No computer is necessary for jbme3.0&hellip;just browse to <a href=\"http://www.jailbreakme.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jailbreakme.com</a> on your device and install it from there!</p>\n<p>While @comex and others have worked hard to make this as simple as possible, some people may have questions and problems may arise.  Rather than inundate comex with any questions over twitter, please consider using either our comments section below, or visit <a href=\"http://jbqa.me\" target=\"_blank\">http://jbqa.me</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Please read <a href=\"http://www.jailbreakme.com/#moreinfo\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;More Information&rdquo;</a> on the jbme3.0 page for some basic background information and ways you can thank @comex</strong>.  Here are some additional Q&amp;As beyond that:</p>\n<p>Q: Which devices and firmware versions are supported?<br/>A: In this initial release, the following configurations are supported:</p>\n<ul><li>iPad1: 4.3 through 4.3.3</li>\n<li>iPad2: 4.3.3</li>\n<li>iPhone3GS: 4.3 through 4.3.3</li>\n<li>iPhone4: 4.3 through 4.3.3</li>\n<li>iPhone4-CDMA: 4.2.6 through 4.2.8</li>\n<li>iPod touch 3g: 4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3</li>\n<li>iPod touch 4g: 4.3 through 4.3.3</li>\n</ul><p>Q: Do the holes discovered by @comex put my device at risk?<br/>A: Yes.  <strong>We recommend installing &ldquo;PDF Patcher 2&rdquo; in Cydia once you&rsquo;re jailbroken</strong> to eliminate this risk (any firmware version). </p>\n<p>Q: How does jbme3.0 differ from the existing jailbreaks?<br/>A: jbme3.0 is entirely userland-based, from start to finish.  The A5 chip in the iPad2 has no iBoot or bootrom-level exploits yet, so tools like redsn0w, PwnageTool and sn0wbreeze can&rsquo;t use the limera1n bootrom exploit to inject the jailbreak.  Even for those devices where limera1n works, jbme3.0 injects the jailbreak with a userland exploit.</p>\n<p>Q: If I&rsquo;m already jailbroken on the latest firmware, is there any advantage to jailbreaking again?<br/>A: No, but you should c<strong>onsider showing this to your friends!  Spread the jailbreaking fever.</strong></p>\n<p>Q: Are the holes exploited by jbme3.0 closed in iOS5?<br/>A: The holes still exist in the iOS5 betas, but they&rsquo;ll almost certainly be fixed by the time iOS5 is public.  However because the iPad2 had no public jailbreak yet, it probably wasn&rsquo;t worth waiting until the fall to use them.  If history repeats itself though, there will be more holes and exploits.</p>\n<p>Q: Will I permanently lose the jailbreak if I need to restore my device?<br/>A: For all except the iPad2, saving your SHSH blobs should let you always restore your device to iOS versions where this jailbreak works.  The iPad2 is a little more complicated.  If you have a wifi-only iPad2 and saved SHSH blobs, you&rsquo;re in good shape.  But<strong> if you have the GSM or CDMA iPad2, you won&rsquo;t be able to restore to 4.3.3 or lower once Apple stops signing its baseband</strong>.  There are a few ideas that might work to get around this limitation, but for now it&rsquo;s best to assume there&rsquo;s no going back to 4.3.3 once 4.3.4 is out for iPad2 GSM or CDMA owners. </p>\n<p>Q: I heard this new unionfs stuff is dangerous?<br/>A: Define dangerous :)  Seriously though, although unionfs is a huge improvement to the install time of the jailbreak, it is brand new code and there is the possibility something will go wrong.  Just keep regular backups of your media and content and you should be fine.  If there are any problems, they should appear within the first few days, so hold off and let &ldquo;everyone else&rdquo; test the waters if you&rsquo;d like.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 Jul 2011 06:43:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1e34f8ab22364e959baf6d7735e9199f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"Three years of pwnage(tool)","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/4332841631","description":"<p>Three years ago (almost to the day!), the first version of PwnageTool was released for firmware 1.1.4.  So today we&rsquo;re excited to release another edition of both PwnageTool and redsn0w to bring an untethered jailbreak for Apple&rsquo;s latest firmware, FW 4.3.1.</p>\n<p>The 4.3.1 untether exploit comes courtesy of Stefan Esser (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/i0n1c\" target=\"_blank\">@i0n1c on twitter</a>), a security researcher based in Germany.  Stefan has a <a href=\"http://www.suspekt.org\" target=\"_blank\">long history of vulnerability research</a>, and ironically his first contribution to the iPhone jailbreak community was <strong>improved security</strong> &ndash; last year he beat Apple to the punch and implemented ASLR for jailbroken iPhones with his &ldquo;antid0te&rdquo; framework.

only the injection method offered by the above tools differs.</p>\n<p>redsn0w allows owners of A4+earlier devices to install rocky-racoon two different ways:</p>\n<ul><li>backup/restore method similar to Absinthe and cinject</li>\n<li>its traditional limera1n-based ramdisk install.  If you have a lot of media on your A4 device (music, movies, TV shows, etc), then the ramdisk method is preferrred because it avoids any possibility of later problems related to syncing to iCloud (including Photo Stream and Music Match).  The ramdisk method is not available for A5 devices or later because limera1n can&rsquo;t be used.  If you&rsquo;d like to use redsn0w&rsquo;s ramdisk method, just be sure to put the A4 device in DFU or Recovery mode before starting redsn0w (otherwise it will immediately start to use the backup/restore method).</li>\n</ul><p>We&rsquo;ve also added a new redsn0w feature specifically for those who got in on the SAM unlock: you can now include your SAM tickets as part of your initial ramdisk jailbreak of iPhone4 or earlier, or alternatively you can upload your SAM tickets to any device after its been jailbroken.  redsn0w accepts either the individual SAM activation ticket plist file, or the entire zip file created by redsn0w&rsquo;s &ldquo;Backup&rdquo; button.  As usual, redsn0w continues to cover all of its previous jailbreaks and untethers (so redsn0w-0.9.12b1 covers everything from 5.1.1 all the way back to 4.1). </p>\n<p>PwnageTool also avoids any possible sync issues, but again it applies only to A4+earlier devices.  <strong>If you unlock your iPhone with ultrasn0w or a commercial method, you must use PwnageTool to avoid updating your baseband</strong> otherwise you&rsquo;ll lose the unlock.  PwnageTool will also jailbreak+untether the AppleTV2,1 5.0_2B206f (unless you customize the IPSW further, you&rsquo;ll have just basic SSH access to the device).</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to those that actually developed rocky-racoon, please visit <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=4U6DQGJ2NRVUN\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (any other links you may see are <strong>not</strong> going to the actual rocky-racoon developers, they&rsquo;re being diverted to other &ldquo;related&rdquo; or fraudulent accounts).</p>\n<p><strong>This particular jailbreak brought an unusual amount of fanfare and hoopla to the table, including &ldquo;press releases&rdquo; and other haughty silliness.  </strong>We&rsquo;d just like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that jailbreaking is about freedom, not fame and donations!</p>\n<p>Here are the download links.  Please use our comment section below to give feedback.  Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Update #1: </strong>Starting with version 0.9.12b2, redsn0w will now explicitly ask users with limera1n-able devices whether they want to inject rocky-racoon using the DFU ramdisk method or the backup/restore method (the ramdisk method is better for those with lots of media on their device that would create very large backups, and it&rsquo;s required for those with unactivated iPhones).  If you&rsquo;ll always want to use limera1n, you can select that in the Preferences pane.  It also fixes an iBooks issue on old-bootrom 3GS iPhones, and provides more useful error messages when things go wrong.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/ipad-dev.com/files/pwnagetool/PwnageTool_5.1.1.dmg?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">PwnageTool 5.1.1</a> (OS X)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_mac_0.9.12b2.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.12b2</a> (OS X)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.12b2.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.12b2</a> (Windows &ndash;

an untethered 5.0.1 jailbreak for non-A5 devices! </p>\n<p>Many of you have already been following @pod2g&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://pod2g-ios.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> where he&rsquo;s been keeping everyone up to date on his progress.  And so you know that he recently decided to push the button on a release for all devices except the new iPhone4S and iPad2.  @pod2g&rsquo;s untether involves two separate exploits and a few other &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; &ndash; and since he&rsquo;s taken the @comex approach of doing nearly everything himself, you know his plate has been full these past few months!</p>\n<p><strong>A few days ago, @pod2g gave the untether to both the iPhone devteam and the chronic devteam.</strong>  We&rsquo;ve put it into redsn0w 0.9.10 and PwnageTool, and the chronic devteam put it into a Cydia package (the same set of exploits is in all three).</p>\n<p>Here are the basic steps for how to get it:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The untether is for iOS 5.0.1 on iPhone3GS, iPhone4, iPhone4-CDMA, iPad1, iPod touch 3G, iPod touch 4G</strong></li>\n<li>If you have one of those devices and are not on 5.0.1 yet, update now!  The SHSH window is still open for 5.0.1  <strong>If you unlock via ultrasn0w or gevey</strong>, make sure you only get to 5.0.1 via a custom IPSW!  See the guides at places like <a href=\"http://iclarified.com\" target=\"_blank\">iClarified.com</a> if you don&rsquo;t know how.  <strong>Once you&rsquo;re at 5.0.1, use the latest redsn0w 0.9.10 to both jailbreak and untether.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re already at 5.0.1 with a tethered jailbreak, you have two choices:</strong> either run redsn0w 0.9.10 over your current jailbreak (deselect &ldquo;Install Cydia&rdquo; if you do that), or install the Cydia package prepared by the chronic devteam.  <strong>The patches are the same regardless of which you choose.</strong></li>\n<li>Some of you are using a hybrid 5.0/5.0.1 configuration.  If so, do not attempt to install this untether over that setup!  You will most likely get into a reboot cycle.  Do a sync and fresh restore to 5.0.1 then install the jailbreak + untether.</li>\n</ul><p>As mentioned earlier, @pod2g has spent months working on all the exploits and tricks in this untether, and many of you may be wondering how you can send donations.  Although the iPhone devteam itself doesn&rsquo;t take donations, we thought it was appropriate to provide a link at the end of the redsn0w run for you to more easily donate directly to @pod2g if you wish (alternatively, you can go right <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=VLSHU7DG68H52\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).  There&rsquo;s a link in the Cydia package for donating to the chronic devteam for the Cydia version of @pod2g&rsquo;s untether.</p>\n<p>@pod2g is now looking for a way to extend this to A5 devices.  Because those devices cannot use geohot&rsquo;s limera1n exploit to inject the untether, they require exploits above and beyond those used for this release.  Keep following pod2g on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pod2g\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> or his blog for any progress reports!</p>\n<div><strong>Update #2: </strong>The b2 version of redsn0w includes the launchctl-related fix by @planetbeing as mentioned by @saurik <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/saurik/status/151831295280947202\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/saurik/status/151851829074989056\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.  As usual, you can just re-run redsn0w in jailbreak mode over your existing 5.0.1 jailbreak (even a PwnageTool one), making sure to de-select &ldquo;Install Cydia&rdquo; if you do.  Always be sure to do a controlled &ldquo;slide to power off&rdquo; shutdown of your device before running redsn0w.</div>\n<div><strong>Update #3: </strong>The b3 version of redsn0w fixes a problem where re-running redsn0w over an existing jailbreak would cause MobileSubstrate-based apps to stop running until MS was installed again.  Now you can re-run the redsn0w jailbreak step without worrying about that (but still remember to de-select the &ldquo;Install Cydia&rdquo; option if it&rsquo;s already installed).</div>\n<div><strong>Update #4: </strong>The b4 version of redsn0w incorporates the 5.0.1 fix for iBooks, and also for sporadic problems with launchctl.  Thanks to @xvolks for merging the iBooks (sandbox) fix from @comex&rsquo;s github into the overall corona untether from @pod2g!  </div>\n<div><strong>Update #5: </strong>redsn0w version b5 incorporates yet another fix for iBooks, this time involving DRM.  @planetbeing wrote a utility called &ldquo;crazeles&rdquo; that overcomes jailbreak detection by iBooks that would cause about 10% of images to show incorrectly.  This fix is similar to the &ldquo;hunnypot&rdquo; fix that @comex wrote for the 4.x jailbreak.  As usual, you can choose to install the fix either by re-running redsn0w over your existing jailbreak (de-select Cydia if you do that), or by installing the corona package from Cydia (it&rsquo;s the same set of files no matter which way you choose).</div>\n<div><strong>Updates #5b and #5c:  </strong>Version b5b fixes an issue with using custom ramdisks on iPhone3G and iPod2G, and version b5c prevents redsn0w from crashing due to the ever-growing ramdisk size :).</div>\n<div><strong>TIP: </strong>If auto-detection fails and redsn0w tells you no identifying data was found, you can always pre-select the <a href=\"http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Firmware\" target=\"_blank\">appropriate 5.0.1 IPSW</a> using &ldquo;Extras-&gt;Select IPSW&rdquo;.</div>\n<div></div>\n<hr><div>Here are the redsn0w download links<strong>:</strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_mac_0.9.10b5c.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.10b5c for OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.10b5c.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.10b5c for Windows</a> (be sure to run in Administrator mode)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>PwnageTool Official Bittorent Releases</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6915059/PwnageTool_5.0.1.dmg.6915059.TPB.torrent\" target=\"_blank\">PwnageTool_5.0.1.dmg</a></li>\n</ul><p>SHA1 Sum = 32e90607378988cdebb6c76d3acf8ffac6366e35</p>\n<p><strong>Unofficial Mirrors</strong></p>\n<p>The following links are unofficial download mirrors, you download these archives at your own risk, we accept no responsibility if your computer explodes or if it becomes part of a NASA attacking botnet or even worse if your hands fall off mid-way during the use of these files.

Note that iTunes ultimately is *not* the component that matters here..it&rsquo;s the boot sequence on the device starting with the LLB.</p>\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s always been just &ldquo;a matter of time&rdquo; before Apple started doing this (they&rsquo;ve always done this with the BBTicket), it&rsquo;s still a significant move on Apple&rsquo;s part (and it also dovetails with certain technical requirements of their upcoming OTA &ldquo;delta&rdquo; updates).</p>\n<p>Note: although there may still be ways to combat this, <strong>a beta period is really not the time or place to discuss them</strong>.  We&rsquo;re just letting you know what Apple has already done in their exisiting beta releases &ndash; they&rsquo;ve stepped up their game!</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 22:57:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d9521e2adaf597c92b74b5e93fe30dca","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"Blob-o-riffic","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/31869383801","description":"<p>Today marks the public release of iOS6!  For those devices capable of running 6.0, the 5.1.1 SHSH blob signing window will soon close, so it&rsquo;s very important that you <strong>backup your 5.1.1 blobs now while you still can</strong>.  We advise you do it for every device you have (see tutorial sites like <a href=\"http://iClarified.com\" target=\"_blank\">iClarified</a> if you don&rsquo;t know the process).</p>\n<p>A few months back we released a redsn0w feature that lets you downgrade A5+ devices from 5.1.1 to anything lower (if you had saved blobs).  Unfortunately once the 5.1.1 window closes, <strong>redsn0w&rsquo;s 5.x downgrade feature will no longer work</strong>.  Most A5+ users will not be able to downgrade.  So if you&rsquo;re an A5+ owner up at 6.0 when the 5.1.1 window closes, you&rsquo;ll be stuck there without a jailbreak for now.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re happy to report there are some serious deficiences in the 5.x restore process that are permanently exploitable. They&rsquo;ll never be fixable by Apple because they&rsquo;re all self-contained in the 5.x IPSWs.  Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>\n<ol><li>A4 devices and 3GS will always be downgradable (and jailbreakable) with saved blobs due to limera1n.  The tethered iOS6 jailbreak for those devices (and untethered for old-bootrom 3GS) will be out when Cydia and other important pieces are all working properly.</li>\n<li>iPad2 owners who have <strong>both</strong> 4.x blobs and 5.x blobs will always be able to downgrade to those versions, even once you come up to 6.0 and the 5.1.1 window closes (don&rsquo;t do that yet though!).  <strong>You need both 4.x and 5.x blobs to qualify for the 5.x downgrade</strong> even though you only wish to downgrade to 5.x (you need only your 4.x blobs to downgrade to 4.x)</li>\n<li>iPad3, i4S (and iPad2 owners who don&rsquo;t satisfy #2) will always be able to RE-restore <strong>the current 5.x OS that&rsquo;s already on their device.</strong>  So if you&rsquo;re at 5.1.1 when the window closes (and you&rsquo;ve saved your blobs), you&rsquo;ll always be able to RE-restore to 5.1.1 again.  This makes the 5.1.1 jailbreak a lot less fragile &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to worry about messing up your install with funky extensions or getting into a boot loop, because you can always RE-restore from <strong>5.1.1 to 5.1.1</strong> again (or from <strong>5.0.1 to 5.0.1</strong> again, etc).  But <strong>once you fall off the 5.x train by restoring to 6.x, you&rsquo;ll be stuck there until the next jailbreak.</strong></li>\n</ol><p>Please be aware that RE-restores and iPad2 downgraded devices will always end up with the latest baseband (not the one that came with that firmware).  So don&rsquo;t go near any of this if your unlock depends on the baseband version.</p>\n<p>All of these features will be released shortly in a new version of redsn0w.  In the meantime please be sure you have your 5.1.1 blobs and stay at 5.1.1.  Happy iOS6 day!</p>\n<p><strong>Update #1: </strong>For a refresher on why saved blobs are not as powerful as they used to be, please see <a href=\"http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/6952986620/blob-monster\" target=\"_blank\">our Blob Monster post</a> (the scenarios described above are possible only due to mistakes made by Apple, but those mistakes are being cleaned up with each new firmware).</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 18:22:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a21084666f71f155720f820168cbfac5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962783},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"Welcome new A5 jailbreakers!","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/16366982367","description":"<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of how many A5 owners have jailbroken their devices since Friday morning.  The numbers as of Monday afternoon are:</p>\n<ul><li>491,325 new iPhone4,1 devices</li>\n<li>308,967 new iPad2 devices</li>\n<li>152,940 previously jailbroken (at 4.x) iPad2 devices</li>\n</ul><p>Total: 953,232 new A5 jailbreaks in a little over 3 days</p>\n<p>The reason these numbers can be so precise is that one of the housekeeping activities that happens when you launch Cydia is a query to @saurik&rsquo;s server for the list of available SHSH blobs.  (Even if you have none on file, the query is still made).</p>\n<p>Welcome to the jailbreak family!</p>\n<p>P.S.

And please avoid using stock IPSWs in the future :)  <strong>Unlockers should never go near stock IPSWs.</strong></p>\n<p>If you need to use redsn0w for any of the above tasks, please make sure it&rsquo;s version 0.9.9b4 or higher, which is <a href=\"http://blog.iphone-dev.org/redsn0w-iOS5\" target=\"_blank\">available here</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 08:01:00 +0000","feedId":2306,"bgimg":"http://musclenerd.com/us124.png","linkMd5":"6a329cfcd0c6d437b66442ee6a677cbb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn5@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-12-42-999_43e445e548c60c1e.jpg","destWidth":0,"destHeight":0,"sourceBytes":27,"destBytes":27,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://musclenerd.com/us124.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn5@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-12-42-999_43e445e548c60c1e.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598281962785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:12:42","title":"The untether rolls on","link":"https://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/4731948971","description":"<p>Only a few weeks after the 4.3.1 untether created by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/i0n1c\" target=\"_blank\">@i0n1c</a> was released, Apple pushed out firmware 4.3.2.

after redsn0w identifies its model and BB version (you needn&rsquo;t pre-select the IPSW anymore).</li>\n<li>Choose the &ldquo;Downgrade from iPad baseband&rdquo; option (you needn&rsquo;t worry about de-selecting Cydia anymore).</li>\n<li>Do a <strong>controlled</strong> &ldquo;slide to power off&rdquo; shutdown of your phone and proceed through the normal DFU ramdisk steps.</li>\n</ol><p>Should the downgrade fail to take, feel free to leave the redsn0w log in the comments below.  Use the &ldquo;Extras-&gt;Even more-&gt;Backup&rdquo;

and select an IPSW that is currently being signed for your device and that you&rsquo;d normally be able to restore to without any hacks.  redsn0w will create an &ldquo;ENTER_DFU_&rdquo; version of the IPSW that you can restore to just like any other IPSW, except that now you&rsquo;ll be dumped into DFU mode towards the end of the restore (WARNING, your screen will remain completely black&hellip;the only way to even know its on is that iTunes and redsn0w will detect it!).  The technique used by this feature is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/musclenerd/status/3211746820\" target=\"_blank\">3 years old</a> but surprisingly still works today!</p>\n<p><strong>Update #1 7/25/12: </strong>redsn0w is compatible with today&rsquo;s retail release of Mountain Lion OS X 10.8.  Until we start using an official developer ID for it (!), you&rsquo;ll need to use the new Ctrl-Click-Open security bypass the first time you run it after downloading.</p>\n<p>Here are the download links.  Enjoy!</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_mac_0.9.14b2.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.14b2</a> (OS X)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/iphone-dev.com/files/home/redsn0w_win_0.9.14b2.zip?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\" target=\"_blank\">redsn0w 0.9.14b2</a> (Windows &ndash;

just follow the redsn0w prompts during the restore</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>1. redsn0w now lets you restore an A5+ device from any iOS5 to any other iOS5 as long as you have correct 5.x blobs for the starting (current) and ending points of the restore</strong></p>\n<ul><li>APtickets eliminated &ldquo;higher-version only&rdquo; comparison of firmware restores (just like BBtickets did for the baseband)</li>\n<li>example restores supported by redsn0w if you have the correct blobs: 5.1.1-to-5.0.1, 5.0.1-to-5.1.1, 5.1.1-to-5.1.1, 5.0.1-to-5.0.1</li>\n<li>if you don&rsquo;t have the blobs locally, let redsn0w try to fetch them remotely (redsn0w always tries both Apple and Cydia).  Any succesful remote fetch also saves a local copy too.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>2. You DO NOT QUALIFY for iOS5-to-iOS5 restores if you got to your current 5.x via an OTA update</strong></p>\n<ul><li>the tickets saved by Cydia, redsn0w, and TinyUmbrella do not cover OTA update ramdisk images </li>\n<li>even if they did, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;wrong kind&rdquo; of ramdisk (you&rsquo;d need to start at that earlier pre-OTA FW)</li>\n<li>devices fresh from factory or refurb may fall in the &ldquo;does not qualify&rdquo; category (your results will vary)</li>\n<li>it&rsquo;s okay if you previously got to 5.x via an OTA update, as long as your <strong>current</strong> 5.x was installed via a normal iTunes restore.  All that matters is how you got to your current 5.x <strong>most recently</strong></li>\n<li>redsn0w detects an OTA/normal-restore APticket mismatch very early, so if you don&rsquo;t know your status there should be no harm in trying.  Any device in recovery mode after such a mismatch can boot normally again just by going back to &ldquo;Even More&rdquo; screen from the &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; screen (or use &ldquo;Recovery Fix&rdquo; if you quit redsn0w before doing that).</li>\n</ul><p><strong>3.

 When the ramdisk has done its job it will reboot the phone on its own.</p>\n<p>For those who are wondering if you can update your 3G or 3GS to 06.15 solely for the purposes of downgrading to 05.13.04, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for 3G owners, and &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; for 3GS owners.  The iPad baseband is not compatible with 3GS units manufactured week 34 of 2011 or later.  <strong>If you have an iPhone3GS and if digits 3-5 of its Serial Number are 134 or later (xx134&hellip;), then you should NOT try to install the 06.15 baseband on your 3GS!</strong>  It will brick your radio, preventing both the downgrade from working and normal iPhone software from using it as a phone!

 All technical hurdles dealing with the underlying technique have been overcome, and it&rsquo;s now all about making the jailbreak as bug free as possible.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://pod2g-ios.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">his blog</a>, @pod2g playfully nicknamed the combined effort a &ldquo;dream team&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s an ironic name, because the past few weeks have left everyone involved with very little sleep and the opportunity to dream :) But we&rsquo;re now near the final stages of testing the public version of the jailbreak.  Please allow time to clean up any remaining bugs in the jailbreak clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Jailbreak programs:</strong></p>\n<p>To be as flexible as possible, the A5 version of the corona jailbreak will take multiple forms:</p>\n<ul><li>Chronic Dev have incorporated the overall flow into a GUI that runs on your Mac or PC.  The goal is for the GUI to be enough for most cases.</li>\n<li>iPhone Dev have also incorporated the exact same flow into an alternative command-line interface (CLI). This will allow us to help users through individual steps of the jailbreak manually, to both help the user and help improve the overall flow.  Although the CLI will also allow the user to perform the entire jailbreak from beginning to end, we anticipate it will be more useful in debugging the occasional errors.  The CLI currently has over 20 individual options (in addition to the single &ldquo;jailbreak&rdquo; option) that should be useful during debug after the GUI release.</li>\n<li>Once all the bugs in the flow are worked out, we&rsquo;ll also incorporate it into the redsn0w GUI (but still leave the CLI freely available too).  In order to maximize the chances of the jailbreak working for everyone, the redsn0w GUI will use native Apple iTunes libraries &ndash; this technique is slightly different than how the Chronic Dev GUI handles communications, and should provide nice combined coverage for all the odd computer configurations out there.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Paypal Contributions:</strong></p>\n<p>Because there were so many different people and teams involved in the A5 corona release, we all felt the most equitable approach to any Paypal contributions should involve a single shared account.  <strong>If you do feel the desire to contribute to <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=DPFUPCEAYUD4L\" target=\"_blank\">the &ldquo;dream team&rdquo; Paypal account</a>, it will be distributed to the members according to internally agreed-upon proportions :)</strong>  (Please refer to this blog post for that specific <a href=\"http://is.gd/39YMWg\" target=\"_blank\">http://is.gd/39YMWg</a> link, to avoid frauds!)  The same link will be on both the Chronic Dev and iPhone Dev versions of the GUI.  This method seemed like the fairest to everyone involved!</p>\n<p><strong>Firmware:</strong></p>\n<p>The supported firmware versions will be:</p>\n<ul><li>iPhone4S: 5.0 (9A334), 5.0.1 (9A405) and the &ldquo;other&rdquo; 5.0.1 (9A406)</li>\n<li>iPad2: 5.0.1 (9A405)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>iPhone4S owners looking to maximize their chances of achieving an eventual software-based carrier unlock should be staying at 5.0.</strong>  Everyone else should be at 5.0.1.  If you&rsquo;re an iPhone4S owner who already updated to 5.0.1, it&rsquo;s too late to go back down to 5.0, but if you&rsquo;re on 9A406 it is possible to downgrade the BB by going to the 9A405 version of 5.0.1 while the window is still open.</p>\n<p><strong>Support:</strong></p>\n<p>The overall flow used by the GUI and CLI to inject the A5 corona jailbreak has never been done before, and there may be unforeseen problems once it&rsquo;s released to the public.  It&rsquo;s very important for you to sync your data, photos, and music before attempting any version of this jailbreak.  We&rsquo;ll be watching the comments section below for signs of any widespread problems, but please be aware that you jailbreak at your own risk! </p>\n<p><strong>When:</strong></p>\n<p><del>As mentioned at the start of this post: when testing has shown most of the bugs have been fixed!</del></p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>If the Absinthe webclip shows &ldquo;Error establishing a database connection&rdquo;, </strong>please go to Settings, turn on VPN and wait instead.         \n<ul><li>Toggle VPN only AFTER Absinthe says it&rsquo;s done, or it will not work. </li>\n<li>VPN SHOULD error and then reboot soon.
