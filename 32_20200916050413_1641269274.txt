This magnificent stone temple is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, visited by over 2.6 million tourists a year. A nearby temple, Ta Prohm, was featured in the movie <em>Tomb Raider</em>.\n</p><p>\n\t<span></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">A</span>t first glance, the most spectacular and interesting things about the Khmer Empire are these major temples, along with the massive agricultural system built by the empire's kings to support the people and increase their wealth. With this infrastructure, the medieval Khmer people transformed a giant floodplain into a highly engineered landscape over the course of hundreds of years.\n</p><p>\n\tThe scale of the hydraulic system is perhaps unparalleled in the preindustrial world. They built channels that were over 20 km in length and 40–60 m wide, above-ground reservoirs thousands of acres in size, and a vast network of walled fields used for flooded rice agriculture. The largest of these were constructed by kings, who claimed credit for them in inscriptions etched on the walls of temples and commemorative stone slabs called stelae.\n</p><h3></h3><br/><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">M</span>ost academic accounts of agriculture at Angkor have focused on this major infrastructure, and this is perfectly understandable. On the face of it, the reservoirs and major temples seem much more interesting than what also appears on the landscape: apparently random mounds of earth.</p><p>But analyses of these mounds, reaching far beyond the walls of Angkor Wat, are now revealing an important story about the development of the Khmer Empire. Archaeological investigations by our team and others reveal that a diverse network of small-holder farms was subsumed by bigger farms owned by elite, richer farmers until mass centralization took over. This happened just decades before the area slipped into decline and might have been one of the reasons for it.</p><p>It's intriguing to see similar patterns in the United States today, as small farms are subsumed by ever bigger agribusinesses. In general, this scaling up tends to improve efficiency but reduce diversity, and can introduce risks into the food supply chain. Some of these risks may be tested in the coming months and years as the modern food system is strained by everything from climate change to the current coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>For decades, archaeologists have been mapping the regions around the great temples of Angkor using remote sensing and ground surveys. This has worked well for most of the Greater Angkor region, but some areas—especially in the urban core—are now hidden by dense forest. In 2012, the Khmer Archaeology Lidar Consortium <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440316300644\" target=\"_blank\">was formed</a> to organize a campaign of <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/lidar-mapping-earth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lidar</a> (a 3D laser light scanning technique) across 370 km2 of Cambodia, including the forested areas at the center of Angkor. The resulting images revealed the surface lying beneath the vegetation.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"The Bayon temple at the famous temple area of Angkor Archeological Park\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c1c74b899657dff432a9e0af309b593c\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"1790e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDA4MzE5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNzY1MzUyOH0.b56dulFs3HaKtRZm_WTNiIiWOF7onNsXjcBlt-ugt5E/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C396%2C0%2C22&height=700\"/><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">T</span>he generated maps reveal both areas of dense occupation with city blocks and streets, and lower-density areas with scattered community temples, sometimes marked by little more than a scatter of bricks or just a faint impression of a mound with a moat around it. These community temples probably served a somewhat similar function as churches in the agricultural communities of modern America do: not just to promote religion but also to facilitate social networking and help neighbors coordinate their activities. When growing rice, it's important to coordinate and manage water collaboratively with your neighbors. If one farm hoards all the water, neighboring farms may have to let their fields go fallow. When that happens, pests take over and devastate everyone's crops.</p><p>Our team realized that the key to cracking the code of Angkorian agriculture was to understand these community temples. The new maps showed <em>where</em> the temples were on the landscape, but we needed to figure out <em>when</em> they were built.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>In a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205649\" target=\"_blank\">study published</a> in 2018, we used machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) to estimate the age of temples that didn't have inscriptions or artistic elements to date them. In the end, we were able to assign dates to over 5,000 community temples, reservoirs, ponds, and moats.</p><p>Our results indicated that, unsurprisingly, the construction of small temples blossomed around new water sources: Small-holder farms took advantage of good growing conditions fostered by various kings' construction of large hydraulic features.</p><p>What was strange was that we found a severe decrease in the number of new temple foundations on the landscape during the 11th and 12th centuries, right when the kings were constructing major projects like Angkor Wat, hospitals, and extensive road networks.</p><p>Why was that?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">W</span>e pondered this strange observation for months, until we had a eureka moment. We were at a conference in Poznan, Poland, in July 2017, where me met colleagues <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/losing-ground-decline-of-angkors-middlelevel-officials/1AA3E5982F9DA331E303F8A946A99CB6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">who had noted</a> an intriguing pattern in inscriptions relating to land ownership and disputes.</p><p>The landowners mentioned in the earlier inscriptions tended to be of all ranks in society, from lower class to higher class. However, by the mid-11th century, free males of middle rank (<em>vāp</em>) were no longer referenced in the context of land transactions or the foundations for new temples. By the 12th century, even free males of higher rank (<em>loñ</em>) were referred to as temple personnel or workers rather than as landowners. As we published in a paper this year, it seems the land was <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416519301321\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly concentrated</a> into the hands of the evermore wealthy. First the middle class was squeezed out, and then even the upper class lost their lands to the state.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>This period of rapid change in agriculture in the 12th and 13th centuries coincides with a period of urbanization: the emergence of very large populations in epicenters. This was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/angkor-wat-archaeological-digs-yield-new-clues-to-its-civilizations-decline-116793\" target=\"_blank\">the apogee</a> of Angkor's political power.</p><p>But the rise of kingly centralization ushered in an extended period of political and economic decline that lasted for centuries. It seems that the concentration of land ownership and management, along with rapid growth in the population of non–rice-producing citizens in the urban core, conspired to make Greater Angkor more vulnerable to climatic and social challenges. When the political regime shifted and the city was faced with a series of extreme monsoons and droughts, the centralized system may have had a hard time coping.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">P</span>lenty of other societies and empires throughout human history have fallen prey to the problems of over-centralization. As communities grow larger, sometimes the diversity of crops grown or diverse traditions get lost. A larger, more cohesive and more uniform system can be very efficient at feeding a large population. But, if and when something goes wrong, a system can collapse quickly if it relies on a single way of doing things. Similar phenomena have been documented in the <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/hohokam-mimbres-collapse/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pre-Hispanic U.S. Southwest</a> and with the Maya in Central America.</p><p>Something similar may be going on in the United States and in other nations today. Over time, much of the small-holder farmland has been bought up by big agricultural businesses. Of course, there are plenty of differences: Modern America is an entirely different place from Angkor—economically, socially, politically, and environmentally. But there are parallels. What scholars have seen in America and elsewhere is the promotion of efficiency at the cost of diversity. That introduces risk and fragility into a complex system.</p><p>Resilient systems are those that are flexible enough to respond to challenges. Global food supply networks and infrastructure will be strained by the current COVID-19 crisis as food production workers fall ill, transport falters, and borders close. Is the global food system flexible enough to meet the new demands and respond to this unprecedented challenge? Angkor's did not seem to be. Only time will tell what happens to the world's modern empires.</p><p>This work first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SAPIENS</a> under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-ND 4.0 license</a>.

You may have no physical symptoms, or you may worry that normal sensations or minor symptoms are signs of severe illness.</p><p><strong>How common is illness anxiety disorder (IAD)?</strong> </p><p>IAD is a relatively new disorder, having only been added to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) in 2013. It has replaced the now-obsolete \"hypochondria disorder.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554399/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to research</a>, among the patients who were previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis, about 25 percent of them will meet the criteria for IAD.

Small teams of acorn woodpeckers battle over abandoned \"granaries,\" tree sections with thousands of holes dug into their bark by birds — the holes are ideal for storing acorns.</p><p>First author of a new study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31098-8\" target=\"_blank\">Current Biology</a><em>,</em> <a href=\"http://www.sahasbarve.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sahas Barve</a> of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-09-acorn-woodpeckers-wage-days-long-vacant.html\" target=\"_blank\">spoke to Phys.org</a>. He sets the scene:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"When you're approaching a big tree with a power struggle from far away, you'll first hear a lot of acorn woodpeckers calling very distinctly, and see birds flying around like crazy. When you get closer, you can see that there are a dozen or more coalitions of three or four birds fighting and posturing on branches. One group has to beat all the others to win a spot in the territory, which is really, really rare in animals—even in fantasy novels it usually boils down to one army against the other.\"</p><p>The research also reveals that large numbers of acorn woodpeckers who are not themselves involved in the action watch the battle royal unfold as spectators.</p><h3>Acorn woodpeckers</h3><br/><img alt=\"acorn woodpecker\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7093a92289c1e00f38e76504ad3dc596\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"e21f7\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDAzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMTY4NjExN30.hKHCeyekcNOHIkGLbdMF04rSrk89YlxaPSF2I_EH_zw/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Much of what's known about these birds, including the new research, comes from a long-running project at the <a href=\"http://hastingsreserve.org\" target=\"_blank\">Hastings Natural History Reservation</a> in California's Monterey Country. Acorn woodpeckers first arrived at the sanctuary in 1968 and have been under observation since 1974. The birds are common in the oak woodlands of western North America.</p><p>Acorn woodpeckers have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygynandry\" target=\"_blank\">polygynandrous</a> mating system, something that's rarely seen in nature. A group will consist of as many as seven co-breeding males and four joint-nesting females. Breeding members of the group couple promiscuously within the group, and never outside it.</p><p>It's an incestuous arrangement by human standards, with father and son competing for and breeding with the same females. And though the females use the same nests, it's pretty competitive — one female will remove and eat another mother's eggs to make room for her own. Over time, according to Hastings, this results in a balance in the number of chicks among the females.</p><p>In addition, an acorn woodpecker group will also include other, non-breeding community \"helper\" members — they're the woodpeckers who go into battle for acorn granaries. Though the woodpeckers primarily feed on insects, acorns provide them with non-perishable nutrition for those colder months when bug meals are few and far between.</p><h3>Fight Club</h3><br/><img alt=\"acorns embedded in tree holes\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"fe92b1641ba8518f164dd274e69cc44e\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"33cea\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDAzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MTcxMDU5Nn0.ep-PNigMZayCRdAp47v-5aBWp9a3x9iwkVLdlOqZEkM/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>A granary for which an acorn woodpecker will fight is reminiscent of a human wine rack: An array of vertical storage compartments for their precious winter food. And they're dead serious about acquiring this storage: \"These birds often wait for years, and when there's the right time and they have the right coalition size, they'll go and give it their all to win a really good territory,\" <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-09-acorn-woodpeckers-wage-days-long-vacant.html\" target=\"_blank\">says Barve.</a></p><p>The balls-to-the-wall action of acorn woodpecker battle have made it difficult for human researchers to keep track of what's going on, so Barve and his colleagues devised a solution: They outfitted woodpeckers with radio tags that allowed the researchers to tell when two birds were in the same location, and to track the origin of combatants, and also to make detailed observations of a melee.</p><p>While the researchers had thought that acorn woodpeckers living nearby would most fiercely make a play for a nearby granary, this turned out not to be the case. It's not yet known what prompts one group of woodpeckers to commit to battle, though the researchers suggest that a group's internal calculus somehow produces a decision whether to try and acquire a particular granary.</p><p>Yet commit they do. The researchers found that woodpecker teams will fight for as long as 10 hours straight, and will return day after day. This was something of a surprise to researchers, making them wonder how they even sustain themselves that long.</p><h3>\"Get ya acorns heayah, acorns, get ya acorns heayah!\"</h3><br/><img alt=\"woodpeckers\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9af4e854af92f7a5c48aba5a86359366\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"9a454\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDA0Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzkyMDMwMX0.MH5tJaZk4PQrANKic92UKkVIG8kuW7gAgrFRQHk1YMk/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Previous research missed the spectators because the brouhaha was so overwhelming and attention-grabbing. As many as 30 woodpeckers have been observed in the peanut gallery.</p><p>The researchers have seen birds coming from as far as three kilometers (1.9 miles) away. These onlookers may spend up to an hour each day in attendance. Among the spectators are woodpeckers who already have adequate granaries of their own — whatever they get out of watching has to be worth the time spent leaving their own granaries unattended. The researchers suggest the watchers may be curious about changes a battle could make to the local status quo.<span></span></p><p>These highly social birds may also actually be rooting for one fighting group over another. \"They potentially have friendships,\" <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-09-acorn-woodpeckers-wage-days-long-vacant.html\" target=\"_blank\">says Barve,</a> \"and they probably have enemies.

They serve many functions, including protection, fluid balance, particle clearance, and triggering immune responses. These functions make them important to the health and safety of our respiratory system.</p><p>The researchers took their epithelial cells from a bronchus, major airway passages by which air moves from the windpipe and into the lungs. The initial cells were taken from a transplanted lung and later grown in lab dishes. So, unlike your typical photoshoot or family portrait, this experiment remained ethically above board.</p><p>After exposing the cells to coronavirus, they waited for the infection to take hold. They then captured images of the epithelial cells with a <a href=\"https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/SEM.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scanning electron microscope</a>, a device that uses a focused beam of high-energy electrons to produce images. They discovered a high density of virions—individual particles of the virus existing outside the host cell—had been produced and were swarming over the cells. In a mere 96 hours, virus production skyrocketed to reach a multiplicity of infection of three to one. That means there were three virions for each targeted airway cell.</p><p>\"When we looked at these infected cultures under an SEM microscope, the most striking observation was the astonishing number of virions produced by a single infected cell,\" <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/horrifying-images-show-how-the-coronavirus-ravages-our-1844946904\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ehre told Gizmodo in an interview</a>. \"Some of these infected cells were so engorged with viruses that they rounded up and detached from the epithelium, giving the impression that they were about to burst.\"</p><p>The image at the top of this article shows the invasion at one-micrometer magnification.

It's not only that our bodies serve as their viral birthing centers.

They incorporate their DNA or RNA into a host cell's genome, and a bouncing baby virion is born, one that often kills the host upon release.

Warnings about coronavirus in the abstract can make the case for physical distancing, shuttered schools, and wearing stifling makes while shopping. For a while. But as we've seen, people will eventually tire of their social sacrifices. Perhaps the idea of the above horror show occurring more closely to home will spur us to keep up the fight and listen to the experts for a while longer.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/i4EA7of-9H4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 16:44:29 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg2MjQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNTk0OTUzOH0.pctgBeCdJ6e-uo3sH7pIzjaN6SvOFVSEJ5WgKcMoKic/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C58%2C0%2C69&height=700","linkMd5":"9107fae81ab970f0f91f87601273737a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-40-924_bf7f2d41e174341c.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":79906,"destBytes":79906,"author":"Kevin Dickinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg2MjQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNTk0OTUzOH0.pctgBeCdJ6e-uo3sH7pIzjaN6SvOFVSEJ5WgKcMoKic/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C58%2C0%2C69&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-40-924_bf7f2d41e174341c.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg2MjU2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDcyMzY5N30.P9-pN3720tOzXNrYTybx3X7qc_7ZO8ZdF15ztj5cgXA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C52%2C0%2C68&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/16/05-04-09-910_9dbf0ff9cee69f25.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/i4EA7of-9H4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_1/2020/09/16/05-04-09-578_fde86848b9a78418.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620728},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Megalodon’s actual size, recalculated","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/megalodon-size","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg3MjYzMi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODA1OTA0MX0.pR-rUazc5TZqspM01xNfM8dTgYWT3s3YOLwHTCM7cVw/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C75%2C0%2C21&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Previous estimates of the megalodon's size were based solely on its teeth compared to the star of \"Jaws.\"</li><li>The prehistoric monster is as closely related to other sharks.</li><li>Imagine just a dorsal fin as tall as you are.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>For anyone already terrified by ferocious sharks — few of them actually are, of course — the prehistoric <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/63361-megalodon-facts.html\" target=\"_blank\">megalodon</a>, <em>Otodus megalodon</em>, goes several steps beyond a nightmare. Not much is known about the animal that roamed the seas from 23 million to about three million years ago. The most definitive fossils are triangular teeth that are larger than a human hand, really not much from which to extrapolate a complete picture of the shark. Even so, they suggest a gargantuan predator.

The idea has been, essentially, that since a <a href=\"https://www.fossilera.com/blog/megalodon-vs-great-white-tooth-size\" target=\"_blank\">great white's tooth</a> is about 2 inches long — the biggest one ever found is 2.5 inches — and most megalodon teeth seem to be in the neighborhood of six inches — the largest one found is 7.4 inches — then the megalodon must have been about three times as big as a great white. The suggestion is that if great whites can bite with two tonnes of pressure (4400 pounds), then the megalodon's bite must have been significantly more powerful.</p><p>This may not be a completely fair comparison, however, according to one of the study's authors, <a href=\"https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/biosciences/pimiento-c/\" target=\"_blank\">Catalina Pimiento</a> of Swansea. She tells <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2020/september/megalodon.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Bristol</a> that \"Megalodon is not a direct ancestor of the Great White but is equally related to other macropredatory sharks such as the Makos, Salmon shark and Porbeagle shark, as well as the Great white.\" To arrive at their measurements the researchers, \"pooled detailed measurements of all five to make predictions about Megalodon.\"</p><p>To try and work out the proportions of the prehistoric shark based on this larger group of contemporary sharks, the researchers investigated how their bodies change as they mature. \"Before we could do anything,\" says co-author <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/people/mike-j-benton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Benton</a>, \"we had to test whether these five modern sharks changed proportions as they grew up. If, for example, they had been like humans, where babies have big heads and short legs, we would have had some difficulties in projecting the adult proportions for such a huge extinct shark.\"</p><p>It turned out, surprisingly, that though these sharks get larger as they grow up, their body proportions don't really change much. \"This means we could simply take the growth curves of the five modern forms and project the overall shape as they get larger and larger — right up to a body length of 16 meters,\" adds lead author Jack Cooper.</p><p>Cooper has always been, as he puts it, \"mad about sharks.\" He's worked and dived, in a steel cage, with great whites. He enthuses, \"It's that sense of danger, but also that sharks are such beautiful and well-adapted animals that makes them so attractive to study.\"</p><h3>The megalodon’s revised measurements</h3><br/><img alt=\"shark and diver illustration\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8caf88dda090ba04f0aac156e15b7a27\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"98366\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg0OTAwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTM4MjA4M30.uArVFW_ithOZuZ1_oTKCg0y1-2Zue2VRD_C_j2KJVk4/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>The study proposes the following approximate measurements for a full-grown megalodon:</p><ul><li>Length: about 16 meters (52.5 feet).

For the first time ever, this map presented a detailed overview of the geology of an entire country. </p><p><span></span>It set the standard for all geology maps that have followed. And it turned geology into a 'practical' science – helping industrialists locate mineable coal seams, for example. Indeed, this was \"The Map that Changed the World,\" as described in a bestselling book of that title.</p><p>The book, by Simon Winchester, focuses on the mapmaker's compelling life story. Nicknamed 'Strata' Smith, the lowly-born surveyor noticed how fossils occurred in predictable layers in the side of a freshly dug canal. He struck upon the idea of a stratified geological past and spent the first decade and a half of the 19th century surveying most of Britain to prove his theory. <br /></p><h3>Ostracism and plagiarism</h3><br><img alt=\"William Smith\\u2019s Geological section from London to Snowdon, showing the varieties of the strata, and the correct altitude of the hills.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0477bd73285f71f8af2174f8a09a21d6\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"1eed6\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDM3NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NTUwNjY1NH0.4vjgHJo2v-TYWBv6OEVfJ7Fqc-26Fyp5x_KjDHBuEPs/img.png?width=980\" /><p>Smith's map is remarkably similar to current geological maps of Britain, proving the accuracy of his work. But he had some trouble convincing his contemporaries – which was due at least in part to class differences: London's Geological Society was a gentleman's club, not the natural <em>milieu</em> for a blacksmith's son. </p><p>In his fight against social ostracism and professional plagiarism, Smith was forced to sell his fossil collection to the British Museum, lost his house and ended up in debtor's prison. Free again but still homeless, he worked as an itinerant surveyor, until one of his employers recognised him for his work and appointed him Land Steward at an estate near Scarborough. </p><p>Smith later designed the Scarborough Rotunda, one of Britain's oldest surviving purpose-built museums. Only in 1831 was he acknowledged by the Geological Society as the 'Father of English Geology.' His work was an inspiration for Charles Darwin. <br /></p><h3>America beats Britain by 6 years</h3><br><img alt=\"\\u200bBedrock Geology of the UK and Ireland\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d8f15e9d0604d81112e894350ea08006\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"9bb7d\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDM5NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMjI3Mjc1MH0.pzG1eZilJm2xlZi6LxHEYk9UBxpRin0xJioQz6wsixA/img.png?width=980\" /><p>William Smith's original map can be visited at the <a href=\"https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Geological Society's headquarters at Burlington House in London</a>, where it hangs side by side with the geological map of England and Wales by George Greenough, the Geological Society's first president and Smith's mapping rival.</p><p>Smith's is an impressive rags-to-fame story, and his accomplishments are now widely acknowledged, thanks in large part by the Simon Winchester book. <br /></p><p>However, the brightly shining star of Smith's celebrity somewhat obscures the work of one of his American colleagues. In 1809, six years before Smith published his map, William Maclure produced a geological map of the United States. Although inevitably dubbed the 'Father of American Geology', Maclure has not received the bucketloads of fame (granted, mostly posthumous fame) that Smith did. </p><h3>Page-turner material</h3><br><img alt=\"A Map of the United States of America.

For Maclure's life story sounds like page-turner material too. A successful Scottish merchant, Maclure was rich enough to retire at 34. Settling in Virginia but moving back and forth to Europe, he devoted the rest of his life to science and philanthropy – an example of the latter was his introduction to Philadelphia of educational courses based on the principles of the Swiss innovator Pestalozzi. He later also contributed to the establishment of a utopian community in New Harmony, Indiana. </p><p>Maclure had been bitten by the geology bug on a trip to France. In 1807, he personally started mapping the geology of the then United States, crossing and recrossing the Allegheny Mountains no less than 50 times. The monumental work took him two years to complete. Although he used a different system of classification than Smith, later surveys have confirmed the general accuracy of Maclure's observations.</p><p>In 1817, he became the president of the newly founded Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, which he would remain almost until his death. Failing health forced him to abandon the attempt to set up an agricultural college in Indiana. He died in Mexico in 1840. In his will he provided for the establishment of 160 working men's libraries. <br /></p><h3></h3><br><img alt=\"The US is much bigger than in Maclure's day, and geology is much more advanced; yet the current map still builds on some of the observations he made in the early 19th century.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3cfdf27bd5141e30fb5e530bc41956df\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"1b20c\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDM4OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDEzNjQyNn0.WZArpszqZJF_5k6rg4vKUMEblQ3mZqGm5uO3UdKo4Ao/img.png?width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Strange Maps #1046</strong></p><p><em>Got a strange map?

Paramahansa Yogananda <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/autobiography-of-a-yogi-9781619491250/9780876120798\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> his guru dropping his body to take over a dead man by a riverbank (a likely play on a metaphorical transition in the \"Bhagavad Gita\"). A more humorous example is the 2003 comedy, \"Freaky Friday,\" in which Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan wake up to find they've switched bodies—an existential crisis that ultimately results in a grand moment of empathy.</p><p>What if you <em>could</em> accomplish such a feat? Unlike the relatively smooth physical transition in \"Freaky Friday,\" researchers have suggested that such an act would result in severe disassociation, akin to powerful LSD. Your motor patterns would be different; the way you move through space alone would require an entirely new education. The idea that you'd just pick up where you left off in new skin is implausible. </p><p>Humans will try any novel ideas. Though the consciousness-switching tech isn't quite ready, VR headsets are widely available. While still clunky (due to the weight and feel of the headset), a sense of embodiment is rather convincing. And so a team led by Karolinska Institutet neuroscientist Pawel Tacikowski handed 33 pairs of friends goggles and let them trade places. The results have <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(20)30619-2\" target=\"_blank\">just been published</a> in iScience. </p><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b961a7502214947d5f92e4ac565e3e3c\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fajfkO_X0l0?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>The most fascinating aspect of their findings concerns the concept of self. We often think of our self as an island in an ocean of islands, but reality isn't quite that simple. As neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran has written, the idea that the self is \"entirely private is to a significant extent a social construct—a story you make up for others.\" This narrative imposes social stability and also acts as cover to shield your true feelings from others.</p><p>Decades of neuroscience research has found the self is not a fixed identity but a fluid state of being. \"You\" change according to the environment you're in and the people you're around. Changes are often undetectable, as least to you. You likely don't realize your \"self\" depends on everything around you at all times. There is no island.</p><p>It's not that you don't bring anything to the table, however. Your memories—specifically, episodic memories—play a leading role in perception. Because of this, the very concept of \"reality\" is often debated. Is shared reality possible? Likely not. You regularly <em>create</em> reality based on your past experiences. </p><p>Upon assuming their friend's body, volunteers in this study assigned their friend's personality characteristics to their new skin. This process was informed by their own memories of the other person. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"These findings demonstrate that our beliefs about [our] own personality are dynamically shaped by the perception of our body and that coherence between the bodily and conceptual self-representations is important for the normal encoding of episodic memories.\"</p><p>Incredibly, this meant the volunteer lost track of <em>who they are</em>. Their perception of their friend dominated while inhabiting a foreign body. They ended up performing worse on memory tests about their own lives due to how bound up those memories are with their bodies. A major strike against dualism.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"24510dc0015372030eb812db93dae5ec\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"2f802\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0MTcyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxOTExODU2NX0.q76s-8L8PhnYfOXhej67QIytZbEJgrju3MbbQBoHStM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C122%2C0%2C21&height=700\"/><p>While this might seem like a freaky and fun experiment, Tacikowski is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200826110322.htm\" target=\"_blank\">looking at </a>the real-world applications of such a phenomenon.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"People who suffer from depression often have very rigid and negative beliefs about themselves that can be devastating to their everyday functioning. If you change this illusion slightly, it could potentially make those beliefs less rigid and less negative.\" </p><p>Tacikowski first wants to further investigate the neural correlates of body-switching. He's interested in how we construct the self in the first place. Once that's better understood, he believes clinical applications will naturally follow. </p><p>This sort of research also helps overturn an inherent biological impulse to separate body and mind. As neuroscientist Antonio Damasio writes, we need to recognize both aspects of ourselves as continuous partners. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"They are not aloof entities signaling each other like chips in a cell phone. In plain talk, brains and bodies are in the same mind-enabling soup.\"</p><p>Still, an unshackled imagination leads to great storytelling, like Krishna on a battlefield and Yogananda on a riverbank. There's no harm in such tales provided we recognize them as metaphors. Until then, we dream forward the possibility until science fiction again becomes real. </p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://derekberes.substack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Substack</a>.

This study found that, based on the reports from both teachers and parents, one in six students showed enough behavioral or emotional symptoms to be diagnosed with a childhood mental disorder.</p><p><strong>What was the Project to Learn About Youth Mental Health (PLAY-MH) study?</strong></p><p>This was a school-based study conducted throughout the years of 2014-2018. This study was designed to estimate how many kindergarten - grade 12 students had specific mental health disorders. </p><p>The information was collected in two phases. In phase one, teachers in selected school districts were asked to complete a short questionnaire to determine a student's risk for a mental health disorder. In phase two, the parents of selected students were asked to complete a more structured interview to determine if their child met the criteria for a mental health disorder. Between 1 in 6 students (1 in 3 in some districts) fit the criteria, according to the combined data.</p><p>Teachers also identified a higher percentage of boys, non-Hispanic Black students, and students receiving free or reduced-price lunch as having a higher risk for mental disorders than their peers at most schools. However, based on the parent reports, there were generally no major demographic differences in the percentage of students who met the criteria for a mental disorder. This interesting discrepancy suggests that estimating effects of race or income on symptoms gave different results depending on the way the symptoms were examined. </p><p><strong>How can we help at-risk students?</strong></p><p>The information gathered during this four-year study can help parents, teachers, and communities alike to understand and become more aware of the mental health struggles of younger children. With this knowledge, interventions and treatments can become more normalized when dealing with children's mental health conditions.</p><p>The CDC has some suggestions for how we, as communities, can help our at-risk children:</p><ul><li>Schools can consider screening students for mental health concerns and then following up with effective services and counseling options. </li><li>Pediatric and family clinics can use this information to establish how many children may be at risk. </li><li>Communities and parents can work together with school systems to integrate mental health services and referrals into the schools. </li></ul><h3>Common mental health disorders in children, according to experts</h3><br/><img alt=\"Stressed and anxious student sitting at desk during exam\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a6b046f215f2c8d99c44d09de0dbdef3\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"7b6fe\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk1NDc4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODg4NzYwMH0.C3dNExRsuVrcDvs_z68q2FY62kee157DLvBtubmmq8A/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C52%2C0%2C52&height=700\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/mental-illness-in-children/art-20046577\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to experts</a>, these are some of the most common disorders among children:</p><p><strong>Anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorders):</strong> These conditions may appear as persistent fears, worries, or anxiety that disrupt their ability to participate in play, school, or other typical age-appropriate activities.</p><p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):</strong> Children who struggle with ADHD have difficulty with attention, tend to have impulsive behaviors, generalized hyperactivity, or some combination of these issues. </p><p><strong>Depression (or other mood disorders): </strong>Depression in children presents as persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest that disrupt their ability to function in school and interact with others. </p><p><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD):</strong> PTSD is a prolonged state of emotional distress and anxiety that is prefaced with negative memories, nightmares, and disruptive behaviors in response to a traumatic event the child may have suffered. </p><p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): </strong>This is a neurological condition that often can be noticed in early childhood (before the age of three), if you know what to look for.

But the main obstacle is propulsion: Our spacecraft are simply too slow and too reliant on fuel to realistically make a voyage to Alpha Centauri, the closest star to our Sun.</p><p>So, what do we need? Something like a reactionless drive — an engine that moves a spacecraft without exhausting a finite stock of propellant. So far, such a device only exists in science fiction. But for the past few decades, physicist Jim Woodward has been trying to change that.</p><p>The 79-year-old physics professor has developed what a thruster design that he hopes will serve as a proof of concept for how humans can someday achieve interstellar travel. Called the Mach-effect gravitational assist (MEGA) drive, the device only requires a source of electricity to achieve thrust. </p><p>Early tests have shown mixed results. Woodward himself was only able to demonstrate miniscule amounts of thrust, while other teams reported little to no thrust when trying to replicate his experiments. Still, the design intrigued NASA enough to award Woodward $625,000 in funding between 2017 and 2018. </p><p>What's more, in 2019 Woodward and his collaborator and fellow physicist Hal Fearn reported a major breakthrough after redesigning the thruster's mount — a tweak that produced \"more than 100 micronewtons, orders of magnitude larger than anything Woodward had ever built before,\" as a recent feature in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mach-effect-thrusters-interstellar-travel/\" style=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a> notes. </p><p>(To be sure, the level of thrust we're talking about is barely enough to visibly move an object across a table. But if the results are confirmed, it would suggest the technology could be scaled up.)</p><h3>A heterodox view of inertia</h3><br/><p>Woodward's system is based on ideas that 19th-century physicist Ernst Mach proposed about inertia, which is an object's tendency to stay at rest unless acted upon.</p><p>In simple terms, Mach's principle argues that distant matter causes local inertial effects. So, a star in a far away galaxy has some effect on the inertia you encounter when you push a shopping cart. That's the idea, anyway. (Woodward gives a comprehensive breakdown of his views on Mach's principle in this <a href=\"https://medium.com/predict/james-woodward-on-machs-principle-for-reactionless-inertial-propulsion-34384863ad50\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.)</p><p><span></span>In the 20th century, Albert Einstein incorporated Mach's ideas into his theory of general relativity, essentially arguing that gravity and inertia are fundamentally linked. But the broader physics community later rejected this view of inertia, largely because of a <a href=\"http://people.loyno.edu/~brans/ST-history/phd-thesis-Brans.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1961 paper</a> that showed inertia to be unrelated to the gravitational influence of distant matter.</p><p>Still, Woodward believes Einstein had it right all along, and that, under this framework of inertia, it's possible to develop propulsion systems that require only an electrical charge, not fuel. The key element of his thruster is a stack of piezoelectric crystals, which produces an alternating electric field when voltage is applied to it, as Woodward explained:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Piezoelectric crystals are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics\" target=\"_blank\">electromechanical</a> devices, which means that when you apply the voltage, they mechanically expand & contract depending upon the sign of the voltage. So by applying a voltage, you're causing an E/c² energy fluctuation in the stack no matter what they do mechanically, and you're also producing an acceleration because of the changing dimensions of the stack due due to electromechanical effects, which also causes the acceleration required couple the device to the large gravitational field.\"</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The trick is timing the energy fluctuations and mechanical oscillations correctly, which requires using two frequencies — at the first and second harmonics, and it's the second harmonic that actually produces thrust.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ad94a778bf9379d610884cc629149e99\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLs9NEt9LRQ?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>Woodward and his colleagues have even drawn up plans for a spacecraft that would utilize the MEGA drive.

No other method for travelling to the stars and braking into the target system has been put forward to date, which also has credible physics to back it up.\"</p><h3>High-reward work</h3><br/><p>After the COVID-19 pandemic settles down, other scientists and engineers hope to put Woodward's designs to the test. The results of those experiments should reveal whether he's onto something. To some experts in the field, the odds are slim.

Nor can one conceal the fact that it brought him an extremely bad reputation. But meanwhile its meaning – however ominous it may sound – is actually very simple.</p><p>The sentence is: \"God is dead.\"</p><p>It appeared for the first time in 1882, in <em>The Gay Science</em> by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the most important philosophers of modern times. But the world is familiar with it mainly from another of Nietzsche's works, perhaps his most famous, written a year later, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. This very strange, poetic text, full of unusual metaphors and lyrical inspiration, predicts the coming of a new era. Its prophet is to be the eponymous Zarathustra, a figure whose name Nietzsche took from an ancient Persian priest, the creator of Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. But despite the mystical aura that Zarathustra radiates, his message has nothing to do with conventional religious ideas. Quite the contrary – for he announces the death of God. And consequently challenges people to conduct a thorough revaluation of everything they think about the world and about themselves.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>A new prophet</h3><p>But what does 'the death of God' mean? Certainly not death in the literal sense – it is not that after aeons of existence a divine being, an old man with a long grey beard who resides in heaven, suddenly ceases to be. Nothing of the kind. The 'death of God' is simply a metaphor for the historical moment whose advent Nietzsche sensed perfectly in advance. The moment when religion – both as a prospect from which to perceive reality, and as a specific doctrine, in particular Christianity – was bound to undergo irrevocable disintegration.</p><p>In Nietzsche's view, these were the ultimate consequences of processes that were set off within Western culture by the age of enlightenment. The new independence of human reason that came about at this time, the creation of the framework of modern science, the departure from the stage of self-incurred immaturity – as Immanuel Kant expressed it – led to the erosion of the great edifice of the religious view of the world. Humanity had finally produced tools that allowed it to distinguish mythology from knowledge, and by this token to unmask the claims of religious institutions and high priests. Finally it was possible to see that the power and social status they had enjoyed until now was entirely built on phantasmal foundations.</p><p>Yet in Nietzsche's day not everyone was aware of this, or rather not everyone was prepared to take it on board. That was why a new, charismatic prophet had to appear, who – by referring to religious, prophetic symbols – would formulate something like a new gospel. And would fully express man's situation in a world from which by now every last trace of the metaphysical had irrevocably been removed.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>New values</h3><p>What is at the heart of this message? It is most fully expressed by a single word: affirmation. The person whose fortunes no imaginary providence is guarding any more, the person living in a world that was not created by any god and that no god is watching, the person now independent of all the religious institutions that disinherited him of his own power and spontaneity, the person who gets back all the wonderful features and possibilities ascribed until now to a deity – only this sort of person has a genuine opportunity to say 'yes' to the world, with all its original meaninglessness, chaos, cruelty and unpredictability. Because only the sort of affirmation that takes account of all this, that does not disguise its meaninglessness with mawkish stories and its cruelty with metaphysical tales of final judgement, actually deserves to be called by that name.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"German philosopher and writer Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844 - 1900)\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"6d8c7c599600ffcde9df4db6eaa75b30\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"c1ad4\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg5Njc3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODMxNTI0N30.mazDgPsvO_DWd4Nj20Uv2GXbT85vpwiyO9KabBEylf8/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>But to reach this affirmation, first a person must fully and genuinely become aware of his own situation – and draw radical consequences from it. In Nietzsche's view, Christianity was a religion based on resentment, and thus on the sense of dislike or even envy that the weak harbour towards the strong – dislike or envy that is institutionalized, harnessed to an entire, complex mythological system, at the centre of which stands a figure of sanctified weakness, humility and modesty. According to Nietzsche, this is nothing other than a systematic means of depriving man of access to his own power, and at the same time it is the perfect way to exalt those who have voluntarily renounced this access. This form of exaltation also has a deeper sense, in that it gives the representatives of religious institutions a guarantee that the believers will be obedient to them, and by this token their position will remain unthreatened. And so the main purpose of this sort of ideology is to restrain those who could by nature pose a genuine threat to the domination of religious institutions.</p><p>Whereas Zarathustra brings a new message that allows mankind to break the chains for good and all, and to overthrow the last vestiges of the old order. Vestiges that were not so much material, as rooted in thinking and ethics based on Christian values. This is exactly what is meant by another famous Nietzschean maxim, about 'the revaluation of all values' – the profound revision of a moral system that, under the guise of goodness and noble-mindedness, leads above all to slavery.</p><p>In any case, the theme of an endless play-off between strength and weakness was, according to Nietzsche, central to the history of humanity long before Christianity became its dominant religion. This is superbly demonstrated by Professor Tadeusz Bartoś in his latest book, <em>Klątwa Parmenidesa</em> [The Curse of Parmenides]. Nietzsche had already perceived this sort of conflict within Greek culture, which for him was the basic point of departure. It was expressed in various features, including the famous division into what was Dionysian and what was Apollonian: chaos, passion and ecstasy versus structure, rationality and abstract thought.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>The new man</h3><p>Nietzsche viewed his own contemporary era through this same prism – as a world of people who were at a standstill, entirely cut off from any enlivening sources. Christianity was just one of many factors – alongside a taste for danger, a cult of averageness, mediocrity and general indolence – responsible for this state of affairs. In a brilliant flash of intuition, perhaps sensing in advance the radical shocks that the 20th century would bring, Nietzsche announced the need for the era of the 'superman' to arrive, someone who would elude all the classifications derived from the old value systems.</p><p>A few decades later, the concept of the 'superman' (in German, <em>Übermensch</em>) – although in actual fact it wasn't entirely clear who exactly he was meant to be – would be given a nightmare interpretation by the Nazi movement, whose representatives were eager to refer to Nietzsche's philosophy. This occurred to a vast extent because of his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche who, as an ardent anti-Semite and nationalist, and also a member of the Nazi Party, thoroughly manipulated her brother's oeuvre and message. The Nazi reception of Nietzsche's texts is one of the most agonizing examples of a profoundly inadequate interpretation of a philosophical work. Nietzsche had nothing in common with the national-socialist ideology – if he had lived in the days of Hitler, he would undoubtedly have spoken of him with the utmost contempt.</p><p>\"In Nietzsche's eyes, the Nazi <em>Übermensch</em>,\" writes Bartoś in his new book, \"would have been a coward, a hidden assassin, the essence of the epitome of weakness – regrettable resentment. Moreover, if we trace Hitler's frustrations as recorded in <em>Mein Kampf</em>, when he talks for instance about the Slavic threat in Austria and his other phobias, it is plain to see that this criminal was not the embodiment of strength, but of weakness, which he chose to address by conspiring, manipulating and murdering. This is a textbook example of resentment in action.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>All over again</h3><p>Full affirmation of life – with its splendour and its cruelty, with everything that prompts horror as well as fascination, with passion as well as order – would not actually be full if not for one particular property of the world around us, which in Nietzsche's opinion was also a simple consequence of moving away from thinking in terms of a deity, a final judgement or letting any other metaphysical idea dominate time and creation.</p><p>And this property is the eternal return of the same thing. The world is an eternal, but finite whole, declares Zarathustra, in which everything dies and everything is reborn. Thus inevitably, though after an unimaginable length of time, every component of the current situation, all the tiniest elements that have come together to form it, will be repeated in exactly the same way. So there will be no final salvation, liberation, or end of time. Everything will keep happening over and over again <em>ad infinitum</em>.

A far more self-critical culture, they find comfort forgoing the small talk, getting to work, and honing in on areas to improve. But one area where Estonians will simply have to grit and bare the praise is in discussing their education system. Smaller than West Virginia and with a population of 1.3 million, this Baltic state has developed one of the world's best education systems as assessed by <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/pisa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results.</a></p><p>PISA is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) triennial study that measures the reading, mathematics, and science abilities of 15-year-olds across the world. Talks of PISA tend to focus on educational powerhouses such as <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mike-colagrossi/no-standardized-tests-no-private-schools-no-stress-10-reasons-why-finlands-education-system-in-the-best-in-the-world\" target=\"_self\">Finland</a>, Singapore, and Korea, but those looking closely have been noticing Estonia's ascent throughout the years. It began in 2006, and despite a small dip in 2009, the country's scores continued upward in 2012 and 2015. </p><p>By 2018, <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/pisa-2018-results.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the most recent PISA study</a>, Estonia became Europe's number one performing country and one of the best in the world. Its students placed fifth in reading, eighth in math, and fourth in science, with mean scores in each that were well above the mean. The only education departments to outperform Estonia's were Singapore and a few of China's distinct economic areas, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Macau.</p><p>Such a cohort may make the reason for such scores obvious. Like Singapore and Shanghai, Estonia is both small and relatively affluent; such education departments simply spread out their resources across fewer students. But PISA's data doesn't support this reasoning. While socioeconomic background is an important predictor of academic success, it doesn't play out that more money equals better education. In fact, according to PISA data, Estonia's per student expenditure was 30 percent lower than the OECD average. Conversely, the United States handily outspends many other countries but receives middling PISA scores for its investment.</p><p>Then what explains Estonia's ascent? That's an answer that requires untangling a myriad of cultural, social, and historical factors that interconnect in ways difficult to untangle. But one factor stands out. A cultural mindset centered only on excellence in education but the drive to give students equal access to that education. </p><h3>Estonia's cultural heirloom</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"2a10956a524467f160f83ddaee4901c5\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"96dbe\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0Mzk5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDMyNjU2OH0.rTLLp1sU-VH33gVkZD33Yn-td9wsEOE3Dm0gjoecly0/img.jpg?width=1068&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=559\"/><p>The belief in education's value is ingrained within Estonian culture. As Mailis Reps, the Estonian Minister of Education and Research, told me in an interview, it's an ethos handed down generation to generation, like a cultural heirloom.</p><p>\"Many generations have had to start from zero all over again. Let it be the war, the regimes, economic reforms, people being deported, people losing their families, or changes to the system,\" Reps said. \"So, education was something that was always given, generation to generation. There's a very strong cultural belief that education is the only thing you cannot take away from a person.\"</p><p>Because education is <a href=\"https://humanrights.ee/en/topics-main/inimoigused-eestis/inimoiguste-aruanne/human-rights-estonia-2014-2015/right-to-education/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a constitutional right</a>, Reps informed me, state and local governments ensure that primary education is available to everyone. Lunches, textbooks, transportation, and study materials are provided gratis, with extracurricular activities subsidized so fees remain low. Local municipalities also subsidize pre-primary education. They maintain a social allowance so fees are tied on a parent's financial situation. Parents enduring economic hardships or temporary setbacks can send their little ones to preschool free of charge, while more financial stable families pay a small fee. And even that fee remains small—Reps says it is no more than €91 (about $107).</p><p>Under such a comprehensive system, many children start their education careers young, as early as 15 months old. Because pre-primary isn't compulsory, parents have more latitude over how their children attend school: half days, a few days a week, etc. By kindergarten, Estonia has a 91 percent attendance rate. Primary attendance is close to universal.</p><p>That system may sound expensive, and like any education system, it takes its share of GDP. But as mentioned, it's not simply a matter of dollars spent. According to <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cmd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the National Center for Education Statistics</a>, in 2016 the United States spent $13,600 per full-time-equivalent student in elementary and secondary education. The OECD average that same year was $9,800. Estonia spent $7,400.</p><p>\"In many countries, the school's socioeconomic context influences the kind of education children are acquiring, and the quality of schooling can shape the socioeconomic contexts of schools,\" Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's director for the Directorate of Education and Skills, writes in <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/pisa/PISA%202018%20Insights%20and%20Interpretations%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his assessment of PISA 2018's data.</a> \"The result is that in most countries, differences in education outcomes related to social inequalities are stubbornly persistent, and too much talent remains latent.\"</p><p>But despite relatively modest spending, that's less true in Estonia. According Schleicher's assessment, 20 percent of disadvantaged boys did not attain minimum proficiency in reading in all countries except three. Estonia was one of those three. It stood as one of 14 countries in which disadvantaged students have at least a one-in-five chance of having high-achieving schoolmates, a ratio that corresponds to reduced social segregation. And the country joined Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom in having more than 13 percent of its disadvantaged students demonstrate academic resilience, a metric that measures proficient educational outcomes in the face of adversity.</p><p>These data point to a weak relationship between student performance and socioeconomic background, a sign that Estonia has lessened the gap between a student's personal situation and their access to quality education.</p><h3>A Tiger Leap forward </h3><br/><img alt=\"students and teacher at computers\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c391c4512ba7c5ee6533cb6a9b4a61dc\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d7e87\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0NDAyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDM0MTA4Nn0.H5-_Jxe6JOldGX12EhCtz1lr4yArmlCaKHD5UBXwIkg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C47%2C0%2C175&height=700\"/><p>A crucial example of Estonia's dedication to equity can be seen in how it wove digital technology into the learning fabric. In the last two decades, Silicon Valley has had a commanding influence in how we approach and access education, but for many countries, the push toward always-accessible, always-on education hasn't <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/blogs/technology-and-learning/technology-driving-educational-inequality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ameliorated many systemic inequalities</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/finland-education-system?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3\" target=\"_self\">Consider the United States</a>. The U.S. finances schools through local property taxes or federal grants tied to test scores and attendance rates. This leaves schools in well-to-do districts with a lion share of funding and resources. Such lopsided endowments, as noted <a href=\"https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/2018-01-10-Education-Inequity.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a 2018 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a>, \"harm students subject to them\" and are \"fundamentally inconsistent with the American ideal of public education operating as a means to equalize life opportunity.\" An inconsistency that the Supreme Court has defended as perfectly <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1972/71-1332\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in keeping with the U.S. Constitution</a>.</p><p>This legacy inequality left many low-income neighborhoods facing another disadvantage at the turn of the century: a lack of access to technology. That reality became starkly apparent in <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/\" target=\"_self\">the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2020/06/22/unequally-disconnected-access-to-online-learning-in-the-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Data from the U.S. Census Bureau</a> suggests that as schools closed, \"1 in 10 of the poorest children in the U.S. has little or no access to technology\" for learning. For children being raised in a household earning less than $25,000 a year, roughly ten percent have no access to the internet or digital learning devices.</p><p>Conversely, Estonia has made internet access available to all students. In the late 1990s, after its independence from Russia, Estonia initiated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiigrih%C3%BCpe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tiger Leap</em></a>. The program invested heavily in building and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22317297\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developing infrastructure for the e-revolution</a>. The push moved many social programs online, such as taxes, voting, and health records, and schools were updated for internet access, computer labs, and the then-latest technologies. </p><p>Today, Estonia has made digital literacy a key competency required in its educational outcomes. Learning materials, such as textbooks and assessments, must be available for free in a digital format (known as the e-schoolbag). Even schools in remote areas enjoy access to high-speed internet.</p><p>That may sound concerning to parents worried that today's technology has reduced learning to the solitude of screens and mental cubicles. But the Estonian government only provides access to the tools and ensures they work. Schools and teachers have broad autonomy in determining when and how to use them. That is, after all, their expertise.</p><p>\"We have never forced our teachers to use it, but we have celebrated if they do so,\" Reps said. \"This is one of the things that I advocate a lot. Provide them the possibility, build them the infrastructure, the quality needs to be there. Because if you start downloading and it doesn't work, no young person accepts it.\"</p><p>Teachers of young students, for example, may forgo technological solutions in favor of more analog approaches to develop motor and social skills. Meanwhile, secondary education may lean heavier on online assessments to prepare students for a tech-focused workforce.</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/technology/silicon-valley-kansas-schools.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Silicon Valley's push into the U.S. education system</a>—a seeming bid to capitalize as much on student's learning time as their free time—Estonia prefers a more Goldilocks strategy. As Gunda Tire, Estonia's PISA National Project Manager, told me in an interview: \"If you look at PISA data about education systems that use a lot of technology, if they use it very extensively, they have lower scores. If they don't use it at all, they also have lower scores. The big challenge is to find the balance.\"</p><p>As we've learned during the pandemic, that's a balance that shifts with circumstance, but by distributing the tools and infrastructure broadly, Estonia has been able to keep its footing. Reps estimates that before the COVID-19 shutdowns, approximately 14 percent of schools regularly used the available digital textbooks. Most preferred the physical counterpart. </p><p>But because the digital option was available for ever school, they were able to quickly pivot to a 100-percent use rate. Additionally, years of prioritizing computer literacy development helped teachers gain competency in digital learning tools, and a civil social push identified at-need children to equip them with the devices necessary to learn remotely. As Mart Laidmets, Estonia's secretary general of the Ministry of Education and Research, said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ZOQbMdSm8\" target=\"_blank\">a roundtable on the subject</a>, it looked as though the country had \"been preparing for such a crisis for 25 years.\"</p><h3>What can we learn from Estonia's success?</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7062b1eb332bc8c8b101f53433f20be7\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbhQ_euH7Ac?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>While Estonia may not spend as much on a dollar-to-dollar basis, the country has created immense valuable in its system by spreading the educational wealth. Part of that achievement stems from removing barriers to primary education and fostering equal-access to learning technology; however, those are simply examples of the principle of equity at work. <a href=\"https://ncee.org/what-we-do/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/top-performing-countries/estonia-overview/estonia-teacher-and-principal-quality/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Others include well-educated teachers</a>, even at the pre-primary level; granting schools broad autonomy to adapt the national curriculum to suit local and cultural needs; and maintaining at-school support centers so students have access to mentors, psychologists, special needs teachers, and anti-bullying resources. The list goes on.</p><p>\"The success of any system is sort of like a puzzle,\" Tire said. \"You have to have many pieces and fit them in properly, or you won't see the whole picture.\"</p><p>Is there room for improvement? Of course! Just ask any Estonian. Tire told me that recent PISA data showed a discrepancy in the results between the country's Estonian-speaking students and its Russian-speaking ones. They are looking into the reason for that gap and how to raise scores across the board. When asked the same question, Reps pointed to improving the country's vocational-track education, the integration of practical skills into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gymnasium</a>, and research into personalized learning.</p><p>When asked what other countries could takeaway from Estonia's example, my interviewees were more cautious. As Reps rightly points out, \"Education is so culturally and historically tied. It's very difficult to copy something, and I would be careful to tell any country to copy the Estonian model.\" </p><p>She did offer some facets for consideration, though. She recommends that systems never look at a child as a problem to solve. Instead, it should look to ameliorate issues in their background or experiences. Even though education systems can be expensive, they should always be child-friendly and dedicated toward their growth. Digital technology doesn't create equality de facto; it must be accessible to all. And trust your teachers. \"They are amazing human beings. They come to teach; they want to give their best; they want to help their pupils.\"</p><p>In my own research into Estonia's education system, its history, and its successes, I would humbly add one more: Foster a culture that values education and assures its available to everyone.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/d1-MYa5CvWE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 17:24:13 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0MzY5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzU3NDM2Nn0.qL6quzr2CX3juOng779MhCRLGfk93xlA-nyPkf53FZA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C202%2C0%2C124&height=700","linkMd5":"334efe49bd98b7a1e3ac70cdcb1f6c69","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-41-138_46723c20876bb827.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":126260,"destBytes":126260,"author":"Kevin Dickinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0MzY5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzU3NDM2Nn0.qL6quzr2CX3juOng779MhCRLGfk93xlA-nyPkf53FZA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C202%2C0%2C124&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-41-138_46723c20876bb827.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0Mzk5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDMyNjU2OH0.rTLLp1sU-VH33gVkZD33Yn-td9wsEOE3Dm0gjoecly0/img.jpg?width=1068&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=559":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_2/2020/09/16/05-04-08-435_96dbe75e86f85e13.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc0NDAyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDM0MTA4Nn0.H5-_Jxe6JOldGX12EhCtz1lr4yArmlCaKHD5UBXwIkg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C47%2C0%2C175&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_5/2020/09/16/05-04-08-459_d7e87c55ee8c856f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/d1-MYa5CvWE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_5/2020/09/16/05-04-08-278_7e8265564ad25fa4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620746},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"The world’s largest space camera’s first test subject?

(Our phones and tablets instead use <a href=\"https://lifeinlofi.com/2015/05/06/how-does-your-iphone-cmos-shutter-work/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CMOS</a> sensors.) The LSST camera contains 189 CCD sensors. The sensors are arranged into 21 squares of nine CCDs each — each square is called a \"science raft.\" The 2-foot-tall, 20-pound rafts are mounted in a grid inside the camera. This all adds up to 3.2 billion pixels, each of which is tiny at 10 microns in size, about a tenth of the width of a human hair.</p><p>As you might expect, assembling such sophisticated hardware is not for the faint of heart. The rafts must be precisely positioned in the grid so that they're separated by a width equivalent to just five human hairs. If they touch they crack, and down the drain goes $3 million per raft. The SLAC team practiced the assembly operation for a year before the six-month assembly process commenced.</p><h3>Amazingly detailed images</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"32a84ac359d1e08caf87ad1d1f0f8fce\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IP3TUneJ0ho?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>The camera will be worth the effort.</p><p>The flatness of its giant focal plane — over 2 feet wide, as opposed to 1.4 inches in a consumer camera — will allow it to capture images of the heavens about 40 moons across. Zoomed in, the team says an image it produces will be so clear it will be like seeing a golf ball from 15 miles away. The camera will also be highly sensitive to dim objects, so it will be able to take pictures of things that are more than 100 million times dimmer than what we can see with our eyes — it's comparable to being able to see a candle from 1,000 miles away. Project scientists Steven Ritz sums it up: \"These specifications are just astounding.\"</p><p>Once assembled, the focal plane was put inside a custom-built cryostat for cooling — the required operating temperature is -150° F.</p><h3>Broccoli, say \"cheese.\"</h3><br/><a href=\"https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~tonyj/osd/public/romanesco.html\"><img alt=\"broccoli image captured by LSST camera\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"dc13ce1e827f4380684bb21aa006d47c\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"0c7cc\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDMwODA5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDEwNTEyNX0.nszfZqSEKmPZabqaYBziJOQetJ6VAowQ7678QB4G6a0/img.jpg?width=980\"/></a><p>Broccoli's surface is packed with tiny details, making it a sensible candidate for testing out the focal plane.

In our reach skyward we've built ziggurats, pyramids, and coliseums. Our mythologies placed the seat of the gods in lofty towers high on mountaintops. We've had moralizing religious parables like the Tower of Babel, warning those who'd place themselves above a god. And some of the self-proclaimed greatest among us have always sought to immortalize themselves through massive works.</p><p>It's safe to say our world civilization is one fixed on achieving ever higher <em>milestones.</em></p><p>Yet, the dreams and wonders of yesterday's buildings look like children's toys compared to our structures now. In the past century and a half skyscrapers have come to dominate the city's form and they haven't stopped growing taller. </p><p>Now we have to ask ourselves, is it possible to build a skyscraper one mile high? </p><p>Perhaps. Let's find out. </p><h3>Frank Lloyd Wright’s The Mile-High Illinois </h3><br/><p>One of the first legitimate plans to build a mile-high tower that wasn't some megalomaniac's fever dream (maybe his was too), was famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright's The Illinois. </p><p>On October 16th, 1956 at the Sherman House Hotel in Chicago, Wright at 89 years old presented his design for what he conceived to be the tallest skyscraper in the world, an incredible spire shooting one mile high. The structure proposed to stand 528 floors and 5,280 feet (1,609 meters) tall. Behind him stood an illustration that measured 25 feet (7.6 meters) tall with the skyscraper's dimensions drawn at a scale of 1/16 inch to the foot. The Illinois' dimensions would have been astronomical at the time, with: </p><ul><li>528 floors </li><li>76 elevators </li><li>Gross floor area (GFA): 18,460,106 ft² (1,715,000 m²)</li><li>100,000 occupants </li><li>15,000 parking spaces </li><li>100 helicopter landing pads </li><li>Architectural height of 5,280 ft (1,609.4 m)</li><li>Tip antenna height of 5,706 ft (1739.2 m)</li></ul><p>\"This is The Illinois, gentlemen… In it, will be consolidated all government offices now scattered around Chicago,\" Wright proclaimed.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"34c0f1f6be1aa9541ef9818dc89910f5\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"61570\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDMxODc3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MjAwNDU2NH0.eJMPnaR6TpYJGS2J08lHCQDRUQtdzVVCJOI8jmcjPK8/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Wright in an exemplary display of showmanship unveiled the first proposal for the mile-high tower. He believed that he'd found a method to construct the tower out of two principles he coined \"tenuity\" and \"continuity.\" With these methods he'd believed he would be able to construct the tower out of reinforced concrete and steel.</p>\n<p>The general principles between these two ideas is characterized by Wright's designs in which he used a \"taproot\" foundation to support the central load of the structure. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/ct-frank-lloyd-wright-mile-high-met-0528-20170528-column.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Tribune's Blaire Kamin</a> described it as follows: </p>\n<p> \"The Mile-High didn't simply aim to be tall. It was the ultimate expression of Wright's \"taproot\" structural system, which sank a central concrete mast deep into the ground and cantilevered floors from the mast. In contrast to a typical skyscraper, in which same-size floors are piled atop one another like so many pancakes, the taproot system lets floors vary in size, opening a high-rise's interior and letting space flow between floors.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><p><br/></p><p>In Wright's own words he saw his method as a break from conventional form, which instead he'd mimic the appearance of a tree with its deep roots and branches spreading deep into the foundation. </p><p>\"I detest seeing the boys fooling around and making their buildings look like boxes,\" Wright said. \"Why not design a building that really is tall? ... Long ago I observed trees after the passing of a cyclone. Those with deep taproots were the ones that survived.\"</p><p>As evident by our lack of sky cracking buildings, Wright's vision never came to pass. His taproot idea, which had only been put into practice in a single building of his, never became part of the future structural engineer's toolkit. While Wright did put an extraordinary amount of effort working out the details of this vision, there were far too many what-ifs that still hadn't been figured out. Many of which we're still working on today.</p><p>But there has been progress. </p><h3>Building technology for a 1-mile skyscraper </h3><br><p>The undefeated champion of the skies right now is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 2,717 feet (roughly half a mile) and is the tallest building in the world.</p><p>Although take that with a grain of dusty salt—only 1,916 feet of the Burj Dubai is occupiable space, the rest is vanity height, meaning nearly 800 feet is non-occupiable space. That represents 29 percent of the building's height. </p><p>So let's get back to real contenders for a mile high.</p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/08/20/2343/get-ready-for-more-and-taller-skyscrapers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Researchers at MIT Technology Review</a> used data from the experts at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat and predicted that there is a 9 percent chance that a building exceeding a mile will be built by 2050. They've also predicted that by 2050, nearly 6 billion people will live in cities. Already we're seeing that urban areas in China and the Middle East are continually building up, not out.<h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"238570ff6e5ed8c7afb2c6ec42cf7818\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"44cfe\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDEwMDM3NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTU5NzI4N30.C_l0mR6PFVdr0ZQQiRXBuonLrJoUXgcgfKaqKhWspSw/img.png?width=980\"/><p>There are three major construction and stability aspects that must be dealt with if we're to reach a vertical mile. Those are:</p><ul><li>Dampening wind sway </li><li>Elevator speed and length </li><li>Construction materials </li></ul><p>The tallest skyscrapers all employ a tapered top design. This serves both a utilitarian and structural purpose. It's simply not possible to take pre-existing buildings and just double their height. </p><p>A mile-high tower would not just be a new structure, but a new technology. </p><p>Putting aside Burj Khalifa's vanity height for a moment, we have to admire its structural ingenuity. Designed by architect Adrian Smith and structural engineer William Baker at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the structure's foundational approach is a buttressed core – which is a hexagonal concrete core that frays out into three triangle buttresses. This was one inventive solution they made to support such a great height. </p><p>But that only solves one issue. </p><p><strong>Diverting winds at high elevations</strong> </p><p>What might be a slight breeze on the ground floor can turn into a windstorm in greater heights. Aside from the fundamentals of stability, occupants also need comfortability. Most building sway is harmless to the structural integrity of the building. But the last thing anyone wants is to feel like they're in the midst of a tornado 500 floors above ground level. </p><p>Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professionals calculate estimated wind sway from a building's height and incorporate that into the design. Buildings are often made to withstand cataclysmic 500 to 1000 year inclement weather disasters. </p><p>To deal with wind, you either confuse it by spinning it around the building in creative structural ways or you use a mass dampener.</p><p>A mass dampener is a counterweight suspended somewhere in the building to counteract and balance the movement from the outside. For example, the Taipei 101 Tower employs a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-a-730-ton-ball-kept-the-second-tallest-building-fro-5019046\" target=\"_blank\">730 ton orb </a>pendulum that sways back and forth to balance wind from storms and typhoons. </p><p>Aerodynamic vortexes of wind can exert dangerous amounts of pressure and vibrations on a building. Air currents can be unpredictable, so rather than guess what could happen to the building, AEC professionals need to calculate it directly into the design. If it's not a mass dampener, it'll be a mix of structural fins, curves, and asymmetrical floors. </p><p><strong>Elevator speed and stability</strong> </p><p>The logistical obstacles of moving thousands of people in a mile-high skyscraper is one of the biggest challenges. To reach the floor at the top of a mile-high building with current technology would require people to change elevators multiple times. </p><p>The current figure for elevators runs at 1,600 feet as wire suspension ropes cannot support their own weight and any additional weight after that point. Aside from the technical limitations, needing multiple elevator lobbies would take up too much valuable space. </p><p>A few years ago, Finnish elevator company Kone developed a carbon fiber cable, UltraRope that they believe could double the distance of an elevator rope. This would be enough to get those would-be mile-high penthouse residents to their sky digs. </p><p>Beyond the old school cable elevator, others have floated ideas about a looped system that could pull elevators up, down and sideways. This could increase the building's usable area by 25 percent. </p><p><strong>New structural materials</strong> </p><p>Concrete has served us well for thousands of years. It's time to rethink what materials we can use. Engineers are looking at materials like carbon fiber, an extremely lightweight and strong material. </p><p>Carbon fiber is a polymer composed of thin strands of carbon atoms bound together in a unique crystalline formation. It is far lighter than steel, five times stronger and has double the stiffness. Currently carbon fiber is used in a number of manufacturing processes ranging from aircraft wings to bike frames. Carbon fiber and other related composite materials weigh very little but can take on heavy bearing loads.</p><h3>The future of the mile-high skyscraper</h3><br/><p>With billions of residents in our cities, it's an inevitability that we'll one day reach the one-mile-high mark, if not beyond that as well. But we need to think about what these skyscrapers will be used for and how they'll interact with and reshape the built environment. </p><p>At the turn of the 20th century, the 1916 Zoning Resolution in New York City was a measure adopted to stop massive skyscrapers from blocking light and air from reaching the streets below. It established limits to what could be built and created a series of setbacks to building lots. </p><p>New measures would need to be created as a building of this magnitude entered into the public domain. New building uses also need to be considered. How many more luxury condos and office space do we really need? </p><p>The advent of a mile-high tower could bring about a new age of the homestead and of our created environment. We have the opportunity to build something that could be a fully functioning self-contained ecosystem, more than just a building, but a city within a city. </p><p>A mixed use building like this could shelter thousands and give them a place where they could work, play, live, and exist on the peripheries of humankind's greatest ingenuity. A place like this could also serve as a consolidated seat for governments and working space for companies of the future.

Although the ancient signal was faint, its source was cataclysmic: the biggest merger of two black holes ever observed.</p><p>It occurred when two mid-sized black holes — 66 and 85 times the mass of our Sun — drifted close together, began spinning around each other and merged into one black hole roughly 142 times the mass of our Sun. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"It's the biggest bang since the Big Bang observed by humanity,\" Caltech physicist Alan Weinstein, who was part of the discovery team, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/scientists-spot-two-black-holes-merged-into-never-before-seen-size\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> The Associated Press.</p><p>A massive bang, sure. But a black hole of this size actually falls within the \"intermediate-mass\" category, which ranges from about 50 to 1,000 times the mass of our Sun.</p><h3>Intermediate-mass black holes</h3><br/><p>Scientists know relatively little about these mid-sized black holes. They've catalogued small black holes only a few times more massive than the Sun, as well as supermassive black holes more than six billion times the mass of our star. But direct evidence of intermediate-mass black holes has remained elusive.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Long have we searched for an intermediate-mass black hole to bridge the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes,\" Christopher Berry, a professor at Northwestern University's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics), <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/09/scientists-detect-first-of-its-kind-intermediate-mass-black-hole-gravitational-waves/\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> Northwestern Now. \"Now, we have proof that intermediate-mass black holes do exist.\"</p><p>Still, how these middleweight black holes form is a mystery. Scientists know that smaller black holes form when stars explode in violent events called supernovas. But mid-sized black holes couldn't form this way, according to current physics, because stars of a certain mass range undergo a death process called pair instability, where they explode and leave nothing behind, not even a black hole.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"LIGO-Virgo\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"631984c49d6189b4adc5f16960abb723\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"cd591\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzczMTI3MC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzA4OTU2MH0.vU_L8bVABnteqgu83LOUylGMXSkbx4T2iUIO1anTc5I/img.png?width=980\"/><p>As for supermassive black holes?

Physical features are not the only qualities gods share with humans. Pattern recognition appears to be another.</p><p>A god that can make sense out of patterns in nature is certainly a powerful being. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18362-3\" target=\"_blank\">new study</a> from Georgetown University, it appears that humans endowed with this skill are more likely to believe in a god. </p><p>The team, led by Adam Green, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, writes that religious variability is common. Universal themes might be extracted from disparate regions, but each of the hundreds of religious practices that came be known broadly as Hinduism espouse different ideas.</p><p>The same holds true for every religion: Buddhism has a \"great vehicle\" and a lesser one; Shia practices are wildly different than Sufis; Japanese Buddhists practice quite different rituals than California Buddhists; what's divine in one Christian sect is blasphemy in another. While the more fervent religious believe their views to be correct, open-minded believers are likely to see the possibility of communication. </p><p>To combat the problem of relativism, Green's team chose volunteers from American Christians and Afghani Muslims, two varied religious and cultural samples. They wanted to know if implicit pattern learning—\"perceptual mechanisms evolved for predictive processing of environmental information\"—is a predictor of belief in a god. </p><h3>Why religion is literally false and metaphorically true | Bret Weinstein | Big Think</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"bb748b6454d9ea27e58c41be9c4b50f6\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0_J998UD9s?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>The answer, according to their research, is yes.

Our hypothesis is that people whose brains are good at subconsciously discerning patterns in their environment may ascribe those patterns to the hand of a higher power.\" </p><p>Consciousness only provides a sliver of data that our brains pay attention to. Bottom-up processes operate below the conscious threshold, such as the biological operations that maintain our body's homeostasis. Threat detection and other forms of perception are also processed from the bottom-up, although, as the authors write, top-down processing is not an entirely separate domain. The two inform one another. </p><p><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-does-intuition-work\" target=\"_self\">Intuition</a> is another example of bottom-up processing that appears in consciousness. We pick up signals from our environment and process it unconsciously all the time.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Because individuals are not aware of such bottom-up influences, intuitions drawn from unconscious processing may instead be consciously interpreted via explicit belief narratives that provide a rationalized context for beliefs and behaviors.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"surfer on beach\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"f97338e7104091793c6716c6cd1677cc\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"bcd5c\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDAwODIyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNzM2MDMwM30.rRzS-mubeF1S8E-oxYFhj7bJhN7bavCI5pWoIqaLeVo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C328&height=700\"/><p>Face processing, implicit racial bias, and pathogen avoidance provide further context. In fact, cleansing rituals likely evolved from an unconscious fear of disease. Our ancestors applied a spiritual dimension to their bathing rituals to make sense out of unconscious drives.</p><p>For this study, 199 (mostly) Christian volunteers in Washington, D.C. and 149 Muslims in Kabul watched a sequence of dots on a computer screen. They were tasked to press a corresponding button every time a dot appeared. Participants with strong implicit learning abilities began to unconsciously recognize patterns in the appearance of the dots, preemptively hitting the corresponding button <em>before</em> they appeared. None of the volunteers claimed to have seen a pattern, suggesting their guesses were unconscious. </p><p>The team observed a link between the strongest implicit learners and religious belief. Recognizing patterns before they appear is correlated with belief in a god. The team was surprised to discover such a strong correlation between two disparate religious and cultural groups, suggesting the potential of a universal theme. As Green notes, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"A brain that is more predisposed to implicit pattern learning may be more inclined to believe in a god no matter where in the world that brain happens to find itself, or in which religious context.\"</p><p>An interesting next step could be studying polytheistic groups, where pattern recognition is likely stronger. It's one thing to give credit to one god for everything, but quite another to assign a variety of divine figures for the relationships between natural phenomena. </p><p>The authors conclude that they cannot write off top-down processing as part of religious belief. Indeed, faith likes has multivariate influences. Still, this research details another cognitive basis of belief, highlighting common ground we all share regardless of the form of our deities. </p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://derekberes.substack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Substack</a>.

Luckily for us, <a href=\"https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N10-915\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Victor Moberger</a> recently published an essay in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17552567\" target=\"_blank\">Theoria</a> on what counts as bullsh*t, how it interacts with pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy, and what to do about it. </p><h3>The Unified Theory of B.S.  </h3><br/><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">The essay \"</span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/theo.12271?af=R\" target=\"_blank\">Bullshit, Pseudoscience and Pseudophilosophy</a>\"<span style=\"background-color: initial;\"><em> </em></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">considers much of the nonsense we encounter </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">and </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">offers a definition </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that allows us to move forward in dealing with it.</span></p><p>Dr. Moberger argues that what makes something bullshit is a \"lack of epistemic conscientiousness,\" meaning that the person arguing for it takes no care to assure the truth of their statements. This typically manifests in systemic errors in reasoning and the frequent use of <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/ten-logical-mistakes-you-make-everyday-and-what-to-instead\" target=\"_blank\">logical fallacies </a>such as <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem\" target=\"_blank\">ad hominem</a>, red herring, <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white\" target=\"_blank\">false dilemma</a>, and <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-texas-sharpshooter\" target=\"_blank\">cherry picking</a><em>, </em>among <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">others</a>.  </p><p>This makes bullsh*t different from lying, which involves caring what the truth is and purposely moving away from it, or mere indifference to truth, as it is quite possible for people pushing nonsense to care about their nonsense being true. It also makes it different from making the occasional mistake with reasoning, occasional errors differ from a systemic reliance on them.  </p><p>Importantly, nonsense is also dependent on the epistemic unconscientiousness of the person pushing it rather than its content alone. This means some of it may end up being true (consider cases where a person's personality does match up with their star sign), but they end up being true for reasons unrelated to the bad reasoning used by its <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy\" target=\"_blank\">advocates</a>.  </p><p>Lots of things can, justly, be deemed \"bullshit\" under this understanding; such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-philosophers-stone/dismantling-astrology-and-pseudoscience-arguments-628411bc26af\" target=\"_blank\">astrology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/12/no-scientific-case-homeopathy-remedies-pharmacists-placebos\" target=\"_blank\">homeopathy</a>, climate change denialism,<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round/\" target=\"_blank\"> flat-Earthism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/\" target=\"_blank\">creationism</a>, and the anti-vaccine movement. </p><h3>Two subcategories: pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy  </h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCdcluiAOKU\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Two commonly </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">encountered</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"> kinds of </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">bullsh*t</span> are pseudoscience and <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">pseudophilosophy</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. They can be easily defined as \"</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">bullshit with scientific pretensions\" and \"</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">bullshit</span> with philosophical pretensions.\"<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Here are a few examples which </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">will</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"> clarify exactly what </span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">these things mean</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">.</span></p><p>A form of pseudoscience would be flat-Earthism. While it takes on scientific pretensions and can be, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/38931-kids-can-prove-earth-round.html\" target=\"_blank\">and has been,</a> proven false, supporters of the idea that the Earth is flat are well known for handwaving away any evidence that falsifies their stance and dismissing good arguments against their worldview.  </p><p>An amusing and illustrative example is the case of the flat-Earthers who devised two experiments to determine if the earth was flat or spherical. When their experiments produced results exactly consistent with the Earth being <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/behind-curve-netflix-ending-light-experiment-mark-sargent-documentary-movie-1343362\" target=\"_blank\">spherical</a>, they refused to accept the results and concluded that something went wrong; despite having no reason to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132210-900-feedback-flat-earthers-accidentally-prove-themselves-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">do so</a>. Clearly, these fellows lack epistemic conscientiousness.  </p><p>Pseudophilosophy is less frequently considered, but can be explained with examples of its two most popular forms. </p><p>The first is dubbed \"obscurantist pseudophilosophy.<em>\" </em>It often takes the form of nonsense posing as philosophy using copious amounts of jargon and arcane, frequently erroneous reasoning connecting a mundane truth to an exciting, fantastic falsehood. </p><p>As an example, there are more than a few cases where people have argued that physical reality is a social construct. This idea is based on the perhaps trivial notion that our beliefs about reality are social <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/shatvo-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">constructs</a>. Often in cases like this, when challenged on the former point, advocates of the more fantastic point will retreat to the latter, as its is less controversial, and claim the issue was one of linguistic confusion caused by their <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ambiguity\" target=\"_blank\">obscure terminology</a>. When the coast is clear, they frequently return to the original stance.  </p><p>Dr. Moberger suggests that the humanities and social sciences seem to have a weakness for these seemingly profound pseudophilosophies without being nonsensical fields themselves.  </p><p>The second is \"scientistic pseudophilosophy<em>\" </em>and is often seen in popular science writing. It frequently manifests when questions considered in scientific writing are topics of philosophy rather than science. Because science writers are often not trained in philosophy, they may produce pseudophilosophy when trying to interact with these questions. </p><p>A famous example is Sam Harris' attempt at reducing the problems of moral philosophy to scientific problems. His book \"The Moral Landscape\" is infamously littered with <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman\" target=\"_blank\">strawman arguments,</a> a failure to interact with relevant philosophical literature, and <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/blackburn-ethics-without-god-secularism-religion-sam-harris\" target=\"_blank\">bad philosophy in general</a>.  </p><p>In all of these cases, we see that the supporters of some kind of nonsense think that what they are supporting is true, but that they are willing to ignore the basic rules of science and philosophical reasoning in order to do so. </p><h3>Okay, so there is plenty of nonsense in the world. What do we do about it?</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omTJxZJgSKk\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">While the first step to dealing with</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"> this</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"> nonsense is to understand what it is, many people would like to go a little farther than that.</span></p><p>Dr. Moberger explained that sometimes, the best thing we can do is show a little humility: </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><br/><em>\"One of the main points of the essay is that there is no sharp boundary between bullshit and non-bullshit. Pseudoscience, pseudophilosophy and other kinds of bullshit are very much continuous with the kind of epistemic irresponsibility or unconscientiousness that we all display in our daily lives. We all have biases and we all dislike cognitive dissonance, and so without realizing it we cherry-pick evidence and use various kinds of fallacious reasoning. This tendency is especially strong when it comes to emotionally sensitive areas, such as politics, where we may have built part of our sense of identity and worth around a particular stance. Well-educated, smart people are no exception. In fact, they are sometimes worse, since they are more adept at using sophistry to rationalize their biases. Thus, the first thing to realize, I think, is that all of us are prone to produce bullshit and that it is much easier to spot other people's bullshit than our own. Intellectual humility is first and foremost. To me it does not come naturally and I struggle with it all the time.\"</em> </p><p>He also advises that people take the time to develop their critical thinking skills: </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>\"I think it is also very helpful to develop the kind of critical thinking skills that are taught to undergraduates in philosophy. The best book I know of in the genre is Richard Feldman's '<a href=\"http://www.susanpetrilli.com/files/II.-Reason-and-Argument,-R.-Feldman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Reason and Argument</a>.' It provides the basic conceptual tools necessary for thinking clearly about philosophical issues, but those tools are certainly useful outside of philosophy too.\"</em> </p><p>Lastly, he reminds us that looking at the facts of the matter can clear things up: </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Finally, no degree of intellectual humility or critical thinking skills is a substitute for gathering relevant information about the issue at hand. And this is where empirical science comes in. If we want to think rationally about any broadly speaking empirical issue, we need to inform ourselves about what empirical science has to say about it. We also need to remember that individual scientists are often unreliable and that scientific consensus is what we should look for. (Indeed, it is a common theme in pseudoscience to appeal to individual scientists whose views do not reflect scientific consensus.)\" </p><p>A great deal of the pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy we deal with is characterized not by being false or even unfalsifiable, but rather by a lack of concern for assuring that something is true by the person pushing it. Oftentimes, it is presented with fairly common logical fallacies and bold claims of rejecting the scientific consensus. <br/> <br/>While having this definition doesn't remove bullshit from the world, it might help you avoid stepping in it. In the end, isn't that what matters? </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/yWRVjH6Hqog\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 19:36:24 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc5OTk3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNTM1ODUyMH0.rkFbAOrppohc5UQTegxZrNa7T11dI13__VY8T83Bjbs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C106%2C0%2C68&height=700","linkMd5":"0c45e9320a1736151b9dff1305b7cba1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn32@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-40-988_f677340caee7b091.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":42170,"destBytes":42170,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc5OTk3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNTM1ODUyMH0.rkFbAOrppohc5UQTegxZrNa7T11dI13__VY8T83Bjbs/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C106%2C0%2C68&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn32@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-40-988_f677340caee7b091.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/yWRVjH6Hqog":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn60@2020_3/2020/09/16/05-04-09-100_cf405538e0aa4ef3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620738},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Rock study may have just revealed cause of Triassic mass extinction","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/triassic-jurassic-extinction","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk4NzU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTE3NDMzMn0.emju3Pq3MfBBt6FHoymbIPw5pergEwL0qBr_HjCZtAQ/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C157%2C0%2C202&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new study suggests that the mass extinction that gave dinosaurs the evolutionary upper hand was caused by oceanic oxygen deprivation.  </li><li>Using ratios of sulfur isotopes, researchers could estimate changes in ocean oxygen levels in ancient seas. </li><li>The authors suggest a similar mechanism as that which can cause dead zones in oceans today caused a mass extinction. </li></ul><hr/><p>Living on Earth isn't always easy.

The \"Big Five\" events each killed an average of 75 percent of all species alive at the time, with the largest one wiping more than 90 percent of them. While the question of what caused these events is interesting as a curiosity in and of itself, the problem also takes on an existential one, as most people would like to avoid the same fate as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">trilobites</a>. <br/> <br/> To that end, a team of researchers based out of the UK, China, and Italy have investigated the causes behind one of the most massive die-offs in history. In a new <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/37/eabb6704\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> published in <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Advances</a><em>, </em>they suggest a depletion in oxygen as a cause for the event at the end of the Triassic Era 201.3 million years ago. </p><h3>How to tell what the world was like 201 million years ago\nusing rocks </h3><br/><p>The mass extinction that ended the Triassic period was a massive die-off that saw somewhere between a quarter and a third of ocean life vanish alongside most large land <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic%E2%80%93Jurassic_extinction_event\" target=\"_blank\">animals</a>. Plants were not spared a culling either, with perhaps 60 percent of plant species also dying. The event took less than 10,000 years to carry out this morbid work. This remarkable event paved the way for dinosaurs to become the dominant land animal during the Jurassic period, as most of their competition was dead.</p><p>Explanations for this event's cause have ranged from gradual climate change, to asteroid impacts, to rampant volcanism. New evidence suggests that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxic_event\" target=\"_blank\">ocean anoxia</a>, the depletion of oxygen supplies in the ocean, played a large role. </p><p>The researchers examined the levels of two isotopes of sulfur in rocks that would have been on the seafloor during the extinction event from British Columbia, Sicily, and Northern Ireland. The two isotopes, <sup>32</sup>S and <sup>34</sup>S, can become trapped in limestone and other rocks and exist at different ratios depending on how much oxygen is in the water around them. By examining the changes in the ratio of the two isotopes in rocks formed at the time, we can know what was happening to oxygen levels in the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago. </p><p>The scientists noticed \"large spikes\" in the ratio of <sup>34</sup>S to <sup>32</sup>S in the samples from all of the locations, indicative of a substantial fall in the amount of oxygen available. These findings can be applied far beyond the sites the rock samples came from, suggesting that oxygen levels fell across large portions of the globe-spanning superocean, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Panthalassa, </a>that existed alongside Pangea.<strong> </strong></p><h3>And you thought the Dead Zone in the Gulf\nof Mexico was bad. </h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yObCpYLLJSk\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p>This study isn't the only one suggesting Ocean anoxia caused the extinction event. A previous <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GC006941\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> from 2017 reached a similar conclusion by measuring the trace uranium levels in rocks formed at the time. Similarly to the ratio of sulfur isotopes considered above, the amount of uranium in these rocks varies with the amount of oxygen. That study suggests that the low oxygen levels may have lasted 50,000 years after their initial fall, with a full 250,000 years needed before coral reefs could <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2017-08-global-oceanic-dead-zones-persisted.html\" target=\"_blank\">recover</a>.</p><p>In the present day, the researchers hypothesize that this anoxia was connected to significant volcanic activity at the time. By releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gasses, this would have both acidified the oceans by increasing their carbon content and lowered their oxygen levels by raising global temperatures, as warm water holds less oxygen <a href=\"http://limnoloan.org/waterquality/dissolved_oxygen/#:~:text=Warm%20water%20holds%20less%20dissolved,to%20escape%20from%20the%20water.&text=Therefore%20the%20warmer%20and%20saltier,dissolved%20oxygen%20it%20will%20contain.\" target=\"_blank\">overall</a>.

Now, scientists are discovering the miraculous healing potential of its sting in curing cancer. New laboratory studies by a team of Australian researchers have found that the active component of honeybee venom, melittin, rapidly killed two forms of malignant breast cancer cells that are notoriously difficult to treat while leaving healthy cells unharmed. </p><h3>The magic molecule </h3><br/><p>Previously, honeybee venom has shown potential in treating other medical conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/mellitin-bee-venom-eczema-inflammation-treatment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eczema</a> and tumors, and it has been known to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010108003796?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">have anticancer properties</a>. How the venom works against tumors on a molecular level hasn't been understood, but science just got a lot closer. </p><p>It seems that the magic healing ingredient in the honeybees' venom is melittin — the zingy molecule responsible for producing the painful sting of a bee. Scientists at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in Perth, Australia and the University of Western Australia found that the melittin induced cancer cell death. </p><p>Their lab study, reported in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-020-00129-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NPJ Precision Oncology</a>, is the first to have looked into the effect the ingredient has on a range of breast cancers, the most common cancer in women worldwide. The two most aggressive and hard-to-treat types are known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-enriched breast cancer, which tend to mutate to resist existing treatments. The researchers found that melittin rapidly kills these cancer types and, critically, does so with no negative effects on normal cells. </p><p>\"The venom was extremely potent,\" <a href=\"https://www.perkins.org.au/honeybee-venom-kills-breast-cancer-cells/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> research leader Ciara Duffy from The Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in a news release. \"We found that melittin can completely destroy cancer cell membranes within 60 minutes.\"</p><p>The lab study also found that bumblebee venom (which does not contain melittin) did not kill those particular breast cancer cells.</p><h3>How it works</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"df37e6f56c59da163c4ed2df27444ee7\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3oMN1a_pdg?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>Melittin disarms cancer cells by puncturing holes in their outer membrane. Another stunning effect: within just 20 minutes of exposure to melittin, the chemical messages cancer cells need to grow and divide are disrupted.</p><p>\"We looked at how honeybee venom and melittin affect the cancer signaling pathways, the chemical messages that are fundamental for cancer cell growth and reproduction, and we found that very quickly these signaling pathways were shut down,\" <a href=\"https://www.perkins.org.au/honeybee-venom-kills-breast-cancer-cells/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said Duffy</a>.</p><p>The molecule is able to do this by stopping the activation of receptors that signal growth factors in the cells' membranes. The large number of these receptors in HER2-enriched cancer cells and some TNBC cells is one reason for their uncontrollable growth. Melittin seems to halt the cell's proliferation by blocking those growth signals from getting through. </p><p>\"Significantly, this study demonstrates how melittin interferes with signalling pathways within breast cancer cells to reduce cell replication,\" said Western Australia's Chief Scientist Professor Peter Klinken. \"It provides another wonderful example of where compounds in nature can be used to treat human diseases.\"</p><h3>Enhancing current cancer treatments</h3><br/><p>The team also tested to see if melittin could be used with existing chemotherapy drugs, as the pores in the membranes that it creates may allow other treatments to faster penetrate and kill cancer cells. </p><p>They tested the idea on a lab mouse with triple-negative breast cancer.

Without gravity, the musculoskeletal system starts to atrophy because it no longer needs to support any weight. And even though regular exercise in space keeps astronauts in decent shape, bone and muscle loss remains a major health concern for long-term space missions.</p><p>A new study published in the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/01/2014716117#sec-1\" target=\"_blank\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> suggests that targeting a specific signaling pathway in the body can help prevent bone and muscle loss in space.</p><p>The study involved sending 40 mice to the ISS for a month-long stay. Eight of the mice were missing the gene for myostatin, a protein known to inhibit muscle growth. Another eight mice were given a treatment that suppresses myostatin and the protein activin A, which also helps to regulate muscle mass. The rest of the mice (24) were left untreated as a control group.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"Mice space study\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"94456b797f70344a1a4c10b0d8e128fd\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"74b8f\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzg1MjY5My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTA2ODI5OX0.RJqWw1b9Dh1Ybbr2yin2Fra7EXHmhOVMSHcjC62mHdI/img.png?width=980\"/><p>Upon return to Earth, the untreated mice showed significant losses in muscle mass and bone density. But the mice missing the myostatin gene retained almost all of their muscle and bone mass. What's more, the mice that received the gene-inhibiting treatment actually gained bone and muscle mass. The researchers observed similar results among a separate group of mice that were given the same set of treatments on Earth.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"These findings show that blocking the activities of these hormones does work to enhance both muscle and bone even when mice are unable to bear weight,\" study authors Se-Jin Lee and Emily L.

That's the extent of their similarity to household tweezers: Acoustic tweezers are not small hand-held devices to pinch with. They're much more high-tech than that. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_tweezers\" target=\"_blank\">Acoustic tweezers</a> use pairs of sound waves directed at the object to be manipulated. (NASA has an <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/X59/science-of-sound.html\" target=\"_blank\">excellent pair of short videos</a> explaining how sound waves work.)</p><p>In an acoustic tweezer, sound waves directed toward each other push an object into the location at which the waves meet, called a \"trapping node.\" Once the object is trapped there, the node's position can be repositioned as desired by adjusting the strength, or amplitude, of the sound waves. As the node moves, so does the object trapped within it.</p><p>Acoustic tweezers provide a touch-free, gentle and non-destructive means of holding on to and manipulating even very tiny objects — a single cell or particle, for example. Using multiple sound waves emitted from opposite each other, and above and below, objects can be moved in three dimensions. This allows scientists to mix objects together with tremendous precision and to construct two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures from trapped objects. </p><h3>How the prototypes work</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"dc8c535494b9830e1a1a594d8495b2c1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"120f9\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5MjExOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODA1ODkzM30.ypFFEBKMYg0iBNvAQ3aiF07-UK8OM8nACZTQTM9unds/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>The researchers present three different prototypes in their paper. They all employ small <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity\" target=\"_blank\">piezoelectric</a> <a href=\"https://blog.teufelaudio.com/transducers/\" target=\"_blank\">sound transducers</a> affixed to the edges and/or below Petri dishes. These transducers convert electrical energy into sound waves and can move objects in Petri dishes in pretty much any direction.</p><ul><li>The first prototype has four transducers arrayed around the four quadrants of a Petri dish, allowing the tweezers to move targeted objects laterally.</li><li>The second model uses a tilted sound transducer beneath the Petri dish that creates a whirlpool in its center capable of capturing, concentrating, and mixing the contents of a dish.</li><li>The third design fits two transducers beneath the dish together like a zipper, forming a holographic IDT (interdigital transducer.) This highly configurable arrangement generates high-frequency beam-like waves from below the dish. They can be programmed as 3D focused or vortex beams, for example, allowing them to perform a range of object manipulations.</li></ul><h3>Moving forward</h3><br/><p>The primary purpose of this study was to work out how to implement already available acoustic tweezers in more compact, practical form for researchers, according to Huang.</p><p>As the paper notes: \"Although previous acoustic tweezers have been demonstrated for the manipulation of cells, most of them require customized microfluidic channels/chambers, which usually require time-consuming and costly steps for fabrication and sterilization and hence are not frequently used in biological and biomedical laboratories.\" The authors' aim, says the paper, was to develop \"acoustic tweezer devices that can directly manipulate bioparticles in the most common laboratory cell culture plate, the Petri dish.\"</p><p>The authors' next goal is to further catalogue the capabilities of their prototypes, in particular their configurable third design. Down the road, they hope, will be development of a device that combines all three types of functionality provided by the prototypes in a single device.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/mQNbCXh5CoA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 18:33:02 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5MTgyMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTEzNDExNX0.kvNtMG2LGtOj--gh4GeYBl6Zt_2brIxEmOMd3UPp3sI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"36896a28596068f4d5a0d0737a3a5ea8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_5/2020/09/16/05-03-42-451_9cdb12063ad58121.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":35868,"destBytes":35868,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5MTgyMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTEzNDExNX0.kvNtMG2LGtOj--gh4GeYBl6Zt_2brIxEmOMd3UPp3sI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_5/2020/09/16/05-03-42-451_9cdb12063ad58121.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5MjAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDY2Mjg4Mn0.5cMqhSjZa6eo8ISWnY37j3R9UtMsEHV9qGAh2EC53i4/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-04-08-594_fb16a7fc3b14eafb.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5MjExOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODA1ODkzM30.ypFFEBKMYg0iBNvAQ3aiF07-UK8OM8nACZTQTM9unds/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-04-08-433_120f9352273c472f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/mQNbCXh5CoA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn8@2020_5/2020/09/16/05-04-09-436_05c4fee4407cf4d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620717},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Venture investors need to invest in Black-owned businesses","link":"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/black-entrepreneurs-venture-capital","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc5OTczMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwOTkzNjY4OX0.05A48Yrr3w3FHKmNzatbi-Xq0JBc-LUqU5ylxNr-v_Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Abner Mason, CEO and founder of health care startup <a href=\"https://consejosano.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ConsejoSano</a>, is calling for all venture capital firms in the United States to pledge to invest 13% of their funds in African American businesses.</li><li>Currently, Black entrepreneurs receive less than 1% of all venture capital funding.</li><li>The 13% target reflects the percentage of Black Americans and is a nod to the 13th Amendment.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>The murder of George Floyd has brought America to a much-needed reckoning on the racism in American society. Young people are marching, white people are reading, and churches are preaching about ways we as people can transform the way we treat Black people. Notably, many business leaders are pledging to end racism. But once the marching ends what will be different in America?</p><p>As a Black business leader, this newfound desire to address America's original sin is a breath of fresh air in the midst of this pandemic. But I wonder how long this new zeal to change will last and, more importantly, what practical steps and sacrifices will be made to make the promise to end racism real.</p><p>Here is one practical solution that all investors can take to make their promise real. I'm calling on all venture capital firms in the United States to pledge now to invest 13% of their funds in African American businesses. I suggest 13 as a target to both reflect the percentage of Black Americans and a nod to the 13th Amendment. I'm reaching out to friends in the social impact space to help me set up the organization that will monitor this.</p><h3></h3><br/><blockquote>Here is one practical solution that all investors can take to make their promise real. I'm calling on all venture capital firms in the United States to pledge now to invest 13% of their funds in African American businesses. </blockquote><h3></h3><br/><p>My life reflects both America at its best in terms of ending racism and at its worst.<br/></p><p>As an African American CEO of the health care startup <a href=\"https://consejosano.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ConsejoSano</a>, I've focused on using technology to connect low-income and multi-cultural people to care in our health care system where their needs are often overlooked. Also, I've lived a blessed life. I grew up in an integrated public school in North Carolina where my parents and church taught me never to judge a book by its cover. They taught me that not all white people were motivated by racism and to seek out white allies in my life path.</p><p>This advice paid off. I found my way out of NC to a prep school in New England where I was one of seven Black students out of three hundred. I then made my way to Harvard College where Black students were less than five percent of my freshman class of thousands. I faced a choice that most young Black men of my generation made: Will I define myself solely by my race or pretty much ignore my race, ignoring racists, and look for allies? I chose the allies path. </p><p>After a short stint in the management consulting field, I found myself working in state government in the MA Department of Transportation where I learned a powerful truth about life—good intentions are not enough. No one cared that we had good intentions to get buses to passengers, we had to get the buses out to waiting passengers. Visible results, not intentions mattered. This lesson speaks to me today when I consider America's response to racism.</p><p>I went on to advise three governors and launched a nonprofit to address the AIDS crisis in Africa, helping to created what later would be called the PEPFAR program. What I learned through this entire career path was that I could pretty much sense and ignore racists and seek good white people at every level. These were my survival techniques.</p><h3></h3><br><p>This strategy hit a wall when I entered the venture capital arena launching a health tech company where I was asking wealthy white men to invest in the leadership of a Black man. In the more than 40 pitches I made to create our Series A, I encountered 99% white male investors who were blunt saying they were not investing in my product or projections; they would be investing in me. I could no longer follow my life strategy of ignoring investors with racist views. I was pitching the 1% of the 1% who lived lifestyles and had social worlds completely different from my own. We both could sense the cultural and lifestyle disconnect. Following my pitches I heard comments such as, 'I'm not comfortable with you being in charge,' or 'I'd imagine you being good at sales,' or 'Let's keep you as Chief Evangelist or something like that.'</p><p>What became clear to me was that uber-wealthy white men could imagine a Black leader as a minister not as a CEO. In my conversations with other Black startup leaders, I realized I was not alone. Then I looked at the data which confirmed my experience. I found <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-vcs-guide-to-investing-in-black-founders\" target=\"_blank\">only 1%</a> of venture capital-funded startup founders are Black. Ultimately, I did find investors who believed in me and my product and I was successful in gaining my Series A through white male investors who cared.</p><p>Today, I'm no longer a young Black man navigating the corridors of white power, but even as a successful entrepreneur I'm still facing the greatest degree of discrimination I've ever encountered in my life. Corporations posting 'Black Lives Matter' is nice, but as I learned in my job in transportation, the young Black entrepreneurs can no longer praise good intentions. They need results.</p><p>If America is serious about the desire to end racism, Black Americans are going to have to follow the lead of Langston Hughes who famously said, \"I will not take 'but' for an answer.\"</p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/xzWpeqvQYLU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 17:46:51 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc5OTczMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwOTkzNjY4OX0.05A48Yrr3w3FHKmNzatbi-Xq0JBc-LUqU5ylxNr-v_Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"18d398b11feb715de6e8230a872cb174","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-03-41-032_fcf9d2e592a58d72.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":56000,"destBytes":56000,"author":"Abner Mason","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzc5OTczMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwOTkzNjY4OX0.05A48Yrr3w3FHKmNzatbi-Xq0JBc-LUqU5ylxNr-v_Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-03-41-032_fcf9d2e592a58d72.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/xzWpeqvQYLU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn99@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-04-10-244_1119d44ee071332a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620745},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Why virtual reality is necessary on a planet of 11 billion","link":"https://bigthink.com/videos/virtual-reality-future","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzkxMzIyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMzY2OTY1NH0.IxIG-Vd7iYGKFkJfPsexvl4PJlCIQDy_UgdIDRxv5VE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>According to projections shared by <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html\" target=\"_blank\">the UN</a>, Earth's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050.

Although there are three million reported cases each year—up to 7 percent of school children have persistent difficulty learning how to read—there's no known cure. Some <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=6Rp0BgAAQBAJ\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> even suggests that up to 17 percent of the population could suffer from mild symptoms.</p><p>While dyslexia runs in some families, the disorder is generally considered to be caused by the interaction of genes and environmental factors, including parental education and teaching quality. It appears that learning in supportive environments reduces the risks of turning on genetic factors associated with the disorder. </p><p>No specific cause of dyslexia has been discovered, although the condition was first identified in 1881. Traumatic brain injuries sometimes cause it. The condition is also linked to ADHD, issues with hand-eye coordination, and developmental language disorders. </p><p>Researchers have <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/reading/conditioninfo/disorders\" target=\"_blank\">figured out</a> that dyslexia is related to problems with language processing. The condition is diagnosed through a series of memory, spelling, and reading tests.

As mentioned, the strongest evidence for an origin is in the brain's processing of language sounds—in the left auditory cortex. </p><p>A research team at the University of Geneva applied 30 Hz (\"low-gamma\") oscillations via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to 30 volunteers. Fifteen were dyslexic; the other 15 were fluent readers. Previous theoretical models suggested 25-35 Hz could be beneficial, though only correlations have been offered. </p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"child with head down on stack of books\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"af19e66be3c14aaecc0b1684b094fd60\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"4b29b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzkxMTE1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODkzNDM4OH0._inmB2wdWSWpbO--ecxV8Ae_IrAXhDAKnGgeFBWoxUA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C274%2C0%2C57&height=700\"/><p>When 30 Hz was applied, dyslexic volunteers saw the greatest improvement in phonological processing. Interestingly, the reading abilities of those in the control group were slightly disrupted by these oscillations. The researchers speculate fast readers may have developed strategies that skip phonological processing.</p><p>The beneficial effect wasn't noticed when 60 Hz was applied. </p><p>The authors believe this research demonstrates a causal role of low-gamma oscillatory activity in the brains of dyslexics. More importantly, their work could lead to non-invasive therapeutic interventions for treating (and perhaps curing) the disorder. </p><p>Co-lead author Silvia Marchesotti, in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Geneva, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200908142934.htm\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The next steps for us are to investigate whether normalizing oscillatory function in very young children could have a long-lasting effect on the organization of the reading system, but also to explore even less invasive means of correcting oscillatory activity, for instance using neurofeedback training.\"</p><p>One session of tCAS lasts for hours or even days—not long enough to ensure long-term change. The authors suggest multiple sessions might inspire long-term potentiation in dyslexics, however. </p><p>They also point out that tACS improved reading accuracy but not reading speed.

A new study finds that it's even more remarkable than many of us realized: It actually changes the way we assess risks.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://psychology.osu.edu/people/way.37\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Baldwin Way</a>, co-author of the study from Ohio State University, \"acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities — they just don't feel as scared.\"</p><p>Considering how many of us take acetaminophen occasionally or regularly, this is no small thing. <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">As Dr. Way puts it</a>, \"with nearly 25 percent of the population in the U.S. taking acetaminophen each week, reduced risk perceptions and increased risk-taking could have important effects on society.\"</p><p>The study builds on earlier research conducted by Way revealing acetaminophen's psychological effects. That earlier work found that taking acetaminophen caused a reduction in both positive and negative emotions when study participants considered their own hurt feelings or <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/your-pain-reliever-may-also-be-diminishing-your-joy/\" target=\"_blank\">joy</a>, or <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/when-you-take-acetaminophen-you-dont-feel-others-pain-as-much/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another person's suffering</a>.</p><p>The new study is published in the journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa108/5897711\" target=\"_blank\">Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</a>.</p><h3>Walking alone in a scary part of town</h3><br/><img alt=\"person standing on bridge at night\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e4393f1a54fad097172ee9e92a18d3da\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"c673a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDIzNjMzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDc0OTY5OX0.UZiwCiNAST22Zm-FSuhRgQlPAEQh57v7V-6N6dzctqc/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>As part of the study, individuals rated the degree of risk they perceived in a range of activities such as \"bungee jumping off a tall bridge\" and \"speaking your mind about an unpopular issue in a meeting at work.\" They considered these activities to be less risky than a control group not taking the medication.</p><p>In the first of the study's experiments, 189 college students took either 1,000 mg of acetaminophen — the standard dosage for headache pain — or a similar-looking placebo.</p><p>After giving the acetaminophen time to take effect, those in the study ranked the level of risk they perceived to be associated with a series of activities, on a scale of 1 to 7. Among the activities were walking alone in an unsafe area after dark, bungee jumping, changing careers in one's 30s, and taking a skydiving class. The students taking acetaminophen considered these activities less risky than the control group.</p><p>An additional three studies in which individuals participated in an <a href=\"http://www.impulsivity.org/measurement/BART\" target=\"_blank\">online risk game</a> confirmed this result. In this game, you click to pump up a virtual balloon — as the balloon gets bigger, you earn more money. If the balloon pops, you lose your earnings.</p><p>The acetaminophen-takers proved to be bolder than their control counterparts. People in the control group pumped less and successfully cashed out more often. Recalls Dr. Way, \"for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting.\" They pumped more times, and indeed popped more balloons.</p><h3>Takeaway</h3><br/><p>Acetaminophen is an important weapon in the modern medical arsenal. Dr. Way points out that it's the CDC's <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommended go-to drug</a> for COVID-19 symptoms. In addition to calming our pounding noggins, surgeons typically prescribe acetaminophen, often with codeine, for post-surgical pain relief; your dentists may also suggest it. Its value lies in how well it works, and also that it's more gentle on our digestive systems than some other painkillers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug\" target=\"_blank\">NSAIDs</a>, drugs that contain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen\" target=\"_blank\">ibuprofen</a>. NSAIDs taken regularly pose danger to one's digestive tract.</p><p>Given that we're unlikely to stop taking acetaminophen for our aches and pains, the study represents a helpful little wakeup call. Perhaps we should pump the brakes a bit as we consider risks when we're taking acetaminophen. Take a beat, think twice, and only then carefully secure that bungee cord before you leap.</p><p class=\"\"><br/></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/fpknIJ7R7Pk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 18:33:51 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDIzNjE0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzg3NzQ4MX0.RqJzc_k5Ip5t8Z79X--9s0IsQpJpYru-xjqYwUncI5o/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"8f976510610478bdf7aecf50544e9bb4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-41-962_a7e895cf1c66025b.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":84788,"destBytes":84788,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDIzNjE0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzg3NzQ4MX0.RqJzc_k5Ip5t8Z79X--9s0IsQpJpYru-xjqYwUncI5o/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-03-41-962_a7e895cf1c66025b.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDIzNjMzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDc0OTY5OX0.UZiwCiNAST22Zm-FSuhRgQlPAEQh57v7V-6N6dzctqc/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-04-08-318_c673a358a24b2e87.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/fpknIJ7R7Pk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn40@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-04-09-655_1ccc96b01e5e1bbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620704},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Study: Older Americans know more about COVID than connected youth","link":"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-knowledge-gap","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5NTQ0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMjEyNzY5N30.CPDj56ab5lPrcmTa6_dGf8uJouOjkZbjuZTd3wRdNlg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C4&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new study suggests older Americans are more knowledgeable about COVID-19 than younger demographics. </li><li>Respondents who scored higher in knowledge about COVID also tended to follow behavioral recommendations better than others. </li><li>The study was conducted early in the pandemic, but the central finding may still hold up. </li></ul><hr/>While the stereotype these days is that young people are taking the pandemic more seriously than their elders, a new <a href=\"https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19161/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> out of Michigan State University and published in <a href=\"https://www.jmirpublications.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JMR Public Health and</a> <a href=\"https://www.jmirpublications.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Surveillance</a> finds that, at the beginning of the pandemic, older Americans were much more knowledgeable about the virus and followed recommendations more stringently than younger <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/2020/09/gen-x-gen-z-and-millennials-know-less-about-covid-19-than-baby-boomers-study-suggests-57924\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">generations</a><em>.</em><em></em><h3></h3><br/><p>The study asked 1070 participants a series of questions relating to COVID-19's characteristics, transmission, and prevention. Answers to these questions were used to gauge a participant's knowledge about the novel coronavirus and scored on a scale of 0-12. A following set of questions focused on behavior, including if the participants went to events with large groups of people or wore a mask outside.</p><p>As you might expect, a higher knowledge score correlated to following public health recommendations at the time. However, the breakdown of the data may prove surprising. </p><p>Baby Boomers scored higher than any other generation, with each subsequent group scoring less than the last. Younger participants were more likely to go out with a mask on (this was before masks were recommended), go to an event with 50 or more people, and hoard supplies. Participants earning more money scored higher in knowledge than those making less, and self-reporting Democrats scored higher than Republicans. Women and those with a college education also earned high scores. </p><h3>There is a catch with this data</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFX9oS2kpUA\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p>Now, there are a couple of caveats that should be mentioned. The first is that this survey was released on March 17, 2020. At the time, masks were not recommended by the CDC. How much deciding to wear a mask relates to a lack of knowledge, being ahead of the curve, or following other advice sources than the Federal Government is up for debate.</p><p>Secondly, the questions used in this study were not validated, meaning that they were not analyzed to assure that a given answer correlates to an exact <a href=\"https://www.mtab.com/validating-a-survey-what-it-means-how-to-do-it/\" target=\"_blank\">outcome</a>. In this case, that a wrong answer directly relates to a lack of understanding of how COVID-19 works is undetermined.</p><p>The validation issue was caused by the \"fast-moving nature of the pandemic response in the United States.\" Study author <a href=\"https://mph.chm.msu.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-bios/54-john-clements-phd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. John Clements</a> argues that we can take away \"face value\" information despite this and other potential issues with the methodology. He explains that understanding the differences in understanding between different demographics can help inform policy and information campaigns going forward:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"These differences appear to have prevented a coordinated effort at slowing the spread of the pandemic in the United States in the early days of the pandemic. Ignoring official recommendations for crowd avoidance, the use of medical supplies, and purchasing behaviors that signal hoarding of goods, does not bode well for efforts to contain the spread of the virus and limit exposure to vulnerable populations. Without a coordinated national response, it is likely that the United States will experience a longer, more drawn out battle than if such coordination would occur. In addition, it is important for future waves of COVID-19 that we consider implementing specific policies and programs to target groups of people who have been unequally affected by the pandemic.\"</p><p>A better understanding of how COVID spreads and the latest recommendations to battle it will likely prove vital in attempts to control its spread. According to this study's findings, there is at least a passing connecting between having that understanding and personal behavior. Let us hope that, in the future, people will be informed enough to make better choices.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/9qQEp9OTbLw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 19:50:16 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5NTQ0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMjEyNzY5N30.CPDj56ab5lPrcmTa6_dGf8uJouOjkZbjuZTd3wRdNlg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C4&height=700","linkMd5":"a7c594bbe899a1906223decbcb4bbd19","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-03-40-953_4b87d4d3a8de4b07.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":65832,"destBytes":65832,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzk5NTQ0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMjEyNzY5N30.CPDj56ab5lPrcmTa6_dGf8uJouOjkZbjuZTd3wRdNlg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C4&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_6/2020/09/16/05-03-40-953_4b87d4d3a8de4b07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/9qQEp9OTbLw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn35@2020_4/2020/09/16/05-04-09-547_6a7c6d37ad13a3a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600232620716},{"createdTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-16 13:03:40","title":"Depression and suicidal ideation reduced after psychedelic usage","link":"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/psychedelics-depression","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDY0NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODk2ODMyNH0.VO1qUlmfs3N3PUFrJtodrcaH63butQQUV0AXYtRmGCo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C168%2C0%2C39&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Two studies found reduced rates in depression severity, suicidal ideation, and experiential avoidance four weeks after taking psychedelics. </li><li>With hundreds of millions of dollars in investment flowing into psychedelics companies, a renaissance in the field is occurring.</li><li>Researchers hope these findings will lead to better therapeutic modalities for mental health disorders. </li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>From mysticism to mental health, the journey of psychedelics in American culture has been quite a trip.

Hundreds of studies on LSD and psilocybin were conducted in the '50s and '60s. Psychiatrist Sidney Cohen wrote an <a href=\"https://drugs-forum.com/data/attachment-files/2009/11/134720_Cohen1960.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">extensive review</a> in 1960 on the complications and side effects of LSD; he found minimal damaging effects in over 25,000 administrations. Likewise, psychiatrist Oscar Janiger used LSD therapeutically with 930 patients. He noted few adverse effects.</p><p>Writing about Janiger's experiments, medical anthropologist Marlene Dobkin de Rios <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/lsd-spirituality-and-the-creative-process-based-on-the-groundbreaking-research-of-oscar-janiger-m-d-original/9780892819737\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a>, \"The nature of the individual drug experience reflects the basic psychophysiological action of the substance as it interacts with the total life experience that the person brings to it.\"</p><p><em>The total life experience</em>.

Anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation—conditions dependent on memories, environment, relationships, genetics, finances, a host of causes.

He's published nearly a <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.carhart-harris/publications.html\" target=\"_blank\">hundred studies</a> on psychedelics. A <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00782/full\" target=\"_blank\">recent research article</a>, published in Frontiers in Psychiatry, found that the effects of psychedelics are associated with a decrease in the severity of depression and suicidal ideation.</p><p>The two studies in the article include 358 volunteers. Each participant filled out questionnaires about their levels of depression, suicidal ideation, and experiential avoidance—\"openness to one's experiences and engagement in behaviors that are congruent with one's values.\" They then took part in either ceremonial psychedelic consumption (as in an ayahuasca ritual) or non-ceremonial usage. Carhart-Harris's team followed up two weeks and four weeks later. </p><p>The parameters of the first study were broad. The individuals had a variety of psychedelics to choose from: LSD, ayahuasca, DMT, salvia divinorum, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, or ibogaine. Interestingly, respondents that planned on using <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/ketamine-depression\" target=\"_blank\">ketamine</a> were excluded. While the sedative has recently been touted as a psychedelic, it's not classically considered in this regard. </p><p>The second study was slightly more structured, as the team accepted participants attending a psychedelic ceremony. This is especially important given the work by organizations like MAPS ( Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which is <a href=\"https://mapspublicbenefit.com/training/\" target=\"_blank\">training psychedelic therapists</a> in the hopes of legalized MDMA by 2023.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Such ceremonies usually involve the presence of one or more \"facilitators\"<em>—</em>individuals who aim to provide a safe, conducive environment, emotional support, as well as certain contextual stimuli which are intended to enhance or structure the psychedelic experience.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"person walking towards light in tunnel\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9b8014399725689ec60d9ed1a4540791\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"4b320\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzgwMDY0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMTU2NjgyN30.ppFzQnKRQXM1bSFubSqOSNDZd9MJUBe437GI5oL5iGI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C69%2C0%2C138&height=700\"/><p>This research differs from previous studies in that psychedelic usage was not conducted in a clinical setting.

repressed.\"</p><p><strong>Erotic literature can help you discover your sexuality and feel more comfortable. </strong></p><p>Not only does it relieve stress and anxiety (which can often be barriers to an active and enjoyable sex life), but it can also help you navigate your own sexuality and express yourself in a healthier way. </p><p>\"Romance novels are as much about a woman falling in love with

consent, these themes are becoming more and more popular among up-and-coming erotica authors. </p><p>Erotica can be a safe place to express sexuality and explore curiosities and it can also promote
