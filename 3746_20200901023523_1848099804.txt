However, the fan-favorite couple hit a rough patch in the midseason finale.</p><p>After being confronted by Sheriff Holt Clanton, a member of the historical family who still holds a deep grudge against the Earps, Wynonna shot him in the back even after Doc talked him down. As this was the biggest offense of his personal moral code since the 19th century, a visibly disgusted Doc chose to break up with Wynonna before celebrating Waverly Earp and Nicole Haught's engagement. According to star Tim Rozon, the breakup also stems from the two characters having different priorities, as Wynonna deals with the responsibility of defending their town of Purgatory from a new wave of monsters.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wynonna-earp-midseason-finale-trailer-against-demonic-nuns/\">Wynonna Earp Midseason Finale Trailer Pits Her Against Demonic Nuns</a></span></p><p>\"More than just going by his old-school moral code, Doc Holliday is finished with fighting. He wants to be in love with the woman he loves and make a family and settle down, and to do that he’s gotta let go of the past. But the thing that he needs to remember is that Wynonna doesn't have the luxury to do that, because she has the burden of being the hero and he doesn’t,\" Rozon told <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2020/08/30/wynonna-earp-recap-season-4-episode-6-midseason-finale-tim-rozon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TVLine</a>. \"She can't just let go. So I don't agree with what she did, and I definitely don't agree with shooting him in the back, but that burden always falls on Wynonna, and it has since Episode 1. They fight together, but let's be honest: Wynonna Earp is the one who’s got to take the brunt of the responsibility.\"</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wynonna-earp-sneak-peek-release-window-season-4-part-2/\">teaser trailer</a> from the second half of Season 4 showed Wynonna won't handle the break-up well. For Rozon, the possibility of the couple reconciling was open but would need Wynonna to make a clean break from her past and the responsibility that comes with it.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wynonna-earp-nicole-haught-killed/\">Wynonna Earp: A Longtime Main Character Is Horrifically Killed</a></span></p><p>\"I think that's what this whole, whole thing is about -- both of them finally letting go of the past. If they can do that, they can have a future; if they can't, they can't. But like I said, it's easier for Doc to do that. Also, his past is 150 years ago,\" Rozon observed. \"Wynonna has the hero's burden. Purgatory and all that stuff, it relies on her, so she'd have to walk away from everything. But what a great season, though, for Melanie Scrofano and the Wynonna Earp character. The fact that she doesn't have Peacemaker and lost her identity of who she is but still, at the end of the day, has to be the hero... it's great stuff. I don't know how she's going to be able to let go of the past. I don't know if she can.\"</p><p>Produced by SEVEN24 Films and IDW Entertainment, <em>Wynonna Earp</em> stars Melanie Scrofano as the title character, Dominique Provost-Chalkley as Waverly, Katherine Barrell as Nicole Haught and Tim Rozon as Doc Holliday. Season 4 airs on Sundays at 10pm ET/PT on Syfy.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Wynonna Earp's Midseason Finale Has Two VERY Different Reunions\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wynonna-earp-midseason-finale-two-different-reunions/\">Wynonna Earp's Midseason Finale Has Two VERY Different Reunions</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:24:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wynonna-vampiredoc.jpg","linkMd5":"66ab31e341fbf9d4d26c99a41bf05102","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-01-994_7c2ec7ff48dc2db0.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":49370,"destBytes":49370,"author":"Sam Stone","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wynonna-vampiredoc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-01-994_7c2ec7ff48dc2db0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700507},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"The Adventure Zone: The Bureau of Balance, Explained | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/adventure-zone-bureau-balance-explained/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Adventure-Zone-Petals-to-the-Metal-1.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-adventure-zone/\">The Adventure Zone</a></em>, an <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-actual-play-shows-boosting-lgbtq-representation/\">actual-play <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> podcast</a> from the McElroy family, struck gold with its first season. Part of what made this initial adventure so compelling was the story's structure, setting individual quests in the context of a broader mission.</p><p>Providing this larger structure is the Bureau of Balance, a benevolent organization with strict hierarchies that is trying to rid the world of some powerfully evil artifacts. The Bureau of Balance provides not only a setting for the world but also an impetus for the quests, making it a crucial component of the <em>Balance</em> universe.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/adventure-zone-best-balance-universe-one-shots/\">The Adventure Zone: 5 Best One-Shots In The Balance Universe</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Adventure-Zone-Here-There-Be-Gerblins.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Bureau of Balance, created and directed by NPC Lucretia, is a secret organization devoted to restoring the balance of good and evil to the world by removing from it items of unimaginable thrall and power that have been wreaking havoc on the land. Each of these Grand Relics becomes the object of one of the quests in <em>Balance</em>, giving each arc a MacGuffin and a definitive end to the whole season.</p><p>The main characters run across their first Grand Relic accidentally. While answering a Craigslist-style call for adventurers, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-adventure-zone-player-characters/\">Merle, Magnus and Taako</a> are drawn into a quest with even higher stakes. While trying to rescue a companion lost in a cave system, they run into an employee of the Bureau, who identifies the adventurers as potential recruits. Before Merle, Magnus and Taako reach the Bureau, they feel like an unlikely group of adventurers, linked only by the shared trauma of their first quest.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-two-new-subclasses/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons Unearths Two Spooky Subclasses</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Adventure-Zone-Balance.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Bureau of Balance follows a very rigid corporate structure. New recruits, like the three player characters, must undergo a rigorous interview process -- troll combat -- to determine if they're a good fit. All employees are also required to wear a bracer with the Bureau's logo on it, showing their commitment to their organization.</p><p>The main characters are brought aboard as Reclaimers, those responsible for retrieving the Grand Relics and bringing them back to the Bureau so they can be destroyed. They work alongside Seekers, who deal in information as they attempt to track down the location of the remaining Relics, and Regulators, responsible for dealing with anyone who has given into the thrall and used one of the Relics. The strict hierarchy of roles is rigorously adhered to, especially once Merle, Magnus and Taako prove themselves to be the only ones capable of regularly resisting the thrall of the powerful artifacts.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dd-beyond-vs-roll20-explained/\">D&#38;D Beyond Vs. Roll20: Which One Should You Use For Your Campaign?</a></span></p><p>In addition to the strict division of labor, the Bureau also institutes performance reviews and year-end bonuses, giving the organization a very corporate vibe. The modern, corporate ideology in a very fantasy <em>D&#38;D</em> setting is a fun space to play in and makes for amusing adventure set-ups.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Adventure-Zone-Murder-on-the-Rockport-Limited.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Bureau is located on its own, hand-crafted moon, giving the staff the ability to quickly travel to anywhere in the land that may hold a Relic. The way of travel to and from the moon is a literal canon, firing glass balls holding the travelers. Employees can summon one of these transports using their Bureau of Balance bracer. It's revealed the moon itself can move as well, though traveling by moon isn't very subtle.</p><p>While the moon isn't large, it does contain its share of other businesses. In addition to dorm rooms, training chambers and offices of the Bureau itself, it also features a Fantasy Costco, selling adventurers all of the magical items they might want.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dd-incorporate-one-shots-into-campaigns/\">D&#38;D: How To Incorporate One-Shots Into Extended Campaigns</a></span></p><p>Part of what makes the Bureau of Balance so secretive is that folks are prevented from discussing it. The Bureau makes use of a creature called a voidfish which feeds on information, erasing it from memories for those who haven't been inoculated. This secrecy is crucial for the Bureau -- they used it to erase the knowledge of the Grand Relics from the land in the hopes that it would help reduce their devastation. It also means that when Merle, Magnus and Taako first met a representative of the Bureau (and someone under the thrall of a Relic), they hear static whenever these items were discussed.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Adventure-Zone.jpg\"/></figure><p>Not every secret, evil-fighting, moon-owning organization is out for good, however. While the Bureau staff seem trustworthy, some unanswered questions call the adventurers' continued work for the Bureau of Balance into question.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-scaling-enemies-monsters-guide/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons: How To Scale Enemies &#38; Monsters</a></span></p><p>After successfully reclaiming a Relic, the three adventurers return to the Bureau's moon and immediately must hand it over for destruction. The process is intense but leaves a lot of room for items to be switched out and secreted away, making the adventurers suspect that they may be reclaiming these Relics for some other purpose. The three characters also have a roommate who is mysteriously mind-controlled and caught exploring the director's quarters. Coupled with the use of voidfish technology and suggestions from other characters, it's enough to suspect the Bureau of ulterior motives.</p><p>The Bureau of Balance is a fallible, corporate-inspired organization that does the heavy lifting of setting up the stakes and the mood of the larger <em>The Adventure Zone: Balance</em> story. By providing individual arc goals in the form of quests for the individual Relics but an overarching continuity, it drives the structure of the podcast. But by including <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/adventure-zone-balance-best-npc/\">interesting characters with individual motivations</a> -- to play their music for someone who will appreciate it, to quench their thirst for invention, to hit people really hard -- it also becomes a lived-in space, full of interesting stories.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-tashas-cauldron-changes-race-approach/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons: How Tasha's Cauldron Changes The Game's Approach To Race</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:15:54 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Adventure-Zone-Petals-to-the-Metal-1.jpg","linkMd5":"b7b51e45c939f298fc6c19259e7e24fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn82@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-334_89d0d87b6ff04640.webp","destWidth":1293,"destHeight":647,"sourceBytes":175950,"destBytes":175950,"author":"E.L.

Last year, Sony revealed that its digital game sales <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/07/30/playstation-4-hits-100-million-sold-as-digital-game-sales-eclipse-physical-for-the-first\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">surpassed physical</a> for the first time. But while digital games are a convenient alternative to buying games from stores, it doesn't make sense for them to cost the same as a physical copy.</p><p>While development costs are the same regardless of whether a game is physical or digital, there is a cost difference where distribution is concerned. Publishers don't have to <a href=\"https://www.eneba.com/blog/digital-vs-physical-games/#:~:text=Another%20key%20reason%20is%20the,expenses%2C%20logistics%20and%20so%20on.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay for packaging</a> and shipping costs when uploading a game on a digital platform, so if anything, physical games should cost more than digital titles to cover these extra expenses.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-1984-xbox-fan-response/\">Wonder Woman 1984: Fan Response to the Furry Xbox Console Is WILD</a></span></p><p>Digital games tend to hold their value for a longer period of time, but that doesn't explain why a digital download sometimes costs more than a physical copy. <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/ubisoft-addresses-digital-physical-game-pricing-348/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ubisoft's CEO has stated</a> that digital prices remain the same because, as time goes on, physical copies become more difficult to find. However, many uncommon physical games are still <a href=\"http://gamesniped.com/2017/04/04/cheap-nes-games-rare-uncommon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relatively cheap</a> despite being somewhat scarce. Buying a loose copy of a rare game like <em>Mermaids of Atlantis</em> still <a href=\"https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/mermaids-of-atlantis?q=mermaids+of+atlantis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">costs less</a> than buying certain modern games on digital platforms.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-games.jpg\"/></figure><p>Poking addition holes in Ubisoft's logic is the fact that many older games are available for low prices on digital storefronts while being hard to find or access physically. For example, a loose copy of <em>Earthbound</em> for the SNES <a href=\"https://www.pricecharting.com/game/super-nintendo/earthbound?q=earthbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">costs around $275</a> and a complete copy is over $1000, but a digital copy typically cost about $10.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ps-plus-september-2020-free-games-information-guide/\">PS Plus: Everything You Need To Know About September 2020's Free Games</a></span></p><p>There are a few good reasons why digital games are sometimes priced higher than physical editions. Retailer will sometimes sell games at a discount to make room for newer games and accessories. This makes it harder to find older games, especially ones from previous generations or that weren't mega-hits, as they are quickly replaced with whatever is new and popular. Digital platforms don't have this issue, as there is endless shelf space in these online stores.</p><p>But while digital platforms cut out the middleman that gets the product onto store shelves, the platforms themselves play this role. To sell their games on a digital store, publishers have to give the platform a cut of the game's sales. Xbox receives around <a href=\"https://www.thexboxhub.com/why-do-digital-versions-of-games-cost-more-than-physical/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">33 percent of profits</a> from games sold on the Xbox Marketplace, which impacts how much the publisher and developer actually make for every digital copy sold.</p><p>Just as physical and digital games themselves are a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/why-physical-games-shouldnt-die-off/\">hot topic among gamers</a>, concerns over how they are priced are also contentious. While there are good arguments on both sides of the debate, perhaps the most compelling reason for digital games to be cheaper is the nature of these copies themselves. Buying a digital game means paying for something you don't physically own and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-games-you-can-no-longer-play/\">losing access to it</a> should it be removed from the platform in question. While digital downloads are convenient for gamers and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/digital-downloads-sparked-indie-games-rise/\">good for indie developers</a>, their prices should reflect the lower distribution costs and the risk involved in purchasing them.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/nintendo-needs-updated-switch/\">Nintendo NEEDS to Release an Updated Switch</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:15:00 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-and-digital-games.jpg","linkMd5":"02f58224fd64d130f796c4c48e629f57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-02-231_df04d542f2c3a171.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":211398,"destBytes":172306,"author":"Zack Millsap","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-and-digital-games.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-02-231_df04d542f2c3a171.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-games.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-06-968_7726199a8affef7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700506},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Chadwick Boseman Remembered in Stunning Bill Sienkiewicz Portrait","link":"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-bill-sienkiewicz-portrait/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chadwick-Boseman-portrait-header.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-panther-film/\">Black Panther</a></em> star <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-obituary/\">Chadwick Boseman passed away</a> Aug. 28 at the age of 43 after a four-year battle with colon cancer.

Bora was murdered on-screen almost as soon as he was introduced, fundamentally changing Goku’s motivations for the rest of the arc. More importantly, Bora’s death set a precedent. Not only could characters die, they could come back to life. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had stumbled onto a way to play with drama on a brand new scale.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-gohan-rage-boosts-chronological-order/\">Dragon Ball Z: All Of Gohan’s Rage Boosts (In Chronological Order)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Dragon Balls ultimately become a fail safe that the audience can always count on to fix any mess, part of the series’ tensest arcs knock the Dragon Balls out of the equation. It’s also important to remember that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-super\">Dragon Ball</a> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">handles death remarkably well early on. The Saiyan arc is filled with death from start to finish, serving as an important period of transition for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> franchise. </span></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Farmer</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/farmer-with-shotgun.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Affectionately nicknamed “Farmer with Shotgun” by most of the community, Raditz’s first victim has had a big impact on fans and it’s not hard to see why. Beyond his memorably simple character design, the farmer’s death is off-putting with it without context. For fans who had already read or watched </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this was a level of mundane violence the series had yet to see. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those jumping in with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it’s just an unforgettable opening. Raditz’s murder of the farmer not only introduces death right away, it puts into perspective just how ferocious Raditz is. On a thematic level, Raditz catching the farmer’s bullet &#38; killing him with it parallels Goku’s first encounter with Bulma.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Son Goku &#38; Raditz</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cartoon-Death-Dragon-Ball-Goku-Raditz.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raditz might very well be the most intimidating opponent Goku fights in the entirety of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Raditz may be at the bottom of the Saiyan hierarchy, but Goku and Piccolo can’t even put up a fair fight while battling as a team. The fact of the matter is that Raditz far outclasses anything that came before him. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goku is forced to give his life just to stop Raditz. Grabbing his brother and holding him in place, Goku is pierced through the chest by Piccolo’s Makankosappo– a technique that was developed with killin Goku in mind to begin with. Goku &#38; Raditz die side by side, Goku slowly fading away and Raditz personally finished off by Piccolo. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Earthlings</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Earthlings.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The very first thing Nappa does upon touching down on Earth is eviscerating his and Vegeta’s landing area. Every single Earthling levelled by Nappa’s blast was killed and they were </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revived by the Dragon Balls at any point in the series. There’s really no reason to care about these dead Earthlings, but this scene highlights Nappa &#38; Vegeta’s relationship. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ultimate-butoden-dragon-ball-games-never-heard-of/\">Ultimate Butoden &#38; 9 Other Dragon Ball Games You’ve Never Heard Of</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Nappa is an impulsive brute, Vegeta is suave &#38; in control. He doesn’t care that the Earthlings have died, but he does care that Nappa could have destroyed a Dragon Ball. More importantly, it’s made clear that Nappa very much respects &#38; abides by Vegeta’s word. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Yamcha</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yamcha.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yamcha’s death is anything but a joke. His fight against the Saibaiman is simple, but it features incredibly tight choreography and an unforgettable ending. After Yamcha has honorably defeated his opponent, he’s suddenly gripped by the Saibaiman. The two explode together and Yamcha’s lifeless corpse litters the battlefield. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Yamcha death pose has become a meme, consider the actual context of the scene. Yamcha– a character who has been with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the first arc– has unceremoniously been killed because he underestimated his opponent. It’s a genuine shock and signals to the rest of the Dragon Team that this isn’t a game. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Chaozu</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chiaotzu-vs-Nappa.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yamcha’s death is also an unfortunate sign that the Earthlings didn’t train hard enough for the fight against the Saiyans. They treated it like training for a tournament and now they’re suffering for it. Yamcha walked away from his opponent because the fight was over, but the Saibaiman was not dead. It’s this desperation that drives the fight against Nappa– the fact that he </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be killed. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaozu hones in on this immediately and tries to take out Nappa in a kamikaze attack. Unfortunately, the blast is barely strong enough to chip Nappa’s armor. Chaozu gives up his life for the second time for nothing, no longer able to revived with the Earth’s Dragon Balls. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Tenshinhan</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DBZ-Tien-Final-Energy-Attack.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Chaozu dead, Tenshinhan loses all hope. The anime plays this up quite a bit, featuring a rather emotional moment where Tenshinhan reflects on everything he and Chaozu have been through together. Determined to follow Chaozu in death, Tenshinhan puts everything he has into a Kikoho and unleashes it on Nappa. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-piccolo-bests-fights-original-series/\">Dragon Ball: Piccolo’s Best Fight In Every Arc (In The Original Series)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the only time in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Kikoho is successful in killing Tenshinhan. His lifeless body falling onto the ground, Tenshinhan dies much like Chaozu– in vain. In spite of how powerful the Kikoho is, it does very little to Nappa in the grand scheme of things. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Piccolo &#38; God</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dragon-Ball-Piccolo-Purple-Blood.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With half of the supporting cast dead, Piccolo, Krillin, and Gohan are left to fight Nappa alone. By this point, however, they’ve eased into the battle and can coordinate accordingly. All three martial artists even manage to get some solid hits on Nappa at different points, but it all falls apart when it matters most. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a combo attack where Piccolo and Krillin successfully set Gohan up for the finishing blow, the young boy chickens out and can’t finish Nappa off. This results in a chain reaction where Piccolo gives his life to protect Gohan from Nappa’s retaliation. As Piccolo dies, so does God– taking the Dragon Balls with them. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Nappa</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Nappa-dead-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goku arrives just in time to save Gohan from Nappa. Although Nappa overwhelmed every single member of the main cast, Goku is able to deliver a cathartic beatdown thanks to the Kaioken. Leaving Nappa broken, Goku explicitly does not kill him. Vegeta, however, isn’t too fond of this mercy. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing his disgust at a Saiyan who can’t fight, Vegeta launches Nappa into the air and kills his former companion. Establishing himself as someone beyond even the ties of his heritage &#38; race, Vegeta shows Goku why he’s the arc’s main villain. No one dies for the remainder of the arc, but both Goku and Vegeta come dangerously close.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/questions-dragon-ball-timeline-answered/\">10 Questions About The Dragon Ball Timeline, Answered</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 22:00:24 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dbsdd-fi.jpg","linkMd5":"9ee8482bcd8aa0931bd48d08c93a1edf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-02-335_25e0197defb1046c.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":230562,"destBytes":230562,"author":"Renan Fontes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dbsdd-fi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-02-335_25e0197defb1046c.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/farmer-with-shotgun.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-13-932_7d21bf8b06cf372f.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cartoon-Death-Dragon-Ball-Goku-Raditz.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn54@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-836_3b6093850480280b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Earthlings.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-14-884_16a43f947fe21e0d.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yamcha.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn8@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-16-792_7531eabfe442a522.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chiaotzu-vs-Nappa.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-10-320_b354db486febe0ce.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DBZ-Tien-Final-Energy-Attack.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn29@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-043_73767acd506e4f20.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dragon-Ball-Piccolo-Purple-Blood.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn65@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-847_eb536a5c7a128ca5.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Nappa-dead-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn25@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-08-245_08d82c389876d779.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700505},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Avatar Theory: Kyoshi's REAL Animal Companion Was the Unagi | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-theory-kyoshi-real-animal-companion-unagi/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shadow-of-kyoshi.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/avatar-the-last-airbender-the-shadow-of-kyoshi/\"><strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender - </strong><strong>The Shadow of Kyoshi</strong></a><em><strong> by author F.C.

The novel ended without supplying a definite answer, but a recent theory on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/iag4xt/fan_theory_the_unagi_was_kyoshis_animal_companion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit</a> puts forward a compelling idea. What if the Unagi is Kyoshi's animal companion?</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Avatar: What's the Strongest Waterbending Feat in the Series?\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-strongest-waterbending-feat/\">Avatar: What's The Strongest Waterbending Feat In The Series?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyoshi-Island-Unagi-1.png\"/></figure><p>Every Avatar gets an animal companion. For Aang, that companion was Appa, bound to him since childhood in the tradition of the Air Nomads and surviving with him frozen in an iceberg for a century as the only living relic Aang retains from his past. The two were best friends, heartbroken when they were apart, and remained together throughout their entire lives. It turned out as the series progressed that such a bond was typical of Avatars, and most other Avatars had their animal companions detailed.</p><p>Roku's was his dragon Fang, and Korra's was the polar bear dog Naga. Even other past Avatars seldom seen had their animal companions revealed, with the tradition going back to the first Avatar Wan and his deercat, and even through to the previous Air Nomad Avatar before Aang, Yangchen, who had the sky bison Boma and two winged lemurs named Pik and Pak. At a certain point, the absence of any mention of Kyoshi's animal companion starts to seem conspicuous, which is exactly the reason why its fertile ground for crafting a fan theory.</p><p>Throughout the two novels, <em>The Rise of Kyoshi</em> and its sequel <em>The Shadow of Kyoshi</em>, the Earth Kingdom Avatar makes plenty of friends among humans but proves lacking in the animal companionship department. While she rides around on the sky bison Pengpeng she briefly inherited from her lost mentor after the airbender's death, it's explained later that Pengpeng retired to the Southern Air Temple to raise her calves. A sky bison may have been a tempting companion for the Avatar given her mother's heritage, but it just wasn't meant to be.</p><p>But what if it turns out that fans of the show have already seen Kyoshi's animal companion all the way back to before Kyoshi herself was introduced? The first episode to touch on her lore was \"The Warriors of Kyoshi,\" in which it was explained that a band of warriors founded by Kyoshi held her in esteem as they protected an island bearing the Avatar's name. Later on, viewers learn that Kyoshi formed the island herself when she split it off the main continent using her Avatar State, granting the island a measure of protection and isolation.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Avatar: What's the Strongest Earthbending Feat in the Series?\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-whats-the-strongest-earthbending-feat-in-the-series/\">Avatar: What's The Strongest Earthbending Feat In The Series?</a></span></p><p>What grants the island even further protection and isolation is the natural threat of the Unagi, a giant eel that inhabits the waters around Kyoshi Island. Aang first ran into the Unagi as a threat when he went for a leisurely swim in the coastal waters, only to discover the gargantuan beast nearly ready to devour him whole. Later on, the Unagi proved to be a valuable fixture in repairing the damage done to Kyoshi Island by the Fire Nation, spouting water across the flames burning down the small village. And that all may have been Kyoshi's plan.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kyoshi-Warriors-training.jpg\"/></figure><p>If the Unagi were Kyoshi's <em>real</em> animal companion, then that would mean she left the beast to guard her legacy even centuries after her death. While typically it seems that Avatars' animal companions pass on to the Spirit World alongside their owner (Fang sacrificed himself upon Roku's death to the volcano) there's certainly no hard and fast rules about it. While no relationship between Kyoshi and the Unagi is hinted at in the prequel novels, the possibility remains entirely open.</p><p>However, the novels do provide a rival for the title of animal companion in the form of a small fox Kyoshi meets at the end of her latest novel. The fox helps guide Kyoshi to a meditation site that allows her to commune with Yangchen, and the story seems to leave off with the fox sticking around. At the same time, the companionship still isn't confirmed and if anything, Yangchen and Aang stand as proof that an Avatar isn't restricted to solely one animal.</p><p>The fox would certainly be a weird choice, as they already serve as Knowledge Seekers to the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-why-wan-shi-tong-chose-stay-human-world/\">Library of Wan Shi Tong</a>. The Unagi would be a great companion for Kyoshi, representing her mythic status and breathtaking power. She certainly has her fox-like qualities as well, but it's hard to imagine a beast more exemplative of the life and legacy of Avatar Kyoshi.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-consistently-inconsistent-good-thing/\">The Avatar Is Consistently Inconsistent - And That's A Good Thing</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:23 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shadow-of-kyoshi.jpg","linkMd5":"ff1d72a3570f125d2d26c09d4cfffdbf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-01-900_04362f66c1e3eb26.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":166342,"destBytes":166342,"author":"Brenton Stewart","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shadow-of-kyoshi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-01-900_04362f66c1e3eb26.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyoshi-Island-Unagi-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-06-225_f3d16c935fad6028.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kyoshi-Warriors-training.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn18@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-05-900_f5da9d4bdccc3604.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700508},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Marvel's Chadwick Boseman Tribute Topped Sunday Night's Ratings","link":"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-tribute-black-panther-sunday-night-ratings/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Black-Panther-Header.jpg\"/></figure><p>To honor the late <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-panther-film/\">Black Panther</a></em> star <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/chadwick-boseman/\">Chadwick Boseman</a>, ABC aired a tribute that celebrated his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Suddenly, the two of them get a call and rush over to their latest crime scene. At the location, the picture is grim. Underneath the covering is a young woman's corpse, the floor awash with her blood: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-6-kambe-family-murder-mystery/\">Sayuri Kambe</a>, 34, who died with a single stab to the heart. Her house appears to be ransacked but the two detectives and Director Kiyomizu are convinced that this isn't a simple robbery gone wrong.</p><p>Their investigation reveals that Shigemaru Kambe, the head of the family and husband of Sayuri, is a researcher currently looking into a dangerous material called \"allodium,\" which is represented with an omega-like symbol. Chosuke and Takei head to the Kambe mansion to ask Kikuko if they can speak to Shigemaru, though she says he's still overseas for work. Takei asks whether Sayuri and her husband are separated, since it turns out that, two months prior, she rented the house she was found in. Kikuko remains tight-lipped. When they fail to get Shigemaru's photo from Kikuko, Chosuke fakes a stomach ache and steals a photo album.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-kyoshi-novels-missed-massive-opportunity/\">Avatar: The Kyoshi Novels Missed a MASSIVE Opportunity</a> </span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-director-saiki.jpg\"/></figure><p>Inviting him to his office, Director Saiki instructs Kiyomizu to watch Chosuke and keep him informed. He warns him to look at the bigger picture instead of  chasing justice. Right at that moment, Takei comes in to deliver a report on Shigemaru and the director <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-3-humor-tension-combo-satisfying/\">swiftly changes tack</a>, telling his son-in-law to be kind to his daughter.</p><p>During a late night, Chosuke realizes that there's a key taped to the back of a family picture with Shigemaru, Sayuri and a young Daisuke. It appears to be the key to a coin-operated locker marked \"D15,\" with the symbol for allodium. Chosuke is about to call Kiyomizu, but he's stopped by Takei, saying they should wait until they get more information.

So much so that He and Haru bust through the Kambe residence gates when Daisuke doesn't come to work. It turns out that he's trying to figure out what actually happened leading up to Imura's death, as the surveillance footage was tampered with. Haru confronts him once more and asks him what he's after, knowing that there must be a reason why he's doing illegal things like tampering with Imura's car. Instead of ignoring him, Daisuke admits he came to Modern Crimes to figure out what really happened to his mother.</p><p>As soon as Takei's car starts, gas pours in through the vents and he loses consciousness. In a weird dream state, he's thrown into various flashbacks, where it's clear that Takei knows more than he's letting on. At the same park he was at with Chosuke, Imura materializes in front of him, accusing him of killing her. She admits that she knew it would come to this, but tells him he needs to report to \"him.\" Takei's about to call, but he sees Haru and Chosuke approaching and he wakes up.</p><p>It turns out Takei was in a virtual world that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/millionaire-detective-episode-3-suzue-identity-revealed/\">Suzue</a> and Daisuke had created to coax the truth out of his memories. From the phone call, Daisuke figures out was trying to contact the late Director Saiki. Completely ashamed, Takei tries to deny Chosuke's remarks that he did all of this because of his ambition. Haru turns to look at Daisuke, who watches Takei break down with an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>From the photos, it seems that Sayuri and Shigemaru were involved in allodium research, which cost them their lives. It's unclear whether Saiki is the one orchestrating all of this or if he's answering to someone else. With Haru and Chosuke now working together with Daisuke, they may finally get to the bottom of what happened 19 years ago.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boruto-chapter-49-sasuke-most-important-heartbreaking-mission/\">The Boruto Manga Gives Sasuke His Most Important (&#38; Heartbreaking) Mission EVER</a></span></p><p><h2></h2></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 02:00:14 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-family-photo.jpg","linkMd5":"f4e07c7540315819c0101a1801c087e8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-03-001_513fc612baae1dd0.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":40802,"destBytes":40802,"author":"Hilary Leung","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-family-photo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-03-001_513fc612baae1dd0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-kambe-family.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn70@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-09-537_3eff6f89a310a8e5.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-director-saiki.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn23@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-05-894_f5ab2d06c09fff9a.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detective-shigemaru-death.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-16-208_65bcacbf2b43bdb0.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/millionaire-detectie-takeis-memories.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn37@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-08-324_a04cef0d01d93be6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Braun Strowman Reveals Vince McMahon Helped Him Overcome His Suicidal Thoughts","link":"https://www.cbr.com/braun-strowman-vince-mcmahon-suicidal-thoughts/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Braun-Strowman-WWE.jpg\"/></figure><p>Former <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/wwe\">WWE</a> Universal Champion Braun Strowman revealed how a discussion between himself and Vince McMahon helped to fend off his suicidal thoughts.</p><p>\"I'm very thankful to have a relationship with him like that because I might not even be here,\" Strowman said on the latest episode of <em>WWE Chronicle</em>. \"There was -- I don't even like talking about this out loud -- I was thinking about killing myself a couple of times and it's just... it's shitty that I got to that point and I should have talked to somebody sooner, and I never knew how much he cared about me.

The Moon Light Sword, a blade passed down the generations of Mira's family, was stolen from her by her husband-to-be -- one of Nox's agents. This hasn't prevented Mira from kicking ass and taking names, however; instead, she felt that being free of the weapon meant also being free of the restrictive burden of legacy that had long weighed on her. Her swordless style has proven more than effective enough to get her this far, too.</p><p>But in Episode 9, as Mira is forced to drag out her match against greased-up marine Lee Marin until Mori shows up, the battle becomes inexplicably more complicated when Marin reveals that he's armed with the Moon Light Sword. Mira struggles to get purchase on his oily, near-naked body (much to the audience's discomfort) and Marin piles on the emotional pressure, too: taunting her for her stupidity in not realizing the sword' \"true power,\" and her inadequacy for failing to wield it. To add insult to injury, the sword refuses to return to her even when she has it in her grip again.</p><p>Overwhelmed, Mira falls -- but sinks into a dreamlike, oceanic world as she does. Beneath the waves, a voice calls to her, and she vows to it that she will become \"peerless and unparalleled\" in strength. When she emerges, this vow turns out to have been a contract with the charyeok, Fengxian, who looks like a historical Chinese warrior. Not only does she throttle Marin and his Kraken charyeok, but she also earns back the Moon Light Sword.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-god-of-high-school-epside-7-jugok-unstoppable-monster-nationals/\">The God Of High School: An Unstoppable Monster Tears Through Nationals</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/God-of-High-School-Mori-Episode-9.png\"/></figure><p>While Mira fights to win back her family's National Treasure, Mori fights to win back his family, period. Unfortunately, his rescue mission quickly turns into a desperate fight for his own life when one of Nox's agents uses his Doppelganger charyeok to disguise a bomb as Mori's grandpa's body. Surviving this only takes Mori out of the frying pan and into the fire -- that fire being an army of clones, who attack him in a scene that's very reminiscent of Neo being beset by Agent Smiths in <em>The Matrix </em>trilogy.</p><p>His attacker, Fei Long, has enough time to kill while watching Mori battle through his copies to do some villain monologuing, which reveals some more of Taejin's backstory: \"Our final weapon in the war against the North who became a hero when he alone survived their Death Squad’s Northern-style Taekwondo.

Norman Osborn's Goblin Army, Doctor Octopus' legion of henchmen, and others have risen up over the years.

But it's revealed that instead of opening fire on Norah and adding her to his list of confirmed kills, in reality, it was Norah trying to shoot him with her gun. Unaffected by the bullet to the chest, Sin-Eater revealed that despite her numerous sins, he didn't want to kill her. In fact, he wanted her to actually do her job and report on his crusade. This allows Sin-Eater to make his case directly to the people of New York City, arguing that his tactics are brutal but necessary if they want to save the world form what he calls an unrelenting wave of crime and death and sin. He even calls on the various peoples of the city to unite behind him and his crusade.</p><p>Despite Jonah Jameson's reluctance to spread this manifesto, Norah argues it's important for New Yorkers to see the video and decide for themselves what they want to do. But Jonah's fears of this motivating the angriest people in the city to action is well-founded. Following a believer in Sin-Eater's principals, Spider-Man sneaks into a building where multiple people have begun donning Sin-Eater inspired costumes and masks. There are dozens of them already, all clamoring for Sin-Eater's brand of justice. Seeing an army grow around him, Sin-Eater hints that like him, they'll soon carry out a holy crusade against crime, killing everyone they deem a genuine threat.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/peter-parker-sin-eater-amazing-spider-man-47-preview/\">Peter Parker Smashes Sin-Eater In Amazing Spider-Man #47</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sin-Eater-Army-Spider-Man-2.jpg\"/></figure><p>What makes this army so particularly concerning is the suggestion that Sin-Eater hints at: that his current ability to take the superhuman abilities of the people he guns down could be spread through his disciples. While using his powers to trounce Spider-Man in a 1-on-1 fight, he calls out to his cheering crowd and tells them that soon, they'll all be capable of this and more. Although he'd earlier been talking about the symbolic power the Sin-Eaters can develop by working as a unified force to take control of the city-streets, Sin-Eater's attack on Spider-Man - and his mastery of multiple powers - hints that this could be a gift that could be spread. If the Kindred was able to empower Sin-Eater, then why couldn't they do the same to a host of his followers?</p><p>This could create an entire army of killers who are capable of stealing the powers of the people they kill - which could lead to a very potential fearsome force. While they may be directed towards bringing down criminals, they're still be commanded by a repeat killer and someone who'd been, until recently, doomed to suffer for the sins of the world he'd taken on. It's his dark morality that defines this army, meaning he (or the Kindred through him) could use this burgeoning strikeforce to attack anyone in the city. These reinforcements might even give Sin-Eater more than enough bodies and fire-power to attack - and try to kill - Norman Osborn, his newest target.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/amazing-spider-man-miles-morales-team/\">Amazing Spider-Man Teases A New Spider-Team Led By Miles Morales</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:20:07 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spider-Man-Sin-Eater-1.jpg","linkMd5":"7e6bf0f2ba5fc148ddcf5dc37da8c444","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-00-695_3af3b80c324c0095.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":115768,"destBytes":115768,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spider-Man-Sin-Eater-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-00-695_3af3b80c324c0095.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sin-Eater-Army-Spider-Man-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn41@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-15-188_82e45ad41dccf583.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sin-Eater-Army-Spider-Man-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn9@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-06-885_375f109b53046d9c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700504},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Dragon Ball Z: Every Butterfly Effect Trunks & Cell Caused Through Time Travel","link":"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-every-butterfly-effect-through-time-travel/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tt-fi.jpg\"/></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time travel always comes with consequences in fiction, especially in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball Z</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

While Goku ultimately survives the virus thanks to the medicine Trunks gave him, Chichi and Yamcha do need to scramble to find it in Goku’s home since he never had a reason to take it in the first place. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Android 16’s Activation</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dragon-Ball-Android-16.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trunks returns to his future shortly after warning the Dragon Team about the Android attack, but he decides to travel back in time to him with the eventual assault. Unfortunately, Trunks’ presence seems to have had a greater effect on the timeline than he imagined as he doesn’t even recognize Dr. Gero and Android 19. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-gohan-power-ups-in-order/\">Dragon Ball Z: All Of Gohan’s Power Ups (In Chronological Order)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s possible that Dr. Gero and Android 19 were present in the fusion’s initial attack as well, there’s a clear anomaly in Android 16’s activation. 16 isn’t so much as referenced in the future, but the main timeline stresses that he not only wants to kill Goku, he’s the strongest of the three Androids. 16 may be introduced as a dangerous villain, but he goes on to play one of the most heroic roles in the Cell arc– instrumental in saving the world.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Stronger Artificial Humans</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Android-18-takes-off-jacket-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main timeline isn’t in the best situation with the activation of Android 16, but it’s made even worse when Trunks realizes that these versions of Android 17 and 18 are much stronger than the ones he fought in the future. Whether it’s because his androids were holding back doesn’t really matter. The point is that Trunks’ presence has severely altered how the androids are behaving. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a single battle, both Androids 17 and 18 overwhelm every single member of the Dragon Team. Vegeta is left broken &#38; battered, Future Trunks has his sword shattered, and both Tenshinhan &#38; Piccolo can hardly do a thing to fight back. Krillin is left the last man standing as the Androids approach him. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>The Survival Of The Dragon Team</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/krillin-and-18.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of their freak strength, the Androids of the main timeline curiously spare the Dragon Team. In Trunks’ future, it’s suggested they killed off every member of the main cast one by one as they came to fight them. Here, however, the Androids very explicitly leave everyone alive. Android 18 had every reason in the world to kill Vegeta, but she doesn’t. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Krillin is spared alongside the rest of the Dragon Team and it’s made clear that quite a number of things have changed between the main timeline and Trunks’ future. Androids 17 and 18 might be much stronger, but they at least don’t have a taste for bloodlust like they did in the future. Though this likely has to do with Goku still being alive. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Gohan’s Potential</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gohan.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gohan ends up training Trunks in the future, but he hits a wall when it comes to Super Saiyan. Future Gohan genuinely believes that this is his peak. Only about as strong as Goku was on Namek– if a bit stronger– Future Gohan fights an uphill battle that costs him everyone he holds dear, his arm, and ultimately his life. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-manga-best-chapters/\">Dragon Ball Super: 10 Best Chapters Of The Manga (So Far)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Goku still alive in the main timeline, Gohan never frames himself through Goku’s strength. Instead, Goku is able to help Gohan see the full scope of his potential. By training with his father inside of the Room of Spirit and Time, main timeline Gohan becomes stronger than Future Gohan ever was.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Goku’s Sacrifice</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Goku-Willing-to-Sacrifice-Self.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole reason Trunks travels back in time is to prevent Goku’s death, but fate seems to have its grip around the Saiyan’s life. While Goku does not succumb to the Heart Virus in the main timeline, he’s forced to sacrifice himself during the Cell Games to save the Earth. The main takeaway being that while Goku is still dead, it wasn’t in vain. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the Dragon Balls could have revived Goku, he opts to stay dead, citing a conversation he had off-screen with Bulma where she tells him that villains always flock to him. While Goku’s death buys the world seven years of peace, the Majin Buu arc makes it very clear just how much </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needs Son Goku. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>The Majin Buu Crisis</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Majin-Buu-Eating-Sweets.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably the most significant butterfly effect caused by Trunks and Cell time travelling is the Majin Buu crisis. In both timelines, they happen at radically different points in time and play out differently. Presumably because the Androids wiped out most of human life, Bobbidi only arrives after Trunks has rebuilt the future. From there, Trunks is able to handle the crisis with minimal casualties. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the main timeline, Bobbidi and Dabra arrive much earlier on a healthy planet Earth. Without Trunks’ pragmatism, however, the main Dragon Team mess everything up, resulting in a chain reaction that revives Majin Buu, mass human extinction, and the destruction of the planet. Everything works out in the end, but Buu proves to be a greater threat in the main timeline.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-android-18-characters-can-cant-beat/\">Dragon Ball Z: 5 Villains Android 18 Could Defeat (&#38; 5 She’d Lose To)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:30:45 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tt-fi.jpg","linkMd5":"669d5114c99d04f1477d4463f8bc501b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-709_375c7943edb8d286.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":185980,"destBytes":185980,"author":"Renan Fontes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tt-fi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn30@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-709_375c7943edb8d286.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Future-Trunks.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn97@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-12-165_19369683ff2f50e7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Goku-Suffering-From-the-Heart-Virus.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn1@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-09-697_f7f150e0df510607.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dragon-Ball-Android-16.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn17@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-10-629_46216930f7deb1ce.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Android-18-takes-off-jacket-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-15-099_5813eeb404a331b0.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/krillin-and-18.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn27@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-17-596_aad79802b566b42e.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gohan.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn38@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-10-912_15533ea52a528289.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Goku-Willing-to-Sacrifice-Self.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn1@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-11-547_46acd067a5b43833.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Majin-Buu-Eating-Sweets.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn5@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-14-760_0858865f5e8c13cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700508},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"X-Men: 10 Best Line-Ups, Ranked | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-best-teams-ranked-marvel-comics-excalibur-first-outbackclass/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/X-Men-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men/\">X-Men</a> have one of the most expansive rosters in all of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel/\">Marvel Comics</a>, even routinely placing in the line-ups of other high profile teams. The line-up shifts so often that it's hard to keep straight, but a good barometer of what generation a fan belongs to is to find out what their favorite line-up is. Whether it's the 80s, 90s, or right now, everybody has a favorite roster they'd love to see in that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-x-men-roster-mcu-movi/\">upcoming MCU X-Men movie</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-facts-genosha/\">X-Men: 10 Facts Fans Should Know About Genosha</a></span></p><p>But what are the best line-ups the X-Men have ever had? What eras and iterations of the team stand out amongst all the rest? Here are the ten best X-Men line-ups, ranked.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Age of Apocalypse</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Age-of-Apocalypse.jpg' /></figure><p>A good number of X-Men line-ups hail from alternate realities. Just think about it: <em>House of M, Age of X</em>, and perhaps most significantly, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-xmen-age-apocalypse-aged-well-poorly/\"><em>Age of Apocalypse</em></a>.</p><p>The core X-Men line-up changed dramatically in the horrific alternate future of the classic 90s event. Now led by Magneto after the murder of Professor X, the team is dominated by characters who had once been villains, including an incredible take on Sabretooth, and Magneto's own wife, Rogue. Throw in fan-favorite Blink, and this team easily ranks as one of the best.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>New X-Men</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/www.cbr-.comnew-x-men-a72e5d70b233ed258b649a0e6a51108c7e956751.jpg' /></figure><p>The New X-Men era of the team emerged in the wake of the hugely successful first Fox X-Men movie. This version focused on some classic characters like Cyclops and Jean Grey, but leveraged new members of the team, like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-emma-frost-costumes-love-hate/\">Emma Frost</a>.</p><p>The White Queen's evolution as a key member of the team to where she is now - one of the most important and influential players in all of mutantdom on Krakoa - really begins here. The very movie-inspired line-up succeeds by introducing a lot of new elements, like Beast's continued evolution.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Excalibur</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/excalibur-meggan-captain-britain-phoenix-shadowcat.jpg' /></figure><p>While technically not the X-Men, this Britain-based line-up of mutant heroes functionally was in the wake of the team's apparent demise in the 80s. Former X-members <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/xmen-kitty-pryde-best-worst-mutant/\">Kitty Pryde</a>, Nightcrawler, and Rachel Summers joined forces with Captain Britain and Meghan to form Excalibur.</p><p>This team proved one of the most interesting and certainly one of the funniest of all the teams. A little bit of humor was sorely needed given the main X-Men titles involved a lot of doom and gloom (and often still do).</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Mid-80s</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-Men-80s-Lineup.jpeg' /></figure><p>Excalibur evolved out of the most iconic periods in the X-Men's history. Kitty, Rachel, and Kurt all anchored a team that included some of the X-Men's most prominent and powerful members like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-top-colossus-costumes-ranked-marvel-comics/\">Colossus</a> and Rogue. This period saw Storm without her powers, and the introduction of her iconic mohawk look. She and Cyclops duked it out for leadership of the X-Men, which he ultimately yielded before leaving the team.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rogue-better-as-avenger-or-x-men/\">5 Reasons Why Rogue Is Better As A Member Of The Uncanny Avengers (&#38; 5 Why She Should Stay An X-Man)</a></span></p><p>Though this period was transitional between the early Claremont era and the crossover craziness of the late 80s and early 90s, it was one of the best in the team's history.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>First Class</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Original-X-Men-Team.jpg' /></figure><p>The classic X-Men remains one of the best line-ups in the team's history. Cyclops, Jean Grey, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-iceman-best-worst-mutant/\">Iceman</a>, Beast, and Angel represent some of the most important and consequential characters in all of Marvel history. Together, they ushered one of the most consequential elements of the Marvel universe: mutants.</p><p>Though their early adventures didn't prove as popular as later iterations of the book, they laid a solid and important foundation that keeps them anchored in the team's destiny to this day (it helps that they die and come back to life. A lot).</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Astonishing X-Men</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Colossus-Astonishing-X-Men.jpeg' /></figure><p>The <em>Astonishing X-Men</em> run in the mid-2000s by Joss Whedon and Frank Quietly succeed the <em>New X-Men</em>, by involving many of the same characters like Cyclops, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/beast-belong-avengers-x-men/\">Beast</a>, and Emma Frost. But where it really popped was in returning some old fan favorites like Kitty and Colossus.</p><p>Their relationship finally grew up here, and arguably was never better (it's not exactly in great shape at the moment). This roster returned fans to the colorful costumes and the crazy fun of earlier eras while adding in that trademark Whedon pathos as well.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Giant-Size X-Men</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nightcrawler-New-X-Men.jpg' /></figure><p>As integral to the history of the team as the original five from the 60s, the line-up introduced in <em>Giant-Size X-Men</em> #1 greatly expanded and diversified the team.</p><p>It's hard to imagine today, but this was the first appearance of numerous iconic characters, like Storm, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-nightcrawler-kurt-wagner-trivia/\">Nightcrawler</a>, and Colossus. Like pretty much every line-up, this particular one would go through quick and significant changes. Thunderbird died quickly after, and Banshee bowed out, but much of this line-up remains in place today.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Outback Team</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/X-MEN-ROSTERS-Outback.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the most interesting line-ups occurred in the late 80s. It was also one of the funniest, despite the circumstances. The X-Men faked their deaths and then went into hiding in the Australian Outback. From there, they launched secret missions around the world with a line-up that including newcomers <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/betsy-braddock-psylocke-captain-britain-better/\">Psylocke</a> (before her traumatic transformation into a ninja assassin) as well as Dazzler and Longshot.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-worst-x-men-crossover-events/\">The 5 Best X-Men Crossover Events (&#38; The 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>This roster scraped by on next to nothing, which honestly made a lot more sense for outcasts than living in a fancy mansion and flying a supersonic jet.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Blue Team</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-Men-Blue-Team.jpeg' /></figure><p>Once the X-Men revealed themselves to be alive and went back to more or less the status quo, the team expanded and then divided into what are arguably for most fans its two most well-known line-ups. The first was the X-Men Blue Team, which consisted of Cyclops, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-alpha-flight-every-team-roster-ranked/\">Wolverine</a>, Beast, Rogue, Gambit, Psylocke, and Jubilee.</p><p>This line-up is likely one of the most tactically effective in their history, with numerous heavy hitters highly experienced and effective in close-quarters combat. And Jubilee helped sometimes, too.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Gold Team</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Storm-X-Men-Gold.jpg' /></figure><p>The Gold Team existed alongside the Blue, and it's debatable if one is better than the other, but the Gold Team features something the Blue Team doesn't.

From the jump, she was an interesting character, as shown with her being sixth in the first character poll the series did. She had a look that was unlike any other in the series, truly embodying the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-powerful-breathing-techniques-ranked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insect breath</a> she represented.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-best-ways-manga-foreshadowed-grand-finale-ending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demon Slayer: The 10 Best Ways The Manga Foreshadowed The Grand Finale</a></span></p><p>Her pleasant disposition is also very unique as she loves joking around with and teasing her teammates, being almost your standard pixie <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rascal-does-not-dream-bunny-girl-senpai-memes-hilarious-anime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dream girl</a>. This pleasantness even seemingly expands to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-what-to-know-before-watching-mugen-train/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demons</a> as she says she wants to be able to get along with them (not truly the case). The cosplay below helps bring out a lot of that playfulness her character has.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Dreams To Reality</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Shinobu-Cosplay-by-cospoxia.png' /></figure><p><em>Cosplay by cospoxia:</em> https://www.instagram.com/p/CCO5rpsDHsp/?utm_source=ig_embed</p><p>Be it photo manipulation or some sort of latex mask, Cospoxia manages to make herself look doll-like as if she were an <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/most-expensive-anime-figures-ranked/\">anime figurine</a> come to life rather than a mere cosplay. It's both astounding and almost jarring to look at as you can't take your eyes off how her face looks. It's a true credit to her ability as a cosplayer to pull off something so eye-catching. Once you manage to pull your eyes away from it, you'll see the rest of the outfit is equally as good.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Free As A Butterfly</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>The butterfly motif her clothing has is perfect on several levels, first being that she's the insect Hashira and second, that free-roaming nature of the bug fits in with the personality she often exudes to others. That almost <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/howls-moving-castle-fan-art/\">whimsical</a> and fun persona is shown beautifully here by Summer. You can see she's someone who roams the world on a whim, never letting the atrocities within it get her down. She's that beacon of light in the dark.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Growth</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>The way she's caressing that budding flower works well for the character, outward appearance being rather nurturing, even as she struggles to contain her inner rage.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-questions-after-end-of-the-maga/\">Demon Slayer: 10 Burning Questions We Still Have Now That The Manga Is Over</a></span></p><p>Blooming of the flower is also very symbolic since her character develops as the series goes on, fully sprouting her petals towards the end of the series when her true nature comes out in full. The highlights of purple in her hair work so well with the natural black.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Shroud Of Purple</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Cospoxia may be the gold standard when it comes to Shinobu cosplay. Every one of her images is not only amazing to look at but so different from each other. They all show different sides of her character, this one focusing more on her abilities, a stream of purple smoke surrounding her. It's the first one that gives the fullest view of the outfit as well, showing how well done it is. The butterfly styling of the robe going perfect with the end of her leggings.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Insect Queen</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Her eyes are a little jarring at first, looking almost cross-eyed, but when you move passed that fact, it's one that nails Shinobu's hair better than anyone else. Rather than going with streaks, she colored the tips of her hair with purple, just as the character does. The color matches well with her butterfly hairpin as well. Her use of props is spot on as well, the butterflies used adding to the cosplay, showing off why she's the insect Hashira.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Ready To Slay</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>It's hard to not have your eyes immediately divert to her eyes, from how thick her eyelashes are to the pale pink contacts used for her eyes. They have a way of sucking you into them.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-best-worst-characters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demon Slayer: 5 Characters Fans Have Come To Love (&#38; 5 They Still Find Annoying)</a></span></p><p>As with others, the purple in her hair matches very nicely with the coloring of the hairpiece nestled on the back of her head. The way it looks like she's ready to unsheath her sword shows how quickly Shinobu can switch from smiling to a straight-up killer at the drop of a hat.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Living Doll</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>It's always going to be incredible seeing people who can turn themselves into what can only be called a living doll. It isn't just her face either, even her hand looks like it could be made of porcelain, lacking any sort of blemish on it at all. Photo editing comes into play, naturally, but it's not the only thing. Beyond that, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-inosuke-anime-cosplay/\">cosplay</a> is everything you'd want it to be, robes, hair, and hairpiece all looking as you'd want them to.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Girl Power</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>If there's one thing you can always give Demon Slayer as a series, it's that it treats its female characters with as much respect as it's men, something that isn't always the case in shounen. Shinobu, Mitsuri, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-reasons-protect-nezuko/\">Nezuko</a> all have moments where they get to shine. All three cosplayers here, look great as their respective characters, deep purple streaks in Shinobu's hair being perfect when contrasted with the sheer brightness of Mitsuri's pink and neon green hair.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Blade</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>That sword is phenomenal looking, engravings within the metal making it look as authentic as possible. The way she's holding it is also on point of the character, using it more as a defensive weapon than one of pure offense as she's well aware she's lacking in physical strength. Her eyes are such a nice royal purple, matching not only her hair and the hairpiece but also the background as well. The purple lighting and sheets hanging near it help provide a very pleasing backdrop for the photo.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Transformation</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>That quote used by Nagini sums up why the butterfly is such a perfect symbol for Shinobu as a character. The metamorphosis the creature had to undergo to achieve the beauty we see is often glossed over, not unlike what Shinobu herself had to undergo. The large bamboo stalks in the background help transport you more to that feudal Japan setting that much of <em>Demon Slayer</em> is set in. The choice to have the butterfly be a different color from the rest of her purple garb was smart, giving a nice point of contrast and avoiding things looking too similar.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-amazing-nezuko-cosplays/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Demon Slayer: 10 Amazing Nezuko Cosplays That Look Just Like the Anime</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 02:00:22 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Shinobu-Header-Cropped.jpg","linkMd5":"093355332267da6f5e1e56999cab4c29","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-907_e0c75b9fd528abbc.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":120932,"destBytes":120932,"author":"Anthony Mazzuca","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Shinobu-Header-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-907_e0c75b9fd528abbc.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Shinobu-Cosplay-by-cospoxia.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-15-557_e4cf373c664644af.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Taika Waititi and Jeff Goldblum are Working on a Secret Project","link":"https://www.cbr.com/taika-waititi-jeff-goldblum-secret-project/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/taikajeffheader.jpg\"/></figure><p>After working together on <em>Thor: Ragnarok,</em> Jeff Goldblum has hinted at an impending reunion with director <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/taika-waititi/\">Taika Waititi</a>.</p><p>When asked about the Disney+ show <em>The Mandalorian</em>, which features Waititi as both a director and the voice of the character IG-11, by <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/jeff-goldblum-jurassic-world-dominion-laura-dern-disney-plus-emmys-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insider</a>, Goldblum responded, \"I'm a fan of it!

That's shown by brief glimpses of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/carnage-vs-joker-villain-psychotic/\">psychotic</a> side of her character.

It all shows that Zoe isn't right in the head. The smudging and overall coloring of the background help give it an interesting look as if blood is splattering around her without making it an overly gory piece.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Notes</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hanji-Attack-On-Titan-2.jpg' /></figure><p>If there's one thing Zoe is always going to be, it's studious. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/goatrocket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goatrocket</a> puts her in a more relaxed setting, sitting amongst her notes and books with a nice steamy cup of coffee or tea. The weathered-look they manage to give both the documents and the journal she's flipping through is a nice touch. The entire piece puts Zoe at a sense of peace as if this is where she can be her true self, among the pages of these books rather than around people.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Headlines</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hanji-Attack-On-Titan-3.jpg' /></figure><p>Slapping Zoe's face onto the cover of a magazine is such a unique way to do fan art. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/emametlo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emametlo</a> doesn't stop there either, giving it more depth by adding the small headlines around it, the line about 8 amazing titan facts being apt for how articles are written now.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-best-erwin-fan-artwork/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attack On Titan: 10 Pieces Of Erwin Fan Art We Love</a></span></p><p>The art itself is very well done too. The depth in her hair is particularly noteworthy, each strand can be visible, looking thin enough to pluck right off her head. The fullness of her lips is instantly eye-catching as well.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Smirking</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hanji-Attack-On-Titan-4.jpg' /></figure><p>While she loses some of her light-heartedness as the series goes on, that smirk seemed plastered all over her face when she first showed up on the scene. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/blackteakimi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blackteakimi</a> does a good job of making it both playful and foreboding, never knowing what exactly is going through Zoe's mind.

On one hand, Levi would trust Zoe with his life, going by whatever plan she ever came up with. On the other hand, her eccentric nature wears on him, clashing far too much with his more calm and detached demeanor. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/ikimaru-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ikimaru-art</a> shows so much of that here, Levi sipping from his cup as he internally wants to scream.

She isn't the star of this art by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/fansyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fansyl</a> though, that spot belonging to Levi who's face exudes a fed up energy, that he feels like he's surrounded by idiots, and is at his wits end over it.

He wants to be anywhere, but right here, yet, he knows there's no use trying to argue once Zoe gets an idea in her head.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>What Now?</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hanji-Attack-On-Titan-10.jpg' /></figure><p>Most of the art has focused on the eccentricity of Zoe, while <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/ayywa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ayywa</a> went more for a serious look. She looks like she's drifted into quiet contemplation over what her next move should be. The weight of the world could very well be on her shoulders, so many lives hinging on whatever plan she comes up with.

While the animated series may have to an end, it receives its own comic book adaptation from BOOM! Studios in a six-issue miniseries crafted by several of the writers behind the animated series, following the Blue Bomber, his father Doctor Light and sister Suna to defend humanity from nefarious Robot Masters that threaten their home of Silicon City. And while the first issue is a genuine thrill ride for fans of the video game character and the animated series, those unfamiliar with the franchise may want to look elsewhere for a jumping-on point to the video game.</p><p>As Doctor Thomas Light steps up as a negotiator and peacemaker between the robots and humanity, he quickly finds himself in over his head when a diplomatic mission goes wrong outside of Silicon City. As Mega Man leaps to his rescue, the young boy finds himself confronted with mysterious visions from his forgotten history that shakes him to his core. As Aki Light attempts to reconcile his strangely shattered memories, he finds himself on an adventure that could determine the fate of Silicon City as he sets out to rediscover his own identity.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mega-man-fully-charged-army-robots-first-look/\">Mega Man Battles an Army of Robots in Fully Charged First Look</a></span></p><p>Series writers A.J. Marchisello and Marcus Rinehart team up for the comic book adaptation, with series co-creator and executive producer Joe Kelly serving as a creative consultant for the miniseries. The writers continue to have a strong handle on each of the character's voices, transitioning seamlessly from animated television to the comic book medium, with Aki and Light each getting ample time to shine in the opening issue. Right from the opening, the comic is noticeably darker in tone than its animated source material, with Marchisello and Rinehart crafting a more action-packed take while Aki is much more serious than he had been on the animated series and it largely works as a continuation to the show.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mega-man-fully-charged-1-preview-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>This darker and hard-edged approach is evident with Stefano Simeone's artwork right from the jump. Joined by colorist Igor Monti, the visuals for the comic adaptation dials up its cyberpunk sensibilities while sequences taking place outside of Silicon City evoke a post-apocalyptic feel as Light and Mega Man navigate the wasteland. A major action sequence that serves as the centerpiece of the opening issue is definitely gripping, as Mega Man confidently charges into battle while his opponents feel like something out of Samurai Jack, robotic yet wholly menacing as they loom over Light and the Blue Bomber. Simeone's designs certainly feel like a continuation of the characters from the animated series, but there is more visible anime influence while Monti's choice in color palette plays up the shadow and light to ground the proceedings.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mega-man-treasure-trove-manga-fans/\">Mega Man Is a Treasure Trove for Manga Fans</a></span></p><p>For those looking for the next step in the ongoing saga of Mega Man as he and his father maintain the fragile peace between humanity and robots, BOOM! Studios' comic book adaptation is fun, more mature ride for fans of the animated series. While the more familiar antagonists and supporting characters from the wider franchise have yet to play a major role, the creative team wastes no time in establishing the world and tone of their approach to the long-running video game franchise. As for those that have no real background with the Blue Bomber's adventures or younger fans of the animated series, <em>Fully Charged</em> may not be the place to delve into Capcom's franchise.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mega-man-legends-action-adventure/\">Mega Man Legends Is the Outcast of the Game Franchise</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:20:49 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mega-man-fully-charged-1-main-cover.jpg","linkMd5":"9e09a5faa5c0864908243a93cbb75ae3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-770_5a94260a849f6b6d.webp","destWidth":1031,"destHeight":1734,"sourceBytes":220045,"destBytes":202488,"author":"Sam Stone","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mega-man-fully-charged-1-main-cover.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-770_5a94260a849f6b6d.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mega-man-fully-charged-1-preview-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn33@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-10-125_f04dee8a0f8d2f41.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700506},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Top 10 Spies In Marvel Comics | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/best-spies-marvel-comics-black-widow/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-10-Spies-In-Marvel-Comics-featured-image.jpg\"/></figure><p>If someone is part of a superhero team like the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers/\">Avengers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/fantastic-four/\">Fantastic Four</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men/\">the X-Men</a>, keeping abreast of the clandestine actions of the Masters of Evil, Frightful Four, or Brotherhood of Evil Mutants would be foremost on their mind, and vice-versa.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-things-need-know-heart-of-universe-trivia/\">Marvel: 10 Things You Need To Know About The Heart Of The Universe</a></span></p><p>One way to do so, aside from sitting around HQ waiting for someone to launch an attack, is to send covert operatives into the enemy camp for some good, old-fashioned espionage.

A big reason behind the popularity of the games is their solid, bad-ass, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/scariest-anime-monsters-of-all-time/\">fantasy monster-slaying</a> protagonist, Geralt of Rivia.

The three of them <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/strangest-marvel-relationships/\">don't exactly fit into the mold of a traditional family</a>, but they do care deeply about each other.</p><p>Triss is a close friend to them. While in the games the four of them never got together for Christmas dinner as shown in the cosplay, it is certainly interesting to imagine this rough and tough group of people in such a wholesome situation.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>An Armoured Warrior</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>The \"mutagens\" and experiments that were forced on to Geralt to morph him into a Witcher physically altered him in many ways, namely making his hair white permanently and giving him inhumane levels of stamina, speed, and strength. He can survive hits that would kill a normal human being, but is not invincible and thus <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-3-coolest-armor-sets-ranked/\">can be seen wearing armor at all times in the games</a>.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-3-vs-dark-souls-3-better-game/\">5 Things The Witcher 3 Does Better Than Dark Souls 3 (&#38; 5 Things Dark Souls 3 Does better)</a></span></p><p>Geralt's most iconic outfit is his chainmail armor, which can be clearly deduced to be the prime focus of this well-crafted cosplay.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>A Fearsome Trio</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Geralt quite literally has the title of \"white wolf\" in his name. Even besides that, he has always been somewhat of a lone wolf, traveling the land of known and unknown regions <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/witcher-3-geralt-vs-video-game-monsters/\">hunting down monsters all by himself</a>.</p><p>Yet, every now and then Geralt finds himself in the company of others, be it by choice or not. The group of cosplayers featured in the picture look ready and willing to head into battle at any moment, which is indeed an appropriate look for Geralt and his fellow Witchers.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>A Hooded Figure</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Two of the most important facial features of Geralt, and the most striking as well, are his eyes and battle scars. The scars are pretty self-explanatory, but the story behind his distinct <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/powerful-eye-abilities-anime/\">piercing eyes</a> is a tad bit longer. In the books, his eyes have never been specified to be of a color and are just mentioned to be \"dark.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-witcher-dc-comics-geralt-heroes/\">The Witcher: 5 DC Heroes Geralt Can Defeat (&#38; 5 He Can't)</a></span></p><p>But in the games, they can be clearly seen to be dark amber and yellowish. This might have something to do with Geralt's \"Witcher Senses\" ability in the third game which allows him to view the world with superhuman senses.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Ready To Fight</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>The most striking part of this cosplay and the one that catches the eye first is the balanced amount of lighting. The engraving on the sword is clearly visible as well, which is a neat little feature that shows the cosplayer's exceptional dedication towards attention to detail.</p><p>In the games, Geralt's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-sword-wielding-comic-book-heroes-ranked/\">swords aren't just pieces of metal</a> to defeat monsters, but they come with extensive histories of their own. The battle stance shows that Geralt is ready to run straight into his next fight.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>On The Hunt</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Although Geralt might seem like a man of barbarian nature who always works in brutish ways, in reality, a vital part of the game involves using his superhuman senses to track down objects, people, or enemies.</p><p>Sure, Geralt's super strength and swordsmanship have kept him alive against all those deadly beasts, but his tracking skills are indispensable as well. All of these factors combine to make Geralt the legendary Witcher that he is.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>A Powerful Magic User</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Digital alteration with software such as Photoshop can be a great way to include effects or highlights in a cosplay picture that would be impossible or difficult to do with practical effects. In this case, not only is the costume well done, but the cosplayer uses heavy editing to exhibit Geralt's magic powers.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-witcher-bosses-look-tougher-than-they-are/\">The Witcher Series: 10 Bosses That Look Way Tougher Than They Really Are</a></span></p><p>In the game, a big portion of the combat mechanics was dependent on the player's use of various spells, both defensive and offensive in nature.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Roach and His Rider</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>As open-world games keep getting bigger, traversing them is becoming a tougher chore. One way to combat this is for developers to give the player a travel companion, something almost all games are doing nowadays.</p><p>Geralt's horse Roach is as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-fan-favorite-animal-companions/\">loyal and trustworthy as a companion can get</a>, who will transcend the limits of space and time to teleport to the protagonist's location at a single summon. The two have faced a great many monsters together, and this full suited cosplayer on the back of his mare looks ready to do so as well.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Deep In Meditation</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Meditating is a very crucial feature present in all <em>The</em> <em>Witcher </em>games. It allows the player to restore Geralt's health and endurance, and it is also a good way to initiate a time-lapse (such as to go from day time to night time).</p><p>An even better in-universe explanation would be that it gives Geralt (and the player as well) a moment of peace and tranquility among all the war and fighting. This cosplay certainly sets a peaceful aesthetic befitting of a resting warrior tired from all the fights he has been in.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/netflix-witcher-fantasy-comic-books-similar/\">10 Fantasy Comics To Read If You Like Netflix's The Witcher</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:30:20 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Witcher-3-10-Geralt-Cosplay-That-We-Absolutely-Love-featured-image.jpg","linkMd5":"414193a89842390df3b012673985bc0e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn61@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-01-950_c6315cd1020025b4.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":172072,"destBytes":172072,"author":"Mahir Wasif","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Witcher-3-10-Geralt-Cosplay-That-We-Absolutely-Love-featured-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn61@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-01-950_c6315cd1020025b4.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/geralt-cosplay-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn52@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-17-055_d351c11a08d67678.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700506},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Jack Kirby's DC Debut 50 Years Ago Was Wild, Wonderful... and Worrying","link":"https://www.cbr.com/jack-kirby-dc-debut-jimmy-olsen-50th-anniversary/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-jack-kirby-debut-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>This is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/look-back/\">\"Look Back,\"</a> a feature that I plan to do for at least all of 2019 and possibly beyond that (and possibly forget about in a week, who knows?). The concept is that every week (I'll probably be skipping the four fifth weeks in the year, but maybe not) of a month, I will spotlight a single issue of a comic book that came out in the past and talk about that issue (often in terms of a larger scale, like the series overall, etc.). Each week will be a look at a comic book from a different year that came out the same month X amount of years ago. The first week of the month looks at a book that came out this month ten years ago. The second week looks at a book that came out this month 25 years ago. The third week looks at a book that came out this month 50 years ago. The fourth week looks at a book that came out this month 75 years ago. The occasional fifth week looks at books from 20/30/40/60/70/80 years ago.</p><p>Today, we look at the August 1970 DC comic book debut of Jack Kirby, as he took over writer/penciler duties on Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #133. </p><p>As you may or may not know, there are two special things about Jack Kiby's run on Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen. The first is that, well, why in the world was Jack Kirby starting his DC tenure on Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen, of all books? Well, you see, Kirby's whole plan at DC was mostly to do his own thing, but while he was working on his own thing, he agreed to do some DC Universe right away and it was as simple as Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen not having a regular creative team. Kirby didn't want someone to lose their job for him to take over, so he asked which books were free and clear and Jimmy Olsen was the answer.</p><p>The other notable thing sort of speaks to the snobbery of DC Comics at the time. DC was so obsessed with their characters being \"on brand\" that they had artist Al Plastino (longtime Superman artist and the co-creator of Supergirl) re-draw Superman's face in this comic book so that it would be \"on model.\" It's absurd. You bring over Jack Kirby, you do big ads for Jack Kirby coming to DC and then you...re-draw Jack Kirby's Superman? It's beyond absurd. Kirby wasn't a fan of it, but he was a good company guy, so he went along with it. DC had Vince Colletta ink Kirby at first and Colletta inked this issue. </p><p>Being his first issue at DC, Kirby wanted to really go overboard with new ideas, but first, he brought back an OLD idea. When he was first at DC in the 1940s, after leaving Timely Comics (now Marvel) in a contract dispute over Captain America royalties (or the lack thereof), Kirby and his partner, Joe Simon, went to DC and invented ANOTHER hit comic book series, with the Boy Commandos, a team of young kids working as, well, you know, commandos. The idea worked so well that Kirby and Simon then introduced a stateside version of the team called the Newsboy Legion, local newsboys who would also fight crime, along with their superhero guardian, the Guardian (who also knew the boys as the beat cop from their block). In Jimmy Olsen #133, Jimmy is sent to interview the Newsboy Legion, who are somehow still young kids (this later gets addressed)...</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Right after this, Kirby then introduced Morgan Edge, the new boss of both Jimmy and Clark Kent, as Edge owned both the Daily Bugle and the Galaxy Broadcasting System (GBS) where Edge made Clark Kent a TV news anchor. Edge was a slick talking executive, but he hid a dark secret, he secretly worked for a criminal organization known as Intergang! In this first issue, Edge arranges to have his own reporter, Clark Kent, murdered!</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-2.jpg\"/></figure><p>Obviously, Kent is a bit harder to kill that most reporters. Jimmy, meanwhile, is having a good time with the Newsboy Legion and their super-fast flying car known as the Whiz Wagon. While flying with it, they come across the Outsiders, a sort of futuristic motorcycle gang. Jimmy inadvertently knocks out their leader and becomes the new head of the gang. When Superman comes to go investigate his missing pal, Jimmy and the gang have to let Superman know that things aren't what they appear....</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-5.jpg\"/></figure><p>They even knock Superman out with a kryptonite gun! When Superman comes to, he discovers that the Outsiders are protecting a bizarre environment known as the Habitat. This is all tied with the DNA Project (later known as Project: Cadmus). As noted, Kirby was throwing so many different awesome new ideas at the wall at once and they all landed really well. </p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-6.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Outsiders are searching for a moving mountain and Jimmy heads off to help them find it (since he is sort of their new leader). Think of all the crazy stuff in  just this first issue and note that we haven't even met Morgan Edge's secret boss yet (hint, his name rhymes with Park Ride). What a start for the King!</p><p>If you folks have any suggestions for September (or any other later months) 2010, 1995, 1970 and 1945 comic books for me to spotlight, drop me a line at brianc@cbr.com! Here is the guide, though, for the cover dates of books so that you can make suggestions for books that actually came out in the correct month. Generally speaking, the traditional amount of time between the cover date and the release date of a comic book throughout most of comic history has been two months (it was three months at times, but not during the times we're discussing here). So the comic books will have a cover date that is two months ahead of the actual release date (so October for a book that came out in August). Obviously, it is easier to tell when a book from 10 years ago was released, since there was internet coverage of books back then.</p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 01:44:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-jack-kirby-debut-header.jpg","linkMd5":"38db19648901576f250a372ab49a669c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn98@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-01-809_26136692f228b028.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":214644,"destBytes":214644,"author":"Brian Cronin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-jack-kirby-debut-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn98@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-01-809_26136692f228b028.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn97@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-05-952_af679e084719570c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn9@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-06-055_0e453ab9c523d26c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-08-402_83ff26d192f2f815.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jimmy-olsen-133-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-10-150_d7688789887e46a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"BOFURI: 10 Things We Hope To See In Season 2 | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/bofuri-isekai-anime-season-two-wishlist/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Featured-Bofuri-Sally-and-Maple-Fighting-Mosters.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense</em>, is one of the newest explorations into anime's isekai genre.

With a new season rumored to be coming sometime during the latter half of this year, there are a handful of things we'd love to see once Maple, Sally, and the rest of her friends grace our screens once again.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>More Beast Companions</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Beast-Companions.jpg' /></figure><p>During NewWorld Online's second event, Maple and Sally managed to defeat a powerful boss and were rewarded with two eggs as a result. Both eggs hatched into tiny but powerful creatures, with Maple keeping the turtle for herself and Sally keeping the fox. Not only are these creatures extremely cute, but they've proven their usefulness in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-battles-anime-greatest/\">battles, and are reminiscent of Pokémon</a> in that they can learn skills of their own through training.</p><p>While Sally and Maple are the only players shown to possess beast companions, there have to be more out there. Not only would the playing field be leveled if more players found their own companions, but fans would have the opportunity to see two of these creatures duke it out, further diversifying NewWorld Online's gameplay.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Maple Tree's Growth</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Members-of-Maple-Tree-Guild.jpg' /></figure><p>Like many MMORPGs, NewWorld Online places a huge emphasis on establishing guilds and growing them. As viewers have seen, some of the largest guilds are akin to armies. Maple's very own guild, Maple Tree, is one of the smallest in the game, but all of its members are powerhouses.</p><p>As Maple and her friends continue to explore this virtual world, it's almost inevitable that they'll come across other powerful players who wouldn't hesitate to join Maple Tree, especially given the fact that they're now recognized as one of the strongest guilds next to the Flame Emperors and the Holy Swords.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>New Kinds Of Events</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-and-Sally-Exploring.jpg' /></figure><p>NewWorld Online emphasizes its in-game events, with four occurring in <em>BOFURI</em>'s first season. This means that new events will be integral to season 2's plot, and hopefully, they are a lot different than the previous events.</p><p>The possibilities are endless: One could be another battle royale, except the map constantly changes with each day. Or perhaps players will be sorted into random teams and be forced to advance together through a string of boss battles. Or maybe an event in which players can only compete if they have a beast companion that they can then use to battle other players' beast companions. No matter what this next event might be, fans can't wait to see just how Maple will show the developers just how broken she still is.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>New Forms</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maples-Different-Forms.jpg' /></figure><p>NewWorld Online gives players an opportunity to become things they'd never become in reality. They can be swordsmen, wizards, and even blacksmiths, but Maple's found ways to become a goddess, a devil, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-gundam-anime-ranked/\">even a Gundam</a>. After clearing extremely difficult quests, she's gained access to unique forms that grant her certain abilities that other players didn't even know existed.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/isekai-anime-things-make-sense-only-genre/\">10 Things That Only Make Sense In Isekai Anime</a></span></p><p>Given that she's already uncovered three forms in season 1, it's only a matter of time until she uncovers a new form to make her more of a threat than she already is.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Gamers Meeting In Real Life</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Swimming-with-her-Friends.jpg' /></figure><p>Many isekai anime make an effort to feature an episode where the gamers cross paths in reality. Given how much went down in season 1 of <em>BOFURI</em>, it would be amazing to see just what a powerful player like Mii is like in real life, and how far her whining gets her outside of NewWorld Online. Are some of the older players like Kasumi and Kuromu working or going to school as well?</p><p>Are any of these characters altering their appearances in the game and look drastically different in real life? Seeing Maple bump into someone she's only interacted with in the digital world (or even one of the game's developers for that matter) is definitely something fans would love to see in season 2.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>New Skills</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Using-Hydra.jpg' /></figure><p>As the series progressed, Maple, Sally, and their allies developed <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/insanely-powerful-characters-isekai-anime/\">powerful skills that helped them in difficult battles</a>, similar to any RPG. Many of these skills are pretty intriguing and unique to specific characters, but as Maple has shown everyone, there are unique skills and combinations that can only be discovered through exploring, along with trial and error.</p><p>Hopefully, season 2 introduces new skills that are not only extremely innovative, but showcase just how layered of a game NewWorld Online actually is.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>More Of \"Kaede\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Getting-Ready-to-Fight-in-Real-Life.jpg' /></figure><p>Most of <em>BOFURI </em>takes place in the virtual world of NewWorld Online, so much so that it becomes easy to forget that Sally and Maple have lives outside of the game.</p><p>In one episode of season 1, Kaede, Maple's real-world identity, allows her in-game habits to bleed into reality; at one point, she even attempts to use skills she possesses in the game during a dodgeball match, which leads to her getting hit by the ball (as expected). An episode diving more into how this game disrupts her normal life would be a great change of pace and go a long way in differentiating season 2 from its predecessor.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Greater Stakes</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Sally-Hurt.jpg' /></figure><p>Unlike most other isekai anime, the characters aren't trapped in the game by malicious developers. Dying in this game means, at the worst, a slight decrease in stats and abilities, but characters respawn with their gear in functioning order. In <em>BOFURI</em>, powerful rivalries don't mean a thing once events are over, and as seen in the final episode of season 1, Maple and her friends were able to hang out with their former adversaries as though they hadn't just been in the fight of their lives. This is due to the anime's low stakes: at worst, losing just means that players don't get a prize for winning an event.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/things-about-isekai-anime-make-no-sense/\">10 Things About Isekai Anime That Don't Make Sense</a></span></p><p>Hopefully, season 2 features a greater level of stakes for these characters in order to make viewers actually fear for them when they're in trouble. Perhaps dying can mean that players lose a valuable skill or random piece of equipment, or maybe someone makes a deal to walk away from the game forever if they lose a contest. So far, the anime feels just as inconsequential as playing any video game. This is what separates <em>BOFURI </em>from similar titles like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/sword-art-online/\">Sword Art Online</a></em>, where the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sword-art-online-best-charters-my-anime-list/\">lives of the players</a> are constantly on the line.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Maple's Defeat</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Gets-Hurt.jpg' /></figure><p>Despite not being a hardcore gamer, Maple was able to overcome every single opponent that challenged her. While she's had some close calls, she's never actually been defeated. It's odd to root for the protagonist's defeat, but almost every likable protagonist has suffered from one at some point. During his younger years, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-first-fights-goku-lost-why/\">Goku was defeated by Master Roshi during a martial arts tournament</a>, and even someone like Gon from <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/hunter-x-hunter/\">Hunter x Hunter</a></em> lost to his rival, Hisoka, when the two met in Heavens Arena.</p><p>These losses, though devastating, pushed both characters to take their training to the next level. If Maple has become so strong after playing \"casually,\" imagine just how ferocious of a player she'd be if she became a more serious-minded player after suffering her first loss.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Rematches Between Maple &#38; Mii/Payne</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Versus-Mii-and-Payne.jpg' /></figure><p>During the final episodes of season 1, Maple clashed against Mii and Payne, some of the strongest players in the game, next to Maple. Both put up a good fight but were no match for her transformations.</p><p>Hopefully, season 2 gives both of these characters a chance to redeem themselves. However, judging by the fact that a new transformation is most likely right around the corner for Maple, the results of each rematch might still be in her favor once again.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/re-zero-isekai-anime-recommendations-watch/\">Re:Zero - 10 Isekai Anime To Watch While Waiting For New Episodes Of Season 2</a> </span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:30:20 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Featured-Bofuri-Sally-and-Maple-Fighting-Mosters.jpg","linkMd5":"bee3668466278d3574c862353d61238c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-01-835_4ffd295c9221d029.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":146134,"destBytes":146134,"author":"Lavell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Featured-Bofuri-Sally-and-Maple-Fighting-Mosters.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-01-835_4ffd295c9221d029.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Beast-Companions.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn93@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-08-771_457dc6d33136ba09.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Members-of-Maple-Tree-Guild.jpg":null,"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-and-Sally-Exploring.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-12-253_779e0140c8ef9502.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maples-Different-Forms.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn53@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-06-996_ea501c38973081be.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Swimming-with-her-Friends.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn32@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-15-876_be9b8a1dad87637c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Using-Hydra.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-11-791_8bc5061dd164dabb.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Getting-Ready-to-Fight-in-Real-Life.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn13@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-05-906_e79b4db10b5e1517.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Sally-Hurt.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-16-250_ff35a18946efbdc3.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Gets-Hurt.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-17-621_9da589b404ca2543.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bofuri-Maple-Versus-Mii-and-Payne.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn66@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-05-904_5ab73aa8d1074402.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700506},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"X-Men: A Fan-Favorite Villain Just Broke Krakoa's Biggest Rule","link":"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-omega-red-krakoa-biggest-rule/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wolverine.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/wolverine/\">Wolverine</a></strong><strong> #4 by Benjamin Percy, Viktor Bogdanovic, Matthew Wilson, VC's Corey Petit, and Tom Mueller, on sale now.</strong></p><p>Ever since the Dawn of X began, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men/\">X-Men</a>, their allies, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-brings-shadow-king-krakoa/\">even their enemies</a> have gone through tremendous changes.

He feels trapped, constantly watched by the Quiet Council or even the island itself.

But it’s clear that this sanctuary has been compromised when Logan gets the feeling that he’s met his fellow patrons before, growing mysteriously disoriented. He stumbles into the bathroom, finding a dead body and wondering not for the first time if this was his doing.</p><p>Having drugged Logan in the first place, the bar’s patrons certainly believe it is, tying Logan to a chair with the intent of taking him to the frozen lake and drowning him to circumvent his healing abilities. Despite Logan’s innocence, the humans are intent on killing him as a part of their Mutant Support Group that came together to cope over their collective suffering at the hands of mutants. All of them seek retribution against mutants for one reason or another, and plan on using Wolverine as a starting point.</p><p>As Logan sinks beneath the ice, the real killer, Omega Red, makes his presence known by hurling the decapitated head of one of the humans in front of his comrades. Omega Red rips through every single one of them without hesitation as Wolverine is forced to watch beneath the frozen water. As Wolverine sinks, his old foe claims that he understands why Logan comes to this spot, using his tentacles to drain the life from Logan beneath the frozen lake. Neither of them can stand the light of Krakoa, so they seek out the shadows to drink away their discomfort. But while Logan comes to drink away his sorrows with watered down beer and cheap whiskey, Omega Red has come to drink pain--Logan’s pain.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-force-mikhail-rasputin-return/\">X-Force Brings Back An Alpha-Level Mutant Powerhouse</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Omega-Red-Kills.jpg\"/></figure><p>This isn’t the first time a citizen of Krakoa has broken its most sacred rule.

As retribution for the lives he’d taken, Victor Creed was cast down deep into the heart of Krakoa into a pit of exile to be kept in stasis until he can be reformed--or more likely until his nation needs him again.</p><p>With many of Wolverine's foes being hardened killers and the like, it is probable that at some point the Quiet Council will have to dispense justice once again sooner rather or later...possibly with Omega Red serving as the next example.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-black-white-blood-all-star-talent-black-white-tales/\">Wolverine: Black, White &#38; Blood Enlists All-Star Talent For Untold Black And White Tales</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:20:39 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wolverine.jpg","linkMd5":"93b3e791ccc2b6a663f11c2c3174df7c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-766_76e2b4dfda967812.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":242861,"destBytes":210868,"author":"Tristan Benns","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wolverine.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-766_76e2b4dfda967812.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wolverine-Omega-Red-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn61@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-08-490_b5bb52182106be87.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Omega-Red-Kills.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn55@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-10-141_b23f816978c5378f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700509},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Howard The Duck In Avengers: Endgame (& 9 Other MCU Easter Eggs We Forgot About)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/howard-the-duck-avengers-endgame-forgotten-mcu-easter-eggs/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marvel-MCU-Easter-Eggs-Feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>Whether you love them or hate them, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/\">MCU</a> deserves praise for the amount of detail placed into every movie and the nods that they make to the comics.

In Norse mythology, these creatures are two of Loki's children, Sleipnir and Fenrir, respectively. It's not clear if that is the case in the MCU but maybe Loki's spin-off might <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/loki-reasons-excited-worried-disney-plus-series/\">shed some light</a> on the matter.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>The Ten Rings Still Lingering</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ten-Rings-Logo-Iron-Man.jpg' /></figure><p>With groups like Hydra and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-worst-things-hand-has-done-marvel-universe/\">the Hand running around the MCU</a>, it's easy to forget about the first villainous organization: the Ten Rings.

Such as Cameron Klein, better known as the agent in <em>The Winter Soldier</em> who refused to launch Project Insight even as Crossbones threatened him at gunpoint. Fury must have valued Klein's resolve because Klein reappeared in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/age-of-ultron/\"><em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em></a> as one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents aboard the helicarrier in Sokovia. The fact that Fury mentioned calling Klein at the end of <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> shows how valuable he is to the agency.

Back in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america-the-first-avenger/\"><em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em></a>, when he wasn't gallivanting on stage he would doodle what was on his mind. In one scene, he drew himself as a monkey on a unicycle reflecting on his role in the war as a cheap attraction. He must have really liked that drawing because in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> he has the page framed in his room. How he kept it in good condition is anyone's guess though it's possible Coulson kept in pristine condition.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Maria's Callsign</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marvel-MCU-Photon-Easter-Egg-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Many fans were quick to scrutinize the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mcu-carol-danvers-comic-accurate/\">accuracy of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mcu-carol-danvers-comic-accurate/\">Captain Marvel</a> </em>for changing <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/carol-danvers/\">Carol Danvers's</a> call sign from Cheeseburger to Avenger but not her friend Maria's.

Fortunately, that is not the case with <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/serious-sam/\">Serious Sam</a>: The First Encounter</em>. The first <em>Serious Sam</em> game is still a fantastic first-person shooter that hasn't lost its charm. Its fast-paced action and simple, yet enjoyable gameplay are more than enough to satisfy any gamer's thirst for nostalgia.</p><p><em>Serious Sam: The First Encounter</em> is like throwing Duke Nukem in the middle of ancient Egypt, while abhorrent monsters and sci-fi creatures run rampant throughout the land. Players take control of Sam \"Serious\" Stone as he travels back in time to save the planet from an evil alien invasion. While it isn't the most original plot in the world, it works for <em>Serious Sam</em>'<em>s</em> arcade-style gameplay.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/turok-rage-wars-rarest-n64-game/\">How a Turok Game Accidentally Became One of Nintendo 64's Rarest Titles</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/serious-sam-the-first-encounter-2.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Serious Sam: The First Encounter</em> offers an extremely fun FPS experience that will captivate players for hours on end. It is one of those games that is easy to pick up, but hard to put down. Players will take on hordes of blood-thirsty creatures as Sam travels through the Egyptian landscape.</p><p>It's like <em>Doom II</em> had a zombie mode with a sci-fi story. It's a bit strange, but it just adds to the game's charm. Mowing down enemies with a variety of powerful weapons is extremely rewarding and never really loses its appeal. The game's simplicity helped it age better than most other retro first-person shooters.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"http://cbr.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-reveal-trailer/\">Call of Duty: Black Ops Brings the Heat to the Cold War With First Trailer</a></span></p><p><em>Serious Sam: The First Encounter</em> has a cheesy, B-rated movie vibe that helps it stand out from other games in the genre. Sam is constantly spouting off catchphrases as he plows through goofy-looking creatures. Most of the enemies have a low budget horror  look, which definitely plays into the overall tone of the game. One enemy belts out a hilarious scream as they run towards Sam with their arms spread like an eagle taking to the sky. <em>Series Sam: The First Encounter</em> has a great sense of humor.</p><p>Very few classic games hold up as well as <em>Serious Sam: The First Encounter</em>.

Not only would Vision be able to phase through his assaults, but he could also increase his density and make his shots that much harder.</p><p>Black Adam is a very emotional man and not being able to hit Vision is going to make him lose his cool very quickly. An enraged Black Adam would be one that is easy for the Vision to take advantage of, using his solar blasts, keeping Adam from hitting him by phasing, and then hitting him with powerful retaliatory strikes at full density.

That is going to be a big factor in Black Adam's victory. He prefers quick, brutal strikes and she wouldn't be able to survive very long.</p><p>Black Adam loves to fly in and through his opponents and that's pretty much what he'd do to Scarlet Witch.

The two men would go at each other furiously, neither backing down, but as time went on, Thor's heavy blows with Mjolnir would take their toll.

Iron Man's not strong enough and his weapons just don't have the kind of oomph they need to have much of an effect on Black Adam. Unfortunately for Iron Man, the same can't be said for Black Adam.</p><p>Honestly, it's doubtful that Iron Man's armor would even be able to last very long against Black Adam. Black Adam would immediately start tearing away at it and while Iron Man would get some separation using his weapon systems, as the damage mounted they would become less powerful. It wouldn't be long before Black Adam tore the armor to shreds and ended Tony Stark.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Would Lose To: Captain Marvel</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Reputation-Captain-Marvel.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the most powerful members of the Avengers, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-marvel/\">Captain Marvel</a> has the powers and skills to take Black Adam out.

That series received a lot of attention when it showcased the romantic relationship between two of the show's main characters, Willow and Tara. In the episode that Rahne watches, Willow and Tara share a kiss.</p><p>This foreshadowing eventually leads to Rahne and Dani developing feelings for each other. They end up sneaking out of the hospital to lie in a cemetery to watch the storming sky. However, the force field dome surrounding the facility blocks the rain so when the rain strikes, it lights up in beautiful red and purple energy strikes.

It isn't sensationalized and instead serves as a sweet moment between two characters. It's no different than if any another couple shared a romantic kiss, and therefore, the scene is a great example of representation that normalizes LGBTQ folks instead of tokenizing or sensationalizing them.</p><p>In an interview, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-new-mutants-lgbtq-romance-makes-sense/\">Maisie Williams</a>, who plays Rahne, said that she felt the romantic relationship between her character and Dani made a lot of sense. She said the characters shared the telepathic connection in the comics, that equated to love in her mind. She also liked the fact that the characters' relationship was normalized in the movie and was not there for sensationalistic purposes or to get people talking.</p><p>This relationship is a big step forward for Marvel superhero movies.

After Goku’s win at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai, however, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball</a> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changes direction and starts to leave tournament arcs behind. It wouldn’t be until midway through the Majin Buu arc where the Tenkaichi Budokai would finally return as a setting. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-saiyan-saga-battles-best/\">Dragon Ball: The 10 Best Battles In The Saiyan Saga, Ranked</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the first three tournament arcs in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-super\">Dragon Ball</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai never actually finished– interrupted by the conflict with Majin Buu. All the same, the tournament is an exciting time for the series, one where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consciously reflects on where it came from in order to come to terms with what it became. Where the Tenkaichi Budokai respected martial arts as a true event, it’s now a commercialized affair meant to amuse the masses and little else. </span></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Trunks Vs Idasa</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kid-Trunks.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most glaring difference between the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai and the 25th is the Junior Division present in the latter. Introduced in the 24th Tenkaichi Budokai, the Junior Division keeps children away from the adult martial artists– a rule which would have outright prevented Goku &#38; Krillin from entering the Tenkaichi Budokai back in the day. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Junior Division proves to be far too easy for both Trunks and Goten. In Trunks first fight of the match, he knocks his opponent Idasa out without much trouble. Trunks doesn’t so much need to transform, use Ki, or exert any effort. Even the youngest members of the Dragon Team have far eclipsed the children of yore.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Son Goten Vs Ikose</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Goten.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Saiyans younger than Goku was when he entered the 21st Tenkaichi Budokai, Goten and Trunks make short work of the Junior Division. Understandably, not a single young martial artist offers the two boys a decent fight. Idasa’s brother, Ikose, believes he’ll have an easy time against Goten because of his age &#38; demeanor, but Goku’s son puts Ikose in his place with ease. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Catching every single punch Ikose throws at him, Goten knocks his opponent down with a single punch to the fight. Both boys having earned their spots in the finals, the Junior Division ends with a match-up between Goten and Trunks. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Son Goten Vs Trunks</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goten-vs-Trunks.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As strange as it might sound, this might actually be the best fight in the entire tournament. Goten’s match against Trunks is the only battle in the entire 25th Tenkaichi Budokai that actually evokes the spirit of the original three tournaments. Between a mix of flashy choreography and Vegeta trying to trash talk Goku, the Junior Division ends on a high note. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-every-time-vegeta-almost-died/\">Dragon Ball Z: Every Time Vegeta Almost Died (But Didn’t)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also worth pointing out that Goten doesn’t win and there's a surprising amount of tension surrounding the otherwise lighthearted battle. Goten and Trunks are near evenly matched, so it really could have been anyone’s game. Trunks &#38; Goten </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trying </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not to turn Super Saiyan also lends an exciting flair to the arc. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Krillin Vs Punter</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Krillin.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Junior Division out of the way and Trunks now champion, the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai can begin in earnest. The first match also serves as Krillin’s last in the original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Heading up to fight Punter, Krillin brushes off his opponent’s trash talk as little more than gag character fodder. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Krillin’s right to do so as he knocks Punter out with a single punch. While it’s an anticlimactic start to the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, Krillin’s victory is heartwarming. He’s a character who’s been with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since nearly the very beginning. Why doesn’t he deserve a win at the twilight of his life? </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Majunior Vs Shin</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/supreme-kai.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering the 25h Tenkaichi Budokai opens with a gag fight, it’s more than a little surprising that the next immediate match involves Piccolo forfeiting the moment he realizes who his opponent is. In awe of the Kaioshin’s tremendous power, Piccolo refuses to fight back and exits the arena.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaioshin reveals himself and his attendant Kibito to Goku, informing the Saiyan that a warlock named Bobbidi is attempting to revive Majin Buu. Almost as soon as the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai begins, the tournament is derailed by a larger than life part. While there are still more matches to come, the 25th TB is now unrecognizable from its predecessors. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Videl Vs Spopovich</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Videl-Dragon-Ball-Z-header.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easily the most violent fight in the story arc, Videl’s match against Spopovich is hard to stomach. Toriyama doesn’t write romance particularly well, but Gohan and Videl’s relationship has been built up naturally. The 25th Tenkaichi Budokai should have been an opportunity for the two to further bond. Instead, Videl’s nearly beaten to death. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-krillin-piccolo-deaths/\">Dragon Ball: All Of Krillin’s Deaths (&#38; All Of Piccolo’s)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possessed by Bobbidi, Spopovich is far stronger and sturdier than he should be. Even with flight at her side, Videl is unable to fight back adequately against her opponent. Spopovich beats Videl bloody, leaving Gohan enraged and Mr. Satan’s daughter near-death. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Great Saiyaman Vs Kibito</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Super-Saiyan-2-Gohan.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Piccolo’s match against Kaioshin, there’s no real “fight” here. Instead, Gohan’s match with Kibito serves to move the story forward. Still enraged by what happened over Videl and his inability to do anything, Gohan humors Kibito’s request to tap into Super Saiyan 2. Notably, this is the last time Gohan uses the form in the manga. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gohan immediately has his energy drained by Spopovich and Yamu, but this is all part of the plan. With the two possessed warriors flying off towards Bobbidi, the Dragon Team can follow them to try to prevent Majin Buu’s revival. With most of the main cast leaving the tournament right away, the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai scrambles to course correct. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Battle Royale</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Android-18-Chokes-Mr.-Satan.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Gohan’s match with Kibito, the only martial artists left in the tournament are Android 18, Mr. Satan, Jewell, Killa, and Goten &#38; Trunks (under the guise of Mighty Mask.)

As <em>The Legend of Korra</em> continues in the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/legend-of-korra-redeems-kuvira/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comics</a>, fans deserve to see the Equalist plotline picked back up, and the Lieutenant deserves to lead the charge.</p><p><em>The Legend of Korra</em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-everything-need-know-legend-korra-season-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Season 1</a> made it clear that there were rising anti-bender sentiments throughout the culturally diverse metropolis of Republic City. While many benders saw it as a haven for unity and a celebration of what the Four Nations could accomplish together, much of the nonbending populace that made up the city's majority held a festering resentment that they were disempowered and disenfranchised. Governed by the United Republic Council that included in its membership a bender representative of every nation, at the time there was no voice to represent the citizens who could not wield the elements to their whim.</p><p>That's where Amon stepped forward, rousing the rabble that became known as the Equalist Movement. Promising a new day forged from an anti-bending revolution, Amon told an all-too familiar story of how his own family were struck down by firebenders. Sharing much the same tragedy, the industrialist Hiroshi Sato pioneered technological innovations that empowered nonbenders with weapons to contend at last with their bending oppressors. And overlooking all of it from Amon's side was his trusted henchman-in-charge, the Lieutenant.</p><p>RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The Avatar: The Last Airbender's Unaired Pilot Is Now Streaming on Twitch\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-unaired-pilot-streaming-twitch/\">The Avatar: The Last Airbender's Unaired Pilot Is Now Streaming On Twitch</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lieutenant-Equalist-Korra.png\"/></figure><p>Of course, the revolution Amon promised did not really end up panning out. The movement died at its head with the discovery that Amon was in truth a bender himself, a sinister bloodbender lying about his past and manipulating the sentiments of the city for his own gain. With Amon defeated, Hiroshi Sato imprisoned and political advancements made in the form of the democratically elected President Raiko, it seemed that the world of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-kyoshi-rangi-vs-korrasami-best-otp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Avatar</em></a> heard the last of the Equalists and the Lieutenant along with them.</p><p>But... why? While a nonbending political leader free from tethers to any of the Four Nations was certainly an advancement, it goes without saying that the most radical political factions could hardly be appeased with the status quo so barely changed. If anything, the revelation that Amon was actually a bender taking advantage of them should have stoked the flames of revolution all the more. In the years that followed Amon's attempted coup the sudden proliferation of airbenders, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-best-moments-legend-korra-season-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">near-anarchic collapse of government at the hands of the Red Lotus</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-the-legend-of-korra-season-4s-best-moments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dictatorial regime headed by Kuvira</a> should only further fuel the fires of nonbenders' outrage.</p><p>Nobody had more reason to feel outraged or betrayed than the Lieutenant, who saw Amon bloodbend first hand shortly before the revolutionary's public reveal. Although little story space went to fleshing out the Lieutenant as a character (afterall we still do not even know his real name) his look of betrayal and sense of defeat upon seeing Amon bloodbend was one of the most moving parts of the show's first season. He turned his taser tonfas on his former leader and Amon whipped him away like he was nothing, something that happened all too often to the poor man.</p><p>In almost every single fight, the Lieutenant was involved in he proved to be a punching bag. Though he could capably dispose of the metalbending officers, he frequently saw anticlimactic defeat at the hands of Team Avatar. In the span of the one day Jinora whipped him away from a fight only for him to return and have Naga immediately bat him aside. All of that loss and all of that pity could be worth it if the Lieutenant returned. That wasn't his story, that was just the beginning to his arc -- and fans deserve to see him become the General.</p><p>RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Avatar: What's the Strongest Waterbending Feat in the Series?\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-strongest-waterbending-feat/\">Avatar: What's The Strongest Waterbending Feat In The Series?</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lieutenant-Equalist-Korra-2.png\"/></figure><p>Though the story of the Equalists saw a brief return in the barely-remembered <em>The Legend of Korra</em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/high-score-missile-command-mit-students/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video game</a> (led by a bender named Hundun), their fate still remains unresolved alongside that of the Lieutenant. The comics already proved their commitment to continuing many plotlines from the show such as the acclimation of the human world to its new relationship with the Spirit World and the fallout of Kuvira's attempted domination of the entire Earth Kingdom. The best route the comics could take would be to return to the story of the Equalists and give the subplot a proper sendoff.</p><p>Finally getting backstory on the Lieutenant and the Equalists at large would be rewarding all its own. Many questions surrounding Amon remain unsatisfactorily resolved, and brief flashbacks to the origins of the political movement could also take the time to flesh out the story of Amon and the gap in his life between leaving the North Pole and arriving in Republic City as a new man. Who exactly was the Lieutenant, and what was his relationship to the masked figure he would one day come to feel so betrayed by?</p><p>Throughout all of <em>Avatar,</em> there has yet to be a truly formidable nonbending antagonist. Watching the Lieutenant rise to the occasional to claim that title would not only be rewarding after his repeated failures and longstanding absence, it would serve as the most satisfactory way to tie up a loose thread from the series left dangling for years. The next upcoming <em>Avatar</em> comic titles take place in the original series' timeline, but when the <em>The Legend of Korra</em> comics return and follow up on <em>Ruins of the Empire, </em>a return to Equality is without a doubt the best place to go.</p><p>KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Avatar: Toph Vs Korra: Who Wins This Bender Fight?\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-toph-vs-korra/\">Avatar: Toph Vs Korra: Who Wins This Bender Fight?</a></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:05 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amon-legend-of-korra.jpg","linkMd5":"56d60d8d653964458ce3d0ad87698173","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn33@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-00-742_4eb3878874c2e1e5.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":57692,"destBytes":57692,"author":"Brenton Stewart","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amon-legend-of-korra.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn33@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-00-742_4eb3878874c2e1e5.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lieutenant-Equalist-Korra.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn29@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-05-966_ad8359510e1eeebc.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lieutenant-Equalist-Korra-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn25@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-427_ef14920da3fe8ae2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700504},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Falcon and Winter Soldier Shirt Offers a Glimpse of the Heroes' New Costumes","link":"https://www.cbr.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-shirt-new-costumes/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Though <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/falcon-and-winter-soldier/\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a></em> has yet to receive an official release date, new merchandise for the series provides a first look at the new costumes Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) will wear during the series.

Despite a lot of moments paying homage to that classic storyline, there are significant differences between the two tales, including the following.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-New-Mutants-Header.jpg\"/></figure><p>The entire setting and overall plot of the movie is different from the comic books. In <em>The New Mutants</em>, the five teenagers are held captive in an abandoned hospital and cared for by one solitary doctor who says she is trying to help them control their powers, but this backfires. While Dani sleeps, her powers manifest and summon the Demon Bear. In the comics, this event takes place while the New Mutants are at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, where they are not prisoners. Where the comics feature the Demon Bear as the main threat, the film and its setting present other antagonistic forces, from the doctor to the asylum itself.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-new-mutants-sunspot-actor-usavengers/\">The New Mutants' Sunspot Actor Wants to Bring the USAvengers to the Big Screen</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/new-mutants-trailer-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>The powers of the New Mutants in the movie are nearly the same as those in the comic books; however, there is one significant difference. In the comics, when the \"Demon Bear Saga\" begins, the New Mutants are already heroes who've trained with their powers extensively. In the movie, the New Mutants don't know how to use their powers. For instance, Cannonball struggles with his confidence, and Roberto has no idea what he is capable of, so they are far from the established heroes seen in the comics. In the movie, they are simply kids who want to be left alone; however, they are forced to fight.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/magma.jpg\"/></figure><p>There is one member of the New Mutants that is missing in the movie. Magma is one of the original members of the team, and while she doesn't last as long as the others, she is still a massive part of the \"Demon Bear Saga\" in the comics. However, the director, Josh Boone, has a reason behind this decision. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/why-new-mutants-doesnt-include-magma/\">Magma is from an ancient Roman world</a> that exists in the Amazon; however, this has yet to be established in the film universe, and Boone wasn't going to go there in the movie.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The New Mutants' REAL Enemy Connects Directly to Logan\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/new-mutants-connects-logan-essex-corporation/\">The New Mutants' REAL Enemy Connects Directly To Logan</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lockheed-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Lockheed is mostly known as a purple alien dragon that serves as Kitty Pryde's sidekick in the comic books. However, in the \"Demon Bear Saga,\" he is at Illyana's side. Meanwhile, in the movie, he is a hand-puppet that Illyana carries as a mental defense mechanism. He does come to life when she goes to Limbo, but he is only real when she brings him out for the final battle of the movie.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/new-mutants-limbo-header.jpeg\"/></figure><p>The most significant change in <em>The New Mutants</em> movie compared to the comics comes with the origin of Illyana Rasputin. In the comics, she is Colossus' sister. When she was six, she was kidnapped and whisked away to the realm of Limbo, where she remained for seven years. In the X-Men's world, she returns only seconds later; however, she is 13, the Queen of Limbo and skilled in black magic. In the movie, Illyana is a young girl abused by older men who take advantage of her powers, so she creates Limbo, where she teleports herself to hide from the pain. She is there for so long that Limbo eventually becomes real, but it is not the pre-existing dimension from the comic books.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The New Mutants Changes Lockheed - and Makes Him Even Better\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/new-mutants-changes-lockheed-origin/\">The New Mutants Changes Lockheed - And Makes Him Even Better</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dani-Demon-Bear.jpg\"/></figure><p>In <em>The New Mutants</em> movie, Dani Moonstar is a new prisoner/patient for Dr. Cecilia Reyes. She has no idea what her mutant powers are, and she is alone after her family and neighbors die in a mysterious attack. In the comics, she is already a fully-fledged member of the New Mutants team. There are also differences in the role she plays. In the movie, Dr. Reyes tries to kill her to stop the Demon Bear attacks, and Dani is out of action due to this. In the comics, Dani takes the fight to the Demon Bear and ends up beaten and almost dead, which is how she is taken out of action in the books.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-New-Mutants-Demon-Bear-Featured.jpg\"/></figure><p>The \"Demon Bear Saga\" from the comic books and <em>The New Mutants</em> movie have the same overall message when it comes to the final battle. In the comics, Rahne reaches into Dani's mind and learns that the team has to learn to work together to cut out the heart of the Demon Bear. The movie also plays on the idea of trusting each other and working as a team to survive; however, the end of the battle is drastically different. In the film, it is Dani who stands up to the bear and proves its scare tactics don't affect her. Meanwhile, Dani doesn't return for the final battle in the comics, and the ending is more finite.

Almost every Superman game released has been seen as either mediocre or a broken, unplayable mess.</p><p>This isn't the case for every superhero, though. There are plenty of video games that adapt comic book superheroes faithfully, with mechanics and gameplay features that are a perfect fit for Superman and his many abilities. If developers can learn from these games, perhaps the next piece of Superman software won't be another budget mobile game, but a triple-A masterpiece akin to these games.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-trailer-evil-superman/\">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Unleashes An Evil Superman in First Trailer</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Arkham-Knight-Bat-Family.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Caped Crusader's adventures in developer Rocksteady's ground-breaking <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman-arkham\">Arkham</a> series are collectively the first and most obvious source of inspiration in most people's minds. The <em>Arkham</em> titles are renowned for their tight controls, something that wouldn't be too difficult to apply to a Superman game. Superman's super-senses already make a fair equivalent to Batman's Detective Mode, and Superman's abilities can easily replace most of Batman's essential gadgets.</p><p>Similar to Batman's Predator challenges, Superman may be challenged by opponents with weapons that can legitimately hurt him. This could force players to use Superman's powers in more creative ways, such as using heat vision to activate sprinklers, smashing walls or floors to catch enemies by surprise, or applying freeze-breath to make floors slippery. There's also <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-villains-underrated-stay-away-comparison/\">Superman's rogues' gallery</a>, which is one of the largest and most diverse in comic books. Having a series of Most Wanted side missions like <em>Arkham Knight</em>'s would be a great way to not only implement Superman's deadliest nemeses but even introduce relatively obscure villains like Volcana or the Atomic Skull.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/injustice-3-release-date-plot-news/\">Injustice 3: Release Date, Plot and News to Know</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PS4-Spider-Man-Classic-Suit.jpg\"/></figure><p>No matter how faithful a comic book-based video game is to its characters, most developers favor fun over realism, and Insomniac's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man-ps4/\"><em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em></a><em> </em>is no exception. Spider-Man tends to use a hefty amount of force against his foes that should reasonably kill a normal person, from dropping huge metal scaffolds to brutally an opponent's heads to the ground. Having Superman punch mobsters or throw them against walls might look brutal, but it's part of the over-the-top fun of a comic book game.</p><p>However, <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em> also emphasizes the \"hero\" part of \"superhero.\" The friendly neighborhood wallcrawler is a man of the people, with side ventures ranging from saving citizens involved in crashes to helping a friend find his pet pigeons. Helping people should be a fundamental aspect of a Superman game, perhaps even more so than with Spider-Man. The air combat in <em>Marvel's Spider-Man </em>is surprisingly fluid and graceful as well, resulting in encounters with the likes of Sable Air Troopers or Vulture being fun rather than tedious. This application of aerial battles can be easily adjusted into a Superman game by having more flying enemies for Clark to fight, such as Brainiac drones or robots made by the Toyman.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-miles-morales-ps5-gamers-will-feel-spidey-sense/\">Gamers Will Actually Feel and Use Miles Morales' Spider-Sense Via the PlayStation 5 Controller</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hulk-ultimate-destruction-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>The hardest part of any Superman game has been justifying his health bar. That hasn't been a problem for the Incredible Hulk, who's probably one of the few A-list Marvel heroes <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/video-the-hulks-incredible-power-explained/\">who can almost match Superman in both strength and toughness</a>. 2005's <em>The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction </em>by Radical Entertainment had the primary goal of allowing players to do what the Hulk does best: smash everything. The Hulk is not only utterly unstoppable, but the game's combat loop revolves around utilizing the Hulk's strength in varied and creative ways, from crafting giant brass knuckles out of cars to forging shields by flattening buses.</p><p>Most of these destruction tactics turn out to not only be fun, but necessary. For all his power in <em>Ultimate Destruction, </em>the Hulk is not actually invincible. The game features a traditional health bar gauging the Jade Giant's remaining strength but implemented in a way that does not take away from Hulk's character. Regular soldiers with guns do little to nothing to the player, but getting bombarded with a dozen homing missiles or thrown around by military Hulkbuster builds up a lot of damage over time. Giving Superman a health bar doesn't have to be something that diminishes the experience outright, but can instead be an excuse for developers to throw as much as they can at the player, challenging them to overcome obstacles by any means possible.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hulk-maestro-marvel-universe/\">Hulk: How Maestro EXPLODED Into The Marvel Universe</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/infamous-cole-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>One of the more recognizable superhero games without a Marvel or DC character, Sony Entertainment and Sucker Punch's <em>InFAMOUS </em>series is a surprisingly well-balanced package. Cole MacGrath's versatile electricity powers allow him a variety of impressive abilities, like gliding long distances, firing electric bolts at enemies and using his hands as defibrillators to rescue injured civilians. The story is, appropriately, like something out of a comic book: Cole is one of many \"Conduits\" that received superhuman powers from a mysterious explosion and takes it upon himself to fight crime and other Conduits in Empire City.</p><p>Playing in the sandbox of Empire City showcases the applications of Superman's abilities in a potential game, but <em>InFAMOUS </em>has an interesting quirk that affects both story and gameplay: a \"Karma\" morality system. Whether you play Cole as heroic or villainous grants him different powers, i.e., Good Karma allows for an explosive burst, Bad Karma allows for continuous electric steam. Cole's Karma even affects the ending of the story. Thanks to concepts like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-kryptonite-types-effects/\">red kryptonite</a>, a morality system such as this can exist in a Superman video game, justifying a destructive and evil playthrough.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/call-of-duty-pulled-fortnite-reveal/\">Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War Pulled a Fortnite</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/superman-returns.jpg\"/></figure><p>It might seem strange to include Electronic Arts' <em>Superman Returns, </em>but this movie tie-in<i> </i>can be seen as both a blueprint for an amazing Superman game and as a cautionary tale. Despite everything going against it, <em>Superman Returns: The Video Game </em>has a lot of exciting ideas with untapped potential, from its then-beautiful flight mechanics to racing Mr. Mxyzptlk in trippy challenges or suddenly turning into Bizarro to \"save\" Metropolis with your fire breath. Perhaps most intriguing was the decision to not give Superman a health bar, but to instead give one to Metropolis. Not only is Superman unable to die, but protecting the city is player's number one priority, making them feel the burden that the Last Son of Krypton must carry.</p><p>As great as most of these ideas were, the problem was the execution. Sluggish controls, ugly graphics, an incohesive story were the tip of the iceberg. Giving Metropolis a health bar instead of Superman meant that defeating enemies could be counter-intuitive, as you could easily miss and damage the city yourself. With a frankly absurd amount of repetitive enemies, a terrible camera and a tornado serving as the final boss, the game was clearly rushed to completion. <em>Superman Returns</em> is yet another lesson on terrible Superman games that future developers can learn from.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/brainiac-tired-trope-dc-video-games/\">Brainiac Is Becoming A Tired Trope of DC Video Games </a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:15:40 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rumor-superman-game-incoming-from-batman-arkham-creators.jpg","linkMd5":"429cc9a4751137e645e20a7a0d04c797","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":217549,"destBytes":192916,"author":"Vladimir Olivares","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rumor-superman-game-incoming-from-batman-arkham-creators.jpg":null,"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Arkham-Knight-Bat-Family.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-11-529_b7fad3545194eda8.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PS4-Spider-Man-Classic-Suit.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-12-033_25b893e14de52389.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hulk-ultimate-destruction-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-14-967_fd30dbf166343d39.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/infamous-cole-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-18-317_9720dcb7979834e1.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/superman-returns.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn86@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-13-283_bf9327c5ad914818.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Fullmetal Alchemist: 5 Ways Izumi Is A Great Teacher (& 5 Ways She Isn't)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-izumi-ways-great-bad-teacher/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-5-Ways-Izumi-Is-A-Great-Teacher-5-Ways-She-Isnt-featured-image-2.jpg\"/></figure><p>Izumi Curtis is one of the most strong-willed and intimidating female characters in all of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/fullmetal-alchemist/\">Fullmetal Alchemist</a>, </em>rivaled only <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-olivier-armstrong-cosplay/\">by Olivier Armstrong</a>.

However, that doesn't mean that she is the perfect candidate to be teaching kids, and has points that make it arguably difficult to claim her as a great role model through-and-through.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Great: Healthy Beliefs</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Smiling.jpg' /></figure><p>Although <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-izumi-curtis-olivier-armstrong-best-girl/\">Izumi is an incredibly capable alchemist</a>, she also still believes in the value of doing things with one's own hands, if that's still a possible option. It's unsure if this is something that she's always staunchly believed, or if this is a belief system that she developed after her rebound with human transmutation.</p><p>A small child from the village comes to Izumi, asking if she can fix his broken toy \"with alchemy.\" Instead, she takes it in her hands and fixes it the traditional way instead, instilling how important it is to not rely solely on alchemy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Not So Great: Overly Violent</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/izumi-curtis-fma.jpg' /></figure><p>It's one thing to harshly reprimand one's students when they do something wrong, but Izumi takes this to an unhealthy extreme a lot of the time. Sure, in the early 2000s, female characters being overly violently aggressive - especially towards the protagonist when they do something foolish - was a trope, but that doesn't mean it's one that makes for a good character trait.</p><p>Whenever Izumi rushes in to save Ed during his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-greed-cosplays/\">fight with Greed</a>, she completely pummels him in the process. She is seen doing similar acts throughout the series that make her come off as physically abusive at worst.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Great: Adventurous Spirit</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-In-The-Briggs-Mountains.jpg' /></figure><p>Izumi is incredibly fearless and self-reliant, able to survive in the harsh Briggs Mountains by herself for an entire month, and she has an affinity for traveling. Until she met her husband and decided on wanting a child of her own, Izumi was an unbound free spirit who traveled wherever her adventurous spirit would take her.</p><p>This is a great trait that she actually seemed to have passed on to Edward, given how fearless and excited he becomes about exploring new places during his own travels.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Not So Great: Death Threats</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Curtis-Death-Glare.jpg' /></figure><p>Going along with her more violent physical tendencies, Izumi has an incredibly bad habit of threatening - and actually at times endangering - the lives of her students, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-edward-right-wrong/\">particularly Edward.</a> After learning that they had committed a taboo after studying under her, she rejects them as students and chucks a knife <em>directly </em>at Ed's head when he tries to re-enter. They're even warned by her husband not to let her kill them, which isn't stated in a joking manner.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-anime-live-action-comparison-better-worse/\">Fullmetal Alchemist: 5 Things The Live-Action Movie Got Right (&#38; 5 The Anime Did Better)</a></span></p><p>Ed and Al are also seen essentially having a panic attack upon thinking about visiting Izumi for the first time since the accident, fearing her reaction. Winry's remark that they should \"find a new teacher\" is played off as a joke, but it's a genuine sentiment given some of Izumi's reactions.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Great: Emotional Support</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Hugging-The-Elrics.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-facts-alphonse-elric/\">The Elric brothers</a> have a tendency to shove many of their emotions aside, especially when it concerns the taboo that the two committed. It makes sense, then, that Izumi would naturally be the one who could empathize with them the strongest, as she also was driven to commit the same act to try to revive a dear loved one.</p><p>They tried to insist that they were fine in front of her, but she relents, stating that it's okay for them to hurt. They break down in her strong familial embrace, and it's an incredibly heartwarming moment that really shows their bond.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Not So Great: No Contact</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Hands-On-Hips.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-edward-best-worst-things/\">Whenever Ed</a> and Al lament over the thought of having to give a visit to their old teacher, it's mostly due to the fact that she still doesn't know they committed the taboo. Considering Ed had been a state alchemist for several years at this point, it does beg the question of why Izumi didn't try to contact them.</p><p>While Amestris still lacks modern-day instant methods of communication, it isn't like she couldn't have tried sending out letters. In fact, when they do show up, at first she seems much more concerned with pummeling them than asking how they'd been holding up.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Great: Away From Taboo</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Curtis-Glaring.jpg' /></figure><p>Because Izumi had already made the mistake of committing the ultimate taboo and suffering the harsh consequences, she understood full well what Edward was thinking when he first mentions it around her. She immediately snaps, stating that it's forbidden, and something that no self-respecting alchemist should dare to try.</p><p>It's clear that there is a personal reason why she felt so strongly against it, though it's not explicitly explained until much later. Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-best-boy-edward-is-best-boy-roy-mustang/\">Edward is smart enough</a> to hide it after this so she can't stop him.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Not So Great: Overly Harsh Training</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-And-Young-Elrics.jpg' /></figure><p>Izumi is no stranger to strict teaching, as she was told to survive a month in the harsh Briggs Mountains by herself. This seems to be something that stuck with her, as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-things-edward/\">she later dumps Ed</a> and Al on an uninhabited island and tells them they must survive for an entire month, or she'd refuse to train them.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fullmetal-alchemist-characters-zodiac-signs/\">Which Fullmetal Alchemist Character Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?</a></span></p><p>It's one thing to put students through the same experiences that molded their teacher, but Izumi was eighteen when she did this, and the Elrics were only just hitting their double-digits. They did almost die, both from enemy attacks and starvation, so no matter what Izumi's intentions were, it makes her look like a less-than-exceptional teacher.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Great: Helps Those Who Can't</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Izumi-Smiling-Under-An-Umbrella.jpg' /></figure><p>Izumi has a tendency to help others who have the drive, but perhaps not the means, to help themselves. This is clearly seen with how she agrees to take on the Elric brothers, as she outright refused several times before it was stated that they didn't have any parents. Izumi's empathy is reflected clearly in her eyes, and she then states that she doesn't have any other choice, since she'd feel too guilty abandoning two orphaned kids.</p><p>Izumi's kind nature is also shown in how she repairs the toys of neighborhood kids, while also instilling into them that it's better if they simply aren't carelessly rough enough to break them in the first place.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Not So Great: Wrathful Temper</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/izumi-fullmetal-angry.jpg' /></figure><p>Although Izumi is the most understanding when it comes to the Elrics' situation and the burden of having committed a taboo, she's also the most outwardly violent and furious towards them about it.</p><p>This instilled a debilitating fear into Ed and Al so deep that they genuinely considered running away instead of facing her once more, and they didn't even flinch when a <em>gun </em>was pointed directly at them. It doesn't take much to send Izumi into a blind, violent rage, which just doesn't help someone who's supposed to be a teacher.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a

It's created by the same genius that made the widely beloved<em> Soul Eater</em>, Atsushi Ōkubo. Thankfully, it is also the same sort of insanely-stylized, action-packed, and incredibly unique sort of tale than Okubo is known for. And now, with the recent anime adaption, it seems like we all agree! <em>Fire Force</em> is a story about Firefighters that fight fire...with fire?</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: 5<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-vs-soul-eater-comparison/\"> Reasons Why Fire Force is an Improvement on Soul Eater (&#38; 5 Why Soul Eater is Classic)</a></span></p><p>Basically, Spontaneous Human Combustion is real in this setting and firefighters are its enemy.

He took on <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-shinra-facts-only-true-fans-know/\">Shinra</a> in close-quarters combat, and it seemed like nothing Shinra could throw at him would faze him.</p><p>The secret: Charon is a second-generation pyrokinetic, and he can absorb his enemy's firepower and throw it right back at them. It'll take more than fire kicks to take this behemoth of a warrior down.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">14 </span>Haumea, The Cackling Troublemaker</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-haumea.jpg' /></figure><p>Here is another white-clad cult member who has definitely made her presence known by now. This woman hides her eyes not with a cloth, but with a crown, suggesting a great deal of authority in the cult. At least, she acts like it, being a competent field commander for her fellows.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-best-ignition-powers/\">Fire Force: The 10 Best Ignition Powers</a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-episode-4-haumea-most-threatening-villain/\">Haumea</a> is a wicked schemer who loves to stir things up, and every time the heroes think they've got her cornered, she blasts off and taunts them over her shoulder. Just what is she plotting next?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">13 </span>Arthur Boyle: One Trick Knight...King</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Arthur-Boyle-Characters-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>At first, this fire soldier was more of a gag character than a serious fighter, but that's starting to change. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-arthur-boyle-facts-history-trivia/\">Arthur Boyle</a>, the so-called \"Knight King\" is a third-gen pyrokinetic who uses fiery plasma rather like a lightsaber blade, making him really stand out in all the right ways. This chivalric buffoon trained with Shinra at the academy and is assigned to Brigade 8 as well.</p><p>He's incredible in a fight as long as he's fully immersed in his knightly persona. For now, Arthur plays second fiddle to most of his Company 8 allies, but he's catching up quickly, and he may be a real kingly knight on the battlefield someday.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">12 </span>Shinra Kasakabe: A Refreshing Shonen Protagonist</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Shinra-Character-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>Shinra on the other hand, is a bit less trope-y then the standard run-of-the-mill shonen protagonist, both mentally and appearance-wise. Most protags tend to act how they look, but Shinra is the exact opposite. The more demonic he looks in the moment, the more the readers can be sure he's actually incredibly conflicted.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-shinmon-benimaru-comparison-characters/\">Fire Force: 5 Anime Characters More Powerful Than Shinmon Benimaru (&#38; 5 Weaker)</a></span></p><p>Shinra Kusakabe can be hard-headed, but most of the time he's respectful, realistic, and a quick-thinker. Which are three traits that are not easily found in shonen main characters. But, at the end of the day, he's still the poster boy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">11 </span>Iris</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Iris-fire-force.jpg' /></figure><p>This young lady is a fully trained sister, or nun, who never fails to pray for the souls of fallen Infernals when the fire soldiers destroy them. She's not a fighter; she's a healer for the soul, and she can help escort the victims of spontaneous combustion to the great fire of heaven <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-different-interpret-of-latom/\">with a prayer</a>.</p><p>That's an important job, and Iris does it with crisp professionalism. On a personal level, she is a charming and upbeat friend for everyone at Company 8, and she gets a little flustered when she's with the girls, but she's in good company all the same.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Sho Kusakabe</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sho-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>This is Shinra's little brother, who was once thought lost in a house fire. But the white-clad cult made sure that he survived, and they spirited him off and began training him. Now the Kusakabe brothers are on opposite sides of the fight for humanity's future.</p><p>Sho is stoic and stern, but he does have a fascinating ability: to cool down the entire universe and thus freeze time, except for himself. This makes him a deadly swordsman, and time will tell if he begins to feel guilt about his role in all this and whether he'll long to return to Shinra's side.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Vulcan Joseph: The Mechanic Obsessed With Animals</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Vulcan-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>Vulcan is the future engineer of Fire Brigade 8 and a total animal lover. The setting of <em>Fire Force</em> takes place long after a fire-based global calamity. And Vulcan's family has passed down the knowledge of all the species of animals that were lost in said calamity. As such, all of Vulcans inventions are animal-based, and an absolute delight to see.</p><p>Vulcan himself is a rather standard eccentric fellow, with a gift for invention. But, what propels him above the rest is the strength of his personal design, the designs of his animal contraptions, and the charm of his creations.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Princess Hibana</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Firefighters-Ranked-princess-hibana-3.jpg' /></figure><p>She's not literally a princess, but Princess Hibana sure acts like it, often putting her foot on bowing subordinates to keep them in their place. She was once a nun in training and knows Iris on a personal level, and she has a mind of scientific curiosity.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-my-hero-academia-characters-could-couldnt-defeat-shinra/\">Fire Force: 5 My Hero Academia Characters Shinra Could Defeat (&#38; 5 Who'd Pulverize Him)</a></span></p><p>All this drives her to ruthlessly study Infernals, and she will use her fearsome firepower on anyone who opposes her, even Shinra. But she's cooled down a bit, so to speak, and is now a loyal and rather charming ally.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Benimaru Shinmon: The Not-So-Standard Lone Wolf Powerhouse</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Benimaru.jpg' /></figure><p>On the surface, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-amazing-cosplays-anime/\">Benimaru Shinmon</a> seems to be another example of the \"sulking bad boy\" trope. A character that seems apathetic and rude, but is too powerful to teach a lesson to. But, the more time he spends on the screen, the more readers see that Shinmon is actually quite a relatable character.</p><p>Sure, he's a powerhouse Ignition-user with a weird right pupil, but he's also a capable leader who has quite the dedicated following. Plus, he's self-sacrificing, unapologetically kind, and weirdly confrontational. All this adds up to making Benimaru one of the characters on Shinra's side so far. Plus, it's fun to see him vaulting around on those poles.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Ogun Montgomery: Just An Overall Great Guy</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ogun.jpg' /></figure><p>Ogun knew Shinra and Arthur from their academy days, and he acted as a sort of peacemaker between them all. He scoffed at the idea of knights, since Arthur is actually a firefighter, but he does enjoy his rivalry-based friendship with Arthur.</p><p>Now that season 2 has begun, Ogun is a part of the squad, and he has proven an outgoing and reliable friend during the trip to China. It's likely that he'll have a few glorious moments to his name before the season is over.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Viktor Licht: The Wackjob Scientist</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-viktor.jpg' /></figure><p>Around the same time that Vulcan joins the crew, Viktor Licht shows up. He's the scientist or researcher of Brigade 8 who obviously has an ulterior objective. But, despite lying to everyone, Viktor is weirdly charming? He's not an Ignition user and isn't really even a firefighter, but he shows up to all the battles regardless.</p><p>He's constantly around to explain complicated fire-based science to the readers, and even works as a tertiary comedic relief. Licht is just an all-around positive addition to the dynamic the Brigade 8 eventually falls into and is completely dedicated to solving the human combustion mystery.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Maki Oze: The Kick-Butt Female Mage</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Maki-Fire-Force-Character.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-maki-oze-facts-trivia-history/\">Maki Oze</a> is one of the best characters in <em>Fire Force</em>, hands down. First of all, she's a female character that actively contributes to the fights in a Shonen series, something that doesn't happen as often as it should. Secondly, she's muscular and has served in the military, another two things that again, isn't seen in female characters often.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-season-two-speculation-best-worst/\">Fire Force: 5 Things the Second Season Should Have (&#38; 5 That it Shouldn't)</a></span></p><p>And lastly, she's unique! Maki isn't the serious veteran stereotype one would think she is. She's funny, vulnerable, and uses her powers to create cute little characters! Basically, the \"Mage\" of Brigade 8 is highly adept at bringing readers under the spell of her charms.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Karim Fulham: Apathetic Trope Done Well</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Firefighters-Ranked-karim-flam-6.jpg' /></figure><p>In <em>Fire Force</em>, the firefighters are split off into different fire \"Brigades\" 1 through 8. And the one that's closest to the Church of the Holy Sun is Brigade 1. These are apparently the most pious and devout of the Fire Brigade members, but Karim seems to defy expectations. On the surface, he's just an apathetic \"soldier,\" but the more time he spends around Shinra and crew, the easier it is to see how likable he is.</p><p>Karim is conversationally repetitive, apathetic, and sarcastic. Which isn't the best defense of his charms. But, he's also a hero, reliable, and is always there to help. Plus his Ignition ability is so interesting that fans are always clamoring to see more of him.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Akitaru Obi: The Buffest Firefighter In History</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Obi-Character-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>Akitaru Obi is absolutely, without a doubt, 100%, the model firefighter. A man who started as a normal firefighter, and worked his way up to captain of Brigade 8. Obi is tenacious, kind-hearted, and a total musclehead. If Obi isn't working out, then something must be wrong. But honestly, his obsession with fitness ties back to a devout need to help others.</p><p>Akitaru is a great leader, a kind captain, and is honestly quite funny. People tend to find these sort of \"good guy\" leaders boring, but Obi is an exception to the rule. Plus he contributes to fights despite literally having no fire-based abilities.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Takehisa Hinawa: The Complete Package</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lieutenant-Character-Fire-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>And finally, it's time to talk about Takehisa. It was a rough time trying to figure out who should rank first, Takehisa or Obi. But, at the end of the day, Takehisa Hinawa is a more diverse character. Hinawa is lieutenant of the 8th directly under Akitaru, but he acts more like the leader himself sometimes.</p><p>Takehisa is dryly amusing to watch. His thousand-yard stare is somehow both intimidating and charming, his lack of social awareness makes for some great punchlines, and his obsession with ruining Maki's fire-creations is the sort of humor that keeps him finely balanced as a <em>Fire Force </em>character. And for combat, he uses second-gen pyrokinetic to actually use magic bullets. Now that's cool.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-anime-hilarious-memes/\">10 Fire Force Memes That Are Too Hilarious For Words</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 22:00:12 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fire-Force-Ranked-header.jpg","linkMd5":"07e161d32f328cafab771083a3fa600b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn6@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-03-306_999d412fcf4441c5.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":89552,"destBytes":89552,"author":"Jacob Buchalter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fire-Force-Ranked-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn6@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-03-306_999d412fcf4441c5.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/charon-fire-force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn5@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-08-183_9b166996b93dc920.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-haumea.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn9@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-13-468_85f069beba421305.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Arthur-Boyle-Characters-Fire-Force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn61@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-140_77ad5ad52a1a2ae0.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Shinra-Character-Fire-Force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn93@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-05-915_fd9a1f7dec5dfb8f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Iris-fire-force.jpg":null,"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sho-Fire-Force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-15-980_ab1d1f0a1feace6c.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Vulcan-Fire-Force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-07-190_a9386f8e0d54b652.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Firefighters-Ranked-princess-hibana-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn21@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-07-745_4a1ebc56d349485f.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Benimaru.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn37@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-12-592_c0b80fe7080201e8.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ogun.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-06-903_44a3a76956baf338.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-viktor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn63@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-10-253_5928a9da08bd2b68.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Maki-Fire-Force-Character.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-13-672_545933fdbf12cbd8.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Firefighters-Ranked-karim-flam-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-17-489_74524cda6ffda67b.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Obi-Character-Fire-Force.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-17-542_580d340544febe89.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lieutenant-Character-Fire-Force.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700510},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Netflix Launches 'Watch Free' Site With Bird Box, Episodes of Stranger Things and More","link":"https://www.cbr.com/netflix-watch-free-site-bird-box-stranger-things/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Netflix.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/netflix/\">Netflix</a> is offering access to some of its original movies and series for free -- and viewers will not need an account to watch.</p><p>To attract new subscribers, Netflix launched a “<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watch Free</a>” portal that is available to anyone with internet access.

But perhaps not even she can handle the monumental challenge placed before her.

Instead, she fought the countless chefs who failed those challenges, all by herself, and exhausted herself in the process. She won't stand for this much longer, so she marched right into the central castle on the BLUE tournament's grounds and demanded to see the Bookmaster. Before long, she stood before the head judge herself, and defiantly notes that she has survived all of the Bookmaster's attempts to eliminate her from the BLUE. The Bookmaster can't see why Erina should complain, since she has indeed won all her matches, and then the bamboo blinds are raised to reveal the kimono-clad woman sitting there, a fan in hand. This is Mana Nakiri, Erina's very own <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-key-events-vol-94/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mother</a>.</p><p>Mana is on a quest, but so far, she feels nothing but despair about her progress. She, too, possesses the God Tongue, but she has maxed out her culinary journey. She has sampled and tasted every flavor and cooking style the world has to offer, and she is desperate to taste something gourmet that the world has not yet seen. It's the classic \"I'm too strong for my own good\" paradigm that sometimes appears in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/japan-top-shonen-jump-protagonists-international-fandom-divide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shonen anime</a>, and coldly, Mana doubts that her daughter can give her what she wants. She has already given up on Erina, and instead believes that Asahi Saiba can fulfill her dream to taste that new gourmet dish. Erina feels differently. She stands proud and declares that she shall win this tournament, and prove her mother wrong, whatever it takes.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/food-wars-season-5-episode-7-saiba-faces-tsukasa-eishi/\">Food Wars!: Saiba Faces Tsukasa Eishi With His Incredible Arsenal of Cookware</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/erina-fired-up.jpg\"/></figure><p>Erina is now fired up more than ever, with the personal stakes of her mother's quest versus her own self-worth. Erina defied her controlling father, Azami, and freed Totsuki from his self-serving vision of what \"perfect\" gourmet looks like. Now Erina will prove her worth to her mother, too, and never has Soma seen Erina this alive in the kitchen. Up until now, Erina was a lofty goddess of gourmet, casually rejecting any dish that didn't meet her stratospheric standards. But now someone stands above Erina, and it's time to get to work.</p><p>The single-elimination tournament is well underway, and after <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/food-wars-season-5-episode-8-soma-takumi-rivalry-paid-off/\">defeating Don Kama with Soma</a>, Takumi must face Erina alone. These are steep odds, and Takumi knows it. He will challenge Erina with all he has, and when Erina presents an astounding dish to the judges, Takumi retorts with his own modified version of a dish Erina had once defeated him with. It's a fine comeback, but alas, it's not enough to douse the flames of Erina's determination to topple her mother. Erina has no grudge against Takumi, but neither does she show any mercy. She defeats him 3-0 in their match, taking Takumi out of the running and moving Erina one step closer to challenging Mana's own God Tongue. Sooner or later, Erina is bound to run into Soma and/or Asahi Saiba as well, and they may be next on Erina's chopping block.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/food-wars-season-5-episode-7-soma-diner-experience-pays-off/\">Food Wars!: Soma's Diner Experience Pays Off Yet Again</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 22:00:32 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mana-vs-erina.jpg","linkMd5":"f0c47213248b39d5e6be56fc8e3cab5b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-03-325_9d62ac0598b9884e.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":58432,"destBytes":58432,"author":"Louis Kemner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mana-vs-erina.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-03-325_9d62ac0598b9884e.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mana-nakiri-sitting.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn82@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-05-943_139def1da727362b.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/erina-fired-up.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-15-551_132e1f7a606299da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700505},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Bill & Ted Face the Music: Why Dave Grohl Makes a Cameo | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/bill-ted-face-the-music-dave-grohl/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bill-ted-face-the-music-header.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/bill-and-ted-3/\">Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music</a>, now in theaters and on premium video on demand.</strong></em></p><p>If someone wants to know what the world will look like five years from now, they should probably just ask Dave Grohl.

In the course of the encounter, the present-day Bill and Ted are able to get the song that will save the world; at least, that's what they <em>believe</em> -- until the mansion's owner returns.</p><p>As they leave, Bill and Ted bump into Grohl. Present-day Bill and Ted are stoked about the encounter, thinking Grohl is visiting their future selves. However, Grohl is far from excited about the meeting.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Grohl-Bill-Ted.jpg\"/></figure><p>\"Who are you guys?\" Grohl asks. \"What are you doing in my house?\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bill-ted-face-the-music-post-credits-scene/\">Does Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music Have a Post-Credits Scene?</a></span></p><p>It finally dawns on Bill and Ted that their future selves have lied about their success, so present-day Bill and Ted close the door in Grohl's face, marking the end the too-brief cameo by the one-time Nirvana drummer. This isn't Grohl's first screen role, by any means. Aside from appearances in numerous Foo Fighters and Nirvana videos, his appearances include episodes The X-Files and The Muppets; he's also voiced characters on <em>The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange</em> and <em>Metalocalypse</em>.</p><p>Grohl’s cameo in <em>Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music</em> suggests the musician will not have aged a day over the next five years. Everything else the film predicts seems absurd, so this is probably its most accurate instance of prognostication.</p><p><em>Directed by Dean Parisot and written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music stars Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, Anthony Carrigan, Kid Cudi, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Samara Weaving.

Rohan was furious with the losses, but he couldn't find out what was wrong. This was bad on Josuke's part who could have done more productive things such as looking for Kira?</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>LOVED: Doesn't Kill Enemies</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Smartest-and-Dumbest-josuke-1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people have pointed out how Josuke <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-bizarre-adventure-anime-character-jonathan-joestar-stronger-weaker/\">resembles Jonathan Joestar</a>. Both the characters could not bear to kill anyone, no matter who it was. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan was hesitant to kill even Dio Brando, who had caused him so much suffering. Josuke is similar in this way, he doesn't like killing people. He even spared Kira after defeating him.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>HATED: Stole Joseph's Wallet</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Joseph-and-Josuke.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-outstanding-joseph-joestar-cosplayers/\">Joseph Joestar</a> came all the way to Morioh to help Jotaro find out about the person who was using Red Hot Chili Pepper. This proved to be the perfect opportunity for Josuke to meet his father.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-characters-araki-wasted-shouldnt-exist/\">JoJo: 5 Characters Who Were Wasted By Araki (&#38; 5 Who Shouldn't Have Existed)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards the end, when Joseph and Jotaro were leaving Morioh, Josuke enquired about the picture that he lent to Joseph. Joseph confirmed that he had put it in his wallet and that was all Josuke needed to hear. He used Crazy Diamond's power to steal his wallet. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>LOVED: Cared About His Family</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3.-Josukes-grandpa.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josuke lived with his family in Morioh ever since he was a kid. He loved both his grandfather and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-bizarre-adventure-forgotten-characters/\">his mother</a> and was willing to go to any lengths to protect them. When Angelo killed his grandfather, Josuke was furious and he didn't rest until he got rid of Angelo. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josuke has protected his mother several times, including from Enigma and also from Joseph. Josuke knew that she would be distraught if she saw Joseph again.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>HATED: Too Cautious About His Hair</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-josuke-school-thug.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josuke is very proud of his hair. He copied the hairstyle of his savior, who helped Josuke and his mom to reach the hospital. This is undoubtedly a very nice gesture; however, Josuke gets riled up too easily when someone takes a jibe at his hairstyle. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his hairstyle, it is very obvious that people passing will pass a remark or two, however, it doesn't give Josuke the right to attack them in a blind fury. Jotaro would have been in real trouble if he didn't have his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-bizarre-adventure-star-platinum-stands-better-worse/\">Star Platinum to defend himself</a>. He goes overboard when his hair is insulted.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>LOVED: Unique Stand</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Crazy-Diamond-stand-JJBA.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early in Part 4, Jotaro said that Josuke has a unique power. Unlike most Stands, Josuke's Stand did more good than harm. Its ability to heal people and other objects is very precious, and it is difficult to pinpoint one particular moment that highlights the Stand's brilliance since Josuke used it in very ingenious ways.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojo-bizarre-adventure-stardust-crusaders-band-references-missed/\">JoJo: 10 Band References You Missed In Stardust Crusaders</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josuke used the rubber glove trick to beat Angelo, while he used his Stand against Otoishi to trap <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-jojo-localization-stand-names/\">Red Hot Chili Pepper in a tire</a>. The aforementioned moments endeared Josuke to the fans.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>HATED: Troubled Shigechi</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JoJo-Heroes-Dispicable-Acts-josuke-bullies-shigechi-9.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-funniest-characters-most-hilarious-quote/\">Josuke and Okuyasu</a> became the best of friends despite their chaotic first encounter, where the two of them were pretty close to killing each other. The two of them were looking for a way to earn some money when they met Shigechi and his Stand, Harvest.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After some careful deliberations, Josuke came up with a plan that would exploit Shigechi's Stand and make them rich. Josuke and Okuyasu befriended Shigechi only because they wanted to use his Stand.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>LOVED: Dedication For His Hero</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Josuke-Saves-Himself.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Josuke has been criticized for overreacting to comments pertaining to his hair, there is a pretty solid reason behind his reactions. The reason is that his hero had exactly the same hair as Josuke, so insulting his hair would mean insulting him. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josuke is usually very calm, as was shown early on in Part 4 when he was being bullied by his seniors and he did nothing. He only got violent when they insulted his hair.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>HATED: Too Laid Back Sometimes</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jotaro-Josuke.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em> is Josuke's part, but at times it didn't really feel that was the case. Many a time, Josuke would wander off and do something too unnecessary. Most of the hard work in the Kira case was done by Jotaro. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not possible to blame anyone who thinks that Jotaro was more important in solving the mystery of Kira. Josuke isn't a bad protagonist, but some other characters did more work in the Kira case.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>LOVED: Funny Throughout Part 4</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/josuke-and-okuyasu.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing <em>Stardust Crusaders</em>, fans had high expectations from the next JoJo. It is fair to say that Josuke is a brilliant JoJo in his own right. He is not serious all the time like Jotaro, as he loves to have fun. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could be said that many viewers can relate to Josuke's day to day high school struggle. His demeanor throughout Part 4 was outStanding. He pitched in with the jokes every now and then, which made the whole thing more interesting.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-hamon-alternatives/\">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: 5 Ways Hamon Is Anime's Best Fighting Style (&#38; 5 Better Alternatives)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:30:33 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JoJo-5-Times-We-Hated-Josuke-5-Times-We-Loved-Him-featured-image.jpg","linkMd5":"a0b719d218d6a417834a7e15f437a088","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":67024,"destBytes":67024,"author":"Suzail Ahmad","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JoJo-5-Times-We-Hated-Josuke-5-Times-We-Loved-Him-featured-image.jpg":null,"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Josuke-Dice.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn1@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-16-572_00381ecd8ba8e047.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Smartest-and-Dumbest-josuke-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-06-321_bdb861cc63049d75.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Joseph-and-Josuke.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn57@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-05-839_d4b107f462e9467e.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3.-Josukes-grandpa.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn45@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-052_8f91538e4a2bb309.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-josuke-school-thug.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn70@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-05-900_d9d102f8ae71ffed.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Crazy-Diamond-stand-JJBA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn31@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-14-161_50812cf2d913b7f1.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JoJo-Heroes-Dispicable-Acts-josuke-bullies-shigechi-9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-10-430_092dafcb0ab1f739.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Josuke-Saves-Himself.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-15-494_a5905d064d06daf1.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jotaro-Josuke.jpg":null,"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/josuke-and-okuyasu.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn97@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-16-445_98fdf71030261740.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700508},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"What Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther Meant to Superhero Movie Culture Outside America","link":"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-black-panther-meant-superhero-movie-culture-outside-america/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/black-panther-chadwick-boseman.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-obituary/\">The death of Chadwick Boseman</a> has shocked people around the world. In many ways, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/chadwick-boseman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boseman</a> performance in 2018's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-panther-film/\">Black Panther</a> went beyond Hollywood's usual depictions of superheroes, and a lot of that has to do with what he represented and the people he connected with outside of America.</p><p>To them, he was their Black Superman, especially in places like Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. In that sense, given what he's accomplished as the Wakandan king on the big screen, <em>Black Panther</em> wasn't just a movie, it was a movement, and Boseman wasn't just an actor, because he was a cinematic civil rights leader.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/chadwick-boseman-angela-bassett-full-circle-black-panther/\">Chadwick Boseman: Angela Bassett Recalls 'Full Circle' Black Panther Experience</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black-panther-boseman.jpg\"/></figure><p>From the moment he pushed back against King T'Challa using <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-accent-importance/\">a European or American accent</a> because he wanted Africa to be depicted as authentic, Boseman became a key figure in Ryan Coogler's movement. After all, to get an all-Black cast and team behind the camera to bring this landmark project to life made a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-movie-mcu-diversity-statement/\">big statement</a> about what the Marvel Cinematic Universe could do for representation in movies. Now, after <em>Black Panther's</em> success, more Black films are entering the mainstream, especially in the superhero genre.</p><p>Boseman's role on the throne showed that you didn't need white heroes to save the world and that the feminist movement could rock the box office as well, like with 2019's <em>Captain Marvel</em>. Not to mention, it gave people hope that maybe someday even LGBTQ heroes could find their place on the big screen. This is all testament to the inspiration Boseman has been to everyone, <em>everywhere</em>, seen from the YouTube clips where audiences gave incredible reactions when he went through the portal in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, and from personal experience in the Caribbean where every scene he's in is greeted with rapturous applause. While white Hollywood has its Captain and Caped Crusader, Black fans had their King in Boseman.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/joe-biden-kamala-harris-pay-their-respects-to-chadwick-boseman/\">Joe Biden, Kamala Harris Pay Their Respects to Chadwick Boseman</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Black-Panther-Cropped.jpg\"/></figure><p>On top of all of that, given Boseman's social work, rallying for the Black Lives Matter movement and better representation in governance, he also appeals to minorities, immigrants and POC all over the world who've taken a strong stance against, racism and systematic oppression. The impact can be felt when you look back at him, with stoicism yet humility, as fans talk about seeing a hero who looks like them or talks like their ancestors. It's an emotional impact that kids of color didn't feel before. Sure, the '90s had <em>Blade</em>, but that franchise wasn't the call for change that <em>Black Panther</em> was.</p><p>Boseman's T'Challa embodied all these things to the outside world, making POC feel they could be more. It's why his speech when Killmonger passed in <em>Black Panther</em> resonates for people whose family were slaves, indentured or who suffered when their lands were colonized. This was a big stroke as it cemented him as the first modern superhero of a new era, one that changed the game to make us fans non-cis-white leads could marshal a tentpole blockbuster. To us outside of America, the sentiment is exponential as he represented the possibility of a cosmopolitan, kaleidoscope and accepting society -- a belief the world can change and embrace everyone, no matter what, which is what Wakanda stands for in the MCU.</p><p>This is best summed up in one reaction online where a giddy fan uses Martin Luther King Jr.'s  \"I have a dream\" line when T'Challa makes his return in <em>Endgame.</em> It shows that he was a paragon of virtue to those who never saw themselves truly on the big screen. It wasn't that he was just a freedom fighter, as he was actually an institution these people connected to. His portrayal spoke to them, letting them know that their art, fashion, food and terrain were worthy of Hollywood. Boseman was the tipping point for a new wave, and since his arrival, it's gained so much momentum. Now, in the wake of his passing, we can only expect it to drive forward in honor of his legacy. Because, from now on, every time we hear \"Yibambe\" or see the \"Wakanda Forever\" salute, we'll remember them as universal tributes to a beacon of light gone too soon, and a superhero regent that changed the world for the better.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/disney-chairman-marvel-president-express-grief-chadwick-boseman/\">Disney Chairman and Marvel President Express Grief For Chadwick Boseman</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:45:56 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/black-panther-chadwick-boseman.jpg","linkMd5":"3466abf35dd4e42564092b3c3179e0e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-789_36f6bee82c1ed4f5.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":128260,"destBytes":101934,"author":"Renaldo Matadeen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/black-panther-chadwick-boseman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-00-789_36f6bee82c1ed4f5.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black-panther-boseman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn93@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-13-870_b77c771646d5fb7d.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Black-Panther-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-16-078_fe255266acbe3d76.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700509},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"NOS4A2 Canceled by AMC | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/nos4a2-canceled-amc/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nos4a2-s2-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>AMC has decided not to move forward with a third season of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/nos4a2/\"><em>NOS4A2</em></a>.</p><p>Series creator and showrunner Jami O'Brien confirmed the cancellation news in a series of tweets, disappointed that the show had come to an end but grateful it was able to adapt the complete story from Joe Hill's 2013 novel.

Since Aresia became one of the show's most famous villains, perhaps the DCEU could translate her into a live-action form.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>No: Doctor Psycho</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Doctor-Psycho-Harley-Quinn.jpg' /></figure><p>While this character has some potential in a movie, the concept of a small-bodied man with a giant head and psychic powers has been overplayed in so many comic book stories. Hector Hammond from Green Lantern, The Leader and MODOK from Marvel Comics, and the Thinker who will be appearing in James Gunn's <em>The Suicide Squad</em>.</p><p>Still, even if they manage to include Doctor Psycho, his design would need to be drastically altered to fit the tone that the movies have set. Perhaps it's best to leave him in the comics or <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-animated-series-season-two-best-episodes/\">comedic animated shows like <em>Harley Quinn</em></a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Yes: Circe</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Circe.jpg' /></figure><p>When it comes to villains, Wonder Woman has a trinity of main recurring rivals: Ares, Cheetah, and the evil sorceress known as Circe. The latter has had several drastically different depictions in the comics over the years, but she is generally always an evil centuries-old witch who has a hatred for Amazons.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-wonder-woman-weaknesses-diana-prince/\">DC: 10 Weaknesses You Didn't Know Wonder Woman Had</a></span></p><p>With Wonder Woman being one of the biggest sources of magical elements in the DCEU, Circe is ripe for the big screen.

Seems familiar, doesn't it? That's because this is a very common comic book trope that was popularized by Lex Luthor and has been used with the likes of Maxwell Lord and Simon Stagg.</p><p>Veronica is essentially Wonder Woman's Lex Luthor but without any of the memorable traits of the latter. She is an uninspiring character who, much like Doctor Psycho, is just victim to an overused villain concept. Veronica would need something new in a live-action form to make her distinct.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Yes: Genocide</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wonder-Woman-Genocide.jpg' /></figure><p>With Ares established in the first <em>Wonder Woman</em> movie and the high chance that the God of War will eventually return, perhaps his ultimate soldier created to destroy Wonder Woman would be a great logical step for a sequel.</p><p>Genocide was created by Ares and a handful of Wonder Woman's foes as the perfect killer of the Amazon princess. She is powered by the Lasso of Hestia itself, allowing her to siphon the truth out of her victims or attack their soul. Genocide is, essentially, the Wonder Woman equivalent of Doomsday, and an effective one at that. She proves to be a danger to both Wonder Woman and the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-greatest-enemies-justice-league/\">Justice League</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>No: Blue Snowman</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Blue-Snowman.jpg' /></figure><p>A woman who wears a high-tech armored snowman suit, it's pretty easy to see why this one might come across as a little silly on film. Even the Silver Age would feel ashamed to have Blue Snowman alongside the likes of Egghead and Crazy Quilt.</p><p>Furthermore, cold-related villains are more overused concepts for villains that should be saved for the iconic ones like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/awesome-mr-freeze-cosplay-every-batman-dc-fan-needs-see/\">Mr. Freeze</a> or Captain Cold.

Giganta is one of the longest-lasting villains of Wonder Woman's roster of villains.

However, the ability to change size is one that could provide a new kind of superpowered fight in which Diana must face a titan. It can also lead audiences to sympathize with the villain, making Giganta less of a one-note villain.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>No: Angle Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Angle-Man.jpg' /></figure><p>With the right visuals, this character could potentially provide some of the more interesting fight scenes due to his ability to change the angles of plains. Think Christopher Nolan's<em> Inception</em> mixed with 2017's <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and it could make for a fun watch. So why would Angle Man not work?</p><p>Well, the truth is that audiences might consider those aspects about the character too unoriginal as even <em>Doctor Strange</em>'s reality-bending sequences were considered too reminiscent of <em>Inception</em>. It also doesn't help that the character is so obscure that some fans might consider Angle Man to be a waste of a villain slot.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Yes: Silver Swan</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/silver-swan.jpg' /></figure><p>Most of Wonder Woman's more iconic villains originate from magic but Silver Swan's origins stem from science and a dark descent into madness. She began as an ally hero and friend of Wonder Woman but slowly, Silver Swan lost her mind. The nanites that allowed her to walk and fly as Silver Swan combined with a misunderstanding to turn her into a deadly threat</p><p>Silver Swan is one of the more unique Wonder Woman villains due to her disturbing and dark psyche that only gets worse and worse. With nanites at her disposal, nearly indestructible wings and claws, and superhuman speed, Silver Swan is just begging for a live-action incarnation.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>No: Sharkeeta</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sharkeeta.jpg' /></figure><p>As if the name was bad enough, Sharkeeta is a half-woman, half-shark who was contained like a pet by the Amazons until she had enough and broke out to get back at her captors. Even though she technically came first, the idea of a human-shark hybrid was done much better with King Shark, who is set to appear in<em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-cast-characters-revealed/\">The Suicide Squad</a></em>.</p><p>Much like with Doctor Psycho, there is a chance Sharkeeta could work in a movie if rebooted with a new design to make her more intimidating and have a better story.

He can fly, cause explosions, create jet propulsion, and even move at the speed of light in certain circumstances (<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-shinra-facts-only-true-fans-know/\">a mystery that's only happened once</a>).

Unlike Shinra who relies solely on his Third Generation, Sho is so dependant on his \"Fourth Generation\" ability given to him by the Evangelist that fans don't really even know what his Third Gen power is. Sho can slow down time to where it almost seems to be frozen, and that's absurd enough in of itself.

But, because of his Second-Generation abilities, he can do such a diverse amount of things with the flame he creates, allowing him to seem like he has total control over fire in general. Benimaru's abilities can only be explained in one simple way, powerful.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Leonard Burn's Voltage Nova</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Leonard.jpg' /></figure><p>Leonard Burns, the Captain of the 1st Brigade has one of the most simple Ignition Abilities out there. But, just because it's simple doesn't mean it's weak, because it really isn't. In fact, it's likely the strongest ability out there if he's allowed to progress from Stage 1 all the way to Stage 5. To keep things simple, Burns basically generates fire inside himself rather than outside, and this fire creates an aura of heat around him as well as enhancing his own bodies' durability and natural strength. The stronger these flames become, the hotter the aura is, and the more durable Burns becomes. He's basically a towering, buff, furnace that can eventually melt anything around him given enough time to generate heat.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Kayoko Huang's Asclepius Staff</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kayoko.jpg' /></figure><p>Kayoko Huang is a very unique case, as her Ignition Ability is very likely useless in combat. But, outside of it, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-most-powerful-firefighters-ranked/\">this power is one of the most useful in all of the<em> </em>Fire Force.</a> Basically, Kayoko can generate a blue flame in the form of a snake that slithers into her patients and uses their own Ignition Abilities to heal them. This Snake also takes the form of the Asclepius Staff, a staff from Greek Mythos that is commonly associated with medicine and healing. Her power can save people from the brink of death, cure diseases, and even heal non-ability users with ease.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Ogun Montgomery's Flamy Ink And Forge</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ogun.jpg' /></figure><p>Ogun might not be a character that most fans think of when the idea of \"most powerful ignition abilities\" comes to mind, but that's only because Ogun hasn't been given the chance to show off enough yet. This 4th Brigade cool-guy is a longtime friend of Shinra and Arthur, and easily keeps up with them in battle thanks to his Ignition Ability.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Soul Eater: 10 Tsubaki Nakatsukasa Facts Most Fans Don't Know\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/soul-eater-tsubaki-nakatsukasa-facts-fans-dont-know-black-star-dwma/\">Soul Eater: 10 Tsubaki Nakatsukasa Facts Most Fans Don't Know</a></span></p><p>Ogun is able to conjure up a variety of blacksmith-esque weapons out of fire and launch them at enemies, and he's also able to brand himself with fiery tattoo's that buff up his stats to astronomical levels. Ogun has a very versatile ability that could frankly be absurdly powerful if he was just part of the narrative a bit more.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Nataku Son As The Sixth Pillar</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nataku.jpg' /></figure><p>It's so sad that an innocent young child was forced to bear such deadly powers thanks to Rekka. But, after Nataku Tatsu awakened to his Third and Fourth Generation abilities as the Sixth Pillar, it became clear that his Ignition powers could one day level all of Tokyo if left on their own. Tatsu's Third Generation powers let him create a giant flaming claw from his right arm that he can use to cause massive destruction. But, even worse, when tapping into his Fourth Gen abilities, Tatsu can actually create floating Radiation Symbols that expel beams of massively destructive fire and radiation. Also, when using this, Tatsu himself expels high levels of deadly radiation. Hopefully, he grows up to use this power responsibly, because the series might be over quickly if he ever learns how to control it with precise mastery.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Kurono Yūichirō's Black Smoke</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kurono.jpg' /></figure><p>Kurono Yuichiro is another unique character in<em> Fire Force</em>. First of all, he's an awful person, spending most of his life delighting in bullying the weak. Secondly, his power is so insanely versatile it actually puts him on par with someone like Benimaru. Kurono has the Ignition Ability to create and modify Black Smoke from his body. That might not sound that great but this Black Smoke can be ridden on, can be solidified into any shape or form, let's Kurono detect any movement within it, and can be forced inside someone to burn them from the inside out. This character hasn't shown up yet in the anime (<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-anime-manga-differences/\">but has in the manga</a>), but we're hoping the animation studio does him justice.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Dragon's Firebreathing</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dragon.jpg' /></figure><p>Lastly, there's Dragon, a villain that showed up in the previous Arc and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-arthur-boyle-facts-history-trivia/\">was a massive turning point for Arthur</a>. Dragon's power is an enigma because at first, it seems like he can breathe fire and explode it from a distance. But, that doesn't explain his scales or how he can Infernalize his body at will. Plus, it doesn't explain his \"Draconic Pressure\" that damages his opponent the more Dragon is attacked. All of these lead fans to believe that Dragons actually Third-Gen power has something to do with Dragons themselves, and all of these are a natural result of it. It's still unclear, but one thing that isn't is just how powerful this ability is. Benimaru himself was even apprehensive about fighting the guy.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Soul Eater: 10 Pieces Of Crona Fan Art You Have To See\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/soul-eater-crona-fan-art/\">Soul Eater: 10 Pieces Of Crona Fan Art You Have To See</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:30:54 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-featured.jpg","linkMd5":"61a1af8fed824bcbbc0ab6a0789a19ec","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-01-872_1dd185ef9513acee.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":103910,"destBytes":103910,"author":"Jacob Buchalter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fire-force-featured.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-01-872_1dd185ef9513acee.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Devils-Footprints.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn49@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-12-674_01212204bd154be6.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sho-Feathers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-07-142_3b53bb953f460edd.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Arrow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn39@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-15-926_da3c654ed1ee298b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Benimaru.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn37@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-12-592_c0b80fe7080201e8.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Leonard.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-17-695_f91fce1eceb00296.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kayoko.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-09-006_7d0067f94f62506d.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ogun.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-06-903_44a3a76956baf338.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nataku.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn65@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-14-488_13fabedd980f5d5e.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kurono.jpg":null,"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dragon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-08-622_5001b7f03bf1eb4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700508},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Avengers: Yellowjacket's Origin Involves Murdering One of the Avengers","link":"https://www.cbr.com/avengers-yellowjacket-origin-murder-goliath-hank-pym/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellowjacket-versus-goliath-display.jpg\"/></figure><p>This is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/from-a-different-point-of-view/\">\"From a Different Point of View,\"</a> a feature where I discuss a comic book series with another writer. In this case, it is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/author/egon/\"><b>Eileen Gonzalez</b></a> who will be going over the history of the Avengers with me, story by story!</p><p> When <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avengers-yellowjacket-debut-j-jonah-jameson-endorsement-spider-man/\">last we checked in with our heroes</a>, we had just met Yellowjacket for the first time in Avengers #59, \"The Name is...Yellowjacket!\" by Roy Thomas, John Buscema and George Klein. Yellowjacket stopped some fur thieves and was a total jerk about it, which got him the attention of J. Jonah Jameson, who was quickly pro-Yellowjacket.</p><p>This takes us to Yellowjacket's bizarre introduction to the Avengers!</p><p>I opened by noting, \"The first clue we should have had that Yellowjacket was someone we know is that he knew the go-to move to become an Avenger. Tie up Jarvis.\" \"Eileen commiserated with the sad sack Avengers butler, \"Poor Jarvis. He was having such a good time polishing things, too. And then Yellowjacket introduces himself as pompously as possible. It's kind of hilarious.\" I agreed, \"He's practically grabbing his crotch!\" Eileen noted, \"I get that they're probably trying to contrast him with his secret identity as much as possible, but still. Also, I guess he's chewing gum, too? I hope that's what that is.\" I replied, \"Yellowjacket is into chaw now.\" Eileen quipped, \"To cement his bad boy image, as opposed to genteel Jarvis, who is out here smoking a pipe as is proper. So why did Jan faint because of the 'strain of Hank's recent work' exactly? Hank was working really hard and this exhausted Jan somehow? I guess picking on someone and continuing to try to force him to marry you is hard work.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-b.jpg\"/></figure><p> I wondered, \"I almost wonder if Thomas felt that was too much. You know, one of those instances where the writer has to try to explain away the art. So Thomas might have though, 'Ooph, that's a bit much to have her pass out just due to Yellowjacket's comments,' and so he threw in, 'Oh, and the stress of Hank's recent work!' It doesn't make sense, of course, but it's better than a superhero just fainting over some guy claiming he killed her boyfriend.\" Eileen replied, \"Hm, true. Maybe this is a first, though rather weak, attempt to improve Jan's character a bit.\"</p><p>Yellowjacket then tells the story of how he killed Goliath. Eileen noted, \"This flashback with the Yellowjacket vs. Goliath fight seems weird once we find out who Yellowjacket is. Like, wow, he really put a lot of effort into detailing every single aspect of this fight that never happened.\" I agreed, \"Right? He is DISTURBED. It's honestly kind of fascinating, when you think about it. How later writers were just, like, 'Yeah, he sort of snapped there for a bit, but it's all good now.' This is downright DISTURBING.\" Eileen opined, \"He should either take up creative writing or see a psychologist.\" I continued, \"Joe Casey did a miniseries where he tried to explain away how disturbing this all was and it was a good effort, but it really didn't work. I'll get into that a bit next issue, as that's where Casey really put a lot of effort into trying to explain it away. Because, obviously, we both know next issue is BONKERS. But yeah, the flashback to the fight even includes THOUGHT BALLOONS for Goliath!! And, of course, a classic John Buscema ordinary citizen.\" Eileen noticed, \"Yellowjacket is even inventing one-liners for the civilians!!\" </p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-e.jpg\"/></figure><p>I concurred, \"But that, in and of itself, makes no sense, as Yellowjacket is inventing WITNESSES to this thing! That, though, makes me wonder. Perhaps Buscema didn't know what the twist was? I did a Comic Book Legends Revealed recently about how Ed Hannigan left out a bit from an early issue of Legends of the Dark Knight. And then that bit turned out to be a clue as to the murderer's identity later in the storyline. Because Denny O'Neil didn't tell him that the guy in the beginning was going to be the murderer later on.\" Eileen replied, \"Ohhhh that would make sense. Either Thomas didn't tell Buscema about part two, or they just weren't thinking through how disturbing this would look in hindsight.\"</p><p>Eileen then wondered, \"My big question with all this is why the Avengers didn't immediately go running to Hank's house to try to rescue him and/or confirm his death. Wouldn't that be the obvious course of action?\" I agreed, \"Right? He specifically notes that he doesn't know if Hank is dead!\" Eileen added, \"This issue is a mess.\" I continued, \"And the Goliath/Yellowjacket fight is FOUR PAGES! That's an eternity. Filled up with this over-the-top, ridiculous fight.\"</p><p>Yellowjacket then kicks the Avengers' collective ass and kidnaps Wasp to his hidden headquarters in a tiny treehouse. Eileen had a question about his headquarters, \"I'm sorry, I hate to keep asking questions, but WHERE did Yellowjacket get that treehouse? Also, WHY did he get that treehouse? It's ugly.\" I agreed, \"So ugly. However, it DOES match some of Hank's past labs, design-wise.\"</p><p>I continued, \"Then we get the creepiest scene of the book. I will let you rant on this scene now.\" Eileen began her rant, \"I hardly even know what to say, to be honest. Again, I know they're trying to contrast Yellowjacket with the more mild-mannered Goliath, but we've already done that. There is no need for this scene at all!  Yellowjacket comes off as an even bigger creep than before, and Wasp's reaction makes everything worse. But hey, he feels bad afterwards, so I guess that makes it okay. Rant over. Thanks for that.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-i.jpg\"/></figure><p>I then wondered, \"And what does he mean by 'I've got other ways of knowing what you're really thinking'? Is that just a basic 'no means yes' bit? Or is it even more disturbing? Like, we don't see where his hand is, right?\" Eileen responded, \"Or she's kissing back because she's figured out who it is on a subconscious level.  Oh, ew, I didn't even notice the lack of hands. Ack.\" I continued, \"That certainly supports a disturbing reading of that sequence, right? I would assume that was not the intent, of course. But it's still weird language.'I have ways of knowing what you REALLY feel.\" Eileen theorized, \"I have a feeling this whole issue wasn't intended to be as horrible as it ended up. I don't think Thomas (and Buscema, depending on how much he was involved) realized how upsetting this all looked.\"</p><p>The Avengers then get their rematch and kick Yellowjacket's ass. I pointed out, \"I like that the others looked more competent in their rematch. Panther looked like he was about to cripple Yellowjacket. And I like the bit about how Hawkeye would have just killed him.\" Eileen added, \"Yeah, they're not playing around here. Too bad Jan stops them. For the WORST reason ever. Sheesh.\" </p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-j.jpg\"/></figure><p> I continued, \"Sigh. Yeah. That ending. It reminds me as sort of sad reflection of #54's ending. Where Thomas had the climax be one shocking thing. But it was really hiding the REAL twist. And he's doing that here, too. But it's a bad cliffhanger hiding an even worse twist. Hmmm...well, I mean, I guess the twist IS technically better than the cliffhanger. But they're both bad. Really great Jan drawing by Buscema, though.\" Eileen agreed, \"Yeah, I was actually just staring at it. It's such a great picture. I'll just ignore the speech bubble and the blurb text there.\" I opined, \"It's a nice romance comic throwback pose, right?\" Eileen agreed, \"It does look like that! I still can't believe this series fell so hard in quality after the Vision issues. I should sue them for whiplash.\"</p><p>I followed up on that, \"Visually, it's on par with the Vision issues. But yeah, story-wise and, perhaps, more importantly, tonally? All over the place. I think Thomas just wanted to mix things up. It was less longterm planning. And more just thinking of cool ideas in the moment. Yellowjacket, in a vacuum, is not a bad idea. The execution, though...yikes.\" Eileen noted, \"I seem to remember they did a better job with this in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, but the show got cancelled before they could really explore the concept.\" I continued, Well, we'll see how much more this goes off the rails when we look at the next issue. I always love a good wedding....and this is not a good wedding.\"</p><p>Okay, folks, if you have any questions for me or Eileen, you can drop us a line at brianc@cbr.com (yes, it's technically just my e-mail address, but I'll obviously pass it along to Eileen, as well).</p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:43:55 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellowjacket-versus-goliath-display.jpg","linkMd5":"90e050308024cfa7e9fed67c8a4d24be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn82@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-00-833_21f72d8542588cb0.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":252589,"destBytes":230718,"author":"Brian Cronin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellowjacket-versus-goliath-display.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn82@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-00-833_21f72d8542588cb0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-17-485_0cc122d325eaeee0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-15-704_0c1802078f1702f7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-i.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-06-184_a8ebb52bc4626651.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/avengers-59-j.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-09-772_4d67e75e4284e794.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700507},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Reveals a New, Doomed Scooby Gang | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-doomed-scooby-gang/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Cordelia-Giles.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following article contains spoilers for \"Where All Paths Lead,\" by Nilah Magruder, Lauren Knight, Alex Guimarães and Jim Campbell, from </strong></em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Every Generation #1</a></strong><em><strong>, available now.</strong></em></p><p>With the story “Where All Paths Lead,” the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Every Generation</em> anthology offers fans a glimpse of an alternate universe from <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/new-buffyverse-after-hellmouth/\">\"Hellmouth,\"</a> a crossover between the <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em> and <em>Angel</em> comics, in which Buffy doesn't win the fateful final battle against Hellmother and Sunnydale destroyed. Interestingly, the comic reimagines Buffy’s original Scooby gang. and this change leads to this Buffy's unfortunate fate.</p><p>In \"Hellmouth,\" Buffy enters Hellmouth with Angel and several of her friends in order to defeat Hellmother and liberate Sunnydale from her power. In a turn of events, Hellmother possesses Angel, but Buffy doesn't fight her alone. With the help of Willow, Cordelia, Kendra, Anyanka and Rose, Buffy is able to cast Hellmother out of Angel and into the Hellmouth lake where a Buffy from an alternate universe pulls the demon deeper into the lake and to her certain doom. It's that Buffy that is the focus of \"Where All Paths Lead,\" which gives a little more backstory as to why this Buffy failed.</p><p>One of the first things revealed to be different in this alternate universe is that Cordelia, who often butts heads with Buffy, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-dating-cordelia-every-generation-comic/#:~:text=Although%20Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20did%20feature%20Willow%2C,an%20alternate%20universe%20take%20on%20the%20source%20material.\">is actually Buffy’s girlfriend</a>. “Where All Paths Lead” tweaks Cordelia’s role in Buffy’s past, revealing that the two had been dating since their time in high school. While not canon, it is great to see Buffy, who is often considered queer by fans, presented as undeniably queer in this universe and in a meaningful relationship with Cordelia.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-joss-whedon-willow-change-in-reboot/\">Joss Whedon Would Make a Major Willow Change in the Reboot</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Buffy-and-Cordelia-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>While Buffy's relationship with Cordelia may seem to be a positive, the second difference in this universe is shocking and sobering -- Willow is dead. Snippets of flashbacks reveal that Willow was killed before the Hellmouth opened and that Buffy blames herself for not <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/willow-boom-studios-first-look-buffy-vampire-slayer-comic/\">being able to protect Willow</a>. Struggling to cope with Willow's death, Buffy distances herself from Xander and many of her other friends, leaving her Scooby gang in \"Where All Paths Lead\" to consist of only Giles and Cordelia. To make matters worse, Buffy believes facing Hellmother alone will be the only way to keep everyone she loves safe, and after arguing with Giles and Cordelia, Buffy pushes Cordelia into Giles and jumps into Hellmouth by herself.</p><p>Of course, as echoed by Giles, Cordelia, and even the demon Agog, Buffy is defeated by Hellmother, who, in turn, destroys Sunnydale. Ironically, Hellmother only destroys Sunnydale out of spite because Buffy did not bring her friends into Hellmouth and therefore Hellmother did not have a suitable vessel for her wicked scheme. Shocked and refusing to believe that her world is gone along with all her friends, \"Where All Paths Lead\" closes with this Buffy running through the tunnels of Hellmouth, hoping she can save Cordelia.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-cordelia-whedon-wanted-black-actor/\">Buffy: Cordelia Was Black, But The WB Told Whedon to Make Her White</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FF14-Buffy-Every-Gen-On-Her-Own-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Ultimately, it's <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-cordelia-whedon-wanted-black-actor/\">Buffy's love for Cordelia</a> and fear for her friends' safety that brings doom upon Buffy and her loved ones. \"Where All Paths Lead\" reveals that only with the help of her Scooby gang can Buffy hope to defeat Hellmother, emphasizing <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/every-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-season-ranked-according-to-critics/\">the importance Buffy's friends play in her battles</a>, although it seems this is not the first time Buffy has had to learn this lesson the hard way. When facing off with Hellmother, the demon hints that Buffy has tried to fight her alone, perhaps in other alternate universes, but they all end in failure.</p><p>Buffy's love for her friends and determination to keep them safe is her bane, but her friends themselves are her boon and, ultimately, are the reason she's able to defeat Hellmother in the \"Hellmouth\" crossover. Buffy's watered down Scooby gang in \"Where All Paths Lead\" wasn't enough for her to succeed and reveals that this was the cause of her downfall. While there's no happy ending in \"Where All Paths Lead,\" it does show insight into Buffy's character and loyalty to her friends as well as how much her friends likewise care for her. After all, Buffy wouldn't be as good of a vampire slayer without her slayer Scooby gang.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Next: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/buffy-whedon-spike-ruining-approach-to-vampires/\">Buffy: Whedon Threatened to Kill Spike for Ruining His Approach to Vampires</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 02:20:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Cordelia-Giles.jpg","linkMd5":"79674c8c69ba1cfa85ceb8c4b93be1bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn73@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-699_3e78c159a39bc10d.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":77018,"destBytes":77018,"author":"Lee","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Cordelia-Giles.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn73@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-699_3e78c159a39bc10d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Buffy-and-Cordelia-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-15-536_8a396bfc9a678f5a.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FF14-Buffy-Every-Gen-On-Her-Own-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-08-845_0cab4f139a19f699.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700502},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Plastic Man Vs Mister Fantastic: Who Would Win? | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/plastic-man-vs-mister-fantastic-who-would-win-marvel-dc-comics/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Plastc-Man-vs-Mr-Fantastic-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>The hero <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/plastic-man/\">Plastic Man</a> has been around for longer than most people imagine.

He can not only transform into inanimate objects of all kinds but most importantly, with a little concentration, he can transform into other people as well.</p><p>This skill has served him well over the years, as it's allowed to get into all kinds of places that he wouldn't be able to.

It's kind of his thing- he spends most of his time in his lab, coming up with all kinds of new inventions and gadgets. Iron Man calls himself a futurist, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-best-worst-upgrades-tony-stark-armors/\">but pretty much just invents weapons</a>; Mister Fantastic is actually inventing the future.</p><p>This gives Mister Fantastic access to all kinds of gadgets and technology that can help him in battle if need be and have served to help him get an advantage over all manners of foes.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Plastic Man: Fights Dirty</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Plastic-Man.jpeg' /></figure><p>Plastic Man wasn't always the best person in the world.

He's virtually indestructible- he'll lose his form when exposed to sudden heat or solvents, but he can reform his shape once these outside stimuli are gone. His internal organs are just as pliable as the rest of his body and he moves them around his body at will, preventing damage to them.</p><p>He's barely aged since WWII and once survived three thousand years at the bottom of the ocean floor.

Not only can Plastic Man stretch but he can transform his body into whatever he needs it to be. Let's say he can't lift something- he can make his muscles more powerful and lift it. He's functionally immortal.</p><p>Plastic Man can do things with his powers that Mister Fantastic just can't and that gives him a huge advantage in this battle.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Mister Fantastic: A Balanced Foe</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/8.-Mr.-Fantastic.jpg' /></figure><p>Fighting Mister Fantastic isn't like fighting other heroes- it's not just a physical fight, it's a race against time.

In just three episodes, the animated series has offered nods to multiple <em>Star Trek</em> series, from <em>The Original Series</em> to <em>Voyager</em>. However, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-trek-the-next-generation/\">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> is the series <em>Lower Decks</em> has homaged the most since its first episode, referencing multiple characters from the live-action series, as well as specific storylines and aliens that first appeared on the fan-favorite show.</p><p>And these nods keep coming in <em>Lower Decks</em>' latest episode. In \"Moist Vessel,\" the animated series not only tips its hat to <em>TNG</em>'s classic poker games, but it also mentions a forgotten villain in Professor James Moriarty.

Cerritos in an effort to have her request a transfer off the ship. However, Mariner manages to find fun in these tasks, and instead, Captain Freeman attempts to discourage her in another manner: by promoting her to the rank of Lieutenant.</p><p>Ensign Boimler is the first to be left completely in shock at Mariner's promotion.

However, he quickly snaps out of it when the person on the other end asks him what's happening. He then brushes it off, saying it wasn't him but Moriarty.</p><p>The mention of Moriarty is a throwback to <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. While most <em>Star Trek</em> villains are aliens like the Ferengi, the Romulans and the Borg, Moriarty was a different breed. The character debuted in the Season 2 episode \"Elementary, Dear Data\" as part of a Holodeck program created by Geordi LaForge that brought Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> stories to life.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-lower-decks-makes-tng-theme-song-canon/\">Star Trek: Lower Decks Makes A Popular Theme Song Canon</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Star-Trek-TNG-Moriarty.jpg\"/></figure><p>Professor Moriarty was, of course, included as Holmes' nemesis. But even though he was a computer program, he eventually gained sentience to maliciously attack the crew of the Enterprise. His only wish was to exist outside of the Holodeck's programming and while he didn't accomplish his goal the first time around, he made a second attempt when he returned in the Season 6 episode \"Ship in a Bottle.\"</p><p>Boimler dropping a mention of Moriarty is yet another deep cut in the iconic lore of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, and continues to show <em>Lower Decks</em> can homage any episode of the series without missing a beat.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks stars Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford, Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler, Noël Wells as Ensign Tendi, Dawnn Lewis as Captain Carol Freeman, Jerry O'Connell as Commander Jack Ransom, Gillian Vigman as Doctor T'Ana and Fred Tatasciore as Lieutenant Shaxs.

With <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internet Movie Database</a> allowing fans to rate the episodes on a scale of one (the worst) to ten (the best), these are the episodes that rank the worst.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>S2E49 Storybook Rangers Part II (5.7)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E49-Storybook-Rangers-Part-II.jpg' /></figure><p>This episode concludes the story of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-pink-ranger-kimberly-questions/\">Kimberly</a>, Tommy, and Rocky being trapped in a book while the rest of the team fights monsters in the outside world.</p><p>To be fair, this is a pretty standard episode as far as plot goes. The trouble is that some of the editing to blend <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-differences-american-original-japanese-show/\">the Japanese footage</a> with the American footage is so poorly completed that it's obvious the show has been spliced together. There are characters from the Japanese footage that appear in shots who never actually have a part to play in the American series, making for a really disjointed episode.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>S2E39 Rangers Back In Time Part I (5.7)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E39-Rangers-Back-In-Time-Part-I.jpg' /></figure><p>Lord Zedd finds a little inspiration from a class assignment of the teens in the Power Rangers. Using the Rock Of Time, he de-ages the planet by about 10 years when the teens reminisce about their childhoods.</p><p>The Power Rangers as children becomes a much bigger storyline a year later, but the events of this episode don't entirely line up with those. This time around, the kids have no memory of their teen years at all, which makes the episode a little less interesting for fans.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>S2E33 Lights, Camera, Action (5.6)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E33-Lights-Camera-Action.jpg' /></figure><p>Does any television fan actually like a clip show? It's a rare show that can do a successful episode that does little more than recap the events of the series. (<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-the-10-best-ember-island-players-gags/\"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> might be the only one, but it wasn't strictly a clip show.)</p><p>The Power Rangers have their first live television interview on a talk show. Both jealous and inspired, Lord Zedd turns a camera into a monster for them to battle, but the bulk of the episode just features recycled footage that the audience has already seen.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>S1E27 Wheel Of Misfortune (5.6)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S1E27-Wheel-Of-Misfortune.jpg' /></figure><p>The only season one episode to make the worst episodes, this one happens to have a particular focus on the Pink Ranger. While most of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-best-pink-ranger-episodes-imdb-mmpr/\">Kimberly's episodes</a> are usually about her friendship with other Rangers, this one was about her family's antique spinning wheel.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/rita-repulsa-fan-art/\">Ten Rita Repulsa Fan Art Pictures That Won't Give You A Headache</a></span></p><p>When Rita Repulsa turns the wheel into a monster, Kimberly is despondent. Not only do they not have it for the school play, but she has to explain the loss to her family. Of course, the Power Rangers defeat the monster and get it back, but Bulk ruins the play, so it's all for naught anyway.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>S3E27 Another Brick In The Wall (5.5)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E27-Another-Brick-In-The-Wall.jpg' /></figure><p>This episode marks Katherine's second as an official Power Ranger, and that might be part of the reason fans don't love it. Though Kimberly has a great arc as she leaves the show, the transition is still a bit bumpy.</p><p>Rita targets Kat, wanting to turn her evil again, but she misses her mark and turns a brick into a monster. Kat ends up having to use some science fiction to save most of the team from being trapped in brick while Billy battles the monster alone. For a Kat-centric episode, it tends to put more of the spotlight on Billy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>S2E48 Storybook Rangers Part I (5.5)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E48-Storybook-Rangers-Part-I.jpg' /></figure><p>Since the second part of this episode lands amongst the worst, it's not surprising to see this one rank even lower. Even though the second part of the episode is disjointed, this half is liked even less by fans.</p><p>That might be because there are no Power Ranger battles in this episode. Though it doesn't use any footage from the Japanese series, it also doesn't feature any of the Power Rangers morphed at all. It makes for a dull episode as the audience constantly wonders when they're going to use their abilities to save the day. Even though <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-tommy-oliver-unknown-facts/\">Tommy</a>, Kimberly, and Rocky can't morph, they still know how to fight, and they don't even try.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>S3E22 Follow That Cab!

It doesn't, however, hold interest with fans because a lot of what happens doesn't make sense.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-questions-about-zordon-answered/\">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: 10 Questions About Zordon, Answered</a></span></p><p>Kimberly plans to talk with a coach who is looking to train a gymnast to take to the Olympics. Unfortunately, her car gets stolen, and she, Bulk, and Skull wind up trapped in the monster that used to be the cab they were using to catch the thief. The idea is that the Power Rangers won't destroy a monster with people trapped inside, but Rita and Zedd's plan makes no sense. Before this episode, monsters always reverted back to their original state as an object or animal once they were defeated - and the people trapped inside always returned safe and sound.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>S3E38 Attack Of The 60' Bulk (5.3)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E38-Attack-Of-The-60-Foot-Bulk.jpg' /></figure><p>Technically, this episode occurs during <em>Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers</em>. The final stretch of episodes in <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> were renamed after the main characters became children that couldn't use their powers and the Alien Rangers of Aquitar came to Earth to help.</p><p>Bulk has always been a bully - and much of the show's comic relief. Here, he becomes an actual monster when he's transformed into Bratboy. Fans like watching Bulk get into trouble, but seeing him become a monster isn't the same kind of fun.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>S3E28 A Chimp In Charge (5.0)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E28-A-Chimp-In-Charge.jpg' /></figure><p>Another of Kat's early episodes with the team, this one explores her new friendship <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-best-yellow-ranger-episodes-imdb/\">with Aisha</a>. The team pair up to teach a chimpanzee sign language for a school project.</p><p>Their chimpanzee ends up at the center of the episode when she's transformed into a monster. It's a pretty typical episode, but perhaps fans would have enjoyed it more if the monster in question was created from an object instead of an animal.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>S2E36 The Great Bookala Escape (4.3)</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E36-The-Great-Bookala-Escape.jpg' /></figure><p>The lowest rated episode is one in which the team of Power Rangers actually have to save an alien that crashes on Earth. Making friends with Bookala, who looks like a doll in his tiny spacecraft, but grows to full size, the Rangers protect him from Lord Zedd.</p><p>It's a rather standard episode for the series, but fans certainly have a dislike for Rangers trying to save creatures from other planets as the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-in-space-best-worst-episodes-imdb/\">worst episode of <em>Power Rangers In Space</em></a> has a similar plot point.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-best-episodes-imdb-mmpr/\">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: 10 Best Episodes According To IMDb</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:46 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Team.jpg","linkMd5":"bc6e5bb1103fd33bb81cd6192a6840bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn29@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-02-007_1f64357cbe3f04e6.webp","destWidth":1580,"destHeight":790,"sourceBytes":116966,"destBytes":116966,"author":"Amanda Bruce","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Team.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn29@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-02-007_1f64357cbe3f04e6.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E49-Storybook-Rangers-Part-II.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn52@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-10-095_5435feeb3549765b.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E39-Rangers-Back-In-Time-Part-I.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn61@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-11-956_ec4943ee944f7731.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E33-Lights-Camera-Action.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-11-989_525775964966d443.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S1E27-Wheel-Of-Misfortune.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn49@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-14-381_e90ed641e3847095.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E27-Another-Brick-In-The-Wall.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn77@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-08-072_395ba25424038950.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E48-Storybook-Rangers-Part-I.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn49@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-07-664_7fe313e51d9ff611.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E22-Follow-That-Cab.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn53@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-12-679_c4093dd00585d36a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E38-Attack-Of-The-60-Foot-Bulk.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-14-181_643d60620cee88be.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S3E28-A-Chimp-In-Charge.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn2@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-05-853_4a0e7bae406b5c0c.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-S2E36-The-Great-Bookala-Escape.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn93@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-07-156_ad3874c231f8fd0a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700504},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"One Piece: Every Major Villain, Ranked From Least To Most Evil","link":"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-evil-villains-ranked/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/big-mom-crocodile-doflamingo-one-piece.jpg\"/></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the undisputed king of Shonen, </span><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-piece/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Piece</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prides itself on its quality characters.

It starts after <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-devil-fruit-abilities-counter-luffy-handle/\">Luffy and co. take down Doflamingo</a> and go to Zou to reunite with the rest of the crew. But, the crew was in for a surprise when they arrived on Zou. Sanji had left the crew! He left the crew for the sake of the safety of the crew. He was left with no choice but to go willingly with Capone Bege. Luffy was surprised to find out about Sanji leaving the crew without any reason. A lot of characters were introduced in the arc; some of them would go on to play a very important role in the future. The arc featured the creation of a new alliance— Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, that would take down Kaido. The Straw Hats also found out about the existence of a Road Poneglyph. The fans were expecting that the crew would be united once again, however, it wasn't the case. The Straw Hats split up once again. Luffy, Nami, Chopper, Brook left for Whole Cake Island- the territory of Big Mom. They were accompanied by Carrot.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>LEVELY</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Imu-One-Piece-1.jpg' /></figure><p>The Levely arc was terse in comparison to Whole Cake Island. It focused on the events after the conclusion of the Whole Cake Island arc. This arc was filled with surprises. First, Luffy's new bounty was revealed, which was 1,500,000,000 beris. Secondly, the whereabouts of the Revolutionary Army were revealed. They had managed to leave Baltigo unscathed. Thirdly, the Revolutionary Army declared war on the World Nobles. Finally, there was the appearance of Im, a mysterious figure to whom even the World Nobles bow down. The arc was fast-paced and there was a lot of stuff of happening throughout. Also, it is impossible to ignore the appearance of Shanks at Mary Geoise and talking to the Five Elders. The arc showed that the world was going to be changed soon.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>WHOLE CAKE ISLAND</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whole-Cake-Island-Arc.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main focus of the arc was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-sanji-vs-devil-fruit-abilities/\">Sanji</a>. Luffy and co. went to the territory of Big Mom to bring back Sanji. It wasn't going to be an easy task by any means. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffys-best-fight-saga-ranked/\">The arc featured the best fight</a> in <em>One Piece</em> to date. Several mysteries were unraveled. The fans found out that Sanji is actually related to the notorious Germa 66. The arc has been subject of severe criticism mainly because there weren't as many fights as the fans would have liked. But, the main purpose of the arc was to focus on Sanji as a character and how far he had come. He was labeled as a failure by his own father. He was ostracized by his own family; only his mother cared for him.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-legendary-fights-story-who-won/\">One Piece: 5 Legendary Fights In The Story (&#38; Who Won)</a></span></p><p>Sanji was saved by Reiju who freed him from his cell. After a chain of events, Sanji ended up on Zeff's ship. Sanji considered Zeff his father, and Big Mom threatened to kill Zeff and all the cooks at Baratie. There was also a looming threat over his crew. Sanji chose to sacrifice himself in order to save everyone else. He was betrayed by Pudding as well, who was supposed to be the shining light in his dark time. The arc featured an unsuccessful attempt at assassinating Big Mom. We also got to see her backstory.</p><p>Towards the end of the arc, we saw Luffy beating Katakuri. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-big-mom-ways-won/\">Big Mom was rampaging</a> and she wouldn't stop until she had eliminated every Straw Hat. There was only one way to stop her and that was to bake her a magnificent wedding cake. This was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-sanjis-best-fight-from-every-saga-ranked/\">Sanji's biggest challenge to date</a>, but he stepped up and made a marvelous cake, which stopped Big Mom and saved the Straw Hats from total annihilation. Also, who can forget Luffy ordering Jinbe to come to Wano and join up with the rest of the crew. The arc was unpredictable and fun. It showed that it was futile to try and predict what Oda was up to.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>WANO</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/One-Piece-5-Things-That-Show-Wano-Is-Already-The-Best-Arc-5-Things-It-Needs-To-Do-Better-featured-image.jpg' /></figure><p>Wano is undoubtedly the best arc after the time-skip. It is going to be a long arc for sure. The first two acts are over; the third act is currently going on. The main antagonist of this arc is none other Kaido, one of the four Yonko. Luffy and Law formed an alliance all the way back at Punk Hazard <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-proved-pirate-king-material-fell-short/\">to take down Kaido</a>; now they have a chance to take him down. The arc is far from finished. So far the arc has been breathtaking. The fans found out the bounties of the current Yonko, Whitebeard and Gol D. Roger. The incident involving Rocks was also revealed. Also, the introduction of Kozuki Oden left the fans stunned. His backstory added more spice to the arc. The culmination of the Wano arc is expected to rival that of Marineford. It <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-wano-best-arc-improve/\">has certainly got the potential to become the best arc in the series to date</a>. There will be a lot riding on Oda's shoulders, and hopefully he will deliver.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-devil-fruits-underrated/\">One Piece: 10 Devil Fruits That Are Insanely Underrated</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:30:32 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Featured-Best-Arcs-Four-Emperors-Saga.jpg","linkMd5":"c5905ce9b559a1367b891f718f3fe8c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-097_327975ebaf846cee.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":68968,"destBytes":68968,"author":"Suzail Ahmad","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Featured-Best-Arcs-Four-Emperors-Saga.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-097_327975ebaf846cee.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zou-in-one-piece.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-09-547_bca905f3afc77e97.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Imu-One-Piece-1.jpg":null,"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whole-Cake-Island-Arc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn82@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-13-744_bdb31cc238dbffa3.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/One-Piece-5-Things-That-Show-Wano-Is-Already-The-Best-Arc-5-Things-It-Needs-To-Do-Better-featured-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn50@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-08-396_90df0f45903496f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700509},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger to Star in Untitled Spy Series | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-star-spy-series/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terminator-dark-fate-schwarzenegger.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Arnold-Schwarzenegger/\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> will star in and executive produce an untitled spy series that is expected to premiere on a streaming service.</p><p>Created by <em>Scorpion</em> creator Nick Santora, the hourlong series is being developed by Skydance Television and will follow the adventures of a global spy (Schwarzenegger) and his daughter.

The paradigm example of this theme is the <em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dark-souls\">Dark Souls</a></em> series, which features humanity as both a game mechanic and an item. For the Fire Keepers, who serve as bonfire guardians, humanity is intimately tied with suffering, disability and physical deformity: It visibly writhes beneath their skin.</p><p>Players start <em>Dark Souls</em> as Undead Hollow creatures, but gaining humanity allows them to reborn in human form. Humanity also provides players with useful combat buffs.</p><p>On the other hand, Fire Keepers' humanity and its appearance is described through in-game text, rather than seen in the character models themselves. Most Fire Keepers cover their bodies to hide the way their deformities. In addition to the way their humanity appears, all known Fire Keepers in <em>Dark Souls</em> are women with disabilities, which adds a rather ableist bent to the way they appear in-game.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"http://cbr.com/dark-souls-challenge-runs/\">Dark Souls: Five Challenge Runs to Keep You From Going Hollow</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dark-souls-bonfire.jpg\"/></figure><p><span class=\"related-single\">The Darkmoon Knightess, a new Fire Keeper, comes back as an Undead Hollow, much like the player character. The only difference is, she's unable to return to human form because she doesn't have enough humanity to do so. This is indicated by in-game descriptions, which note the Brass Armor worn by the Knightess \"hides her hideous form and helps her hunt the guilty.\" </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Another Fire Keeper is Anastacia of Astora, also known as the Ash Maiden. Anastacia is found locked away in a prison, with players unsure if she was put in there for some crime she committed, or if she locked herself away. Most likely, she's been locked away because of her disability and appearance. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Like the Darkmoon Knightess, Anastacia is found with her entire body covered except for her hands and face. The description of the Dingy Set she wears notes it was once a white robe, left blackened and dirty from years of use around bonfires. This could mean that over time, she has gathered enough humanity that her body is starting to heal and change into human form once more.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"http://cbr.com/dark-souls-iii-find-hollowslayer-greatsword/\">Dark Souls III: How to Find the Game's Best Greatsword</a></span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Fair Lady, one of the Daughters of Chaos, acts as the final Fire Keeper players will meet in <em>Dark Souls.</em> As part of her lore, Fair Lady’s mother and sisters attempted to create their own first flame, only to create a flame of chaos that turned them into spider-like abominations similar to Jorogumo or Arachne. </span><span class=\"related-single\">Unlike the other Fire Keepers, Fair Lady wears no clothing. When players find her, it is clear that the Fair Lady is dying. Giving her humanity seems to ease her pain.</span></p><p>It seems that each one of these Fire Keepers must have died and come back as either Hollow or Abominations. In-game descriptions explain, “Each Fire Keeper is a corporeal manifestation of her bonfire, and a draw for the humanity which is offered to her.

In the end, fans get the most excellent of bands and true unity that transcends history.</p><p><em>Directed by Dean Parisot and written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music stars Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, Anthony Carrigan, Kid Cudi, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Samara Weaving.

Not to be undone, the Sensational <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/she-hulk/\">She-Hulk</a> does <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-she-hulk-better-worse-cousin-hulk/\">whatever a Hulk can</a>. Besides both being Marvel superheroes, the two are friends and have worked together numerous times over the years. Just as the best of friends occasionally argue, superheroes can also occasionally <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mismatched-unequal-superhero-fights-comics/\">fight each other</a>.</p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-vs-she-hulk-who-wins/\">Wonder Woman Vs. She-Hulk: Who Would Win?</a></span></p><p class=\"article-title\">Why would Spider-Man and She-Hulk fight? Mind control is always a popular cause of superhero fights. Or it can be over little things, like an adjective (Spider-Man apparently <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/722/sensational_spider-man_2006_-_2007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">needs to be sensational</a> as well). But a Spider-Man vs She-Hulk fight isn't going to go well for Spidey, right? Not so fast! Spider-Man's defeated some very <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spiderman-most-powerful-defeated-enemies/\">heavy hitters</a> over the years, and he may even be the odds on favorite, so here's a look at just who would win.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Strength: She-Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/She-Hulk.jpg' /></figure><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, which allows him to lift approximately 10 tons. That's pretty darn impressive! Though he certainly has a lot of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-strongest-villains/\">strong villains</a>, oftentimes Spider-Man is the strongest guy in the fight, especially when he's a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/peter-parker-spider-man-friendly-neighborhood-save-world-marvel/\">friendly neighborhood Spider-Man</a>.</p><p>As clearly stated in her name, though, She-Hulk is a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/hulk/\">Hulk</a>. And Hulks are the strongest ones there are. Over the years, She-Hulk has shown off many insane <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-strength-moments-ranked/\">feats of strength</a> and without question, she has a considerable strength advantage over Spider-Man.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Intelligence: Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Spider-Man-Peter-Parker-Teaching.jpg' /></figure><p>Typically a Hulk is the strongest there is, but they have been far from the smartest there is over the years. While the Hulk's intelligence fluctuates depending on the incarnation, She-Hulk typically retains her intelligence in her Hulk form. Furthermore, she is even a successful attorney. Passing the bar is an impressive feat, how's Spidey gonna top that?</p><p>Oh, that's right, Peter Parker is a scientific genius who invented his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spiderman-best-worst-web-shooter-designs/\">mechanical web-shooters</a> while he was just a teenager. Spider-Man's name won't come up while discussing the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-universe-most-intelligent-heroes-ranked/\">top tier of geniuses in the Marvel Universe</a>, but he's only a level or two below them.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Team Support: She-Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/She-Hulk-A-Force.jpg' /></figure><p>Since she's not a mutant, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men/\">X-Men</a> are about the only major team that She-Hulk hasn't been a member of. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers/\">Avengers</a>?

Champions: Who Would Win?</a></span></p></p><p><p class=\"article-title\">Spider-Man has been a member of both the Avengers and the Fantastic Four as well, though not as often or as long as She-Hulk. For a good while, Spider-Man considered himself a loner. While he's always down for a team-up or to join a team nowadays, his isolated past versus She-Hulk's rich team history makes it easier for her to get team assistance.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Speed &#38; Agility: Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Spider-Man-vs-Firelord.jpg' /></figure><p>In a straight-up foot race, She-Hulk's going to beat Spider-Man because of her stronger leg muscles. However, physical speed is only a portion of what makes up having the proportionate speed of a spider.</p><p>Spider-Man is legendary for his danger-detecting Spider-Sense. That combined with his incredible Spider-Agility makes him very difficult to land a blow on. Spider-Man can dodge She-Hulk for ages while swiftly landing shots of his own as well.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Public Perception: She-Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/She-Hulk-Mind-Over-Muscle.jpg' /></figure><p>As already mentioned, She-Hulk has been a regular member of both the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, two of the most beloved teams in the Marvel Universe. Furthermore, her popularity makes her a highly sought after attorney to boot. After all, who doesn't want a lawyer who can <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-most-powerful-lawyers/\">literally fight for them</a>?</p><p>On the other hand, Spider-Man can hardly catch a break with the public. For many years, the general public of the 616 thought that Spider-Man was a menace because of a certain <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-shadiest-things-j-jonah-jameson-has-done-marvel/\">Daily Bugle publisher</a>. JJJ has <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/j-jonah-jameson-villain-ally-spider-man/\">softened some over the years</a>, so maybe Spidey's finally turned a corner, but years of bad PR still follow him at times.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Gadgets: Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spider-Man-Spider-Armor-feature.jpg' /></figure><p>Aside from tossing a random car or something along those lines, She-Hulk doesn't use (or need) any gadgets while she's out there doing her superhero thing. Spider-Man's web-shooters have already been mentioned, but those are only the tip of the iceberg for the Web-Slinger.</p><p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batmobile-versus-spider-buggy-best-superhero-vehicle/\">5 Reasons Why The Batmobile Is The Best Superhero Vehicle Of All Time (&#38; 5 Why It's The Spider-Buggy)</a></span></p></p><p><p class=\"article-title\">On a few occasions, Spider-Man has busted out the Spider-Buggy, but his most impressive gadget has been the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-powerful-armors/\">armors</a> he has used over the years. Almost all of them have been designed by Peter Parker and have significantly powered him up. With the right suit, he may just be a physical match for She-Hulk.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Trainers: She-Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gamora.jpg' /></figure><p>She-Hulk and Spider-Man share a common trainer, none other than <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america/\">Captain America</a>. With their respective powers, learning how to fight makes the two of them even more formidable. But Cap isn't the only hero that's worked with the two of them...</p><p>Spider-Man has worked with the Master of Kung Fu himself, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/shang-chi/\">Shang-Chi</a>. He helped Spider-Man develop \"the Way of the Spider\" martial art style. But She-Hulk received her additional training from the most dangerous woman in the universe, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/gamora/\">Gamora</a>. Kung Fu is great but it can't compete with the countless other fighting styles throughout the universe.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Costume: Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/spider-man-ben-peter-parker-costume.jpg' /></figure><p>She-Hulk stands out because she's tall, buff, and green, but when it comes to a specific outfit, she doesn't really have a defining one. That still hasn't stopped cosplayers from pulling off some <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-cosplay-marvel-comics-look-like/\">sensational She-Hulk cosplay</a> though.</p><p>Spider-Man's red and blue costume is iconic and also <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spiderman-best-worst-costumes/\">far from the only spectacular outfit</a> Spider-Man has donned over the years. His outfits are so astonishing that it carries over to the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-best-worst-spider-costumes/\">other Spider-People of the Marvel Universe</a> as well. If it weren't for Spider-Man's years of bad press, he could be a fashion mogul by now. Spider-Man's costumes can also give the hero an edge in battle, depending on his chosen outfit.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Famous Family: Tie</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Spider-Man-and-She-Hulk.jpg' /></figure><p><p class=\"article-title\">Spider-Man may just have the most famous aunt and uncle in history.

Although not currently married, for many, Peter and Mary Jane had the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mary-jane-superman-lois-lane-best-greatest-comic-power-couple/\">ideal superhero marriage</a>.</p></p><p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-spider-man-family-everyday-heroes/\">10 Members Of Spider-Man’s Family Who Are Everyday Heroes</a></span></p></p><p><p class=\"article-title\">She-Hulk, in turn, might just have the most famous cousin in all of comics. When Jennifer Walters was shot by a crime boss, her cousin Bruce Banner gave her a life-saving blood transfusion that would turn her into She-Hulk because of his gamma-irradiated blood. One famous giant green cousin = three famous humans.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>WINNER: She-Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/She-Hulk.jpeg' /></figure><p>A case can certainly be made for Spider-Man winning. His agility and speed make him tough to hit, and he's strong enough to do damage to her with his punches. With the addition of gadgets, his odds greatly increase.</p><p>It comes down to hand-to-hand combat, and She-Hulk's strength and training with Gamora give her the edge. While She-Hulk may have difficulty striking a shot against Spider-Man, she only needs to land one really good hit to win. Thanks to Gamora, she'll have great insight on strategies to use against a faster opponent.</p><p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-vs-spider-man-who-would-win/\">Wonder Woman Vs.

But with the group backed into a corner, super powered muscle Red Mist is prepared to take the fight to Superman. She's even indicated to her boss Ms. Leone that she's willing to target Superman's family, specifically one of the two <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/superboy/\">Superboys</a> - Jon Kent who is back from a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superboy-mon-el-legion-secret/\">future spent with the Legion of Superheroes</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-kents-remember-post-crisis-dc-universe/\">recently returned Conner Kent</a>.

However, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-marvel-comics-krakoa-no-sense/\">not every idea introduced</a> has been clearly explained, so it makes sense to take a look at some of the most confusing things from Hickman's run.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>‘A Man Called X’</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-has-a-new-dream.jpg' /></figure><p>Before <em>House of X</em>, Charles Xavier was last seen as a blonde-haired man called \"X\" following his fusion with Fantomex in Charles Soule and Gerardo Sandoval’s <em>Astonishing X-Men #</em>12. After declaring he was not Xavier and he had a new dream, X wouldn't appear again. However, Xavier is now back to normal, speaking with Moira MacTaggert in Hickman and Pepe Laraz’s <em>House of X #</em>2.</p><p>Throughout Hickman’s run, Xavier has been noticeably different, sporting an eerie new appearance and wearing a portable helmet version of Cerebro 24/7. The gap between X's last appearance and Xavier's reappearance in <em>House of X </em>has been oddly overlooked.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Moira MacTaggert’s Role</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/house-of-x-moira.jpeg' /></figure><p>The aforementioned <em>House of X</em> #2 retconned Moira MacTaggert into being a mutant.

Doug’s mutant genes make him a citizen of Krakoa, but Warlock is techno-organic, so he isn't. Hickman and R.B. Silva’s <em>Powers of X #2</em> sees Doug subtlety touch a flower and assimilate it with a piece of Warlock.</p><p>Doug’s appearances have been peppered with similar hints at Warlock’s existence, like when Cyclops briefly witnessed the two separate before finally revealing Warlock was stowing away on Doug’s arm, but what’s going on with them assimilating parts of Krakoa? These actions build suspicion around their intentions, and whether they are a friend or unsuspected foe.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Age of X-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Age-Of-X-Man-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Before <em>Dawn of X</em> established the current era of Mutant prosperity, the <em>Age of X-Man </em>event put mutants at their rock bottom. The event's alternate universe, created by Earth-295’s Nate Grey, created the illusion of peace on earth by transforming humans into mutants and placing false memories in everyone's head.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-xmen-blackbird-little-known-trivia/\">X-Men 10 Things Fans Should Know About The Blackbird</a></span></p><p>After the X-Men broke through the illusion and their memories were restored, Nate returned everyone to Earth-616. Hickman’s run began immediately after the<em> Age of X-Man </em>ended, with an added time jump to boot. While <em>House of X </em>and <em>Powers of X </em>filled in key events that led to Krakoa’s formation, there is no reference to the fallout from <em>Age of X-Man. </em>It seems likely that an occurrence of that magnitude would leave some sort of residual trauma.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Kitty Pryde’s ‘Condition’</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kitty-Pryde-Krakoa-Portal.jpg' /></figure><p>Kitty Pryde has <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/xmen-kitty-pryde-best-worst-mutant/\">long been a consistent presence</a> in the X- Men lineup, progressing from young student to school headmaster. While one would expect her history with the X-Men to ensure her importance in Krakoa, Kitty is unable to participate in the luxuries of Krakoa.</p><p>Gerry Duggan and Matteo Lolli's <em>Marauders #</em>1 shows Kitty unable to pass through the Krakoan gateway, but this doesn't stop Kitty, as she gathers up a crew and becomes a pirate. However, this leads to her murder <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-xmen-sebastian-shinobi-shaw-better-worse-comparison/\">at the hands of Sebastian Shaw</a> when he realizes she likely could not be resurrected. While the mutants are eventually able to bring her back with a little help from Emma Frost, it requires 16 attempts.

In Hickman and Pepe Larraz's <em>House of X #4</em> Wolverine, Cyclops, and Jean Grey all die, killing off <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-xtreme-xmen-strongest-members/\">the three biggest X-Men</a>. However, in the next issue, we are introduced to the Krakoan resurrection protocols that are used to bring them back, seemingly establishing that Mutants have solved death.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-marvel-asteroid-m-facts-fans-know/\">X-Men: 10 Facts About Asteroid M That Fans Should Know</a></span></p><p>Xavier states that they can do so by backing up a copy of every mutant's consciousness to Cerebro and then placing it in new replica clone bodies that are made by a group of mutants called \"The Five.\" While the details of the process have been explained, the philosophical and technical details have yet to be explored.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>The Timelines in Powers of X</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Powers-of-X-Nimrod-Omega-Sentinel.jpg' /></figure><p>While <em>House of X</em> was mostly rooted in the present-day early formation of Krakoa, the companion series <em>Powers of X</em> jumped between various timelines. Each timeline explores the future of mutants and humans post-Krakoa, painting a picture that gets grimmer as it progresses, with enemies such as technologically augmented humans and chimera mutant fusions.</p><p>But, since these timelines were explored in <em>Powers of X,</em> we have not seen them again. This may be because the timelines were only meant to be warnings, but they surely seemed more important than that. The initial missions in Hickman's <em>X-Men </em>book saw the team following leads on Nimrod, a robotic mutant-hunting Sentinel descendant who played a role in future timelines, but mentions of possible futures have since vanished.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Apocalypse’s Intentions</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/apocalypse-header-1.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the most eye-raising parts of Hickman's run has been the sudden camaraderie of both heroic and villainous mutants. The formation of Krakoa has led to some of the biggest X-Men villains working side-by-side with the team. No villain in this group has been more suspect than Apocalypse himself. Apocalypse has quickly become one of the most important leaders on Krakoa and has consistently shown himself to be acting in the nation's best interest.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-anatomy-magneto-body/\">X-Men Anatomy: 5 Weirdest Thing About Magneto's Body</a></span></p><p>However, that hasn't stopped some of the X-Men from questioning his intentions. While other former foes like Pyro and Magneto have carved a comfortable spot in Krakoa and quickly gained the respect and trust of their former foes, there are plenty of mutants keeping their guards up against Apocalypse, and with good reason.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>\"Make More Mutants\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Make-More-Mutants.jpg' /></figure><p>The formation of a new nation necessitates the creation of a body to govern it, leading to the formation of the Krakoan \"Quiet Council\" in Hickman and Larraz's <em>House of X #</em>6. When the council is creating laws, Nightcrawler declares they \"Make More Mutants,\" an obvious spin on the infamous <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-no-more-mutants-changed-marvel/\">\"No More Mutants\"</a> line. This law serves as motivation for mutants to procreate and thrive in ways they were not able to as an oppressed group. Yet, aside from a few mentions <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-gambit-rogue-best-worst-comic-couple/\">in a conversation between Rogue and Gambit</a>, the law is just another part of Hickman's run that has not resurfaced or gained traction.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Children of the Vault</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Children-of-the-Vault.jpg' /></figure><p>One plot thread that Hickman has pulled from X-Men lore is the group of the augmented humans The Children of the Vault. The Children were raised in a vault where time moves differently, accelerating evolutionary development. In Hickman and R.B. Silva’s <em>X-Men </em>#5, they are chased back into their vault, prompting Krakoa to send a team after them on a suicide mission.</p><p>Later, In Hickman and Russell Dauterman's <em>Giant-Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost </em>#1, it is revealed they also placed a bomb in Storm’s head, forcing Emma Frost and Jean Grey to operate. Both situations look bleak, and the impending threat from the Children is looming.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-x-men-things-fans-need-know-brood/\">X-Men: 10 Things You Need To Know About The Brood</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:30:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pjimage-27.jpg","linkMd5":"27e2b6afc1a989217ab009b9c68108e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn53@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-01-935_fdae102cacd96996.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":190152,"destBytes":190152,"author":"Jacob Nardone","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pjimage-27.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn53@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-01-935_fdae102cacd96996.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-has-a-new-dream.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-11-650_dc4790260b9bbf83.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/house-of-x-moira.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn51@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-09-461_5ef08e0c02c7c4c3.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/doug-ramsey-krakoa.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-10-224_7b4ba330c8ce098e.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Age-Of-X-Man-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-06-003_737c10c4fa5f1592.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kitty-Pryde-Krakoa-Portal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn74@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-07-147_ed6b7c7d70c20359.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-09-582_681ddce2347abea9.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Powers-of-X-Nimrod-Omega-Sentinel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-11-246_e803208b15c2686f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/apocalypse-header-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn17@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-08-221_75cc479ce3953d5a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Make-More-Mutants.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn22@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-13-263_47efa852479ab2c4.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Children-of-the-Vault.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-15-946_4c76b108adfe3d40.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700509},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"EXCLUSIVE Retro Doctor Doom Marvel Legends Figure Now Available HERE!","link":"https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-retro-doctor-doom-marvel-legends-figure/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EXCLUSIVE-Retro-ToyBiz-Inspired-Doctor-Doom-Marvel-Legends-Figure-Now-Available-HERE.jpg\"/></figure><p>It's Marvel Monday over at <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/entertainment-earth\">Entertainment Earth</a>, which means an amazing new figure from <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-legends/\">Marvel Legends</a> has been announced and is ready for pre-order!

Instead he <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/perfect-blue-perfect-ending-explored/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stalks them</a> -- all afternoon and evening.</p><p>The two attend a movie together (titled <em>The Redemption of a Twenty-Year-Old</em>) and go shopping, and Chizuru's clearly having a great time with the mystery guy. Kazuya grows increasingly despondent seeing their chemistry. The final nail in the coffin comes when he overhears Chizuru talking about making breakfast for him in the morning. Nearly all evidence suggests the two are in a serious relationship.</p><p>Kazuya has finally resolved to go home and leave them be when the mystery man, named Umi, goes into the restroom while Kazuya is there. Kazuya overhears him on the phone discussing topics like Chizuru's measurements, qualifications and how she'd be a great fit for an unspecified job. He concludes that Umi is a scam artist trying to lure Chizuru into a less than savory line of work, then later interrupts them as they are seemingly about to kiss in front of a giant <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lobo-christmas-special-homage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christmas</a> tree.</p><p>With the ensuing confusion and embarrassment building to a breaking point, Chizuru finally reveals the reason she works as a rental girlfriend: she's an <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/soap-opera-actress-supergirl-mary-jane-karen-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aspiring actress</a> who also attends an acting classes, and Umi is a fellow attendee. The lovey-dovey talk was the two of them rehearsing a script they'd been assigned, while Umi's suspicious phone call was actually him recommending Chizuru to a director he knew. As for the shopping, Chizuru was searching for the perfect gift to give Kazuya: a new phone case to protect the phone he'd broken while saving her from drowning.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/diary-of-our-days-at-the-breakwater-episode-8-who-needs-ocean/\">Diary of Our Days at the Breakwater: Who Needs the Ocean Anyway?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rent-A-Girlfriend-Kazuya-and-Chizuru-Christmas-Eve-Feature-Image.jpg\"/></figure><p>Interestingly, despite Kazuya admitting to stalking them, embarrassing her and forcing her to reveal her secret, Chizuru isn't that upset with him. Though she gives him a quick lecture, deep down she seems happy because his heart was in the right place and he was trying to look out for her. Other points earlier on -- her stoic look at seeing him locked in arms with Ruka, the happiness in her eyes when she selected his gift -- that show her feelings toward Kazuya are developing further.</p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em> has been light on the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-romance-anime-2020-so-far/\">heartfelt moments</a>, and when they do arrive, they're often swiftly followed by something comedic or a bumbling screwup. Here though, Kazuya receiving the phone case from Chizuru is a genuinely touching scene. It clearly means a lot to her to give it to him (even if she claims it's not a gift, but a thank you for saving her life), while Kazuya tears up in admitting it's the first time a girl has given him something meaningful at Christmas.</p><p>It's unclear where all this leaves Ruka, or why she was introduced in the first place if Kazuya can't even feign any serious interest in her. She doesn't seem to have a firm desire to out Kazuya or Chizuru, but she must know Kazuya's heart isn't fully invested in their blackmail-driven relationship. The long-kept secrets will surely come out at some point, but as Kazuya and Chizuru grow closer, the potential effects to their dynamic are changing thanks to some shared holiday joy.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/anime-distributors-can-follow-in-steams-footsteps-to-fight-piracy/\">Anime Distributors Can Follow in Steam's Footsteps to Fight Piracy</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:00:55 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rent-A-Girlfriend-Chizuru-and-Umi-Feature-Image.jpg","linkMd5":"d7999398bf433d2d385d5598c2dc3128","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-02-188_40e11df6bcf2dcb1.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":59240,"destBytes":59240,"author":"Joe Ballard","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rent-A-Girlfriend-Chizuru-and-Umi-Feature-Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-02-188_40e11df6bcf2dcb1.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rent-A-Girlfriend-Ruka-Going-Out-With-Kazuya.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn30@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-11-681_95c4a5e11540c3f8.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rent-A-Girlfriend-Kazuya-and-Chizuru-Christmas-Eve-Feature-Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-12-312_89bec498cbe9b57d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700507},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Batman Beyond: A DEVASTATING New Villain Does What Mr. Freeze Never Could","link":"https://www.cbr.com/batman-beyond-zeh-ro-mr-freeze/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Beyond-Zeh-Ro-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/batman-beyond\"><strong>Batman Beyond</strong></a><em><strong> #46, by Dan Jurgens, Sean Chen, Chris Sotomayor, Dave Wielgosz, Ben Abernathy and Travis Lanham, available now.</strong></em></p><p>In the world of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman\">Batman</a>, Mr. Freeze has been one of the Dark Knight's most formidable opponents, even if he's not as evil as Joker or Bane. He doesn't usually upset the status quo in terms of damaging the Bat-Family, but his tragic history gives him an emotional tug-of-war that often reminds Batman about humanity in them both.</p><p>Freeze's main ambition has always been to get funds to cure his wife, Nora, making him a sympathetic villain in most comics, cartoons and even the big screen. However, in <em>Batman Beyond</em> #46, a similar kind of criminal enacts a devastating Ice Age and achieves what Freeze never could.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-beyond-bruce-wayne-next-ras-al-ghul/\">Batman Beyond: Bruce Wayne Is Becoming the Next Ra's al Ghul</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/batman-beyond.jpg\"/></figure><p>This comes in the form of the ice-cold Zeh-Ro, Ra's al Ghul's disciple who took over the League of Assassins in a coup. Zeh-Ro was initially content being second-fiddle to Damian, just working as Ra's' top scientist in order to freeze the planet over, but soon lost faith.</p><p>Ra's knew he'd die before the plan came to fruition, so it was expected Damian would follow through. However, the Son of the Bat opted not to as he felt there was still good in the world. It clearly resonated from the brief time spent with Bruce and Zeh-Ro felt this made Ra's' legacy look weak. It's why he convinced the soldiers to attack Damian and Goliath, which led to them aligning with the new Bat-Family.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-beyond-just-used-guns/\">Batman Beyond: Bruce Wayne Just Broke One of His Biggest Rules</a></span></p><p>Zeh-Ro doesn't waste any time putting his plan into motion because within hours, as he launches his space fleet from al-Ghul's Arctic base, Earth begins to experience frigid conditions. As it freezes over, Bruce sends his charges to space via a Star Cruiser, and they discover how Zeh-Ro's getting the job done. He's using a space station and mini-satellites to block out the sun's rays, making the planet an icebox that'll kill all humans in a day or so. It's a smart plan because the station is well fortified, and the entire plot far outclasses the kind of similar thing that Mister Freeze used to do.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-batman-beyond.jpg\"/></figure><p>What's intimidating about Zeh-Ro is he has the genius of Freeze but also the guile of Ra's. He even lures Damian, Batwoman, Dick and Terry to a fake control room to jettison them into space, concluding a plot that was set up years before when he showed Ra's' grandson fake schematics.</p><p>Given his name and his affection for cold-based tech, there's even a chance that Zeh-Ro might be the son of Freeze and Nora in this universe. Freeze died at the hands of Blight in the animated episode, \"Meltdown,\" and Ra's may have raised Freeze'schild in secret.

While many fans consider the Goku Black arc to be when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">started to get good, the Universe 6 Tournament has a certain charm missing from every other arc in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball Super</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-manga-anime-similarities-differences/\">Dragon Ball: 5 Things They Changed From Dragon Ball Super To The Manga (&#38; 5 That Stayed The Same)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Universe 6 Tournament was our first real look at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s mythos, deliberately calling back to OG </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the process. Like Uranai Baba’s 5 on 5 exhibition, the Universe 6 Tournament saw the best fighters of Universes 7 and 6 going at it for the Super Dragon Balls. Although Universe 7 ultimately came out victorious, Goku and company came face to face with some of the oddest fights in the franchise. </span></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Son Goku Vs Botamo</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Botamo.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Universe 6 Tournament arc straddles a line between early </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s tone and the action of the Z-era. It’s debatable how well this balance works narratively and thematically, but it does lead to a comfortable atmosphere. Goku’s first fight against Botamo isn’t too exciting, but it plays out like a proper OG </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">match. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manga does an especially good job at capturing the tone of the early tournaments. Botamo is a gag villain through and through, but Goku strategizing around this fact is charming. Goku earning his victory by ring-out is a reminder that he knows how to handle a tournament setting. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Son Goku Vs Frost</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Super-Saiyan-Goku-vs-Frost.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Goku is fighting first should be a sign that not all is as it seems in the Universe 6 Tournament. Realistically, there’s just no way </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s first proper arc</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will let Goku either hog every match or bow out early. The fight against Frost tries to suggest the latter with Goku suddenly falling unconscious, but it’s clear something is amiss. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it’s revealed that Frost is fighting with poison, Goku is allowed to jump back into the fight. Instead of taking his former slot, however, Goku chooses to come after Vegeta– giving him an opportunity to study Hit when the time comes. As for Goku and Frost’s fight, it’s a big step up from Botamo, but the ending is anticlimactic. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Piccolo Vs Frost</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Frost-Frost-vs-Piccolo-Dragon-Ball-Super.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Goku defeated by Frost, Piccolo steps into the arena to fight on behalf of Universe 7. Unfortunately, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes it a point to mention how utterly outclassed Piccolo is. At best, he can do some damage on Frost, but he won’t be winning. It’s a detail that frankly holds the fight back. Piccolo can lose, but there’s no reason to spell it out. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-vs-super-which-series-better/\">Dragon Ball Z VS Dragon Ball Super: Which Series Is Better?</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worse is that Piccolo loses, but gets the chance to stay in the tournament. Instead of taking his rightful place in the arena, Piccolo forfeits so Vegeta can knock his way through four of Universe 6’s five fighters. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Vegeta Vs Frost</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Frost-Vegeta-vs-Frost-Dragon-Ball-Super.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegeta’s fight against Frost is really nothing special and just highlights how poor of an introduction to the Universe 6 Tournament arc Frost is. Botamo was unexciting, but his match at least brought some early </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">atmosphere. The fight against Frost just feels like a way of rearranging Universe 7’s playing field. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegeta knocks out Frost with a single punch, moving onto the next match. There’s no reason Piccolo couldn’t have beaten Frost and then lost to Magetta. That would have at least prevented the tournament from dedicating nearly half of its fights to Vegeta. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Vegeta Vs Magetta</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Magetta-vs-Vegeta-Dragon-Ball-Super.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Frost out of the way, however, the Universe 6 Tournament starts to really pick up. The fight against Magetta is one of the better matches in the arc, essentially an early </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gag</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">battle with the ridiculously powerful Vegeta as the leading man. It’s a genuinely exciting fight that forces Vegeta to strategize around his opponent. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When push comes to shove, though, Vegeta ends up winning the match by insulting the ultra sensitive Magetta. It’s a turn that feels appropriately </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and ends up leading into what is arguably Vegeta’s best bit of character development in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Vegeta Vs Cabba</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cabba-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabba is the best thing to happen to Vegeta since Future Trunks’ death. The amount of fresh characterization Vegeta shows when confronting Cabba is outstanding. When face to face with what the Saiyan race became without a Frieza enslaving them, Vegeta sees fit to bring out the full potential he knows is lurking inside of Cabba. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-manga-best-chapters/\">Dragon Ball Super: 10 Best Chapters Of The Manga (So Far)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegeta does this the only way he knows how– by being a callous monster– but it’s enough to trigger Super Saiyan in Cabba, along with a chain reaction that has Cabba teaching other U6 Saiyans the technique. Vegeta shows Cabba a flash of Super Saiyan Blue before taking him out, urging Cabba to keep training &#38; showing an important new side to the prince of all Saiyans. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Vegeta Vs Hit</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vegeta-vs-Hit-Dragon-Ball-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vegeta’s defeat at the hands of Hit is a bit different between the anime and manga. In the anime, Vegeta’s overwhelmed by Hit’s time skip, unable to fight back even in Super Saiyan Blue. In the manga, Vegeta triggering Super Saiyan Blue while fighting Cabba drains so much of his energy that even God Ki can’t defend him from Hit. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hit clobbers Vegeta into submission in both adaptations, ruining the prince’s winning streak right at the finale. While Vegeta leaves the arena confused over how he lost, Goku’s seen enough to start devising a plan around Hit’s mysterious abilities. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Son Goku Vs Hit</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Goku-vs-Hit.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goku’s fight against Hit is also different between mediums, but far more significantly than Vegeta’s. In the anime, Hit gradually becomes more powerful as Goku tries to outmaneuver his time skip. Goku is forced to combine Kaioken with Super Saiyan Blue to fight back. He’s able to fight evenly with Hit, but he’s forced to turn off Kaioken, prematurely end the fight, and forfeit on his own terms.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the manga, Goku goes through every stage of Super Saiyan while fighting off Hit’s time skip. Hit never becomes more powerful and Goku is able to gain the upper hand by overwhelming the assassin with Super Saiyan Blue. Although he would have won, Goku forfeits the match regardless as he realizes Hit wasn’t fighting at full power with the intent to kill. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Monaka Vs Hit</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monaka-Punched-Dragon-Ball-Super.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With every member of Universe 7 down for the count (Buu is disqualified as the fifth fighter in both adaptations,) Monaka is left to fight Hit. Monaka was always supposed to be a tool Beerus hyped up to motivate Goku and Vegeta. The intent was never for him to fight. In truth, Monaka is pitifully weak.

No one was going to care for him as his true family had done in the past. His creator saw him as nothing more than a pawn, and his fellow spiders only followed him out of fear rather than love. <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/kohkii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kohkii</a> captures a lot of that melancholy here, Rui looking dead inside as he stares up at his webbing dancing before his eyes.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Instability</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rui-Demon-Slaye-6.jpg' /></figure><p>Rui was an incredibly unstable character whose desires didn't at all align with his actions.

The legs sprouting from his back are almost translucent, blending into the background so nicely that you'd think they were nearly an apparition. His eyes are more prototypical anime style too, very wide and large, giving you a full view of the intricate design his eyes have. The colors are also so bright and vivid.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>I See You</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rui-Demon-Slaye-8.jpg' /></figure><p>The fact <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/heroinecreative\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heroinecreative</a> chose to do such an up-close image of Rui means the detail needs to be impeccable and it is here. The coloring of the eyes is so bright, eyelashes matching perfectly with the fingernail polish. It's close enough that you can see the lashes themselves as well. That pose makes it look like Rui is staring through his fingers like it's a microscope, examining his prey with the same cold demeanor a mad scientist would have.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Tears</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rui-Demon-Slaye-9-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Judging from his eyes, this piece by <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/kumasan0214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kumasan0214 </a>is from the early parts of Rui's transformation, when he was first granted the ability to walk and move around. It's hard to know if those tears are from that fact or something else, as it seems like his parents are behind him. It's a rare image that shows Rui before he became the full-fledged demon seen in the show. It almost makes you <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tragic-sad-villain-origins-ranked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feel bad</a> for him, knowing how badly his image of a family was twisted.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Join Me</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rui-Demon-Slaye-10.jpg' /></figure><p>The interesting part of Rui's character wasn't his powers or even the fact he was one of the lower moons, it's that he yearned to have Nezuko as a sister, obsessing over the fact. He was always looking to bring people into his fold, no matter what. It's why him being a spider demon worked so well. <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/katrinci\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Katrinci</a> does a great job of showing some of that yearning in his eyes, and with the fact, the web is spread so far between his fingertips, ready to trap those he wants to keep.

She-Hulk was there when the Fantastic Four first encounter Terminus, an alien that battled the Celestials themselves. Her incredible strength helps stop Terminus from obliterating the planet, though it's ultimately Reed Richards who puts the villain down.

Most of the series’ combat revolves around fairly traditional martial arts, with an increase in Ki attacks and spectacle as the story matured. Most every character has a signature Ki attack, but very few have a signature weapon. Which isn’t to say </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hasn’t had its share of weapon wielding warriors.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ultimate-butoden-dragon-ball-games-never-heard-of/\">Ultimate Butoden &#38; 9 Other Dragon Ball Games You’ve Never Heard Of</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Goku was originally designed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a weapon in mind. Before Goku began learning martial arts under Roshi, he fought with the Nyoibo– </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball</a></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s signature weapon. But he wasn’t the only character to wield a weapon. With a preference towards swords &#38; staffs, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-super\">Dragon Ball</a> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has featured a surprising number of weapons for characters throughout the years. </span></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Son Goku (Nyoibo)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/power-pole.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nyoibo– also known as the Power Pole in Funimation’s English dub– is a weapon Goku inherited from his grandfather, Gohan, before the start of the series. Along with his tail, the Nyoibo is one of Goku’s defining features in the first story arc. The first proper martial arts fight in the series even includes Goku clashing the Nyoibo against Yamcha’s Liuyedao. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Nyoibo would be understandably sidelined for the 21st Tenkaichi Budokai, Goku used it a few times in the Red Ribbon Army arc. After this point, Goku’s focus on martial arts meant he didn’t need to use the Nyoibo as a weapon anymore. The last time the Nyoibo is used in the manga is when Goku connects Karin Tower to God’s Palace. The last time it’s seen, however, is on Goku’s back when he reunited with everyone at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Yamcha (Liuyedao)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yamcha-vs-Goku.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A desert bandit, it only makes sense Yamcha is introduced with a weapon. While he has access to the Roga Fufu Ken– one of the first named techniques in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– his first fight sees heavy use of his Liuyedao. Yamcha never uses his Liuyedao again following his battle with Goku, but it’s an exciting introduction to the character. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yamcha also busts out a rocket launcher at one point, taking out the Dragon Team’s car. As </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued and Yamcha faded into the background, there would be less &#38; less opportunities for him to use weapons. Virtually all of Yamcha’s battles after this point are fought in tournament settings. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Master Roshi (Staff)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dragon-Ball-Master-Roshi-Buff.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A martial arts master, it makes sense Master Roshi wouldn’t need to fight with a weapon. In fact, throughout the original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the only time he ever uses his staff as a weapon is in his brief fight against Captain Dock &#38; his men during the Red Ribbon Army arc. Come </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, and you’d think Roshi’s staff was a key part of his skill set. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-piccolo-bests-fights-original-series/\">Dragon Ball: Piccolo’s Best Fight In Every Arc (In The Original Series)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resurrection F </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Moro arc feature Roshi using his staff to fight opponents. While this does make sense in some capacity considering Roshi is far outclassed by the current Dragon Team, the manga’s Universe Survival arc does go to greath lengths to showcase Roshi’s skill in light of his age. Either way, it’s a means of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to get interesting choreography out of a character who stopped fighting at the Piccolo Daimao arc. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Son Gohan (Sword)</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gohan-with-sword.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gohan very briefly wields a sword in the Saiyan arc, but it’s almost iconic to the character– if only because it’s paired with a demonic version of Goku’s own gi. In the manga, Gohan only ever uses the sword to cut off a dinosaur’s tail, the story skipping past most of Gohan’s time in the wild. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anime revels in this period of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">history, though, showcasing almost everything Gohan went through in order to begin training with Piccolo. Gohan’s sword is as much a weapon as it is a tool, and it’s even comparable to Goku’s early relationship with the Nyoibo. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Future Trunks (Sword)</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dragon-Ball-Z-Kakarot-Future-Trunks.png' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the hand blasters used by Frieza’s men, the next time a weapon is seen after Gohan’s sword in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">isn’t until Future Trunks’ introduction in the Cell arc. Despite being a spacebound story, the Namek arc is pure martial arts from start to finish. Trunks’ sword introduces a new edge to combat that had been missed. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paired with his sheer tenacity, Trunks makes excellent use of his sword– cutting Frieza into pieces before obliterating him with a Ki attack. Unfortunately, Trunks’ sword is shattered during the fight with the Artificial Humans. 18 grabs the blade and shatters it before Trunks can do much of anything. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Dabra (Dadao)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dabura.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though he doesn’t use his dadao enough to be associated with it (his signature attack is petrifying spit, after all,) Dabra’s sword is still an iconic part of his character design. The King of Hell wielding a dadao only makes sense. It’s just a pity he doesn’t get to use it all that much before he ultimately dies. </span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-z-gohan-vs-goku-better-protagonist/\">Dragon Ball Z: 5 Reasons Why Gohan Should’ve Been The Protagonist (&#38; 5 Reasons Why Goku Was Good Enough)</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dabra uses his sword against Gohan and later Majin Buu, but the blade does nothing to his opponent both times. In the case of Gohan, their fight ends shortly after the fact. With Buu, the Djinn turns Dabra into a cookie &#38; eats him almost immediately. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Son Gohan (Z-Sword)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dragon-Bal-Z-Gohan-Destroys-Z-Sword.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toriyama’s passion for swords rear their head in the Majin Buu arc, with Gohan even pulling out a weapon right out of Arthurian Legend on Kaioshin’s home world. Stuck in its pedestal, the Z Sword is deemed too heavy to be pulled out, but Gohan’s able to force his way through the ordeal by turning Super Saiyan. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Z Sword is set up as the weapon destined to defeat Majin Buu, so having it break in two makes for quite a shock. That said, the destruction leads to Rou Kaioshin’s unsealing. While the elder Kaioshin is able to unlock Gohan’s latent potential, Evil Buu is one step ahead of the Dragon Team and the Z Sword’s efforts go to waste. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Future Trunks (Super Sword)</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Future-Trunks-with-his-Sword-of-Hope.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gohan, Future Trunks gets to wield the Z Sword during his Majin Buu crisis. It also breaks, but Dabra’s petrification shatters the blade completely, presumably killing the Rou Kaioshin. Trunks loses the Z Sword in the process, but he’s able to defeat both Dabra and Bobbidi before Majin Buu can be revived. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some time after, Trunks manages to get his hands on a wider blade that he uses throughout all of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The sword breaks during his fight against Zamasu and Goku Black near the end of the arc, but the anime has Trunks channel what seems to be Genki into the sword in order to land the finishing blow on Merged Zamasu. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Merus (Angel Staff)</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Merus-vs-Moro.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the Galactic Patrolmen use blasters to make up for their lack of Ki, but Merus was in a league of his own. Of course, this only ended up being the case because Merus is actually an angel. With the Moro arc nearing its conclusion, Merus recently gave his life in an attempt to teach Goku Ultra Instinct one last time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his fight with Moro, Merus uses his angel staff as a weapon– ranging from a spear, to a sniper rifle. Merus’ battle makes for some of the best fight choreography </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has had in a while and a large reason why is the creative use of his angel staff.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-manga-anime-similarities-differences/\">Dragon Ball: 5 Things They Changed From Dragon Ball Super To The Manga (&#38; 5 That Stayed The Same)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:30 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dbw-fi.jpg","linkMd5":"1e307c75b59b872199e791a53216dd14","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-02-277_ac8f3091564a69f2.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":116922,"destBytes":116922,"author":"Renan Fontes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dbw-fi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-02-277_ac8f3091564a69f2.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/power-pole.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn54@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-08-300_5530a2592eefc032.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yamcha-vs-Goku.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-09-783_4ae7838a72b25738.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dragon-Ball-Master-Roshi-Buff.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-12-967_55ed3dc7e0366f80.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gohan-with-sword.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn14@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-11-650_bd648ea3502e1d3b.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dragon-Ball-Z-Kakarot-Future-Trunks.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-10-402_b3dda29ae15dc9db.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dabura.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn42@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-07-556_57037f0adbcf0e1a.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dragon-Bal-Z-Gohan-Destroys-Z-Sword.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn88@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-16-253_96701bbce1a8f539.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Future-Trunks-with-his-Sword-of-Hope.jpg":null,"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Merus-vs-Moro.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn65@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-07-116_de8263efb9fc78e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700504},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Shonen Jump’s Cancellation of Time Paradox Ghostwriter Is Unsurprising","link":"https://www.cbr.com/shonen-jumps-cancellation-of-time-paradox-ghostwriter-is-unsurprising/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/time-paradox-ghostwriter.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/time-paradox-ghostwriter/\"><em>Time Paradox Ghostwriter</em></a> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ_manga/status/1298554498672197632?s=20\">reportedly been axed</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/shonen-jump/\"><em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em></a>. It's been a controversial series since it began serialization, with a vocal fanbase making their dislike of the series' exploration of plagiarism known. The author, Kenji Ichima, was forced to disable replies on social media due to negative comments about the series. What adds to the discourse is that the main character, a male creator, steals the work of a young girl who spends over a decade trying to perfect a story that she can be proud of and is excited to show other people.

The beginning of this series shows the inner workings of how <em>Shonen Jump</em>, and other manga publishers, operate behind the scenes. The audience sees the many challenges that comes with getting a published one-shot, much less a full running series, putting them on full display and giving readers a renewed appreciation for their favorite manga, the mangaka behind them and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-you-can-support-anime-industry/\">the entire team who work hard </a>to get a new chapter out every week. Teppei's struggles as a creator are also very realistic, trying to find his unique voice as an artist as he resiliently tries to live out his dream while trying to make ends meet.</p><p>The series takes a turn when he finally finds success by plagiarizing \"White Knight,\" the work of a young girl named Itsuki Aino, when a microwave time machine sends Teppei her groundbreaking manga from 10 years in the future. Teppei recognizes that what he's doing is wrong, but reasons that it's somehow okay to steal Itsuki's hard work and creativity, even trying to trace her artwork at one point to replicate her success. No, he does not accept profit from the manga due to feeling terrible about his actions, but that still doesn't change the fact that he does it for personal gain' recognition, praise and prestige are all still forms of payment. Itsuki surrenders the 'White Knight' story to Teppei and becomes determined to create another <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/manga\">manga </a>that can surpass it. To top it all off, Itsuki is going to die from exhaustion due to overworking herself as a manga artist and Teppei has to somehow prevent this by plagiarizing some more.</p><p>Although this type of story did not sit well with readers, there is still some merit to it. <em>Shonen Jump's </em>usual fare are action-packed stories with powerful, immutable heroes. a few exceptions like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-promised-neverland/\"><em>The Promised Neverland</em></a>, but <em>Time Paradox Ghostwriter</em> is a shonen-supernatural series that fans of the manga magazine don't typically get to see serialized. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/shonen-jump-manga-titles-canceled/\">Despite its short run </a>and controversial topic of choice, <em>Time Paradox Ghostwriter</em> had great visuals and a premise that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/shonen-protagonists-changed-for-the-better/\">broke the cookie cutter <em>Shonen Jump</em> formula</a>.

However, when the topic turns to inclusiveness, some <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>fans become decidedly unwilling to allow others to play the game how they want.</p><p>Recently, a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dd-fan-created-combat-wheelchair-inclusivity/\">fan made creation combat wheelchair</a>, which allows players to create a character who uses a wheelchair for their <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>game, went viral. Such <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-build-campaign-first-town/\">homebrews that change aspects</a> of <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>have been a key part of the game and it's community for years, because the gameplay system is meant to be malleable and allow for changes that fit a player's wants and desires. While most were positive about the combat wheelchair, a number of players argued the rule-set wasn't in the spirit of the game.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-mythic-odysseys-theros-pantheon/\">D&#38;D: Who Are the Gods in the Pantheon of Theros?</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dnd-press-tasha-cover-header.png\"/></figure><p><em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>is fundamentally about gathering with a group of friends and creating a fun experience that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/1296481985959989253?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lead Designer Jeremy Crawford</a>, \"weave fantasy tales for our mutual bliss.\" In a fantasy world in which anything can happen, the idea of limiting what one can do because of an erroneous perception that the rules do not allow for it directly violates the spirit of the game. Instead, it's the responsibility of players to find ways to help those around them enjoy the game to the utmost. Choosing to police accessibility by telling someone that their character cannot reflect the existence and experience of someone in the real world in a novel way that fits with <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons</em>' fantasy setting is ridiculous.</p><p>Critiques like those received by the combat wheelchair are all too common in nerd/geek spaces, which often find ways to exclude people for their gender identity, sexual preference and/or race. However, <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>should be a space free from such concerns and instead allow players to approach the game no matter who they are. Through the magic of imagination, all things are possible, and to choose to limit what one can do based on ableist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic and/or racist basis are entirely at odds with the very reason so many love <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons</em>, which is its ability to facilitate stories and experiences.</p><p>This isn't to say <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>has always been a model of inclusivity. Until 1989's <em>Advanced Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>2nd Edition, the game contained fundamental differences between men and women that play heavily into notions of gender essentialism. Those were later done away with, and <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/enword_gary_gygax_qa_threads/enweggqa08_djvu.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creator Gary Gygax</a> noted the idea \"doesn't make a great deal of sense\" in a fantasy game. Race has also been an issue for quite a while, with the game potentially turning people off due to white supremacist notions inherent in its depiction of various races. For its part,<em> Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>publisher <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-and-dragons-representation-inclusivity-plans/\">Wizards of the Coast is also taking steps</a> to address the game's problematic approach to race.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wwe-xavier-woods-dungeons-dragons-pax-online-panel/\">WWE's Xavier Woods Headlines Dungeons &#38; Dragons PAX Online Panel</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dungeons-Dragons-Evil.jpg\"/></figure><p>Despite resistance from some segments of the fanbase, the future of <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>is inclusivity. Wizards of the Coast has had a lot of success in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-and-dragons-why-5e-successful-new-players/\">bringing new players into fifth edition</a>, due in part both to the prevalence of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-actual-play-shows-boosting-lgbtq-representation/\">actual-play shows</a> and this increased focus on inclusivity. The very makers of the game understand that to police accessibility and keep people away from <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons</em> by not allowing them to do stories their way is ridiculous and not the way forward.</p><p>Fundamentally, <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>is a gameplay system designed to facilitate adventures in a fantasy world that is <em>whatever </em>a group makes of it. The game is not a static document to which one needs to adhere religiously. Instead, <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>is designed to undergo revisions and to change. The beauty of the game is not in dogmatically following the rules, but deciding when the system can be improved to better facilitate the needs and wants of the group. Policing accessibility does not uphold some nebulous Platonic Ideal about what <em>Dungeons &#38; Dragons </em>is and isn't. Rather, it violates the most fundamental tenets of the game: Pursue your bliss and help others find theirs.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-tashas-cauldron-everything-sourcebook/\">Dungeons &#38; Dragons Announces Tasha's Cauldron of Everything Sourcebook</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:15:51 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dungeon-and-dragons.jpg","linkMd5":"77f86dfe253e12a903a61822453ce8fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn77@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-03-180_df871c2c67879253.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":88218,"destBytes":88218,"author":"Liam Nolan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dungeon-and-dragons.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn77@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-03-180_df871c2c67879253.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dnd-press-tasha-cover-header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn58@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-14-587_f5994df6ecebbb8b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dungeons-Dragons-Evil.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn50@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-11-800_3a8de88503199c75.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700509},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Punisher: 5 Times He Went Full Villain (& 5 Evil Villains He Killed)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/punisher-times-he-was-a-villain-vs-foes-he-felled-mandarin-barracuda-kasyckla/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/punisher-feature-5-villains-killed-n-5-times-he-was-one-Cropped.jpg\"/></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-punisher/\">Punisher </a>was always a morally grey character.

Bobo is immune, since the Anti-Life virus only infects people, as he says its progenitors were too arrogant, thinking animals weren't important enough to wipe out.

The most we might do is call vector control but in the DCU, if mosquitoes were spreading this disease, people would be quicker to look to villains like the Joker or Lex Luthor. Bobo's point is that mosquitoes are taken for granted as they can cover so much ground and exist almost anywhere. They don't need specific conditions, so they can transmit a virus in places as diverse as murky lagoons, cold office spaces, dark alleys or superhero secret hideouts.</p><p>While Bob is making a cheeky statement here, it's also an indictment on why animals should be taken seriously, especially mosquitoes.

Mike proved to be a useful tool for Daredevil over the years, with Matt using the alias to go undercover as a crook more than once. However, while working with the Inhuman Reader to try and bring down Wilson Fisk, Mike was accidentally manifested in the real world by Reader's abilities. Matt initially intended for Reader to erase this fragment, but Matt eventually decided that he wanted to give Mike the chance to live. Mike quickly ended up separated from his brother and began working for the Hood, at the recommendation of Wilson Fisk, the former Kingpin and current Mayor of New York.</p><p>Formerly a member of Norman Osborn's Cabal and the kingpin of his own superpowered gang, the Hood has been quietly reasserting his power in the New York criminal underworld, partly by recovering the Asgardian Nord Stones that previously empowered him. Using their time together as a means to get close to Hood, the two quickly seem to become friends. But it's all a trick, leading to Mike finding out where the Hood hides the Nord Stone and even the combination to the safe. Mike is able to get ahold of books detailing the use of objects like the Nord Stone, allowing Mike to access the reality-bending attributes of the Asgardian artifact and ensure his existence.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-matt-murdock-suits-up/\">Daredevil: Why Matt Murdock Officially Suits Up Again</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Hood-1.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-annual-mike-murdock-history/\">This changes reality</a> so that Mike always actually existed as a living, breathing brother to Matt Murdock. But it also doesn't change the fact that Mike worked with the Hood and openly betrayed him. When Daredevil approaches him later, he reveals that the Hood is looking for Mike and is on the warpath, seeking revenge for his theft. Daredevil's own personal issues with his upcoming manslaughter trial will keep him from being able to fully protect his brother, but it's unlikely that a good man like Daredevil will be able to turn his back on his newly established brother.</p><p>This means Matt might soon fight himself dealing with a former Avengers-level threat in pursuit of saving a brother who intends to help take over the criminal side of New York City. While Mike has his new ally Butch -- who's apparently the son of Wilson Fisk -- there's a chance that Mike still also has access to the Nord Stone. Although the artifact appears exhausted of any energy after he affects reality, it's still a potentially valuable tool. While it wouldn't be surprising if the reality-bending effects of his choice drained it of power, it would just make the Hood even more furious with his former partner. The beginnings of a new gang war in New York might be brewing, and Mike's choices put Daredevil directly into the sights of the Hood.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/empyre-wolverine-spider-man-marvel-event/\">Empyre: How Wolverine &#38; Spider-Man Get Drafted Into The Marvel Event</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 21:20:36 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Daredevil-Costume-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"7bf973f922a78df062b2a8651fe60705","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn18@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-00-719_69c62ab61be41252.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":113622,"destBytes":113622,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Daredevil-Costume-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn18@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-00-719_69c62ab61be41252.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Daredevil-Mike-Murdock-Hood.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-12-321_f4caeebd640ceb23.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Hood-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn13@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-07-230_389ac314039e5699.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700505},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"The Green Lantern: Liam Sharp Says Series Is Grant Morrison's Last DC Work, Ever","link":"https://www.cbr.com/green-lantern-grant-morrison-last-dc-work-ever/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Green-Lantern-Corps-Liam-Sharp.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-green-lantern/\">The Green Lantern</a></em> artist Liam Sharp revealed the series' Season 2 conclusion will also be a wrap for writer <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/grant-morrison/\">Grant Morrison's</a> career with DC.</p><p>Sharp responded to a fan asking about a possible Season 3, tweeting, \"It was always planned as two seasons of twelve issues each, so that’ll be it.

Of course, since Mountain Dew is a PepsiCo product, he could end up attracting the attention of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/most-powerful-japanese-comic-characters-ranked/\">Japanese superhero</a> and Pepsi mascot Pepsiman, who’d no doubt disapprove of Bane Doing the Dew for evil.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>“Villainy Mix: BANECROCODILE” By Gingashi</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Villainy-Mix-Banecrocodile-fan-art-by-Gingashi.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/gingashi/art/Villainy-Mix-BANECROCODILE-100694513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Original image</a> from <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/gingashi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gingashi's DeviantArt page</a>.</p><p>Bane and Killer Croc are <em>not</em> friends.

One highly notable change is the Venom delivery system, whose wrist device no longer connects to the back of his head.</p><p>Whether this means Bane is off the drug or has changed Venom’s transfer method is unknown, as he has often worn his Venom equipment even when no longer taking it.

Not only is this endearing and downright adorable, but <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/takashidaimao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Takashidaimo</a> made it even cuter by drawing this piece of Melissa resting on All Might's arm while he and her father converse.</p><p>It's no wonder that Melissa sticks so firmly to her ideals of wanting to be someone's hero despite being quirkless since she would have had All Might as a pretty close role model from such a young age.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Wide-Eyed Fascination</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/My-Hero-Academia-Melissa-Shield-Fascinated.jpg' /></figure><p>Melissa's expressive, curious personality makes her quite the joy to witness on-screen, and <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/mikazukiblue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MikazukiBlue</a> captures her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes perfectly.

The choice to include the markers that they used in the picture is a great touch, and they even include a version that only showcases the art itself in case viewers want it in more detail. The marker coloring looks great, and Melissa's shining golden hair is especially well-captured.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Deer In The Headlights</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Melissa is a bright, beaming ball of sunshine throughout her appearances in the first movie, which makes the duality of seeing her terrified of the unknown quite interesting.

This leads them to once again start bouncing through time. However, as a result of the comedian's death in 2008, Rufus isn't there to guide the heroes. Still, <em>Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music </em>pays homage to Carlin in a great way.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bill-ted-face-music-interview-ed-solomon-chris-matheson/\">Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music's Ed Solomon &#38; Chris Matheson Break Down the Long-Awaited Sequel</a></span></p><p>Kelly -- Rufus' daughter -- instead serves as the Wyld Stallyns' guide, which is a nice touch to keep a connection to Carlin's character in the film. While it's fitting she is the one who first escorts the heroes forward through time, the Stallyns eventually come face to face with Rufus' past and his wife, along with the iconic phone booth.</p><p>Bill and Ted first encounter their old time travelling phone booth when they're brought to the future.

The Rufus' widow, played by Holland Taylor, is now the future’s Ultimate Leader. She is the prime antagonist for Bill and Ted, whom she has lost faith in to record the song that will save them all. Having Taylor’s character is a nice and easy way to keep the feeling of having Carlin around in these scenes.</p><p>Carlin’s presence in the films always gave the impression that he was like the band's road manager of sorts. He was the one guiding the boys towards their destiny to save everyone. When not bestowing them with encouragement, gifts and matchmaking advice, Carlin always seemed to be going along with Bill and Ted in spirit. 12 years after his death, in a very heartwarming way, he is still there in spirit, tagging along for their final journey.</p><p><em>Directed by Dean Parisot and written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music stars Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, Anthony Carrigan, Kid Cudi, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Samara Weaving.

To make matters worse, the Clown Prince of Crime has unleashed a \"zombie\" army, and Batman is forced to take a page out of a real bat's playbook.</p><p>So far the Joker War has been an increasing set of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-joker-war-dark-knight-clown-prince-dynamic/\">terrible scenarios for Bruce Wayne</a>. First, the locations of his micro-caves were tortured out of Lucius Fox by the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker/\">Joker</a>. Next, he was dosed with a three-part chemical cocktail of Joker toxin, venom and the Scarecrow's fear toxin before discovering that the Joker had successfully stolen (as well as repainted) all of his vehicles and gadgets. Finally, the Joker unveiled an army of dead Jokerized victims that have been reanimated using nanobots and uses them to attack Batman.</p><p>In <em>Batman</em> #97, the third issue of \"Joker War,\" picks up with Batman attempting to fend off these pseudo zombies in the Monarch theatre - which is, of course, the site of his childhood trauma - while the Joker taunts him from the big screen.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/joker-war-batman-arkham-games-cues/\">Joker War Takes Terrifying Cue From Arkham Games</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-blindfolded.png\"/></figure><p>If all of this wasn't bad enough it is made incredibly apparent that Punchline's special blend is still working it's twisted magic on Batman's nervous system, causing extreme visual hallucinations which make it nearly impossible for him to put up a fight against the grinning reanimated horde. Being the Dark Knight, however, he has one more trick up his sleeve, or on his cloak to be precise. Realizing that he cannot fight with his eyes playing tricks on him, Bruce tears a strip from his cloak and ties it over his eyes. He then relies on his other senses in order to come out on top of the brawl. While this blindfolded fighting move has been seen in a variety of different stories the idea of the blind fighter is probably best represented by Marvel's Daredevil.</p><p>Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, unlike Batman, is actually blind and relies on his other senses (which are supernaturally heightened) in order to perceive the world around him. This is relatively well-represented in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hawkeye-vs-bullseye-invokes-netflix-daredevil-series/\">Netflix's now-defunct <em>Daredevil</em> series</a> as well as more recent issues of his comic. The black blindfold is a semi iconic look for Daredevil and is featured in both the Netflix series and more recent Daredevil comics.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-joker-war-clownhunter-gotham-vigilante/\">Joker War Turns Clown Hunter Into Gotham's Deadliest Vigilante</a></span></p><p>While there may be a nod to a Marvel hero here, the idea of fighting based primarily on sound is fitting for Batman as well, since he's not unlike an actual bat using echolocation. He references this himself saying that a bat should be able to fight blind while managing to still look menacing with a piece of cloth over his eyes. Of course, he doesn't finish the fight simply via his own martial arts skills but instead with the use of a hand-held EMP which shuts down the nanobots and returns the Jokerized corpses to being just that once again.</p><p>Even with the obvious differences in consideration, it speaks to Batman's skill and training that he is able to quickly adopt a new set of fighting abilities inspired by the creatures that famously inspired him to take up his war on crime.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-long-halloween-guide/\">Batman: The Long Halloween - A Complete Guide to DC's Most Puzzling Mystery</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:20:35 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Joker-War-hallucination.jpg","linkMd5":"f6d590ace090d0934270d3836e81380e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-784_ee32fba3817b0857.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":137174,"destBytes":137174,"author":"Carter Burrowes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Joker-War-hallucination.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-01-784_ee32fba3817b0857.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-blindfolded.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-15-899_6356ce70f57402d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Charlie Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things Is Mind-Bending Nonsense","link":"https://www.cbr.com/charlie-kaufman-im-thinking-of-ending-things-review/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>What things, exactly, are the protagonist of Charlie Kaufman’s <em><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/im-thinking-of-ending-things/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’m Thinking of Ending Things</a></em> thinking of ending? When the character, played by Jessie Buckley, first speaks those words in voiceover in the opening moments of the movie, it sounds like she’s contemplating suicide. But Kaufman soon introduces the young woman’s boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons), and her inner monologue about their relationship shifts the meaning of those initial words, making it seem like she’s thinking of ending her romance with this man she doesn’t feel connected to. As the movie goes on, though, growing increasingly surreal and disjointed, it’s easy to wonder if this woman is actually thinking of ending all space and time.</p><p>Kaufman, of course, provides no easy answers, and anyone familiar with the filmmaker’s work wouldn’t expect him to. Especially since he started directing his own screenplays, Kaufman has specialized in the inscrutable, in movies that filter emotions through bizarre metaphysical scenarios and challenge the audience to establish connections with the characters. Adapted from the 2016 novel by Iain Reid, <em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em> is just as confounding as Kaufman’s previous directorial efforts, 2008’s <em>Synecdoche, New York</em> and 2015’s <em>Anomalisa</em>, with a central couple whose relationship is constantly in flux, an unreliable narrator and a plot that is constantly shifting direction.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/raised-by-wolves-review-ridley-scott/\">Ridley Scott Comes to TV With Eerie Sci-Fi Drama Raised by Wolves</a></span></p><p>It’s impressively ambitious and strange, but it’s often tedious to watch, especially during the long car-trip sequences in which Jake and his girlfriend (whose name may be Lucy or Lucia or Louisa or Amy) talk in circles, quoting literature and philosophy and film at each other without ever communicating anything. Their inability to understand each other is part of the point, but their conversations are tedious rather than illuminating, and there’s no insight into intimacy or their individual mental states.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-david-thewlis-toni-collette.jpg\"/></figure><p>Lucy (or whatever her name is) narrates the movie incessantly, sometimes the dialogue even interrupts her voiceover, but she doesn’t seem to have an actual personality since the details of her life constantly change. She may be a poet, a painter or a physicist, but the poem she recites is actually a piece by Canadian poet Eva H.D. and the paintings she shows off come from museum prints. When she tries to make a point about a John Cassavetes movie, she just recites a Pauline Kael review verbatim.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-david-thewlis-reveals-sequels-hes-in/\">Avatar: David Thewlis Reveals Which of the Sequels He's In</a></span></p><p>Jake and Lucy spend so much time in the car because they’re on a trip to meet his parents, who are also never named and are played by Toni Collette and David Thewlis. Once they arrive at the remote family farmhouse, everything there keeps changing, too. Jake’s parents are middle-aged and chatty, and then they’re elderly, suffering from dementia and barely able to get out of bed or feed themselves. Later, his mom is young, picking up toys that she says are Jake’s. Lucy doesn’t understand any of this, although Jake seems to just go with it, or perhaps he's used to the slippery nature of time in his home.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-jessie-buckley.jpg\"/></figure><p>All of this uncertainty makes it impossible to get a handle on any of the characters, and while Buckley and Plemons give committed performances, Jake and Lucy never come across as actual people. Collette and Thewlis are suitably creepy as Jake’s parents, and the segment of the movie that takes place at the farmhouse features plenty of horror-movie elements, including an ominous locked basement with scratches on the door and evasive anecdotes about dead pigs. But <em>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</em> isn’t a horror movie, or even a meta deconstruction of horror movies, and Jake and Lucy spend less than half the movie with Jake’s parents.</p><p>Then they’re back on the road, stopping at a desolate ice cream stand in the middle of a snow storm, and eventually at Jake’s old high school, where the movie turns from surreal into complete nonsense, albeit nonsense that is artfully crafted and often mesmerizing. There have been flashes throughout the movie of an older janitor (Guy Boyd) at this same school, and that janitor may be Jake himself, or a manifestation of some aspect of his personality. Kaufman stages an entire dream ballet, the abstract style of dance sequence popular in classic movie musicals like <em>An American in Paris</em> and <em>Oklahoma!</em>, in the halls of the school, and while it’s beautiful to watch, it seems only tenuously connected to the story.</p><p>Like the works of David Foster Wallace and William Wordsworth, <em>Oklahoma!</em> is another piece of culture that Jake obsesses over, and Kaufman seizes on it for the movie’s bizarre, non sequitur finale. Unlike Reid’s novel, which concludes with a more conventional thriller-style twist, Kaufman’s film ends in complete opaqueness, dashing any hopes of resolution or narrative progression. It’s audacious and odd and unique, but it doesn’t really add up to anything.</p><p><em>Starring Jessie Buckley, Jesse Plemons, Toni Collette, David Thewlis and Guy Boyd, I’m Thinking of Ending Things premieres Friday, Sept. 4 on Netflix.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lake-michigan-monster-review/\">Lake Michigan Monster Is a Delightfully Funny Fever-Dream</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:45:24 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-header.jpg","linkMd5":"bf08c60a837679cbb12e59ab20434bf7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn54@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-969_dfad386537686da1.webp","destWidth":3600,"destHeight":1800,"sourceBytes":793032,"destBytes":406080,"author":"Josh Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn54@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-00-969_dfad386537686da1.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-david-thewlis-toni-collette.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn26@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-09-246_97019f5ed0abc6ef.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/im-thinking-of-ending-things-jessie-buckley.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-05-985_b02f22ce704e72ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700503},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"Avatar: The 15 Most Powerful Benders | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-most-powerful-benders-all-time/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Strongest-Benders-Feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>The world of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/avatar-the-last-airbender/\"><em>Avatar</em></a> is positively littered with some truly incredible benders.

The Avatars may have been the ultimates when it comes to mastering the various elements, however, there are certain skills that take a certain specialization to truly grasp.</span></p><p><em><strong>Updated By Amanda Bruce On August 31st, 2020:</strong> Between Aang and Korra's stories, there are so many incredible benders that we just can't leave it at the top ten benders. Now, even more of the most powerful benders in the Avatar universe have been added to demonstrate some truly awesome feats.</em></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">15 </span>Ming-Hua</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Alsoidliketotalkaboutminghuabeingthat-3a3a21b3058eef140ce4d434b2e987d9.jpg' /></figure><p>Ming-Hua might be a villain, but she's a truly impressive water-bender. Water bending is often seen to be dependent on the movement of someone's appendages. Katara initially has trouble when she can't get her hand motions exactly right. Ming-Hua perfects water bending without the need for those hand motions.</p><p>That's because she doesn't actually have arms to utilize. She manages to truly make her element an extension of herself, using water in place of her arms for a more fluid method of attack altogether. It's no wonder people have such a hard time besting her.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">14 </span>Zuko</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KidsTV4.jpg' /></figure><p>Zuko doesn't get a lot of screen time as a bender in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-legend-of-korra/\"><em>The Legend Of Korra</em></a>, but the audience gets to steadily <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avatar-zuko-character-arc-masterpiece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watch him improve</a> (in more ways than one) in the original series. He's able to eventually master every technique his uncle teaches him.</p><p>Zuko spends the bulk of his young life training and perfecting his technique. He even accepts, eventually, that he won't be able to master every technique because some fire-benders just might have more raw power than him.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">13 </span>Azula</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Azula.jpg' /></figure><p>One of those fire-benders with more raw power is his own sister. Azula might be unhinged, but she's an incredible fire-bender. She's one of very few benders in the entire franchise to be able <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-lightningbending-things-fans-know/\">to use lightning</a>.</p><p>Bending lightning takes even more concentration and power than bending fire. Even Avatar Kyoshi isn't able to bend lightning during her 230 year lifetime. It also takes the combined force of Zuko and Katara to finally defeat her.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">12 </span>Jinora</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jinora.jpg' /></figure><p>Jinora is a surprisingly strong bender. She's not someone the audience would expect to be so powerful when she debuts in <em>Legend Of Korra</em>, but she grows to have some serious skills.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-legend-of-korra-better-avatar-the-last-airbender/\">10 Things The Legend Of Korra Does Better Than The Last Avatar</a></span></p><p>Jinora has the honor of being one of the youngest air bending masters - ever. That's quite a feat considering her grandfather became the Avatar. It's not just her air bending that lands her here. She has strong power outside of her command of air; she's incredibly young to be able to communicate with spirits and enter the Spirit World, but she's able to lead Korra through the experience.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">11 </span>Kyoshi</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kyoshi.jpg' /></figure><p>Kyoshi is the Avatar two generations before Aang. Though she's not the Avatar Aang communicates with most often, she is definitely one of the most powerful.</p><p>Born an earth-bender, Kyoshi commands all elements, but it's truly earth where she excels. She does, after all, use her ability to break off a piece of a continent, further separating the two pieces of land with lava bending, to create Kyoshi Island. She's the only Avatar we know of who created her own island.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Kuvira</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DnD-LoK-kuvira-7.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earth-benders are already an incredibly tough bunch. With the fortitude of the earth beneath them, they are able to unleash devastating attacks while standing their ground and rooted in the earth beneath them. Kuvira takes these principles to the extreme. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-legend-korra-kuvira-characters-defeat-lose/\">She is incredibly tough</a> as one of the strongest metal-benders alive during the time that Korra is Avatar. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this great strength, she takes control of a faltering Earth kingdom and pushes the Avatar herself to her very limits. Kuvira is cold, impenetrable and only made malleable through great force and external pressure, just like the element she uses with devastating efficiency. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Bumi</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Bumi.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bumi is another truly impressive earth-bender that uses his element like few others throughout the course of the two series. While he has a personality much like that of an air-bender, Bumi is one of the most powerful earth-benders around during Aang’s time as the Avatar. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audiences may only get a peek at his elemental prowess as they are only introduced to him when he is over a century old, but that only makes the spritely Bumi more impressive. He may not have the body of his younger self, but even with his aging body, he’s still able to show the fire nation (and Aang) what earth-bending is really about. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Zaheer</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Zaheer-flying-in-Legend-of-Korra.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zaheer may not have <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-fans-know-about-airbending/\">been an air-bender</a> for very long, but during his brief tenure he was able to not only take down the Avatar, but he was able to accomplish what few air-benders before him could, flight. The air-nation may have been devastated by the fire nation long before his time, but even so Zaheer perfect embodied the spirit of the air nation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he may have been much more serious than many of the air-bender that audiences were introduced to, he took their teachings to heart and used the free-flowing air nomad teaching to enact his plan to destroy that Avatar. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Katara</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Katara-1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Katara may have just been a young water-bender when audiences were first introduced to her, but throughout the course of her time with Aang, she evolved nearly as much as the Avatar himself. From blood-bending to healing through the power of her bending, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-katara-fun-facts/\">Katara embodied</a> perfectly what it meant to be a water-bender.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-best-episodes-imdb/\">The 10 Best Episodes Of Avatar: The Last Airbender, Ranked</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Much like the greatest water-benders throughout the series, Katara was able to perfectly balance the offensive and defensive capabilities of her element. She may not have always <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-katara-best-fight-scenes-ranked-atla/\">been up for a fight</a>, but she was always there to help out or clean up the pieces afterward. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Toph</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Avatar-Toph.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there have already been some incredibly impressive earth-benders mentioned in this article, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-best-character-toph-vs-varrick-atla/\">Toph is perhaps</a> the greatest earth-bender to have ever lived. Not only was Toph a natural when it came to moving the sturdiest of the elements, and not only was she taught by the badger-moles (the original earth-benders), but she was also able to take earth-bending to its natural evolution, metal-bending. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the creator of the metal-bending technique, Toph takes the top spot when it comes to earth-benders across the entirety of the series. There may have been many after her who would follow the steps that she had laid out, but Toph is the girl who opened the door to an all-new type of bending. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Iroh</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Entry-1-Iroh-in-the-Order-of-the-White-Lotus.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iroh may have been the older brother in line for the throne before Ozai forced his way in, but he was never really one to hold that kind of power with much regard. The Dragon of The West as he was called during his heyday, Iroh was an incredibly powerful fire-bender. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he earned the title of Dragon by his well-known ability to breathe fire and (supposedly) killing a dragon, Iroh was much more in harmony with the true roots of fire-bending than his brother and most of his peers. Ozai and others like him may have been beholden to the rage that the used to fuel their fire, but Iroh was able to see through that charade and find a path toward the life that fire-bending was truly attached to. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Wan</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Wan-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first avatar both in this article and in history, Avatar Wan was capable of some truly incredible feats. After releasing the dark spirit Vaatu from his eternal fight with Rava, Wan traveled great distances to visit the lion-turtles of all four elements in order to free the world of Vaatu’s chaos. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he had become the most powerful bender of his time and ushered in a new age where humans would live free of the lion-turtles, Wan was not able to broker a peace between the spirits of his world and the humans who were now capable of fighting back. He may have made many mistakes, but Wan fought for peace with all his might until the very end. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Korra</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Asami-vs-Korra-Best-Girl-korra-tough-10.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a very early age, Korra makes it abundantly clear that she is going to become an extremely powerful bender. Although Korra may be naturally very gifted when it comes to manipulating the elements, she has a tough time coming to terms with responsibilities as both one of the few remaining air-benders and as the Avatar.</span></p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-zuko-facts/\">Avatar: 10 Things You Never Knew About Zuko</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the link between the spirit realm and the physical realm, Korra is pushed to her limits time and time again by benders that have taken their element to the very furthest reaches of its power. While Korra is able to control all the elements with great power and precision, her adversaries routinely push her past her breaking points. Yet, somehow, she manages to keep going. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Firelord Ozai</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Ozai-1.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ozai’s fire-bending prowess and utter ruthlessness make him a truly terrifying adversary (and father) to oppose, they aren’t the only factors that make Ozai such a formidable opponent. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ozai’s fighting prowess in a one-on-one battle is certainly something to beware of, but what makes Ozai one of the most powerful benders to have ever lived, even more so than his own strength, is the fact that has the complete faith and trust of an entire nation of powerful fire-benders watching his back. And why wouldn’t they? His family has led the fire nation through prosperous times for generations now. That kind of loyalty and trust isn’t something that just anyone can command. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Aang</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Child-Prodigies-avatar-aang-9.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And last but not least, Aang, quite possibly the greatest Avatar (and greatest bender) to have ever lived. Not only was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-strongest-non-benders-jet-suki-piandao/\">Aang able to master</a> the four elements with relative ease and take down the fire nation, but he was also able to do so without compromising who he was as a person. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and time again, Aang was told that the only way to end Ozai’s rule would be to end the Firelord’s life. But even as a child, Aang was able to see that there had to be some other way of doing it, some way that would keep his hands clean of the blood everyone expected him to shed. Finally, having exhausted all other options, Aang unleashed the power of soul-bending (taught to him by the wise lion-turtle, of course) and was able to safely end the tyranny of Firelord Ozai without taking his life.</span></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-last-airbender-anime/\">10 Reasons Avatar: The Last Airbender Is An Anime</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:30:45 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Strongest-Benders-Feature.jpg","linkMd5":"de08f08a532f4b0e6db5d331460584ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn57@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-00-591_6f66a9846e585b4c.webp","destWidth":1450,"destHeight":725,"sourceBytes":69388,"destBytes":69388,"author":"Danny Hernandez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Strongest-Benders-Feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn57@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-35-00-591_6f66a9846e585b4c.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Alsoidliketotalkaboutminghuabeingthat-3a3a21b3058eef140ce4d434b2e987d9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn34@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-07-466_3b63ff7345f5e900.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KidsTV4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn33@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-07-024_7f369cdc916249bc.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Azula.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn56@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-15-628_a8d8bfba034fe191.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jinora.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn85@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-05-901_eef07be8d4dcd0fa.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kyoshi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-11-816_9ad11cb99b241795.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DnD-LoK-kuvira-7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-09-152_9d7964bc0f62169e.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Bumi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-14-067_f9ad8a92c68cf941.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Zaheer-flying-in-Legend-of-Korra.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn97@2020_3/2020/09/01/02-35-13-794_f72a89acb6a34278.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Katara-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn58@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-07-571_bb2608633c14fc55.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Avatar-Toph.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn70@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-11-952_b1ce73141532dbef.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Entry-1-Iroh-in-the-Order-of-the-White-Lotus.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-35-13-528_21e103ad50d95c76.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Avatar-Wan-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-35-15-822_7a917700bff1bbe1.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Asami-vs-Korra-Best-Girl-korra-tough-10.jpg":null,"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Ozai-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn26@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-35-05-925_1d9e024cc9a6d77b.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Child-Prodigies-avatar-aang-9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/01/02-35-07-226_3c6ff2e74363dca2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598927700510},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:35:00","title":"X-Men: The Animated Series' Cyclops Voice Actor Norm Spencer Has Died","link":"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-animated-series-cyclops-norm-spencer-dead/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/x-men-1992-animated-series-wolverine-cyclops-rogue-jubilee-professor-x.jpg\"/></figure><p>Norm Spencer, who voiced Scott Summers/Cyclops on <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em>, has passed away.</p><p>\"Lost my dear friend and cohort Norm Spencer,\" Wolverine voice actor Cal Dodd tweeted. \"WHat a sad day.
