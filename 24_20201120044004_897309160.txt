But there’s something obnoxiously similar about many of these movies: they are all about cisgender, heterosexual couples. They reinforce stereotypical gender dynamics, and while yes they are just movies, they speak volumes about the kinds of love that society deems the most important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, director <strong>Clea DuVall</strong> is looking to change that this year with her feature film <em><strong>Happiest Season</strong></em>, coming to Hulu on November 25th. <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> and <strong>Mackenzie Davis</strong> play Abby and Harper, respectively, a lesbian couple who are head over heels in love with each other. Abby is ready to propose, but not before she goes home with Harper for the holidays. That’s where it gets complicated: Harper is not out to her family, so she’s told them that Abby is her lesbian orphan roommate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hijinks inevitably ensue and feelings are hurt, but since it’s a Christmas movie, everything ends happily ever after. Stewart confirms this in <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/features/clea-duvall-hulu-happiest-season-kristen-stewart-1234827619/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an interview with Variety</a>: &#8220;The audience should be afraid that they might not get together,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but it’s a rom-com — they’re going to get back together!” It is the heartwarming gay love story without life-or-death stakes that the queer community has been craving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the film’s announcement &#8212; and more so since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rejectnation/status/1325896258008084482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its trailer dropped</a> &#8212; excitement has been buzzing on Twitter, to say the least. It isn’t just because Stewart and Davis, plus <strong>Daniel Levy</strong>, <strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong>, and everyone’s favorite mom <strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong> star in <em>Happiest Season</em>. It’s also due to the fact that this is a cheesy rom-com set during Christmas about a gay couple. Unfortunately in 2020, it’s rather revolutionary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a quick Google search for gay Christmas movies brings up only two results: <em><strong>Holiday Heart</strong></em>, about a gay drag queen who befriends a mother and her daughter; and <em><strong>Make the Yuletide Gay</strong></em>, a traditional rom-com of errors. Neither are studio films, with the former premiering on the Hallmark Channel in 2000 and the latter making the festival circuit in 2009 without a large release. These are the only two relatively well-known films that center on gay experiences during the holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queer inclusion in holiday movies comes, instead, mainly from gay side-characters who more often than not are sprinkled in to offer comedic relief or drama. One particularly uncomfortable example of this is in <em><strong>The Family Stone</strong></em>. Centered on a relationship between Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Everrett (Dermott Mulroney), the 2005 film follows the couple as they travel to Everrett’s family home for the holidays. Meredith meets all of his siblings, including brother Patrick and his husband Thad, who are so loved by everyone and there’s no obvious family drama over their sexuality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they are used as a backdrop for Meredith to make homophobic comments that only further reveal how stiff and uncomfortable she is as a person. The only two gay characters in the film are merely used for Meredith’s character development as the script humiliates them in front of the entire family.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other films, such as 1995&#8217;s <em><strong>Home for the Holidays</strong></em>, the gay family member (in this case played by Robert Downey, Jr.) is the black sheep, looked down upon and treated like a failure. He is just another burden for the main character, Claudia (Holly Hunter), to watch over and worry about. Due to his eccentric and flamboyant nature, a.k.a. his sexuality, he is also the impetus for many family fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, of course, positive queer representation in films such as Lifetime&#8217;s <em><strong>Twinkle All The Way</strong></em> and Netflix’s <em><strong>Let It Snow</strong></em>, but its still relegated to side characters. Gay romance gets a brief moment in the snow-filled spotlight before attention is turned back to the main heterosexual couple.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Happiest Season</em>’s central conflict, though, has some worried about reducing gay couples to narratives about coming out experiences. But this is just one movie that cannot carry all of the wants and desires for queer cinema. Mainstream queer representation is growing very slowly, and placing all of the pressure on a single rom-com to entice the entire queer population is unrealistic. Instead, the focus should be that there is finally a studio release about lesbians during Christmas.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet it isn’t the only movie looking to bring the holiday queer this season. Cable channels such as Lifetime and Hallmark are also striving for better representation. Lifetime is debuting its first LGBTQ+ holiday movie, <em><strong>The Christmas Setup</strong></em> (December 12th), starring two gay male leads. Hallmark is releasing <em><strong>The Christmas House</strong></em> (November 22nd), about a gay couple waiting to adopt their first child. Paramount TV has a gay cowboy flick, <em><strong>Dashing to December</strong></em> (December 13th), galloping onto screens. And even Netflix recently released <em><strong>A New York Christmas Wedding</strong></em>, about two women of color falling in love.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While seemingly following Hulu’s lead, they are paying attention to what audiences want and aren’t afraid to start shifting the tried-and-true narratives. Yes, Lifetime and Hallmark are known for an almost impossible output of movies around the holidays that drip with absurd amounts of tinsel and kisses in the snow. But without them, <em>Happiest Season</em> would be the only gay Christmas movie of 2020 to discuss.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Happiest Season</em> is a blueprint for a bright, and gay, cinematic future. It’s a movie about lesbians starring queer actors, directed by a lesbian, written by two women, scored by a woman, edited by a woman, the list goes on. This isn’t Hulu just trying to gain inclusivity points; it’s an earnest production about gay women based on a gay woman’s experience. This is why <em>Happiest Season</em> is so important: it’s a genuine holiday rom-com that revels in more than just heterosexual love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes down to it, Christmas movies are joyful and cheesy. Why can’t queer people get in on the fun? The queer community needs <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/lgbtq-movies-with-happy-endings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">these kinds of narratives</a> focused on gay couples experiencing joy. They exist in these spaces and absolutely deserve to be the center of a rom-com narrative that uses those well-worn tropes in exciting ways. Representation is not just about the struggles and heartbreak that queer people have experienced; it’s also about their joy and silly family confrontations that don’t have tragic consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love is love, as they say, and that love deserves to be represented in all forms, including during the most wonderful time of the year.&#160;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Z1dJ8Hx-OS0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 12:16:06 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c375ffe0d2396913febaf8ef6d3c70bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Z1dJ8Hx-OS0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-40-03-540_d1a90f5408221316.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847154090},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","title":"The Year’s Best Horror Film Is Our Home Video Pick of the Week","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359711","description":"<p class=\"section-divider\"><em>Streaming might be the future, but physical media is still the present.

It follows three generations of women as they deal with the eldest&#8217;s descent into dementia, and while it delivers scares and atmosphere a plenty, its heart and focus on the loss of a loved one remains. Rather than exploit the illness, the film uses it to craft an unforgettable horror experience that builds to an ending that might just leave you in tears. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: None]</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Best</h2>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359777\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ghost-dog.jpg\" alt=\"Ghost Dog\" width=\"195\" height=\"242\" />Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai [Criterion Collection]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A hitman is targeted by his employers.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Jim Jarmusch is mostly miss for me, <em>Paterson</em> (2017) aside, but this beautifully told tale of a hitman, his birds, and an atypical philosophy towards life, death, and the warrior&#8217;s way is a gem. Forest Whitaker makes for an endearing lead who&#8217;s both capable of dealing death and appreciating the finer, calmer things in life. Jarmusch&#8217;s penchant for introspection works well here, and Whitaker commands the screen with a kind awareness. Quotes from samurai teachings act as chapter headings and lend it a unique feel. Criterion&#8217;s new Blu looks sharp and includes plenty of extras offering a look into the film&#8217;s making and meaning.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 4K restoration, Q&#38;A, interviews, featurettes, deleted scenes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359778\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grace-of-my-heart.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Of My Heart\" width=\"195\" height=\"250\" />Grace of My Heart</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A female songwriter struggles to sing her own songs.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Allison Anders wrote and directed this inspiring tale of talent rising up against oppression, and it&#8217;s an amusing and entertaining journey. Illeana Douglas takes the lead here and is fantastic, and she&#8217;s joined by the likes of Eric Stoltz, Matt Dillon, John Turturro, and more. It&#8217;s funny and sweet, and the music is both catchy and appealing.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary, featurette, deleted scenes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359779\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/its-a-wonderful-life.jpg\" alt=\"Its A Wonderful Life\" width=\"195\" height=\"245\" />It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life [4K UltraHD]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A man in distress discovers the value in his life.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Frank Capra&#8217;s holiday classic is back in the news, as it is every year, and it remains an affecting gem about confirming the love you share with and for others in your life. James Stewart brings his everyman charms to a character whose doubts and concerns are familiar to anyone alive, and the film explores his journey with a little bit of magic and a lot of heart.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Color version, featurettes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359780\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/resident-evil.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil\" width=\"195\" height=\"229\" />Resident Evil &#8211; The Complete Collection [4K UltraHD]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> All six films in the franchise, remastered in 4K.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Capcom&#8217;s videogame series might not have seemed like the game adaptation to break the curse, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with a film franchise that&#8217;s brought in over a billion dollars at the box-office while averaging B grades at the same time. The films vary in quality, but between the non-stop action and monster mayhem they&#8217;re fun times more often than not. Their biggest asset, though, is lead Milla Jovovich. She grows as a performer across the films, but from the very start she&#8217;s a gung-ho action performer that stands apart from the usual genre fray. The new 4K remasters highlight the action and production design behind this iconic franchise, and all six films look sharp and bright.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359799\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/silent-running-1.jpg\" alt=\"Silent Running\" width=\"195\" height=\"277\" />Silent Running [Arrow Video]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A man defies an order to destroy what might be the last vegetation near Earth.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Bruce Dern as a compassionate and affecting leading man might take some getting used to, but he does great work here as a botanist forced to act against irrational thought. Special effects wizard Douglas Trumbull made his directorial debut here, and while that guarantees fantastic miniatures and sculptures he also delivers a compelling tale about the environment and our stewardship over it. The film remains an all-timer with its potent message taking center stage. Arrow&#8217;s new Blu looks brilliant too.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 2K restoration, commentaries, interviews, featurette]</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Rest</h2>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">2067</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A dying Earth sends a miner to dig for hope in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the miner named in a mysterious message from the future, but his adventure begins when he&#8217;s sent forward in time in the hopes of finding a way to save humanity. Ryan Kwanten is his best friend, but while the familiar faces stop there the film manages some engaging world-building even if some of the story beats are visible while in advance. It&#8217;s a solid little sci-fi tale with an effective ending.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary, featurettes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Dragnet [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Sgt. Joe Friday asks for the facts and solves the case.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> The popular television show gets a feature film here, but sadly Harry Morgan is nowhere to be found. Jack Webb brings his iconic character to colorful life, though, in a story about corrupt mobsters and murder. It&#8217;s a pretty straightforward affair finding many of the same beats fans appreciated in the show, and as a directorial effort by Webb himself there&#8217;s an extra appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 2K master, commentary]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Moonstruck [Criterion Collection]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A romantic comedy set against an Italian-American family.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Cher and Olympia Dukakis both won Oscars for their work here, and it&#8217;s easy to see why they struck a chord with critics and moviegoers alike. The film moves along with energy and bombast as various relatives and friends in and out of relationships are touched on with Cher&#8217;s downtrodden widow at the heart of it all. Your mileage with the journey comes down to your embrace of Cher&#8217;s budding romance with Nicolas Cage, and if it works for you the movie will too. Criterion&#8217;s new Blu is heavy with older interviews, but they remain informative and enlightening.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 4K restoration, commentary, interviews, featurettes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">The New Mutants</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A group of teens with powers discover the truth behind their incarceration.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Josh Boone&#8217;s bastard child of the <em>X-Men</em> franchise has bounced around for a few years, but now that it&#8217;s finally released it&#8217;s hard to see what the fuss was about. While not good necessarily, it&#8217;s far from terrible, and is instead just a mediocre thriller that can&#8217;t quite decide how it wants to stand out from the crowd. We&#8217;ve seen this story before, both in and out of X-Men lore, and there&#8217;s just nothing here to make you go wow aside from some questionable accents and wigs.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Deleted scenes, featurette]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Ulysses [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Homer&#8217;s epic tale comes to life.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Kirk Douglas is always worth watching, and his lead performance as the adventurous Ulysses delivers. It&#8217;s worlds apart from the sandal-wearing similarities of <em>Spartacus</em>, but it&#8217;s a solid adventure featuring one-eyed giants, magic, swordplay, and more. Kino&#8217;s new Blu gives this older film a sharp remaster capturing its details and colors with renewed vibrance.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 4K master, commentary, US and Italian versions]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Westworld &#8211; Season Three</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> The hosts are loose.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> HBO&#8217;s <em>Westworld</em> offers up a bold, violent, and exploitative reimagining of Michael Crichton&#8217;s clunky classic, but three seasons in it&#8217;s a bit less sure of itself. The story has spilled out of the theme parks and into the real world, and as the androids navigate it the show tosses twists within twists at viewers that slowly but surely loosen its grasp on our attention. It&#8217;s a gamble, and there&#8217;s no denying the top-tier visual effects, production design, and performances, but the storylines just continue to grow less cohesive. Fans will want to pick up the 4K release, though, as it&#8217;s a visual treat.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurettes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Wonders of Aladdin [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> An &#8220;interesting&#8221; take on the story of Aladdin.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Look, the 60s were a time, I get it, but Donald O&#8217;Connor as Aladdin? Come on people. Anyway, if you can get past that this family adventure manages some minor fun with its frequent effects and action beats. The story is eminently familiar by now and has been told better by Disney, but fans of whitewashed Arabian adventures from decades past will enjoy its charms.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 4K master, commentary]</p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Also out this week:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><em>Hero On the Front, Nomad, A Woman Missing</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dNnGywqjOfg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 21:27:20 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/relic.jpg","linkMd5":"2af83ada6b41c6baaf35288869a16f4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-34-447_1cc2d2d92c47e0a7.webp","destWidth":195,"destHeight":245,"sourceBytes":27524,"destBytes":12070,"author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/relic.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-34-447_1cc2d2d92c47e0a7.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ghost-dog.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-35-628_6345e2169bb5b124.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grace-of-my-heart.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-35-528_41e4c5f591927e4d.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/its-a-wonderful-life.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-59-635_c51ab77f6c39d301.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/resident-evil.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn22@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-35-602_57f1a986d925056c.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/silent-running-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn37@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-38-696_f9aa964007480ef5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dNnGywqjOfg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn18@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-39-937_6102c2be51a49401.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847154086},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","title":"Chief’s Dynamic Change in ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359788","description":"<p><i><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/through-a-native-lens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Through a Native Lens</a> is a column from film critic and citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Shea Vassar, who will dive into the nuance of cinema’s best and worst cases of Indigenous representation. This entry looks at the most important character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s Nest.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Miloš Forman</strong>’s </span><strong><i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> holds a special place in cinematic and pop-cultural history. Since its release in 1975, the film adaptation of Ken Kesey&#8217;s novel remains relevant, most recently inspiring Ryan Murphy’s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/ratched-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deep dive into the infamous Nurse Ratched</a>. While most talk around the film </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">focuses on the tumultuous relationship between Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), the most important character is actually one tall quiet guy holding a broom in the corner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of the film, McMurphy makes a rambunctious debut at a mental institution. His charisma is instantly recognizable, fully alive when compared to the patients scattered around the stale, cold common room. As he waits for instructions from the ward’s staff, he walks to a tall Native man standing alone by the wall. This stranger&#8217;s hair is dark and shoulder-length with some gray streaks in the front, and his face shows little emotion. “Goddamn boy! You&#8217;re about as big as a mountain! Look like you might have played some football.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After asking his name, McMurphy is interrupted by another patient who explains, “He’s a deaf and dumb Indian.&#8221; This inspires McMurphy to break out into a cheesy stereotypical warcry noise, but the tall Native man, whom they call Chief (<strong>Will Sampson</strong>), doesn’t flinch. While this moment is certainly not the most positive interaction, it is remarkably the first time someone has attempted to communicate with Chief in quite a long time due to his supposed status of being “deaf and dumb.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowly but surely, a connection develops between Chief and McMurphy. The two couldn’t be more opposite as McMurphy goes through each day stating his exact thoughts as loudly as possible and clowning around by attempting to tear the sink out of the bathroom unsuccessfully. During all the festivities that surround McMurphy, Chief lingers in the background unseen, like a giant ghost haunting the activities of the ward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The true testament of this onscreen duo happens after a disagreement in group therapy turns into a brawl. A nurse’s aide attempts to physically restrain McMurphy, which compels Chief to step away from his own seclusion and intervene on behalf of his friend. He forcibly tears the aide from McMurphy, displaying his strength and emotion as well as his ability to understand more than the medical staff had given him credit for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two sit in the hallway waiting to be reprimanded, McMurphy offers Chief a stick of gum. “Thank you,” he says nonchalantly as he unwraps the item. McMurphy stares in unbelief. A few seconds later, after Chief makes a casual comment about Juicy Fruit, McMurphy asks if he can hear him, too. “You bet,” he answers with a smile. Chief is showing his true self as he breaks down the protective walls he had built around his tall being. This interaction immediately changes their dynamic as McMurphy now sees Chief as his equal, his partner in crime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This simple interaction proves that Chief’s “disabilities” were assumed, put upon him as a way to silence the big Indian man in the corner. These assumptions are metaphoric for the oppression that most Native people around the world have been subjected to for centuries. To this day, the suppression of Indigenous languages, customs, and beliefs remains normalized, a form of silencing Native people and creating more invisibility for the diversity that exists within Indigenous communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a late-night talk with McMurphy, Chief opens up about his father’s alcoholism and the way “they worked on him.” While this isn’t explained, the rest of the conversation alludes to Chief’s father going through an institutional system, like prison or a mental institution. Eventually, Chief mentions, very slyly, the similarities between his paternal figure and McMurphy, stating that they are working on him, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This moment foreshadows the tragic events that follow, but the overall conversation is ambiguous, showcasing just how bright this supposedly “deaf and dumb” man is and always has been. Chief has purposely chosen a safe life by becoming an observer, but McMurphy awakens something inside of him that no longer is satisfied with being invisible or less than those around him. He longs to be free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the finale of <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em> is not a happy one for McMurphy. His misbehavior reaches a new level of destruction, and his </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">punishment is a permanent state of vegetation through a lobotomy. On his arrival back to the ward, Chief realizes the sad state of his friend. “I’m going to let you out,” he says as he hugs McMurphy. “You’re coming with me.” With tears in his eyes, Chief lays McMurphy back down and pauses before smothering him with a pillow. Chief’s actions aren’t one out of murderous intentions. It is an act of mercy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief has a special understanding of what that is like, as he spent who knows how long as the tallest invisible man in the world. In fact, Chief is only returning the favor as McMurphy was the catalyst for his newfound confidence and independence. The Chief that is seen during McMurphy’s first moments at the mental institution and the one at the end of the film are completely different characters.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Chief is the most dynamic character in <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. </em></span><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Nurse Ratched is still miserable, the other patients are more or less in the same predicament, and McMurphy was forced into a non-responsive state, but Chief is different, inspired, and ready to take on the world. </span><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">He might be passive and quiet, but by the end, he no longer is bound by the restrictions around him to which he had been subjected.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"><br />\nChief embraces his newfound confidence as he walks to the bathroom sink that he watched McMurphy fail to pull from the ground on more than one occasion. He grabs the huge structure and plucks it from its base. Water protrudes from the ground as Chief carries the sink to the window, thrusting it through the glass. As the other patients look at each other in shock, Chief struts through the new opening and into the open field. He has officially claimed his freedom. </span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/I_XcynQx4mY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 21:16:35 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b9d0eef3655861b71acefef0800e5d46","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shea Vassar","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/I_XcynQx4mY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn30@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-35-540_ad1f4de3fd082523.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847154089},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","title":"The Great (and Silent) History of Hollywood’s First Female Director","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359740","description":"\n<p id=\"block-6f00726e-27c0-4c3f-977d-0d878230e87b\"><em>Welcome to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

The sentiment behind the statement is appealing enough. And it is a good reminder that this pastime, while often passive, isn&#8217;t frivolous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet I do find that there is a drop-off point. I&#8217;d say <em>most </em>folks are familiar with films from the studio system onwards. But when it comes to pre-code fare, it starts to get a bit more obscure. This is, I suspect, in part because so much of early cinema is quite literally missing, lost, or irrevocably damaged. If people who watch films before the 1960s are historians, people who watch early 20th-century cinema are basically archeologists. And there are decidedly fewer of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I myself am not especially knowledgeable about this era and am always grateful to find resources that try to bring me up to speed. Like today&#8217;s video essay, which profiles, succinctly, one of the most remarkable and unsung women filmmakers in early Hollywood history: <strong>Lois Weber</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weber was the first woman to direct her own feature film and to own her own studio. She made over one hundred and thirty-five films, many of which were ahead of their time both in their innovative formal construction and their moral nuance, the latter of which courted considerable controversy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her name ought to be uttered in the same breath as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. So, why did we largely forget about one of the great pioneering voices in early filmmaking? What did &#8220;the cinema of Lois Weber&#8221; look like? </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-e541a95a-199d-4122-b78b-2c914720e5df\">Watch &#8220;<strong>A History of Silence: The Cinema of Lois Weber&#8221;</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"A History of Silence: The Cinema of Lois Weber\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dM3_O4FEZA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-2db4b785-6b87-4022-8b34-6427a91b3c9c\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-179f886d-6774-4450-838c-e8ce21d0a808\">This video essay is by <strong>Lux</strong>, a series that explores film form, history, and culture.

In this edition, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\">Rob Hunter</a> listens to Paul Schrader discuss his directorial debut, Blue Collar.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Paul Schrader</strong>&#8216;s been a part of the American movie scene since writing 1974&#8217;s <em>The Yakuza</em>, and he&#8217;s remained a compelling voice through films as varied as <em>American Gigolo</em> (1980), <em>Affliction</em> (1997), <em>Auto Focus</em> (2002), and <em>First Reformed</em> (2017). He decided early on in his career, after seeing four scripts of his directed by others, to take a seat in the director&#8217;s chair himself. The result was a terrific American drama featuring one of <strong>Richard Pryor</strong>&#8216;s best dramatic performances, <strong><em>Blue Collar</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Keep reading to see what I heard on the commentary for Schrader&#8217;s <em>Blue Collar</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Blue Collar (1978)</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Commentators: Paul Schrader (writer/director), Maitland McDonagh (journalist)</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>1.</strong> The opening credits shots include an overhead one lifted from Sergei Eisenstein&#8217;s <em>Strike</em> (1925).</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The automobile plant scenes were filmed at the Checker Cab plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. &#8220;We tried to go to every auto plant in the US and Canada, and we were turned down uniformly.&#8221; This plant finally relented because they were having some labor issues and thought the shoot would help settle and calm the workers.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> The origin of the <em>Blue Collar</em> script started with a young man who brought an idea to him about his own father who worked in an auto plant before committing suicide. Schrader told him a better idea was a story about workers who rob their own union. &#8220;After he left I called up my brother and said &#8216;there was a guy over here and I gave him a very interesting idea, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever write that idea. Let&#8217;s you and I write it.&#8221; He and <strong>Leonard Schrader</strong> wrote the script, but once the film went into production the man, <strong>Sydney A. Glass</strong>, returned claiming he had supplied the initial idea so they gave him a &#8220;source material&#8221; credit.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> One theme that Schrader returns to again and again in his writing is exploring why people act against their interests.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Schrader notes that Richard Pryor had done one previous serious role in <em>Lady Sings the Blues</em> (1972), but the comic actor had actually appeared in more than a few serious films, albeit in smaller roles. These include <em>The Mack</em> (1973), <em>Hit!</em> (1973), and <em>Some Call It Loving</em> (1973). The filmmaker was trying to find financing and having trouble, but bringing on the rising star helped dramatically.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Pryor was prone to improvisation and only &#8220;good&#8221; for the first few takes. &#8220;By the fourth or fifth take he would already be downhill because he&#8217;d be running out of gas.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> He was met with resistance in trying to sell the film as being about &#8220;two Black guys and a white guy,&#8221; as people would respond asking if he meant to say &#8220;two white guys and a Black guy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Schrader says he used to refer to Pryor as suffering from &#8220;the big and Black problem.&#8221; He explains that the performer wanted to be a big success while still holding onto Black politics. &#8220;He would turn on people, he would instigate racial situations, and everyone hated it.&#8221; The next day he would be a joy and ingratiate himself with everyone. The pendulum swings led to confrontations both verbal and violent.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Yaphet Kotto</strong> first caught Schrader&#8217;s attention in 1972&#8217;s <em>Across 110th Street</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> The shot/scene around 14:37 led to a fight between Pryor and <strong>Harvey Keitel</strong>. The latter would take several takes to warm up, so they&#8217;d shoot him with a stand-in reading Pryor&#8217;s lines. &#8220;When Harvey was all warmed up you brought in Richard and you shot Richard&#8217;s first take.&#8221; Apparently Keitel started riffing and Pryor joined in leading to a big, off-script rant that, while funny, possibly looked like showboating to Keitel who then moved an ashtray and spoke directly into the camera to scratch the take. &#8220;Even before I cut, Richard was on Harvey, fists were flying,&#8221; and soon Pryor&#8217;s bodyguard and Schrader himself entered the fray. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the only time things happened like this on the film.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> The film was shot over forty days which was more than he had on <em>Affliction</em>, which was the last film he made prior to this commentary track.</p>\n<p><strong>12.</strong> He essentially apologizes for the scene in which Zeke (Pryor) is visited by an IRS agent and it&#8217;s revealed that he&#8217;s been scamming welfare by pretending to have twice as many kids as he actually does. It was funny to him at the time he wrote it, but &#8220;today in retrospect it&#8217;s quite offensive.&#8221; He adds that it&#8217;s difficult to watch now, but rather than pursue the matter McDonagh decides to ask if the IRS actually visited people at home like that.</p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> Pryor had bad things to say about Schrader after the film&#8217;s release including accusing the director of &#8220;putting him back on cocaine, which was a bit of a stretch.&#8221; Two decades later, though, Pryor asked if Schrader would adapt his autobiography. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something I could do while he&#8217;s still alive, because as long as there was one body part of his that was still functioning he&#8217;d come after you.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>14.</strong> Schrader was overwhelmed as a director and leaned heavily on his cinematographer (<strong>Bobby Byrne</strong>) and script supervisor (<strong>Wallace Bennett</strong>).</p>\n<p><strong>15.</strong> &#8220;I hired three bulls and asked them come into a china shop, and I promised each of those bulls that they would be the lead actor.&#8221; Pryor, Kotto, and Keitel each figured out soon enough that they weren&#8217;t the lead, and it led to chaos. Keitel saw himself as having to play straight man to Pryor&#8217;s shenanigans, Pryor saw himself as &#8220;the colored friend&#8221; of Keitel&#8217;s character, and Kotto felt secondary to both men. &#8220;It became a real ego struggle about who would win the day,&#8221; and that was every day.</p>\n<p><strong>16.</strong> The party scene was among the last sequences filmed, and by that time there was ample drug use among the cast including Pryor&#8217;s return to cocaine. &#8220;They were coking it up on set.&#8221; The scene featured Sweet n Low as a substitute, but he discovered later that the actors were actually using between takes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-359752\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2.jpg\" alt=\"the final shot in Blue Collar\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>17.</strong> The shot above of the three leads on the couch was the final shot they filmed, and it required intense wrangling on Schrader&#8217;s part to get the three actors to sit together. That&#8217;s a recurring theme throughout the commentary as he reveals that numerous scenes were shot without closeups or additional coverage because calling cut meant the actors would get up and leave immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>18.</strong> Jerry&#8217;s (Keitel) house features very visible religious iconography, and Schrader feels it&#8217;s overdone. He mentions that Martin Scorsese is making his script for <em>Bringing Out the Dead</em> (1999) and the two had already butted heads over the Catholic imagery and paraphernalia in the film. The novel it&#8217;s based on is heavy with the stuff, but Schrader told the director they&#8217;d been reliant on the imagery for too long and for too many of their films.</p>\n<p><strong>19.</strong> Keitel walked at one point mid-film and went to the airport to fly back home, but thankfully his agent talked him into returning to the set.</p>\n<p><strong>20.</strong> Schrader says this is his first viewing of the film since its release roughly two decades prior. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange to watch it after all these years. I don&#8217;t go back and watch films I&#8217;ve made because it&#8217;s a lose/lose proposition.&#8221; He adds that if they&#8217;re good you wonder what happened to the talent you once had, and if they&#8217;re bad you realize you never had talent at all.</p>\n<p><strong>21.</strong> He decided to direct <em>Blue Collar</em> because he didn&#8217;t feel as if he was in charge of his creative life. &#8220;Once I was able to direct, I was able to go back to writing for others without feeling incomplete.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>22.</strong> Universal did minimal marketing for the film&#8217;s release and essentially folded it in with their marketing for Pryor&#8217;s other Universal release, <em>Which Way Is Up?</em> (1977). It died in theaters fairly quickly as people realized it wasn&#8217;t another Pryor comedy, but positive reviews helped launch Schrader as a director anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>23.</strong> Smokey&#8217;s (Kotto) death scene is a favorite of many because it&#8217;s dramatic and satisfying, but &#8220;on a realistic level it has zero credibility.&#8221; He says it&#8217;s not how the painting works, and you probably couldn&#8217;t kill someone this way either. &#8220;It shows the power of movies, because if it&#8217;s the right emotion and the right action at the right time, people set their more realistic sensibilities aside and go with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>24.</strong> The car chase scene with Jerry being followed features the ominously increasing sound of bees. Composer <strong>Jack Nitzsche</strong> used a prototype synthesizer with digitally recorded sounds to create the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>25.</strong> The freeze frame ending was planned from the start as a &#8220;classic social realist poster.&#8221;</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Best in Context-Free Commentary</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote\">“It&#8217;s so spooky watching Richard. He was the unhappiest person I ever met in my life.”</p>\n<p>&#8220;You could be sure if on one given day he was extremely nice to everybody, the next day he was gonna walk in and kick someone&#8217;s ass.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this is what directing was, I wanted no part of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I learned that day never to put somebody so white next to somebody so Black.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a big stickler for political correctness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t figure out how to direct until my third film.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the scene where Richard hit Yaphet with a chair.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a writer you look back and you wince.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just wish I could rewrite it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;More people want to make films than want to see films.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plot 101. Make &#8217;em nice so you can kill &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a fantastic commentary track with one real caveat &#8212; Schrader&#8217;s frequent use of the n-word. He says it six times, and while it&#8217;s used in the form of references as opposed to casual utterances it&#8217;s still jarring. He mentions that Pryor went through a period where he wouldn&#8217;t say it, and Schrader says it twice while sharing that information. Later, he talks about how other people viewed the film&#8217;s characters and uses the word a few more times. In each instance he&#8217;s essentially referring to someone else&#8217;s use of the word, but it&#8217;s clear that he has no qualms about using it himself. Context matters I suppose, and as a reminder this commentary is roughly twenty-five years-old, but still, his language is unnecessary and left unchallenged.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Schrader is a &#8220;give no shits&#8221; kind of filmmaker, for better and worse, but his observations on <em>Blue Collar</em> are honest and never less than engaging. He points out weaknesses in his script, shares his inexperience, and offers up anecdotes involving his cast that are both entertaining and crazy. McDonagh unfortunately doesn&#8217;t add much, as while she&#8217;s a strong writer in her own right she seems a bit out of her element here. Still, it&#8217;s a great listen and highly recommended.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Read more <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/section/features/commentary/\">Commentary Commentary</a> from the archives.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/AVNHV3Vvky8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 21:20:06 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2.jpg","linkMd5":"651a7b433ab85d3a38472b69616833e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-39-32-675_85574ed34fd03c9e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":61282,"destBytes":44320,"author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blue-collar2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-39-32-675_85574ed34fd03c9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/AVNHV3Vvky8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn25@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-49-612_19caa2439d3f1fd5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847154097},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:14","title":"How the Makers of Hulu’s ‘Run’ Got Traditional Thrills to Pop","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359737","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/world-builders\"><strong>World Builders</strong></a>, our ongoing series of conversations with the most productive and thoughtful behind-the-scenes craftspeople in the industry.

In their minds, they knew their gimmick had legs and could stand tall next to other thrillers. All they had to do was expertly and flawlessly execute the craft to expose the emotion behind the schtick.</p> \n<p>They succeeded.</p> \n<p>Toward the end of our first conversation, we discussed their excitement regarding their next project briefly. At the time, they were already days into shooting <strong><em>Run</em></strong>. On a few occasions, Ohanian stopped himself, coming very close to spilling the beans on key plot points. The filmmakers were giddy, bouncing like children in a candy store, finally operating in a cinematic arena mastered by the greats.</p> \n<p><em>Run</em> is their chance to deliver a film they would adore. The premise is razor-thin but deadly sharp. A teenage daughter (<strong>Kiera Allen</strong>) begins to suspect the control her mother (<strong>Sarah Paulson</strong>) has on her life stems from more than a medical concern. What are those pills she swallows every day? What happens when she pockets them in her piggy bank? When trust erodes, will a dark truth reveal itself?</p> \n<p><iframe title=\"RUN - Trailer (Official) • A Hulu Original\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lf99oBP5mhQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Speaking to Chaganty and Ohanian today, it’s clear that their energy and enthusiasm for their new film has only elevated.&nbsp;As the director, Chaganty wants to prove to himself and others that he can play with the rest of the kids. He’s no one-trick pony.</p> \n<p><em>Run</em> is their stab at Hitchcock. It’s designed to bob and weave, to hit you with an expected right hook as a means of distracting you from the big wallop coming from the left. The audience knows what they’re buying into when they sit down to watch. The filmmakers’ joy extends from their ability to slap the viewer&nbsp;and knock them from their defiant, crossed arms position.</p> \n<p>“On a perception level,” says Chaganty, “I did not want to place myself in a box. <em>Searching</em> is technically complex and a gimmick. I think we pulled it off, but it’s still a gimmick.”</p> \n<p>At least, that’s how it started. <em>Searching</em> was an opportunity to showcase.&nbsp;<em>Run</em> was always the future.</p> \n<p>“I was a filmmaker who was nobody before that film,” continues Chaganty. “If we nailed [<em>Searching</em>], if we did it really, really well, it could be the platform where I actually get to make the movies that I want to make.”</p> \n<p>Having access to the more traditional tools of filmmaking was both freeing and constricting this time around. As co-writer and producer, Ohanian concedes that yanking the narrative off a desktop opens the plot to infinite possibilities, but sometimes endless choices equal stagnant thought.</p> \n<p>“Did we miss the restrictions that we had on <em>Searching</em>?” he asks. “Probably not. In a lot of ways, those restrictions on <em>Searching</em> created opportunities. To be frank, the benefit of <em>Searching</em> taking place on a computer screen is it kind of allowed us to modify the edit in ways that are not possible with a regular movie because usually, we have to re-shoot people and schedule actors to come in. With <em>Searching</em>, you can just click and drag something.”</p> \n<p>With a conventional structure comes conventional problems with conventional solutions. To achieve the bob and weave of a successful thriller, relying on the standard execution is not permitted. Chaganty and Ohanian needed their audience to dig deep into the minds of their characters.</p> \n<p>“There were other restrictions on <em>Run</em>,” says Ohanian. “Primarily, <em>Run</em> is a film about this young lady who for a lot of the movie is either by herself or opposite her mother. One of the things that became really difficult was: how do we get into this girl’s head? We don’t have that best friend character where she could be like, ‘I think something weird is going on, and here’s how I feel.’ I wish we did. Sometimes it would have been great.”</p> \n<p>There is no shortcut dialogue. The camera, the actors, and the edit do the heavy lifting. If one falters, they all falter.</p> \n<p>“It forced us to be even more creative,” continues Ohanian. “You have to let the audience get into her head, not necessarily about what she’s saying, but what she’s doing, and more importantly, how she’s feeling. That is something that I really think we excelled at, to Aneesh’s credit, and Kiera nailed. Her performance is so good, especially knowing this is her first-ever full-movie.”</p> \n<p>To get their audience into the characters, they first had to get their actors into them. The challenge became working with two actors who have two very different styles of approach. On set, Chaganty constructed dueling game plans.</p> \n<p>“Before the movie started,” says Chaganty, “I wrote this sixteen-page, ten-point font backstory booklet for [Sarah Paulson’s] character. Her whole life with her mom, her mom’s mom. Every moment from the moment she grew up. All these little tiny stories of the objects in her house. Our time before shooting was spent going over that, less than the script. We knew Sarah was so talented, obviously. All she needs to do is soak in the right information, and it’ll pop out with fire.”</p> \n<p>On the other end, with Kiera, Chaganty took a radically different approach.</p> \n<p>“We went over everything,” he says. “It felt like my job wouldn’t be to give [Kiera Allen] the material — the backstory to soak in — but rather for her to create it herself or feel ownership of it. I made her write her own sixteen-page, ten-point font backstory about every single moment in her life and everything in her house and why it’s there and when was the last time she used it. Oftentimes, I would literally go into before shooting something and be like, ‘What’s that? How’d you get that?’ Just asking these questions because she would then process it and take ownership of it.”</p> \n<p>Since Paulson and Allen don’t share the screen in every scene, operating in such a duel fashion with the actors didn’t often result in schizophrenic direction. However, when they did occupy the same scene, Chaganty’s approach would eat up a little more time. Time well spent.</p> \n<p>“With Sarah,” he explains, “my directions were so technical. From take one, she was killing it. The decisions in the edit room were not choices between a good take and a bad take. They were choices between what we want her to think about at this moment. Whether we want her to be a little upset at that moment. They were genuinely valid pathways that she was providing in every take. I would basically be like, ‘Hey, can you do that faster? Can you pick up this thing?’ It was very technical.”</p> \n<p>“With Kiera,” he continues, “I was sitting down with her, hushed whispers, talking for minutes at a time, across the same scenes. The thing is, both processes were resulting in this great take.”</p> \n<p>Along with producing partner&nbsp;<strong>Natalie Qasabian</strong>, Chaganty and Ohanian have established an unbreakable collaboration. Whenever a creative partnership clicks, one should latch on. There are so many obstacles within the industry and within yourself. If you can find someone who motivates you to be the better you, that’s a crucial and necessary relationship.</p> \n<p>“We first met when I was a TA on Aneesh’s film school movie,” says Ohanian. “We wrote our first movie, which is like a hundred million dollar movie that maybe one day we’ll make. Then we made <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/94024888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this Google Glass video called <em>Seeds</em></a>, then <em>Searching,</em> and then&nbsp;<em>Run</em>. We’re producing <em>Searching 2</em> together. We got our next movie we’re writing right now. We’ve become truly equal partners in so many ways.”</p> \n<p>The bond has strengthened but not staled. They are not the same filmmakers that made <em>Seeds</em>, or even <em>Searching</em>, and maybe not even <em>Run</em>. They make room in themselves for growth.</p> \n<p>“The trust has gone up,” says Chaganty. “The shorthand has gone up. The relationship always has to change because you, as a person, is always changing. The movies that I love now are not the movies that I loved as much as when Sev and I first met. My taste has changed and evolved into something different than where it was, for better or worse.”</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><strong><em>Run</em> starts streaming on Hulu on November 20th.</strong></p> \n<img
