Today, the search giant has announced that users on the stable channel can now organize their tabs into groups for easier identification. Just right click on a Chrome tab, and follow this path &#8211; <strong><em>Add tab to group > New group</em></strong>. You can then pick up a name for the group and also color code it for easier identification. Here, have a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1280x616.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571323\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1280x616.jpg 1280w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-641x308.jpg 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-768x369.jpg 768w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1536x739.jpg 1536w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-800x385.jpg 800w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1160x558.jpg 1160w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs.jpg 1906w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, you can drag and drop tabs into a group with ease. More importantly, groups will be saved and will spring back to life as soon as you restore the closed window. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://pocketnow.com/tag/google\">Google</a> says it has made a few <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/chrome-just-got-faster-with-profile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">improvements</a> that will make Chrome tabs load up to 10 times faster. Another useful feature coming to Chrome is the ability to fill out PDF forms and save them directly in Chrome. Moreover, when users open the PDF file again, they can start from the same point where they left off. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/PDF-Editor.gif\" alt=\"PDF-Editor.gif\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Chrome users will soon see a miniaturized window preview at the top of the screen while switching tabs. This tweak has been made with tablets and touchscreen devices in mind, and is first coming to Chromebooks soon. This is how it looks:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/TouchpadTab_Manager.gif\" alt=\"TouchpadTab_Manager.gif\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Google is also testing a new tab view format that will let users see a small preview of a tab when they hover the cursor over it. This will surely come in handy when you have a lot of tabs from the same website opened across multiple tabs. This feature is first coming to the beta channel, and here&#8217;s how it looks: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Hover_Preview.gif\" alt=\"Hover_Preview.gif\"/></figure>\n\n            <script>\n                jQuery(document).ready(function(){\n                    setTimeout(function(){\n                        window.newVuukleWidgets({\n                           elementsIndex: 571318,\n                           articleId: 571318,\n                           img: \"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/Chrome_tabs-136x136.jpg\",\n                           title: \"Chrome now lets you organize tabs into groups and makes opening them 10% faster\",\n                           tags: \"Google, Google Chrome, News\",\n                           url: \"https://pocketnow.com/chrome-now-lets-you-organize-tabs-into-groups-and-makes-opening-them-10-faster\",\n                        });\n                    }, 2000);\n                }); \n            </script> <div class=\"vuukle-powerbar-571318\"></div>\n                                <div id=\"vuukle-emote-571318\"></div>\n                                <div id=\"vuukle-comments-571318\"></div>\n                               <div id=\"vuukle-emote\" style='max-width:600px' class=\"emotesBoxDiv\"></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pocketnow.com/chrome-now-lets-you-organize-tabs-into-groups-and-makes-opening-them-10-faster\">Chrome now lets you organize tabs into groups and makes opening them 10% faster</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pocketnow.com\">Pocketnow</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pocketnow/~4/Xif4o9A8R5M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:47:29 +0000","feedId":1363,"bgimg":"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1280x616.jpg","linkMd5":"7932f2d3ad6e68f28bdc9a97b047b27b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-25-48-783_3264135022dcd930.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":616,"sourceBytes":103567,"destBytes":72728,"author":"Nadeem Sarwar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/tabs-1280x616.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-25-48-783_3264135022dcd930.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/PDF-Editor.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-27-30-803_05bbd59a8ac0ac3f.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/TouchpadTab_Manager.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn10@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-26-28-212_958539f074790296.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Hover_Preview.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-26-36-627_60d8ee89e506d33e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pocketnow/~4/Xif4o9A8R5M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-26-10-989_87afebec75b642f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379948642},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:25:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:25:48","title":"Microsoft adds useful Transcribe and Dictate tools to Word for the web","link":"https://pocketnow.com/?p=571310","description":"\n<p>Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&amp;hl=en_IN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recorder app</a> has proved to be of great help to me when it came to transcribing long interviews, and with sufficiently high accuracy. <a href=\"https://pocketnow.com/tag/microsoft\">Microsoft</a> is doing something similar in Word for the web by adding a new Transcribe tool. As the name suggests, the tool allows users to transcribe audio clips or live audio. The Transcribe option is located underneath the Dictate tool on the formatting toolbar, and you can see it in action below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gif-transcription-with-audio-upload.gif\" alt=\"An animated image showing the functionality of dictation in Word.\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you hit the Transcribe button, you can choose to select an existing audio file saved on your PC or record a live conversation. The transcribed text will be separated when a different person speaks, and there is also an option to edit and use individual quotes directly in a document. Currently, Transcribe is available in Word for the web for all Microsoft 365 subscribers and works on the new Edge and Chrome browsers, but it only supports English for now. There is also a limit of 5 hours worth of transcription time per month for recordings uploaded by users, and there is also a file size cap of 200MB.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1279\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571316\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139.png 1279w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139-641x338.png 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139-768x405.png 768w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139-380x200.png 380w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139-800x422.png 800w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139-1160x612.png 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second tool that has been added to Word for the web is Dictate. And as you would&#8217;ve guessed, it uses voice commands such as “start list”, “bold last sentence”, “add percent sign&#8221;, “smiley face”, or “sad emoji” while writing something. Additionally, users can quickly add a comment by saying something like &#8220;add comment [comment content]&#8221; while collaborating on a project. Voice command dictation is available in Word for the web and Office mobile app, and is coming to Word desktop and Mac apps for Microsoft 365 subscribers later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/08/25/microsoft-365-transcription-voice-commands-word/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Blog</a></p>\n\n            <script>\n                jQuery(document).ready(function(){\n                    setTimeout(function(){\n                        window.newVuukleWidgets({\n                           elementsIndex: 571310,\n                           articleId: 571310,\n                           img: \"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/microsoft-136x136.jpg\",\n                           title: \"Microsoft adds useful Transcribe and Dictate tools to Word for the web\",\n                           tags: \"Dictate, Microsoft, News\",\n                           url: \"https://pocketnow.com/microsoft-adds-useful-transcribe-and-dictate-tools-to-word-for-the-web\",\n                        });\n                    }, 2000);\n                }); \n            </script> <div class=\"vuukle-powerbar-571310\"></div>\n                                <div id=\"vuukle-emote-571310\"></div>\n                                <div id=\"vuukle-comments-571310\"></div>\n                               <div id=\"vuukle-emote\" style='max-width:600px' class=\"emotesBoxDiv\"></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pocketnow.com/microsoft-adds-useful-transcribe-and-dictate-tools-to-word-for-the-web\">Microsoft adds useful Transcribe and Dictate tools to Word for the web</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pocketnow.com\">Pocketnow</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pocketnow/~4/o_zxofI6g8c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:44:54 +0000","feedId":1363,"bgimg":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gif-transcription-with-audio-upload.gif","linkMd5":"0ed46cceaa79c6530b959b3e2f181f22","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-26-09-368_1cab0c3c5a41ff12.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":622,"sourceBytes":3917035,"destBytes":2575178,"author":"Nadeem Sarwar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gif-transcription-with-audio-upload.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-26-09-368_1cab0c3c5a41ff12.webp","https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-139.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-26-11-404_10a53bade72998ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pocketnow/~4/o_zxofI6g8c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-26-10-981_d7c9afac3d1132a0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379948643},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:25:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:25:48","title":"Here&#8217;s a Galaxy Z Fold 2 review video before Samsung could reveal more on September 1","link":"https://pocketnow.com/?p=571299","description":"\n<p>When Samsung introduced the Galaxy Z Fold 2 at its unpacked event earlier this month, the company only gave a brief video preview of the device and promised to reveal more details about it on September 1. But before that happens and <a href=\"https://pocketnow.com/tag/pocketnow\">Samsung&#8217;s</a> new foldable phone could hit the shelves, a full-fledged Galaxy Z Fold 2 review video has been posted on YouTube, giving us our first glimpse of the slick device while being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"cs-embed cs-embed-responsive\"><iframe title=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Review: The best foldable phone！\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWxA90icr4E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the video is in Chinese, and since I don&#8217;t speak or understand the language, I can&#8217;t tell you how it fared in the review. But what we do get is an up-close look at the Galaxy Z Fold 2 from all angles, including its redesigned hinge, the larger cover display and the inner foldable panel. But here are a few key takeaways from the video:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1014\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-134.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571301\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-134.png 1014w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-134-641x492.png 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-134-768x589.png 768w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-134-800x614.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" /><figcaption>Image: YouTube / 灵感研究所</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The cover display on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 now occupies almost the entire front panel, while the Galaxy Fold had ugly thick bezels on the cover display. And thanks to the larger screen real estate, the cover display can now be used for tasks like gaming without any second thoughts. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1267\" height=\"871\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571302\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135.png 1267w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135-641x441.png 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135-768x528.png 768w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135-800x550.png 800w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-135-1160x797.png 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1267px) 100vw, 1267px\" /><figcaption>Image: YouTube / 灵感研究所</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And thanks to the hole punch, the inner foldable panel of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 looks cleaner and more immersive compared to the Galaxy Fold, which had a huge notch in the right corner. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"968\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-137.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571304\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-137.png 968w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-137-641x493.png 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-137-768x590.png 768w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-137-800x615.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px\" /><figcaption>Image: YouTube / 灵感研究所</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, it appears that the crease in the middle of the foldable panel is here to stay, just the way it was easily noticeable on the Galaxy Fold. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"736\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-138.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571305\" srcset=\"https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-138.png 736w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-138-641x350.png 641w, https://pocketnow.com/wp/../files/2020/08/image-138-200x110.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An interesting new use case scenario is that the cover display of the Galaxy Z fold 2 can be used as a viewfinder to click selfies and record high-resolution vlogs using the rear cameras, a feature will be a huge deal for content creators. In the meanwhile, here&#8217;s what Pocketnow&#8217;s Jaime Rivera thinks about it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube
