It caters for all levels and comes with a variety of learning aids. The program&#8217;s aim is to make you absorb your target language in the same way that you do when you&#8217;re a child.</p>\n<p>In total, 24 languages are offered on the platform, including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Mandarin, and Russian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/the-2020-digital-life-hack-bundle-ft-rosetta-stone?utm_source=makeuseof.com&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_campaign=the-2020-digital-life-hack-bundle-ft-rosetta-stone_071820&#38;utm_term=scsf-416281&#38;utm_content=a0x1P000004sn9pQAA&#38;scsonar=1\">This deal</a> gives you <strong>lifetime access to all 24 languages</strong> on both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also be able to practice your pronunciation with Rosetta Stone&#8217;s <span>TruAccent speech recognition technology and, when you feel comfortable enough, use the advanced speech engine to compare your accent with native speakers.</span></p>\n<h2>KeepSolid VPN Unlimited</h2>\n<p>The lockdown has meant we&#8217;ve all been binge-watching TV and movies more than ever. That&#8217;s where the next tool in the bundle&#8212;KeepSolid VPN Unlimited&#8212;is useful.</p>\n<p>As any regular MakeUseOf reader knows, using a VPN lets you bypass geoblocking that streaming services put in place. It means you can access the Netflix catalog from another country, stream live TV from BBC iPlayer if you&#8217;re based outside the UK, and even sign up for paid subscriptions with video-on-demand providers from elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Of course, a VPN is also an essential security tool. You can protect yourself on public Wi-Fi, prevent your ISP and local government from seeing your web traffic, and encrypt all your internet data.</p>\n<p>KeepSolid VPN Unlimited has servers in more than 80 countries and supports the major VPN protocols such as I<span>KEv2, OpenVPN, and L2TP/IPSec.</span></p>\n<p>Once again, this deal will bag you a <strong>lifetime subscription</strong>.</p>\n<h2>12min Premium Micro Book Library</h2>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4kD_4NIDSI' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p>The final lifetime subscription in our social distancing bundle is 12min Premium Micro Book Library.</p>\n<p>One of the curious truths about 2020&#8217;s lockdown is that while we might all be spending more time in our homes, many of us also have less free time than ever. Anyone with kids knows what we&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a book lover who&#8217;s not had time to read any new material in 2020, 12min Premium Micro Book Library might offer a solution. The app&#8217;s specialty is providing digestible overviews of long books. In theory, each overview only takes 12 minutes to read. Audio and text versions are available.</p>\n<p>In total, more than 380 overviews are on the platform, with 30+ new titles added every month.</p>\n<h2>Make Social Distancing Fun!</h2>\n<p>More knowledge, more entertainment, more security. The perfect lockdown combination. If you&#8217;d like to get lifetime access to these three premium apps, make sure you <a href=\"https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/the-2020-digital-life-hack-bundle-ft-rosetta-stone?utm_source=makeuseof.com&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_campaign=the-2020-digital-life-hack-bundle-ft-rosetta-stone_071820&#38;utm_term=scsf-416281&#38;utm_content=a0x1P000004sn9pQAA&#38;scsonar=1\">grab the bundle</a> while it&#8217;s still available&#8212;<strong>the deal expires on August 15th, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p class='appexclude'>Read the full article: <a href='https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lifetime-cheap-rosetta-stone/'>How Lifetime Access to Rosetta Stone Is Cheaper Than You Think</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 05:30:57 +0000","feedId":14,"bgimg":"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_339642275.jpg","linkMd5":"2ac3601449475af7f8e1b49a7d759ce2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_5/2020-08-07/1596792651775_17e06b08cce25eff.webp","author":"Dan Price","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_339642275.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn90@2020_5/2020-08-07/1596792651775_17e06b08cce25eff.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-07 17:30:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-07 17:30:36","title":"Google Discontinues Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL Flagships","link":"https://www.makeuseof.com/?p=980375","description":"<div><img width=\"1680\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixel-4-sold-out-featured.jpg\" class=\"attachment-featured size-featured wp-post-image\" alt=\"Google Discontinues Pixel 4\" /></div><p>Hot on the heels of <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-pixel-4a-announcement/\">announcing the Pixel 4a and teasing the release of the Pixel 5</a>, Google has already discontinued the production of its Pixel 4 and 4 XL flagship phones. Both the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are fantastic phones, so we&#8217;re sad to see them go.</p>\n<h2>Can You Still Buy The Pixel 4 and 4 XL?</h2>\n<p><span>A Google spokesperson talked to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock\">The Verge</a> and said, &#8220;Google Store has sold through its inventory and completed sales of Pixel 4 [and] 4 XL.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about getting a Pixel 4, you can still find them at some retailers until they sell out. The phones will still be available for a limited time, according to a Google spokesperson. &#8220;For people who are still interested in buying Pixel 4 [and] 4 XL, the product is available from some partners while supplies last,&#8221; the representative said.</p>\n<div class='youtube-player'><iframe data-src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0gizLT97cKo' class='lazy-load' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-index='1'></iframe></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA01187-US-Pixel-Black-Unlocked/dp/B07YMNLXL3\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google/learn-about-google-pixel-4/pcmcat1566430029496.c\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1507474-REG/google_ga01187_us_pixel_4_64gb_smartphone.html\">B&#38;H</a> all have the Pixel 4 in stock, so you shouldn&#8217;t have too much trouble finding a device for the time being. If you act fast, you&#8217;ll be able to choose between the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, depending on your needs. However, we expect both devices to be out of stock soon.</p>\n<p>If you were hoping to jump on a Pixel 4 at a discounted price, prepare to be disappointed. All of the retailers we checked still had the Pixel 4 listed at its $799 starting price. With a seemingly limited supply out there, we expect most retailers to sell through their stock without discounts.</p>\n<h2>Should You Buy a Pixel 4?</h2>\n<p>The Pixel 4 is a tremendous phone that&#8217;s definitely still worth picking up. Until we know what the Pixel 5 offers, it&#8217;s hard to say whether you should wait or not. In the end, it&#8217;ll come down to how soon you need a new flagship phone in your life.</p>\n<p>If you purchase a Pixel 4, you&#8217;ll be able to play some of the <a href=\"//www.makeuseof.com/tag/xbox-one-games-android/\">best Xbox games on it soon</a>.</p>\n<p class='appexclude'>Read the full article: <a href='https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-discontinues-pixel-4/'>Google Discontinues Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL Flagships</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 01:45:44 +0000","feedId":14,"bgimg":"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixel-4-sold-out-featured.jpg","linkMd5":"6b57abc3e9c3be1c3b4ebf3e570d81ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_6/2020-08-07/1596792671215_16058beba2843a40.webp","author":"Dave LeClair","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixel-4-sold-out-featured.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn86@2020_6/2020-08-07/1596792671215_16058beba2843a40.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-07 17:30:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-07 17:30:36","feedId":14,"fetchDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 09:30:36 +0000","fetchMs":100,"handleMs":1629,"totalMs":37735,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"54.76.14.211","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"03776026bbb24f4ea2a290b3830e6386_14","bgimgsTotal":2,"bgimgsGithubTotal":2,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-07 16:37:55","id":14,"name":"MakeUseOf","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/Makeuseof","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/themes/makeuseof2016/components/icons/128x128.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-07/1596792635931_9cb91170ecc71c9d.png","description":"Cool Websites, Software and Internet Tips","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.makeuseof.com"},"extra4":{"start":1596792635101,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":117,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":1629,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[]}
