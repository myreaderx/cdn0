Michael is one of many friends I&#8217;ve made on the Internet. We all share common interests (the main one seems to be the Internet itself) and frequent a lot of the same virtual conversations. From following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/sippey\">Michael Sippey on Twitter</a>, Facebook and our common music streaming service, I know that he is a fellow Arcade Fire fan. It&#8217;s just one of the personal details and threads of commonality I share with a growing community of fellow web professionals and others whose path I regularly cross. This community wouldn&#8217;t exist for me without the assistance  of the Internet and the suite of social software that now rides its rails.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a member of several of these virtual groups, large and small. I count on these folks for much of my news. On blogs and Twitter, we share inside jokes and opinions, and riff off each other in the same way I do with my friends in real life.</p>\n<p>It turns out Michael Sippey was at the same show and even in the same section, but true to form, the only interaction we had was via a couple follow-up emails. Keepin&#8217; it virtual is the new keepin&#8217; it real.</p>\n<p>The Internet has had a dual effect on the level of connectedness I feel with the people I know in my offline life. On one hand, the basic communication tools now available make distance almost a non-issue. My conversation with Mordy that led to this post took place over instant messenger where we communicate nearly every day &#8211; far more often than we ever did before the Internet, even though back then, we were only separated by a few blocks, not a few thousand miles.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, when I am actually with my friends and family, I find myself (and increasingly, my companions) distracted by a smartphone that&#8217;s either the object of my gaze or being fingered in my front pocket.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Cell-Phones.aspx\">Pew Internet survey</a>, 13% of cell owners said that they&#8217;ve pretended to be using their phone in order to avoid interacting with the people around them. I&#8217;m assuming the other 87% of cell owners were not pretending at all, and were using their phones because they just couldn&#8217;t help themselves. I recently walked through a hotel restaurant where every single person was interacting with a device of some sort. They were together spatially, but that was about it.</p>\n<p>The actual number of social interactions I have with friends hasn&#8217;t been impacted by the Internet. But I do worry that the quality of those interactions has taken a hit because everyone in the room is not only connected to each other, but also to everything else in the world.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to my connectedness with people I know, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s about a draw. The overall frequency of our interactions has increased, but my ability to focus on them and only them has become more challenging in this age of distraction.</p>\n<p>The distractions play an even more aggressive role when it comes to my connection with myself. Most of the moments once reserved for a little alone time have been infiltrated by the realtime Internet. I never just wait for a bus, or just stand in line at a bank, or even just sit and think as I sit stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. At these moments, I pull my phone out of my pocket faster than a gunfighter pulls his weapon out of its holster.</p>\n<p>The only time I really experience any self-reflection these days is when my computer sleeps and my screen goes dark.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not alone. According to Pew, 42% of cell owners used their phone for entertainment when they were bored. If those 42% of people are anything like me, that so-called boredom now arrives sooner than the random thoughts that can lead to self-reflection, creativity or just a few seconds of nothingness. I can draw my phone faster than my mind can wander.</p>\n<p>Of course, the draw of our devices is about more than relieving boredom (a goal the devices only occasionally achieve). It&#8217;s about getting a fix; reacting to a feeling of urgency that you&#8217;ve got to keep up with whatever it is that&#8217;s coming into your stream right now. Part of the power of the realtime web is that it can quickly make you feel like you can&#8217;t live without a flow of data that you easily lived without before you discovered it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the Internet&#8217;s reverse placebo effect: you feel as though you were missing something important before you signed up for the latest service. It&#8217;s a drug for an ailment you never had.</p>\n<p>At that same Arcade Fire concert, a guy in front of me held his camera phone towards the big screen that flanked the stage and hit the video record button. He stood like that for a long time, separated from a live concert by two screens. Maybe he gained some social benefit by sharing the video with a friend or a broader Internet audience. But the concert provided him an opportunity to lose himself in the music and the moment. He let a screen block that experience.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m thankful that I can use the Internet to connect with my old friends and my newer, virtual communities. But I&#8217;m worried about the price of that always-on connection. Without the Internet, my friend Mordy never would have asked me the question that led to this post. With the Internet, it&#8217;s a lot less likely I&#8217;ll ask similar questions of myself.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?a=8a8dUV_8Ek4:QEl5HeTTwPc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?a=8a8dUV_8Ek4:QEl5HeTTwPc:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?a=8a8dUV_8Ek4:QEl5HeTTwPc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tweetagewasteland/~4/8a8dUV_8Ek4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Aug 2011 18:53:19 +0000","feedId":40269,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"9d1131c1ed25020611335e5fafd69802","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn45@2020_1/2020/10/19/03-34-25-113_9cd52e0a4b333e9a.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"Dave Pell","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn45@2020_1/2020/10/19/03-34-25-113_9cd52e0a4b333e9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn54@2020_3/2020/10/19/03-34-26-374_d40b5a02841fa0c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/tweetagewasteland?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn50@2020_1/2020/10/19/03-34-26-377_3c798b58a50042b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tweetagewasteland/~4/8a8dUV_8Ek4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn58@2020_4/2020/10/19/03-34-26-353_db7f78fd2003e704.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603078465035}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 11:34:25","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 11:34:25","feedId":40269,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 03:34:25 +0000","fetchMs":169,"handleMs":240529,"totalMs":243309,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"37ff164ed8700febcc02ea7a26d1d1bb","hostName":"europe-58*","requestId":"3c1e7c67a61043ab8975f52cbce80339_40269","contentType":"text/xml;
