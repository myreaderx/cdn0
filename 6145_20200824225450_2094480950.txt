We had 10 presentations and the videos for them are <a href=\"https://pages.jetbrains.com/technology-day-java-2020\">available here</a>. Over the coming weeks, in no particular order, we&#8217;d like to share with you extra resources that our speakers kindly provided and any links to further reading or code samples.</p>\n<p>We hosted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade\">Nikhil Nanivadekar</a> talking about collections. Collections are among the basic building blocks for writing code. Frequently used collections, such as List, Set, and Map, are designed to serve a basic fundamental purpose, but sometimes these collections are not enough, and developers will want to extend them to add new functionality.</p>\n<p>In this hands-on demo, Nikhil extended the Map data structure to create two new collections called a bag (MultiSet) and a multimap (MultiValuedMap) and explained the basics of creating a new collection, adding new APIs, the salient aspects of the new collection, and the various knobs and controls required to make it safe and usable.</p>\n<p>We loved how Nikhil started at the beginning with his presentation and proceeded to take us through it in real time. Nikhil live-coded using IntelliJ IDEA and used Test Driven Development (TDD) to create new collections. You might even pick up an IntelliJ IDEA trick or two while watching Nikhil code! Nikhil asked us to mention that Eclipse Collections has nothing to do with Eclipse IDE and he writes code for Eclipse Collections in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wlH_s3sGxTo?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Code samples</strong><br />\nAll the code from the session is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code respository: <a href=\"https://github.com/nikhilnanivadekar/DIYCollections\">https://github.com/nikhilnanivadekar/DIYCollections</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eclipse Collections information</strong><br />\nFurther information about Eclipse Collections is available here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eclipse Collections website: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/collections/\">https://www.eclipse.org/collections/</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections\">https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections Kata Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata\">https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata</a></li>\n<li>Eclipse Collections API Design: <a href=\"http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/api-design/\">http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/api-design/</a>#/</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\nThese are additional posts provided by Nikhil if you&#8217;re interested in learning more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UnifiedSet: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedset-the-memory-saver-25b830745959\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedset-the-memory-saver-25b830745959</a></li>\n<li>UnifiedMap: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedmap-how-it-works-48af0b80cb37\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/unifiedmap-how-it-works-48af0b80cb37</a></li>\n<li>Bag: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/bag-the-counter-2689e901aadb\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/bag-the-counter-2689e901aadb</a></li>\n<li>Multimap: <a href=\"https://medium.com/oracledevs/multimap-how-it-works-a3430f549d35\">https://medium.com/oracledevs/multimap-how-it-works-a3430f549d35</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What our audience thought of Nikhil&#8217;s demo</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Muy buena presentación de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">NikhilNanivade</a> en la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JBTechDayforJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JBTechDayforJava</a><a href=\"https://t.co/yAWOWPS2mT\">https://t.co/yAWOWPS2mT</a></p>\n<p> CyberneticKoi (@CyberneticKoi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CyberneticKoi/status/1281597677562736642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THANKS ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NikhilNanivade</a> Incredible presentation bro <br />&#8220;Technology Day For Java&#8221;<br />cc <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javabsas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@javabsas</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetbrains?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jetbrains</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JetBrainsLovesJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JetBrainsLovesJava</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JBTechDayforJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JBTechDayforJava</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JetBrainsLovesJava?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JetBrainsLovesJava</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Java?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Java</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaBaires?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaBaires</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaBsAs?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaBsAs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaProgrammers?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JavaProgrammers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/javaArgentina?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#javaArgentina</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/loveJavaProgramming?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#loveJavaProgramming</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jug?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Jug</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Gm6INLjlBe\">pic.twitter.com/Gm6INLjlBe</a></p>\n<p>— C:\\Users\\Mauri\\Java (MauriDeveloper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MauriDeveloper/status/1281605528305770496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikhilNanivade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">NikhilNanivade</a> implemented Bag and Multimap classes in 45min using TDD.

Angie described why any automation was probably still passing, making you think that everything was fine when it’s not. It’s one thing for the elements to be displayed on the page, it’s another thing entirely for them to be displayed in the right place at the right time! </p> \n<p>Angie then took us through how we can use automation to do some visual checking using an API from <a href=\"https://applitools.com/\">Applitools</a> and discussed the pros and cons.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed//4WsvIw581dk?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Angie’s Website</strong><br /> Angie has a great website with lots of resources:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&amp;p=67470/angiejones.tech\">Angie’s Website</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Test Automation University</strong><br /> I have completed the Java Programming course that Angie wrote for Test Automation University.

In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, we decided to focus on this feature, introducing several changes to simplify working with problems in your code. Our main goal was to make it easier for you to view all the problems at once and to navigate between them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspections_widget\">Inspections widget</h2>\n<p>Previously, problems in the current file were shown with a single icon in the upper right-hand corner of the editor. It was unclear how to navigate through the problems, however, and the icon was uninformative and hard to see.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/old-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, we’ve replaced the old icon with the Inspections widget. It provides detailed information about warnings, errors, and other problems in the current file.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/new-inspections-widget-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The Inspections widget allows you to navigate through the problems in your file using the arrow icons. You can also use the <strong>F2</strong> and <strong>⇧F2</strong> shortcuts, and then press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> to see the available fixes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f2-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If code analysis is in progress, the icons are either replaced with the analysis progress text or dimmed out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/states-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Hover over the widget to see detailed information about the current state of the analysis process and about the problems that have been found.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/progress-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re in the process of writing new code and warnings are not that important to you at the moment, you can change the highlighting level to Syntax. This way, warnings won’t distract you. To make this change, hover over the Inspections widget and use the link at the bottom of the popup to change the highlighting level to Syntax or None.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/popup-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Just be sure to change the highlighting level back to All Problems when the time comes for you to polish your code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"related_problems\">Related problems</h2>\n<p>Starting from version 2020.2, IntelliJ IDEA shows problems that occur in other files as a result of changes made in the file you are currently working on.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve changed a non-private part of class API in some way – for example, by renaming a public field or updating the number of parameters in a package-private method signature – IntelliJ IDEA will analyze files related to that change and will notify you of any problems it finds with an inlay hint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/related-problems-2x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can click on the hint or use an action from the <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> menu to see the full list of related problems in the Find tool window. Currently, this feature works only for Java.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems_tool_window\">Problems tool window</h2>\n<p>We’ve introduced a new Problems tool window. Click on the Inspections widget in the editor or use the <strong>Ctrl/Cmd+6</strong> shortcut to open it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/current-file-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The Current File tab shows the list of problems in the file that is open in the editor. Select a problem and press <strong>Enter</strong> or double-click to navigate to it. You can also open a preview right in the tool window, and you can use the eye icon to filter the problems by type and to change the sorting.</p>\n<p>The light bulb icon on the toolbar turns on if there are quick fixes for the selected problem. You can also press <strong>Alt+Enter</strong> on a problem to see the list of available quick fixes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/altenter-2x-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"what_s_next\">What’s next</h2>\n<p>Our plans don’t end here. With v2020.3, we will continue to make it working with errors in IntelliJ IDEA easier. We are going to add the Project Errors tab to the Problems tool window.

Many applications will have a large number of JUnit tests written using JUnit 4. <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/\">JUnit 5</a> was released in 2017, and provides a lot of features that weren&#8217;t in the previous version. This blog shows you how to migrate existing JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5 using <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/9afc1e77d269e0d4a0cbcf57f9862e9b321f2e68/standard-java/src/test/com/jetbrains/testing/JUnit4To5.java\">this java class</a> initially. All the code before the migration we will go through <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/b52a483d0d6fe612ea4ef3f727792a10795061f8\">is available here</a>.</p>\n<p>A typical JUnit 4 test contains sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>code to run once at the start of all the tests<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@BeforeClass\npublic static void beforeClass() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.beforeClass&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run before each individual test<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@Before\npublic void before() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.before&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>the tests themselves, some of which may be ignored<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@Test\npublic void shouldMigrateASimpleTest() {\nAssert.assertEquals(&#34;expected&#34;, &#34;expected&#34;);\n}\n@Test\n@Ignore\npublic void shouldMigrateIgnoreTestToDisabledTest() {\n// This test is Ignored in JUnit 4 and should be Disabled in JUnit 5&#34;\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run to clean up after each test<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@After\npublic void after() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.after&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n<li>code to run once to clean up after all tests<br />\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">@AfterClass\npublic static void afterClass() throws Exception {\nSystem.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.afterClass&#34;);\n}</pre></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project is currently using JUnit 4.13, but these guidelines apply to any version of JUnit 4. We also have a dependency on Hamcrest. We need to edit our <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/9afc1e77d269e0d4a0cbcf57f9862e9b321f2e68/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"Maven POM file\">Maven POM file</a>.</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">&#60;!-- start of pom.xml is above here --&#62;\n       &#60;dependency&#62;\n           &#60;groupId&#62;junit&#60;/groupId&#62;\n           &#60;artifactId&#62;junit&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n           &#60;version&#62;4.13&#60;/version&#62;\n           &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n       &#60;/dependency&#62;\n       &#60;dependency&#62;\n           &#60;groupId&#62;org.hamcrest&#60;/groupId&#62;\n           &#60;artifactId&#62;hamcrest-library&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n           &#60;version&#62;2.2&#60;/version&#62;\n       &#60;/dependency&#62;\n&#60;!-- rest of pom.xml below --&#62;</pre></p>\n<p>The first thing we need to do in order to migrate to JUnit 5 is to add the JUnit 5 dependencies. We can get IntelliJ IDEA to do this for us, if we press <strong>⌃⏎</strong> or, <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong> within the POM file, the IDE will offer the option of adding a new dependency.</p>\n<p>Typing &#8216;JUnit&#8217; will show junit-jupiter dependencies, which are the JUnit 5 dependencies. To start with let&#8217;s add a dependency on the basic junit-jupiter-api. IntelliJ IDEA has identified that 5.7.0-M1 (milestone one) is the latest dependency. Let&#8217;s use a release version rather than a milestone, so use the drop-down to select 5.6.2 as this is the current release version.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-jupiter-562.png\" alt=\"Junit Jupiter 5.6.2\" /></p>\n<p>Because we want to run existing JUnit 4 tests with JUnit 5, we need to add one more dependency. Use <strong>⌃⏎</strong>, or , <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong> again and this time look for the JUnit vintage engine to run older tests. Once again, IntelliJ IDEA is suggesting version 5.7.0-M1. Expand the menu item using the right arrow and select version 5.6.2 so we’re using the same version as the API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-vintage-562-2.png\" alt=\"Junit Vintage Engine 5.6.2\" /></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA will update the Maven POM file with the new dependency version and imports. Click the Maven icon in the top-right to ensure that IntelliJ IDEA loads the changes. Alternatively you can use <strong>⇧⌘I</strong> on macOS, or <strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>O</strong> on Windows and Linux.</p>\n<p>We only need these dependencies to run tests, so add the test scope to them as well.</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">&#60;dependency&#62;\n   &#60;groupId&#62;org.junit.jupiter&#60;/groupId&#62;\n   &#60;artifactId&#62;junit-jupiter-api&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n   &#60;version&#62;5.6.2&#60;/version&#62;\n   &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n&#60;/dependency&#62;\n&#60;dependency&#62;\n   &#60;groupId&#62;org.junit.vintage&#60;/groupId&#62;\n   &#60;artifactId&#62;junit-vintage-engine&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n   &#60;version&#62;5.6.2&#60;/version&#62;\n   &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n&#60;/dependency&#62;</pre></p>\n<p>Now we should be able to safely remove the old JUnit 4 dependency from <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/b52a483d0d6fe612ea4ef3f727792a10795061f8/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"the Maven POM file\">the Maven POM file</a>, and the project will still compile. Click the Maven icon to make sure that IntelliJ IDEA removes the old dependency from the project.</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">&#60;dependency&#62;\n   &#60;groupId&#62;org.junit.jupiter&#60;/groupId&#62;\n   &#60;artifactId&#62;junit-jupiter-api&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n   &#60;version&#62;5.6.2&#60;/version&#62;\n   &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n&#60;/dependency&#62;\n&#60;dependency&#62;\n   &#60;groupId&#62;org.junit.vintage&#60;/groupId&#62;\n   &#60;artifactId&#62;junit-vintage-engine&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n   &#60;version&#62;5.6.2&#60;/version&#62;\n   &#60;scope&#62;test&#60;/scope&#62;\n&#60;/dependency&#62;\n&#60;dependency&#62;\n   &#60;groupId&#62;org.hamcrest&#60;/groupId&#62;\n   &#60;artifactId&#62;hamcrest-library&#60;/artifactId&#62;\n   &#60;version&#62;2.2&#60;/version&#62;\n&#60;/dependency&#62;</pre></p>\n<p>Navigate back to the Junit4ToJUnit5 class using <strong>⌘O</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>N</strong>, to find a file and <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiling-applications.html?#199ce0\">rebuild the whole project</a> with the new dependencies using <strong>⌘F9</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+F9</strong>.

IntelliJ IDEA&#8217;s inspections <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html#access-inspections-and-settings\" title=\"IntelliJ IDEA&#039;s inspections\">IntelliJ IDEA&#8217;s inspections</a> can be very helpful for migrating code. In particular there are a number of inspections for JUnit tests.</p>\n<p>To help with the migration, turn on ‘JUnit 4 test can be JUnit 5’ inspection. You can only turn this on if you’re using at least Java 8 and have JUnit 5 dependencies set up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit4-can-be-5.png\" alt=\"Junit 4 can be 5\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s open the Junit4ToJUnit5 test class to see this in action:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class JUnit4To5 {\n   @BeforeClass\n   public static void beforeClass() throws Exception {\n         System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.beforeClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Before\n   public void before() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.before&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldMigrateASimpleTest() {\n       Assert.assertEquals(&#34;expected&#34;, &#34;expected&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   @Ignore\n   public void shouldMigrateIgnoreTestToDisabledTest() {\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportHamcrestMatchers() {\n       assertThat(1, equalTo(1));\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportAssume() {\n       Assume.assumeTrue(javaVersion() &#62; 8);\n   }\n\n   @After\n   public void after() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.after&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @AfterClass\n   public static void afterClass() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.afterClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   private int javaVersion() {\n       return 14;\n   }\n}</pre></p>\n<p>With this inspection turned on, JUnit 4 tests that are currently running using the JUnit 5 vintage engine are flagged to show you that they can be migrated. Press <strong>⌥⏎</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, in the class name and IntelliJ IDEA offers to migrate the test class to JUnit 5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/migrate-junit4-5.png\" alt=\"Migrate JUnit 4 to 5\" /></p>\n<p>The refactoring preview window will show the places where changes will be made, in this case a number of annotations will be changed to the new JUnit 5 annotations. You can click ‘Preview Usages’ on the bottom-right corner to see the changes it will make to your class.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/annotation-refactoring-preview.png\" alt=\"Annotation Refactoring Preview\" /></p>\n<p>The second section in this case, Unclassified usage  contains methods that will be changed because the assertions will be updated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unclassified-refactoring-preview.png\" alt=\"Unclassified Refactoring Preview\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to exclude any of the tests from the refactor you can click <strong>⌫</strong>, or <strong>Delete</strong>.

Press Do Refactor and let’s see what the new code looks like in the <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/b52a483d0d6fe612ea4ef3f727792a10795061f8/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"Maven POM file\">Maven POM file</a>.</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class JUnit4To5 {\n   @BeforeAll\n   public static void beforeClass() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.beforeClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @BeforeEach\n   public void before() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.before&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldMigrateASimpleTest() {\n       Assertions.assertEquals(&#34;expected&#34;, &#34;expected&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   @Disabled\n   public void shouldMigrateIgnoreTestToDisabledTest() {\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportHamcrestMatchers() {\n       assertThat(1, equalTo(1));\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void shouldStillSupportAssume() {\n       Assumptions.assumeTrue(javaVersion() &#62; 8);\n       // then go ahead and run the rest of the test\n   }\n\n   @AfterEach\n   public void after() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.after&#34;);\n   }\n\n   @AfterAll\n   public static void afterClass() throws Exception {\n       System.out.println(&#34;JUnit4To5.afterClass&#34;);\n   }\n\n   private int javaVersion() {\n       // stub method. just used for the example\n       return 14;\n   }\n\n}</pre></p>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/local-history.html#view-local-history\" title=\"Local History\">Local History</a> (<em>VCS</em> | <em>Local History</em> | <em>Show History</em>) to see the changes side-by-side. The section on the left shows you the old JUnit 4 file. The changes from the refactor are shown on the right. The main change is that instead of importing org.junit, which is the JUnit 4 package, the class will import org.junit.jupiter, which is the JUnit 5 package structure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-imports.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Input\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see that the before and after annotation names have been changed to the new, more descriptive, ones: BeforeClass becomes BeforeAll, Before becomes BeforeEach.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-before-class-1.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Before\" /></p>\n<p>The test annotation doesn&#8217;t change, because the name is still the same. Changing the import means this will now use the new Test annotation. Assert statements now use methods on the Assertions class, instead of the old Assert.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-test.png\" alt=\"Junit Local History Test\" /></p>\n<p>The JUnit 4 Ignore annotation has been replaced with the JUnit5 Disabled annotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-test-ignore.png\" alt=\"JUnit Local History Test Ignore\" /></p>\n<p>Any tests that used Hamcrest matchers should still work as before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-hamcrest.png\" alt=\"JUnit Local History Hamcrest\" /></p>\n<p>JUnit4 <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Assertions\" title=\"introduced the idea of assumptions\">introduced the idea of assumptions</a>, if these assumptions are met the test is run. JUnit5 <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assumptions.html\" title=\"provides an Assumptions class\">provides an Assumptions class</a> instead of Assume.</p>\n<p>Like the Before Annotations, After is replaced with AfterEach, and AfterClass is replaced with AfterAll.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-local-history-after.png\" alt=\"JUnit Local History After\" /></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA makes all of these changes automatically. Like any IntelliJ IDEA refactoring, you can see the class still compiles after you’ve done the refactoring by using <strong>⌘F9</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>F9</strong>. Let&#8217;s use <strong>⌃⇧R</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F10</strong> to run the tests to make sure everything behaves the way we expect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-run-test-results.png\" alt=\"JUnit Run Test Results\" /></p>\n<p>The beforeClass method is run once, each before and after method is run once per test, and the afterClass method is run once at the end, so the overall setup works as it did under JUnit 4. The  disabled test is still not run, and there are three passing tests, the same as before.</p>\n<h2>Automatically Migrate All Tests</h2>\n<p>Now we understand the individual steps to migrate a test, we can be a bit more ambitious with our migration. Let&#8217;s try to automatically migrate all our tests. Use Find Action with <strong>⌘⇧A</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>A</strong>, and type Migrate, to see migration options for the code. IntelliJ IDEA offers the option to migrate the code from JUnit4 to JUnit5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-migrate-4-5-automatically.png\" alt=\"Junit Migrate 4 to 5\" /></p>\n<p>This migration is similar to what we did with the individual test class, but for all test classes. Press Run to see the refactoring preview. You can exclude specific classes or methods here using if you want to using <strong>⇧⌫</strong>, or <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Delete</strong>. Press Do Refactor to do the refactoring.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-refactored-unit-tests.png\" alt=\"Junit Refactored Unit Tests\" /></p>\n<p>We want to check all our tests still work as before, so run them using <strong>⌃⇧R</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F10</strong> as before. You can also right-click on the ‘tests’ folder and select Run ‘All Tests’. The Test Results window shows us the outcome of running the tests.</p>\n<p>Press the grey tick/check mark at the top-right to hide all the tests that passed and then press the icon next to that to hide all the tests that are disabled since these don’t need our attention or we don’t expect these to run respectively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-hide-passed-ignored.png\" alt=\"JUnit Hide Passed and Ignored Tests\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/80636d6a4d81a1c56e30457f9e4df5e6cb25397d\" title=\"After the migration\">After the migration</a>, you can see that the test classes have been changed. We can go through each of the files to check the changes before we commit them. <strong>⇧⌘]</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong> +  <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, to move to the next file to compare so you can quickly check all the files. As these are mostly simple JUnit tests, most of the changes are a change to the imports to use the new JUnit Jupiter test annotation instead of the old JUnit test annotation.</p>\n<h2>Manual Migration for More Complex Cases</h2>\n<p>If the tests in the project are fairly straightforward ones, this automatic migration should take care of most of the tasks that need to happen. However, not all cases can be managed automatically. Migration from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 could be a slow and steady process.</p>\n<p>At this point in our project, we have some tests fully migrated to JUnit 5, some partially migrated but using some JUnit 4 features, and potentially there may be some classic JUnit 4 (or even JUnit 3) tests running as they are. We&#8217;re running them all using JUnit 5, so we can write new tests using the new JUnit 5 features but keep existing stable tests as they are.</p>\n<p>However we might want to remove the dependency on the vintage engine to prevent ourselves from accidentally writing tests in the old style. If we <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/blob/901b5f824e5ee2bbeb3f4b6eb213a237a70b4399/standard-java/pom.xml\" title=\"remove this dependency\">remove this dependency</a>, refresh the Maven changes and rebuild the project, we will be able to see which classes require the vintage engine, and therefore which tests need more help migrating to JUnit 5.</p>\n<p>One example of a change that we might do manually is to use the correct import for Hamcrest&#8217;s assertThat in the ExceptionStackTraceTest class, for example. We could do this by removing the reference to the JUnit Assert class, and getting IntelliJ IDEA to static import the Hamcrest MatcherAssert.assertThat. We can use optimise imports to remove the unnecessary JUnit 4 Assert import.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-manual-migration.png\" alt=\"AssertThat Refactor Example\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/junit-manual-migration.gif\" /></p>\n<p>You may discover that some tests are even JUnit 3 style tests, such as our NavigateToTestTest class. These tests extend a TestCase instead of using annotations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-30-11.17.05.png\" alt=\"Junit 3 Test Error\" /></p>\n<p>To address this, put the vintage dependency back in to the Maven POM file so that the project compiles again, and reload the maven changes. You can use <strong>⌥⏎</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, on the class that is using a JUnit 3 test case. IntelliJ IDEA will suggest migrating to JUnit as a good first step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/junit3-4-migration-intellij.png\" alt=\"Junit 3 Migration in IntelliJ\" /></p>\n<p>The test now uses annotations, and doesn&#8217;t import anything from the old junit.framework package. Now you can take the next step and migrate this test to JUnit5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/junit4-5-migration-intelllij.png\" alt=\"Junit 4 to Migration IntelliJ\" /></p>\n<p>We might also want to do optimise imports to remove any old imports that aren&#8217;t needed. To do that, we can use a Find in Path search with <strong>⌃⇧F</strong>, or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>F</strong>, and type org.junit. This will show up everything, including our new Jupiter classes. We could use an expression to capture that the next character after the dot needs to be an upper case letter so we need to type &#8216;org.junit.[A-Z]&#8217; and select Search with Regex and then match the case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/junit-regex-search.png\" alt=\"Junit Regex Search\" /></p>\n<p>Now we can see all the remaining files that import a class from org.junit. There are lots of ways we could fix this, one option is to simply remove the old import, use the new JUnit 5 Assertions class, and add a static import for the assertEquals method so it can be used by all tests in the class.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/manual-assert-equals.png\" alt=\"Manual JUnit Refactor\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/manual-assert-equals.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If your project has a number of these tests you can run this inspection alone on the whole codebase to automatically migrate all of those tests in one step.</p>\n<h2>Other Approaches to Consider</h2>\n<p>This specific problem, for example, can be fixed with an inspection. If we turn on &#8216;Obsolete assertions in JUnit 5 tests&#8217; we can get IntelliJ IDEA to suggest using the new JUnit 5 assertions. Now, when we go back to the editor, there is a warning on the old assert statement, and we can get IntelliJ IDEA to automatically use the new JUnit 5 Assertions instead. IntelliJ IDEA does have inspections and automatic fixes to help migrate code from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, but if there isn&#8217;t a specific fix, we might take another approach such as a find and replace, or a <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/structural-search-and-replace.html\">Structural Search</a>, which might be more appropriate if there are a lot of files to change but the changes are all the same. We could use <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ffBeoE6NBSs\">live templates</a> for common code, and we could configure our auto import settings to make sure the new JUnit imports are suggested over the old ones. The right solution will depend upon what sort of changes need to be made and how many files are affected.</p>\n<h2>Final Steps</h2>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-samples/tree/901b5f824e5ee2bbeb3f4b6eb213a237a70b4399\" title=\"removed all references to JUnit 4 classes and functionality\">removed all references to JUnit 4 classes and functionality</a>, we can remove the vintage engine and use just the modern JUnit 5 test engine. You can load the Maven changes and rebuild the project. You should check the tests still work and pass, which you can do by pressing <strong>CTRL</strong> twice to bring up the run anything window. If we type &#8216;All&#8217; we can see the all tests run configuration and run all our project&#8217;s tests.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>We have successfully migrated all the tests in this project to JUnit 5. The first step was to migrate the project to run our JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit 5 platform. For many projects it may be enough to do this, and there may be no need to go all the way to removing the vintage engine. The most important thing is to be able to write and run tests in the new JUnit 5 style. We&#8217;ll cover the advantages of using JUnit 5 in another video.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/11/intellij-idea-2017-3-junit-support/\"

helpful when it comes to improving your code. Not only does it help you to identify inconsistencies, but it also makes navigating to the responsible lines much easier.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to set a target execution line during debugging. You can use breakpoints, or step to the line using the <em>Step Over</em> (<em>F8</em>), <em>Step Into</em> (<em>F7</em>), and <em>Run to Cursor</em> (<em>⌥F9</em>) commands. But what if you want to jump to a particular line and set an execution point there, without executing the preceding code? </p>\n<p>Surprisingly, at the moment you can only do this with the help of workarounds, and this is where the <em>Jump to Line </em>plugin comes in handy. When the program is suspended, this plugin allows you to drag and drop an arrow in the Gutter area, putting an execution point at the desired line. This saves you time because instead of performing several actions – like setting a breakpoint and waiting for the program to pause, or applying a two-handed shortcut combination – you can just hover your mouse to the exact place you want to be. </p>\n<p><em>Jump to Line </em>enables you to move either forward or backward within a function. When you drag the arrow, the IDE highlights in green the code lines at which you can set execution points. </p>\n<p>With the plugin, you can interrupt the control flow. For example, you can change the if-else branch. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</p>\n<p>What’s more, you can force the loop to break, or restart it from any iteration. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger3.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</p>\n<p>If you need to move back but do not want to use <em>Drop Frame</em> to rewind the execution of your code, <em>Jump to Line</em> works for you. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger4.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>\n<p>Remember the following when you move back and forth through your code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making changes to some lines may break the workflow. That’s why the IDE will highlight them in yellow. You can still move to them, but you need to be aware of possible consequences.</li>\n<li>If you press and hold the <em>Ctrl / ⌘ </em>button while dragging the arrow, the IDE will highlight all the lines in green. When you drop the arrow, you won’t jump to the line of code. Instead, the IDE will act as if you have used the <em>Run to Cursor (</em><em>⌥F9)</em> action. </li>\n<li>If you jump over the line at which a variable is initialized, this variable will take the default value (like zero for numbers and null for references) upon running.</li>\n<li>The main method and the Kotlin suspend functions are restricted for jumps.</li>\n<li>It is impossible to move to the execution point into another function.</li>\n<li>The plugin works for Java and Kotlin only. Android and other JVM-translated languages (like Dalvik) are not supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line </strong></p>\n<p>To sum it all up, <em>Jump to Line </em>can improve your productivity when you need to get to a specific line of code quickly, as it allows you to skip unnecessary actions like rerunning the program, setting additional breakpoints, or stepping.</p>\n<p>As you always come up with helpful ideas on how to improve our products, we encourage you to <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14877-jump-to-line\">test</a> this plugin and send us your <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/idea?_ga=2.78620944.58245678.1597034439-1683505809.1594742857&#38;_gac=1.149512578.1594731129.EAIaIQobChMIlLPVsOTM6gIVDywYCh1mpQKFEAAYASAAEgJ4P_D_BwE\">feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>Boost your debugging routine with us!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 12:05:49 +0000","feedId":6145,"bgimg":"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger1.gif","linkMd5":"d9f07088bbe5f99e2e4d3aac16313b2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-57-629_195bf68b692c6486.webp","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":254573,"destBytes":86310,"author":"Irina Maryasova","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-57-629_195bf68b692c6486.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger3.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-52-38-699_4b45491074ba3462.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/debugger4.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-52-39-906_e784b786493cdbff.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309512447},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","title":"Java Annotated Monthly – August 2020","link":"http://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&p=64235","description":"<p>It&#8217;s August, so here in Europe we&#8217;re trying to relax a little for the summer.

It’s also packed with useful information:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Is there any interaction with the JDBC database?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Vaadin is not bound to any specific database or backend. Vaadin&#8217;s data-binding API works with Java objects and collections, so you can use JPA or plain JDBC calls to populate Java objects and then pass them to Vaadin components.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Is Vaadin SPA ready? Does it generate pages on the server or on the client side?</em></strong></p>\n<p>All Vaadin apps are SPA. Pages are generated on the client side based on the state on the server. Only changed parts of the UI are re-rendered.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can I use Vaadin in Kotlin?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/kotlin\">can</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What Spring Boot topics should I study to create web applications with Vaadin?</em></strong></p>\n<p>You can get by with the basics of Spring Boot and learn as needed. We have an in-depth <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin\">tutorial series</a> that covers Vaadin and Spring Boot.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Does Vaadin generate secure REST APIs? </em></strong></p>\n<p>Vaadin does not generate a REST API when you use the Java component API. Instead, it communicates through a custom JSON-based protocol that defaults to XHR requests, but can also be sent over WebSockets. The communication is very secure by design, as the server keeps track of the UI state and prevents any illegal actions, such as trying to trigger clicks on buttons that are disabled.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What is better for building a web application – Vaadin or Kotlin/JS? </em></strong></p>\n<p>It depends on your application. Vaadin is a simpler approach, as you don&#8217;t have a separate backend and frontend codebase and you have the same type of info from the database to the UI layer.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can there be performance issues while converting Java code to HTML/JS?</em></strong></p>\n<p>HTML creation happens in the browser and only for the parts of the UI that need to be updated. There isn&#8217;t much overhead.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can Vaadin handle the responsiveness of all components, including Grid? </em></strong></p>\n<p>Vaadin components are responsive by design. For the Grid, though, you would need to listen for resizes and determine how you want to respond to those, as there is no universal way of determining which columns to hide. By default, the Grid makes the content scrollable sideways, if needed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What would be the best strategy for exception handling in a web application? When should I propagate or recover the exception?</em></strong></p>\n<p>It depends. You need to evaluate case by case. In some cases, you may be able to recover, and in others, it&#8217;s better to show an error and let the user decide how to proceed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s the default embedded server? </em></strong></p>\n<p>Tomcat. Vaadin will work on any servlet container.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Is there hot reload support?</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vaadin.com/releases/\">Vaadin 14.3</a>, which is due out this week, will have improved hot reload support without any browser plugins.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Is Vaadin free to use for a personal project?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Yes. It is Apache 2 licensed. There are some added-value components, tools, and learning materials that are <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/pricing\">commercial</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Will the example code be available somewhere?</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/marcushellberg/vaadin-14-spring-boot-todo\">Yes</a>, feel free to check out our tips and tricks.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more webinars and useful advice for productive development.

Let’s have a more in-depth look at the updates in this release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docker\"><strong>Docker</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Use Selenoid for cross-browser testing of web applications</strong></p>\n<p>Selenoid (available only in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate) is an implementation of the Selenium hub for Docker, which allows you to execute automated tests on web browsers running in Docker containers. For each test, Selenoid creates a container with the specified web browser, environment, and settings.</p>\n<p>With IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 and the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/03/intellij-idea-2020-1-selenium-support/\">Selenium</a> plugin, you don’t need to manually run Selenoid from the command line. You can now select the <em>browsers.json</em> file and click the <em>Launch</em> action in the editor. The IDE will automatically pull all the required containers with the browsers, and run the main Selenoid container to manage them. There are additional options available in the Selenoid run configuration settings, such as output destination folders for logs and videos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/selenoid.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Connect to Docker on Windows with TLS</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, to connect to Docker, you had to expose a non-TLS connection in the Docker preferences. In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, you can connect to Docker securely with TLS without performing any additional actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Docker.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes_intellij_idea_ultimate\"><strong>Kubernetes (IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate) </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Add </strong><strong>custom</strong><strong> configuration </strong><strong>files</strong><strong> for a cluster connection</strong></p>\n<p>We continue to add ways to customize the Kubernetes tools to your needs. This time, we’ve made it possible to add your own <code>kubeconfig</code> files to configure access to a cluster.  </p>\n<p>To do this, click the <em>Show Settings</em> button in the <em>Services</em> tool window when selecting a <em>kubernetes </em>root item. Alternatively, go to <em>Preferences / Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Kubernetes</em>. Before you apply the settings, you can choose whether to set this path only for the current project or to let the IDE use it globally. </p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA starts using the newly configured file automatically. However, if you have made configuration changes, you need to click the new <em>Refresh Configuration</em> button in the <em>Services</em> tool window to apply them. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/multiple_contexts.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Switch contexts </strong><strong>for more efficient work with multiple clusters</strong></p>\n<p>A context is a group of access parameters such as cluster, user, and namespace. When you deal with multiple clusters, you’ll want quick access to contexts. Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, you can switch contexts quickly with the <em>Context </em>button in the <em>Services</em> tool window. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/switchcontexts.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>View</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Custom</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Resource</strong><strong> Definitions (CRDs)</strong><strong> in a cluster</strong></p>\n<p>In IntelliJ IDEA 2020, you can view a list of all the existing custom schemas and resources created on a cluster. Here’s the new feature in action. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CRD.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the previous release, we introduced the ability to apply CRDs and other resource files using the <em>Apply </em>icon in the gutter. The applied CRD is then shown inside the <em>Custom Resources</em> item in the <em>Services</em> tool window tree. </p>\n<p>To work with сustom resources in the IDE editor, you need to add a path to your CRD via <em>Preferences / Settings | Languages &#38; frameworks | Kubernetes</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Get full support for </strong><strong>ConfigMaps and Secrets</strong></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA fully supports the Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets API objects. Complete with editor completion, resolve, rename, and find usages. Now the information for these options is not only taken from your project but also the configured cluster. </p>\n<p>If you call completion for ConfigMap names and keys, the IDE will offer suggestions. The items from the cluster are marked in blue, all others are only present in the current project. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-07-at-12.55.35.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It is now possible to call <em>Find Usages</em> from the cluster for ConfigMaps/Secrets and their keys. Select the corresponding item in the <em>Services</em> tool window and call <em>Find Usages</em> in the context menu. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/find_usages.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can navigate from the ConfigMap/Secret usages to their declarations in the project and cluster. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/navigate2.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Another useful time-saving update is the possibility to rename ConfigMaps/Secrets and their keys.

These shortcuts <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html\">can also be configured</a> if required.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Editor Tips and Tricks in IntelliJ IDEA (2020)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEpeHNsWIMk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This blog post covers the same material as the video. This provides an easy way for people to skim the content quickly if they prefer reading to watching, and to give the reader/watcher code samples and links to additional information.</em></p>\n<p>IntelliJ IDEA has lots of <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html\">keyboard shortcuts</a> and features that help you write code. In this tutorial we&#8217;re going to see some shortcuts that you can use to make it easier to write and edit code.</p>\n<h2>Focusing Our Workspace</h2>\n<p>The most useful shortcut to help you focus on your code is <strong>⇧⌘F12</strong> on macOS, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>F12 </strong>on Windows and Linux. This hides all the other windows so the editor takes the full space available. It&#8217;s worth using this shortcut when you start working on something to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ide-viewing-modes.html\">minimise distractions and maximise space</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png\" alt=\"IntelliJ Full Screen\" /></p>\n<h2>Editor Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">editor shortcuts</a> that you can use to speed up your workflows, for example, <strong>⌘⌫</strong>, (or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Y</strong>), to delete the current line.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">cut a line</a>, press <strong>⌘X</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>X,</strong> without selecting or highlighting anything. This saves a few keystrokes. We can paste this line using <strong>⌘V</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>V</strong>, like in any application.</p>\n<p>Like cut, we can copy a whole line with <strong>⌘C</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>C</strong>, without having to highlight it first, and paste this too. Sometimes it might be more useful to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">duplicate the line</a> instead with <strong>⌘D</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>D</strong>.</p>\n<p>Try it out with the code below:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class MultiLineStrings {\n    public void multiLineStrings() {\n        // Pressing Command+X or CTRL+X will cut the line\n        // Pressing Command+V or CTRL+V will paste the line\n        // Pressing Command+C or CTRL+C will copy the line\n        // Pressing Command+D or CTRL+D will duplicate the line\n        String someText = &#34;This code can be on a single line &#34; +\n                &#34;or it can be on multiple lines &#34; +\n                &#34;and you can type and hit Enter and get the + sign &#34; +\n                &#34;inserted automatically&#34;;\n    }\n}</pre></p>\n<h2>Moving Code</h2>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#17953c\">move a statement up</a> use <strong>⇧⌘↑</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>. Moving a statement moves the Java statement as a whole. Applying this to the line with the variable declaration will move the whole statement, in this case the whole multi-line string declaration. The move is context sensitive, so in this case the IDE won&#8217;t let us move it out of the method. Use <strong>⇧⌘↓</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Down</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>, to move it down</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveStatementUpDown-1.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to move statements up and down\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MoveStatementUpDown.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#179512\">move just a line</a>, or move something without factoring in code context, you can move a line up with <strong>⌥⇧↑</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>. This means you can move the line anywhere. If we select more than one line and use the shortcut, it will move all highlighted lines.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveLineUpDown.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to move lines up and down\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MoveLineUpDown.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Manipulating Strings</h2>\n<p>One of the simplest but most useful editor features is <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">creating a line break</a> in the middle of a declared String using <strong>Enter</strong>. IntelliJ IDEA will automatically close off the String on the line above, add the ‘+’ symbol for concatenation, and reopen the String on the line below. Try it out with the code below, press <strong>Enter</strong> somewhere inside the String value:</p>\n<p><pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"\">public class MultiLineStrings {\n    public void multiLineStrings() {\n\n        // Ctrl+Shift+J will join lines\n        // Pressing Enter in String will auto-insert +\n        String someText = &#34;This code can be on a single line &#34; +\n                &#34;or it can be on multiple lines &#34; +\n                &#34;and you can type and hit Enter and get the + sign &#34; +\n                &#34;inserted automatically&#34;;\n    }\n}</pre></p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks\">join the lines together</a>, use <strong>⌃⇧J</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>J</strong>. This is extremely helpful for formatting multiline strings, and for laying out block comments.</p>\n<p>As well as pressing <strong>⏎</strong>, or <strong>Enter</strong>, to split the line and put the caret on the new line, you can also use <strong>⌘⏎</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, to split the line but keep the caret on the current line.</p>\n<h2>Selecting Code</h2>\n<p>You can use <strong>⌥↑</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>W,</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#editor_code_selection\">extend your selection</a> to include ever-increasing, valid blocks of code. Use <strong>⌥↓</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>W</strong>, to decrease the selection back to where you started.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExtendShrinkSelection.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to expand and shrink chunks of code\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/ExtendShrinkSelection.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Working with Linear Formats</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#17962e\">Column Selection Mode</a> is a useful tool for manipulating code or text and working with linear formats. You can search for it in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find Action <strong>⌘⇧A, </strong>or <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong>+<strong>A</strong></li>\n<li>Search Everywhere <strong>⇧⇧, or SHIFT</strong>+<strong>SHIFT</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then type in <strong>Column Select</strong>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, use the shortcut <strong>⇧⌘8</strong>, or <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Ins</strong>. Once you’re in column selection mode, you can hold down shift and press up or down to create carets in a column above or below where you are. The same shortcut toggles off Column Selection Mode.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColumnSelectionMode.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to expand and shrink chunks of code\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/ColumnSelectionMode.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Manipulating Caret Placement</h2>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#multiple_cursor\">place multiple carets</a> in specific places, hold down <strong>⌥⇧</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>, and use the mouse to click where you want the next caret to be. As you type, each caret will output the same thing. This might be useful when making multiple changes to XML files, for example. To get back to your original caret, press <strong>Escape</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MultipleCarets.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to use and place multiple carets\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/MultipleCarets.gif\" /></p>\n<p>To clone the caret above or below the line you are on, press <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>, and then <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>, a second time, but this time keep holding down <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong>.  Press down to create another caret directly below the line. Again, this is useful for column based formatting or edits. Press <strong>Escape</strong> to go back to one caret. Similarly, press <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong> twice, holding down the <strong>⌥</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong> on the second time and press the <strong>↑</strong>, or <strong>Up</strong> <strong>Arrow</strong>, to clone the caret to the line above.</p>\n<h2>Finding a Word in the File</h2>\n<p>As well as using <strong>⌘F</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong> <strong>F</strong>, to find something, you can use <strong>⌘G</strong>, or <strong>F3</strong>, to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-source-code.html#select-occurrences\">find the next occurrence of the word</a> currently at the caret, and move to it. Alternatively, use <strong>⌃⌘G</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>J</strong> to select all instances of the current word.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FindNextWord.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to select all instances of the same word\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/FindNextWord.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>Select and Surround</h2>\n<p>To add quotes around a word or words, highlight the text and type the quote. This also works for all types of brackets. The quotes or brackets will be placed directly outside the highlighted text.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-55173 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.png\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing how to wrap words with quotes and brackets\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\" data-gif-src=\"https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>IntelliJ IDEA Clipboard</h2>\n<p>Finally, IntelliJ IDEA keeps a record of everything that was copied inside the IDE. To <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/pro-tips.html#paste-from-history\">paste an item</a> that was copied in IntelliJ IDEA in the past, use <strong>⇧⌘V</strong>, or <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>V</strong>. All the items copied or cut in the past are shown and we can use the keyboard to navigate them. We can even copy sections of the copied code for later use. You might notice from this example that the editor and other sections of IntelliJ IDEA support emojis on macOS.<br />\n<img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clipboard_IntelliJ.png\" alt=\"Clipboard in IntelliJ\" /><br />\nYou don&#8217;t have to use the arrow keys to move all the way down to the item you want in the History window. Just type the number next to the history item to paste, for example number 1.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a small selection of <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html\">shortcuts</a> to help you write code, or text, in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/04/tips-for-writing-code-in-intellij-idea/\" title=\"Tips for writing code in IntelliJ IDEA\">Tips for writing code in IntelliJ IDEA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/03/top-15-intellij-idea-shortcuts/\" title=\"Top 15 IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts\">Top 15 IntelliJ IDEA Shortcuts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:00:42 +0000","feedId":6145,"bgimg":"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png","linkMd5":"a99f48e642db47499188025330838581","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-53-074_0eaaba461d93f96b.webp","destWidth":2784,"destHeight":1618,"sourceBytes":589251,"destBytes":173172,"author":"Helen Scott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IntelliJ-Full-Screen.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-53-074_0eaaba461d93f96b.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveStatementUpDown-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-52-19-449_34fb9680e2925a27.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MoveLineUpDown.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-52-19-841_a1bd4988b40dc477.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ExtendShrinkSelection.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn97@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-52-19-434_ed566171df4b4133.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ColumnSelectionMode.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-52-19-444_cb841e5569c6ee43.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MultipleCarets.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-52-19-479_058ee47c25447628.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FindNextWord.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-52-19-299_79442566f97d59d4.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WordWrappingQuotesBrackets.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-52-19-274_7bed84098746591c.webp","https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clipboard_IntelliJ.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-52-19-485_44ba2355346d8e6a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309512446},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","title":"IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 is released!","link":"http://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&p=61631","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\">IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2</a> is packed with an amazing set of features, including more advanced support for GitHub pull requests, a new Inspections Widget that displays the number of warnings and errors in an opened file and allows you to quickly navigate between them, the Problems tool window that offers details of the issues in your current file and allows you to fix them fast, and the Related Problems inlay hint that notifies you when your changes break other files.

Most of these tools run in the system shell under the hood. Sometimes you don’t even realize that instead of running a command in the integrated terminal and reading console output, you can use the relevant IDE feature, like a tool window or a dialog that implements this functionality.</p>\n<p>For example, the diff viewer actually runs the <code>diff</code> command in the system shell to produce results. Another example is the <strong>Log</strong> tab in the <strong>Git</strong> tool window, which is based on the output of the <code>git log</code> command.<span id=\"more-55693\"></span></p>\n<p>If you didn’t know such features existed in IntelliJ IDEA or you are just used to running them in the terminal, now the IDE will let you know you can view the results in the GUI. This increases the discoverability of features and provides a handy way to open your favorite IntelliJ IDEA tools from the terminal.</p>\n<p>Here is how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type a supported command in the terminal and notice how it gets highlighted.<br />\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yo_Vfs007eMGAJ8Q-pO4o-jSFjAKHml49AH0TPeZ3d8tYmoRVjYe187M-SbT_ewbH8vAi-722-I5oY8p_nQIzHR9TIhtoyFFM2KR3oPXiQ7f2aoNaexitS9Xqy3-OBHvxq3jeyql\" /></li>\n<li>Instead of pressing Enter, which runs the command in the terminal, press Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Enter to open the corresponding GUI tool. In the example above, it will open the <strong>Log</strong> tab of the <strong>Git</strong> tool window and filter commits by authors with “dmitry” in their usernames.<br />\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r30ClRJVJVY0aWS6KqrHgFiT1d8mSFi75noOyTV7k0OIj_IizNjlXjmqfp6WpgVYYhteR2zT2-OWNvoP-BEg5lmt_lZU7s7N6fF9MZY-xd461iWCDsk3hHqaMj3bGL0e9zdIOjKq\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a similar manner, you can type the <code>diff</code> command with the names of files you want to compare, and when it is highlighted, press Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Enter to open the diff viewer instead of printing the diff output to the terminal.</p>\n<p>This feature also works with most of the commands recognized by <strong>Run Anything</strong> (press Ctrl twice), such as <code>mvn</code>, <code>gradle</code>, <code>rake</code>, <code>rails</code>, and so on, depending on what plugins you have installed. Try out the commands that you use frequently and see if this feature helps you be more productive.</p>\n<p>Try Ctrl + Shift + Enter or Cmd + Shift + Enter to run the highlighted commands in debug mode (use the <strong>Debug</strong> tool window instead of <strong>Run</strong>).</p>\n<p>You can use the API provided to implement support for more commands and tools. For implementation examples, see the <code>GitLogTerminalCustomCommandHandler</code> and <code>TerminalShellCommandHandler</code> classes in the source code of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.</p>\n<p>If you want to disable this feature, click the gear icon in the <strong>Terminal</strong> tool window and clear the <strong>Run commands using IDE</strong> option.</p>\n<p>If you want to change the default shortcuts, open the <strong>Settings</strong> / <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog, go to <strong>Keymap</strong>, then expand <strong>Plug-ins | Terminal</strong> and modify the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Run highlighted command using IDE</strong> (default shortcut: Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Enter)</li>\n<li><strong>Debug highlighted command using IDE</strong> (default shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + Enter or Cmd + Shift + Enter)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try this feature in the latest <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/\">IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 EAP</a>.</p>\n<p>Happy developing!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 08:35:40 +0000","feedId":6145,"bgimg":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yo_Vfs007eMGAJ8Q-pO4o-jSFjAKHml49AH0TPeZ3d8tYmoRVjYe187M-SbT_ewbH8vAi-722-I5oY8p_nQIzHR9TIhtoyFFM2KR3oPXiQ7f2aoNaexitS9Xqy3-OBHvxq3jeyql","linkMd5":"93685a71d88b3f71c225aa115b4276f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-52-710_7a818a0608a0d3bf.webp","destWidth":1488,"destHeight":372,"sourceBytes":20041,"destBytes":13818,"author":"Alexey Zhebel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yo_Vfs007eMGAJ8Q-pO4o-jSFjAKHml49AH0TPeZ3d8tYmoRVjYe187M-SbT_ewbH8vAi-722-I5oY8p_nQIzHR9TIhtoyFFM2KR3oPXiQ7f2aoNaexitS9Xqy3-OBHvxq3jeyql":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-52-710_7a818a0608a0d3bf.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r30ClRJVJVY0aWS6KqrHgFiT1d8mSFi75noOyTV7k0OIj_IizNjlXjmqfp6WpgVYYhteR2zT2-OWNvoP-BEg5lmt_lZU7s7N6fF9MZY-xd461iWCDsk3hHqaMj3bGL0e9zdIOjKq":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-52-19-529_a955c84b8a171fe4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309512447},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:52","title":"IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 Goes Beta!","link":"https://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=idea&p=56167","description":"<p>IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 has now reached the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/\">Beta</a> milestone.

It is designed to simplify your work by teaching the IDE the ins and outs of your code even before you start applying any changes. The IDE indexes classes, methods, and other code elements to create a virtual map of your project<em>. </em></p>\n<p>At JetBrains, we believe that the time you spend indexing at startup will save you precious hours when you are busy coding and want nothing to disturb your creative flow. It’s better to have your project fully indexed before you need contextual help with code completion, or have to navigate somewhere deep in the code.</p>\n<p>When you step into the realm of large projects, the only concern that you may have about indexing is speed. You may sometimes wonder, “If someone else has already indexed the project, why do I need to index it too?” And we’d say that’s a valid question.</p>\n<p>We’ve addressed this concern with the <strong><em>Shared Indexes Plugin, </em></strong>which allows you to download indexes prepared on another machine instead of building them locally. You can generate shared indexes on one computer and download them to another, just bear in mind that they should all be running the same OS. If your network connection is sufficiently fast, this plugin can reduce the overall indexing time for a Java project by up to 75%.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>We build shared indexes in a way that lets them work on multiple computers. Ordinary indexes depend on file IDs inside file systems that are unique to each local computer. They are additionally affected by the IDE configurations. Shared indexes, by contrast, use hashes of file contents (with mixins included). This allows them to be used outside the environment they were created in.</p>\n<p>You can easily try this plugin out by downloading pre-built shared indexes for JDKs that are available from right inside IntelliJ IDEA. If we detect that the CDN contains a shared index for the selected JDK, the IDE will ask you if you want to download it. You can choose to download the index just once or configure the system to download shared indexes automatically.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shared-index-darcula-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-57462\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shared-index-darcula-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can access the settings from the pop-up window you can see in the screenshot above or via <i>Preferences/Settings/Tools/Shared Indexes</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shared-index-darcula-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-57472\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shared-index-darcula-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you need custom shared indexes for your private project, you will have to generate and distribute them to the target IDE build. For more information on how to do this, please refer to our <a href=\"http://jb.gg/shared-indexes\">guide</a>.</p>\n<p>We ran some tests with large companies working on large projects, and we have already seen that the time lost to indexing has decreased considerably.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a role in making IntelliJ IDEA better, give our Shared Indexes plugin a try, and be sure to send us <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/idea\">your feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>Starting from v.2020.2, the Shared Indexes plugin  will be available for <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14437-shared-indexes\">download</a> for IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, and WebStorm.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 08:04:45
