For most shoppers, the most convincing benefit is the lower cost. Depending on the item and the manufacturer, a refurbished item can cost you up to 50% less than a brand new one. Another perk is that it&#39;s a bit more environmentally friendly: you&#39;re essentially buying a recycled item.  In the end, both refurbished and new items will ideally deliver the same user experience, likely with some differences in packaging and cosmetics, so long as you do your research before adding to cart.</p><p>When determining a refurb&#39;s worthiness, it comes down to two major factors to make the judgment call: who refurbished the item and who is selling it?</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe best refurb deals available right now\n\t\n\t<p>When shopping refurb deals, we keep an eye out for items that are discounted compared to typical refurb pricing, which is generally much less than brand new.

Year-round, manufacturers like Dyson, Nintendo, and Apple offer refurbished goods for considerably less money than in new condition. I, personally, bought a refurbished Dyson V6 cordless stick vacuum 3 years ago during Black Friday, and not only did the item arrive looking new, but it also still performs well despite daily use.&#160;</p><p>Manufacturer refurbs can also come with pretty hefty warranties. <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&#38;mid=36310&#38;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fdyson-outlet%23shop-all-refurbished\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Dyson</a>, for example, provides a 6- or 12-month warranty with every order, along with expert support and the promise of genuine Dyson parts in your item.</p><p>If you're a frequent online shopper, you've surely come across a few items marked as \"seller-refurbished.\" Our advice: outside of a few exceptions, don't risk it. While you don't necessarily need to limit yourself to only buying from manufacturer storefronts, buying an item refurbished by anyone other than the manufacturer is dubious.

The warranties never last as long, it doesn't guarantee the use of genuine parts, and the product support you receive will never be as good &#8212; if you get any at all.&#160;</p><p>Much older generation tech is also not worth buying refurbished. It's 2020: buying a refurbished iPhone 7 is a moot investment in an item nearing obsoletion.</p><p>Finally, don't bother with anything that can't have its battery replaced, like truly wireless earbuds and headphones. It's a mixed bag getting these in any condition other than new; you'll never know the battery's remaining lifespan. With tech like tablets, smartphones, and computers, you can always bring them into a store for a battery replacement.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/refurbished-electronics-deals'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nWsVuUi0R9Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:24:45 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fb56624a3dc610012005990?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7090a6f84be6cee5e44cff8961304983","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-11-056_d59dc9fbc7b92c77.webp","destWidth":3569,"destHeight":2676,"sourceBytes":913402,"destBytes":913402,"author":"insider@insider.com (Sarah Saril)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fb566357b94e80011de9c42?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn79@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-11-878_07eb14cbd65d0ce1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-16-326_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn98@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-16-142_753fd9bc38c799c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-14-600_dfb2a7780006b895.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-888_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nWsVuUi0R9Q:txOTqqSRI3M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-16-269_397e83cbbc3b15b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nWsVuUi0R9Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-14-396_cdfe5ec2254e1cda.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245786375},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","title":"Microsoft will buy AI firm Nuance for $19.7 billion to bolster healthcare tech","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-will-buy-ai-speech-firm-nuance-for-19-billion-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607442253e3fe7001882a11a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Microsoft Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Satya Narayana Nadella speaks at a live Microsoft event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016.

If you&#39;re looking for dewy, light coverage that feels as natural as it looks, you&#39;re in the right place.</p><h3>The 10 best tinted moisturizers in 2021:</h3>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tUrban Decay Stay Naked Hydromaniac Tinted Glow Hydrator\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60649790daf0f10018f993ab?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best tinted moisturizer_UrbanDecay\" height=\"1251\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Urban Decay; Catherine Santino/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Urban Decay's <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1735900988773888548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Hydromaniac Tinted Glow Hydrator</a> offers impressive medium coverage that stays dewy and fresh.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>SPF: </strong>None</li><li><strong>Color range: </strong>12 shades, ranging from ultra-fair neutral to ultra-deep neutral.&#160;</li></ul></aside><p>If you want a bit more than sheer coverage but still prefer lightweight face makeup, Urban Decay's tinted moisturizer is the one for you. This deliciously dewy product has an almost serum-like texture, allowing for a super smooth application and all-day luminous finish. While the 24-hour wear claim is a bit extreme (and unlikely to ever be needed in the first place), it definitely holds up for several hours with no dry patches in sight.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"605ca42a065f5700185197ba\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Stay Naked Hydromaniac Tinted Glow Hydrator (small)</bi-shortcode>\n\tMilk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606497b56183e10019819829?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Best tinted moisturizer_Milk Makeup\" height=\"1251\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Milk Makeup; Catherine Santino/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1735901601461980723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Milk Makeup's Sunshine Skin Tint</a> uses a blend of natural oils for an ultra-dewy finish.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>SPF: </strong>30</li><li><strong>Color range: </strong>14 shades, from fair to deep.&#160;</li></ul></aside><p>Formulated with a blend of grapeseed, avocado, mandarin, jojoba and olive oils, Milk Makeup's <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1735901601461980723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">skin tint</a> is truly one of the dewiest tinted moisturizers out there.

marketing that&#39;s more personalized and interactive.</li>\n<li>Customers tend to advocate for brands they have great relationships with via positive experiences. </li>\n<li>This type of marketing helps businesses build loyal and recurring customers.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>As a business consultant, I often have to remind small-business owners that their marketing needs to be more interactive, versus the traditional &#34;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/michael-fertik/welcome-to-the-pull-economy.html\">push</a>&#34; model, where you broadcast your message to as many people as possible.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/shama-hyder/how-to-market-to-gen-z.html\">New generations</a> of customers respond better to the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/robert-glazer/these-3-new-marketing-trends-will-transform-your-marketing-strategy.html\">participative</a>&#34; approach, where they get to provide input via social media and the internet.</p><p>It started a few years ago with email satisfaction surveys after an online purchase, but now includes interactive internet ads, as well as custom requests for input on the design of future products and influencers on social media. It seems that everyone these days wants an experience and a relationship, and is willing to become your best advocate via word of mouth.</p><p>Some call it a move from always &#34;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-pruitt/why-your-businesss-growth-potential-isnt-in-net-new.html\">hunting</a>&#34; for new customers in the wild to &#34;gardening,&#34; or nurturing loyalty and value from the ones you already have.</p><p>In any case, the new approach is important to all businesses, and embodies some new marketing rules that you need to focus on and learn:</p><h2>1. Make your marketing exploratory and dynamic</h2><p>The days of big-bang long-term campaigns that never change are over. You should be constantly trying new approaches via social media and online, and asking for feedback and input from influencers and customers. Scale quickly on good feedback, and move on if you get little engagement.</p><p>A step in the right direction is to take advantage of the new tools available at very low cost, including sponsored podcasts, blogs, visibility in online communities, and Twitter influencer support. Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as updating your website format and videos.</p><h2>2. Use experiments versus designing the ideal ad</h2><p>Trends and customer interests change quickly, so use small experiments to find something that works today, and use innovation to push the envelope, before your competitors can copy and overrun you. The key is to be able to measure your return, adapt quickly, and learn from your efforts.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/10/marketers-underuse-ad-experiments-thats-a-big-mistake\">Harvard Business Review</a>, e-commerce companies that conducted ad experiments saw 2-3% better performance per experiment run. An advertiser that ran 15 experiments in a given year saw a 30% higher ad performance.</p><h2>3. Motivate customers to participate and engage</h2><p>Reward customers for their advocacy and engagement with discounts and coupons, keep the interaction dynamic, and encourage their return. This requires a sense of urgency on the part of your team, and a culture of accountability and focus on the customer. Marketing must be everyone&#39;s top priority.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/robert-glazer/these-3-new-marketing-trends-will-transform-your-marketing-strategy.html\">Dunkin&#39; Donuts</a> did this through a photo contest, rewarding discounts to those who submitted a photo with the brand&#39;s handle and hashtag. Other companies highlight live experience and happy videos, submitted by customers, on their website and promotions.</p><h2>4. Partner with others to create blended offerings</h2><p>A very successful marketing effort created by a restaurant near me during the pandemic offered a carryout from multiple sources - to combine flowers with food and drinks, all from different establishments, packaged creatively together. Everybody wins, and it spread quickly on social media.</p><p>People remember and endorse you as the primary brand that created the blended offering, as well as the other &#34;endorsed&#34; brands. The hybrid approach is also effective as an experiment if you are exploring ways to expand your own brand into new segments.</p><h2>5. Market solutions as an experience or an event</h2><p>Advertising more features, or even a lower price, is not as memorable to customers today as a great experience or a unique event. These may be live or immersive online experiences. Use social media to build anticipation and highlight successes, to get people talking and coming back for more. <br> <br>The message here is that big blockbuster campaigns and big marketing budgets are no longer the key to results in the new customer environment, where participation and relationships are key.</p><p>Now is the time to ask your customers and partners for participative ideas, do some experiments, and scale up the ones that work. Be prepared to make frequent updates as trends change.</p><p>Marketing is no longer a one-way conversation, whether you are a startup or a legacy business. How long has it been since you changed your marketing strategy? Are your costs going up and the returns going down?<br>Try listening and learning, more than talking and pushing.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

net debt.</p><p>Microsoft, in a joint statement, said it will buy Nuance for $56 a share, which is a 23% premium to Nuance&#39;s closing price on Friday at $45.58. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/microsoft-makes-big-bet-on-health-care-ai-technology-with-nuance?sref=GUP2BhaG\">Bloomberg reported</a> late Sunday that the two companies were in talks, citing sources who asked not to be identified. An agreement with Nuance would be Microsoft&#39;s largest since it purchased professional networking site LinkedIn in 2016.</p><p>Nuance climbed 18% to $53.93 as regular-session trading got underway. The stock during pre-market trade climbed by as much as 31%. Meanwhile, Microsoft shares edged up 0.1% to $255.97 as Wall Street&#39;s new trading week kicked off. </p><p>Nuance and Microsoft have been working together since 2019, focusing on Nuance&#39;s products that allow clinicians to capture patient discussions and integrate them into electronic health records. Microsoft said the deal will double its total addressable market in the healthcare provider space to nearly $500 billion.</p><p>&#34;AI is technology&#39;s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application,&#34; said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in the statement.</p><p>The deal is expected to close by the end of the calendar year 2021 and has been unanimously approved by the boards of both Nuance and Microsoft. Nuance&#39;s CEO Mark Benjamin will remain in his role.</p><p>&#34;For Nadella &#38; Co., this is the right acquisition at the right time with Microsoft doubling down on its healthcare initiatives over the coming years,&#34; said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday note in which he called the Nuance deal a &#34;strategic no brainer&#34; for Microsoft. Wedbush lowered its 12-month price target on Nuance to $56 from $65 to reflect the deal but maintained its outperform rating.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

That makes them a great choice whether you're looking for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for working out or drowning out distractions.</p><p>The biggest benefit that the AirPods Pro offer over the standard AirPods are active noise cancellation. During my time using them, I've found that the AirPods Pro are able to successfully dull the sound of the treadmill humming during my run, the noisiness of the New York City subway, and chatty coworkers. They don't seal out sound as efficiently as the AirPods Max given the latter model's over-ear design, but they do a great job for earbuds.</p><p>In addition to bringing active noise cancellation and swappable ear tips for a more customized fit, the AirPods Pro also sound better than their cheaper siblings.&#160;</p><p>Unlike the regular AirPods, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods Pro</a> have a custom Apple driver and high dynamic range amplifier, which results in sound that feels more boisterous and rich compared to the standard AirPods. They also support spatial audio, a surround sound effect that adjusts as you move your head. The standard AirPods don't have this feature.</p><p>While the AirPods Pro's active noise cancellation and wide selection of features make them the best choice for most people, especially since you can often <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find them at a discount</a>, that doesn't mean they're perfect.&#160;</p><p>Anyone who isn't partial to Apple should strongly consider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-headphones-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony's WF-1000XM3 </a>wireless earbuds, which offer better noise cancellation, sound, and battery life compared to the AirPods Pro.</p>\n\tThe best AirPods on a budget\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c9bc412ffcb27152b2bec1a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple Airpods\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hollis Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Apple's standard <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-airpods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods</a> nail the basics when it comes to truly wireless earbuds, such as quick connectivity, decent sound quality, and plenty of other features that pair nicely with the iPhone.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Fit and style:</strong> Earbuds, non-customizable&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 5 hours, more than 24 hours with charging case</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Water resistant:</strong> No</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Features:</strong> Hey Siri, automatic switching, quick pairing, auto play and pause</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-2-review-specs-features-photos-2019-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out our full AirPods review</a></li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Convenient pairing features, lightweight design, hands-free Siri access, quick device switching</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Wireless charging case adds a lot to the price</p><p>Apple's regular <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-airpods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods</a> package all the core features &#8212; like quick pairing with iOS devices and automatic playing and pausing &#8212; in a more affordable pair of wireless headphones. They're the right choice if convenience is your top priority in a pair of wireless earbuds, and if you'd rather sacrifice features like noise cancellation to save a few bucks.</p><p>Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2019, adding new features like the ability to use Siri hands-free and faster switching between devices. You also have the option to purchase AirPods with a wireless charging case, but that brings the price up to $199.&#160;</p><p>Unless you really hate plugging your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-airpods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods</a> in with a Lightning cable and already own a wireless charger, we'd recommend either saving money by opting for the standard $159 pair or extending your budget to get the $249 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods Pro</a>.</p><p>The AirPods that Apple launched in 2019 have the same design as the original model. That's to say they have a simple, white aesthetic with stems protruding from the bottom that essentially makes them look like Apple just snipped the wires off its wired EarPods headphones.&#160;</p><p>The standard AirPods are slightly lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods Pro</a> (4 grams versus 5.6 grams), and unlike the AirPods Pro they rest on the ear rather than inside it. That means the regular AirPods might be a better choice for those who prefer a less obtrusive fit.&#160;</p><p>All told, the standard AirPods are the best choice if convenience and affordability take priority over sound quality and noise cancellation when it comes to shopping for wireless earbuds.&#160;</p><h3>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-2-review-specs-features-photos-2019-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple AirPods review</a></h3>\n\tThe best AirPods for audiophiles\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ffb7c8ebde805001980c13a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"AirPods Max 3\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>At $549, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-max%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">AirPods Max</a> are the definition of luxury audio, offering superb sound quality, a premium and comfortable build, and top-notch noise cancellation.</h3><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Fit and style:</strong> Over-ear headphones with adjustable ear cups</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 20 hours</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Water resistant:</strong> No</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Features:</strong> Active noise cancellation, adaptive EQ, transparency mode, digital crown for media controls, Hey Siri, automatic switching, quick pairing, auto play and pause</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-airpods-max-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out our full review of the AirPods Max</a></li></ul></aside><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Top-notch audio quality noise cancellation, premium design, comfortable fit&#160;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, no charging case, included case doesn't protect entire headset, no input options or included cables for other audio connections</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-max\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">AirPods Max</a> deliver first-rate audio performance and noise cancellation, all wrapped in an elegant design that outclasses rivals from Bose and Sony.&#160;</p><p>The biggest difference you'll notice between the AirPods Max and Apple's other AirPods is its over-ear design.

The release cycle for AirPods isn't as easy to predict as the iPhone's, but here's what we know based on reliable reports.&#160;</p><ul><li><strong>AirPods:</strong> Apple's second-generation AirPods launched in March 2019, and the company is said to be preparing a new pair of its least expensive wireless earbuds for launch in 2021. The new earbuds will have a new design with a shorter stem, longer battery life, and replaceable ear tips, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-revamped-entry-level-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a>. That report says Apple had discussed launching the new AirPods in the first half of 2021. But TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has reported</a> that they won't go into mass production until the third quarter of 2021.</li><li><strong>AirPods Pro</strong>: Apple launched the AirPods Pro in October 2019. The company is working on a new redesigned version with a shorter stem that more closely resembles other wireless earbuds from brands like Samsung, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-revamped-entry-level-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a>. But it's unclear when this new model would launch.</li><li><strong>AirPods Max</strong>: Apple just released the AirPods Max in December, and we have not heard any details about when a successor could

We are big fans of what Coinbase has done to date, but we worry about the centralizing effects of the concentration of users on a single platform, negating the true benefits of decentralization.&#34; - <strong>Alberto Jauregui, growth lead of <a href=\"https://pokt.network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pokt.network/&source=gmail&ust=1618071785530000&usg=AFQjCNFCFzOJrNiuuCyOflXUvhRn-dzNWQXUvhRn-dzNWQ\">Pocket Network</a>, a blockchain data ecosystem</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">&#34;The Coinbase listing is a huge step for the digital asset industry from both a mainstream adoption and regulatory point of view, signifying the acceptance of cryptocurrency business in traditional finance. Other exchanges following in Coinbase&#39;s footsteps are entirely based on their readiness to go public. This will pave the way for Coinbase&#39;s competitors to join the IPO movement. Kraken will most likely be next.&#34; - <strong>Gunnar Jaerv, COO of <a href=\"https://1stdigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://1stdigital.com/&source=gmail&ust=1618071785530000&usg=AFQjCNGEiuQsx1b-I4XQrotgyI1bX8tumgtgyI1bX8tumg\">First Digital Trust</a>, a leading digital asset custodian in Hong Kong</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">&#34;The success of Coinbase and its direct listing will bring on the next wave of new users to cryptocurrencies by continuing to solve the challenges of owning, storing, and providing custody to digital assets.

But progressive and liberal groups want Biden to go bigger on such measures in the next part of his plan.</p><p>Led by Invest in America and Care Can&#39;t Wait, 55 progressive groups called for Congress and the Biden administration to invest in care infrastructure to bring economic gains for women and communities of color, according to the <a href=\"https://investinamericanow.com/its-time-for-big-public-investment-in-a-care-infrastructure-that-works-for-everyone/\">letter</a>, which was first obtained by The Hill. The letter notes that over 2.3 million women left the labor force in 2020, of which more than 600,000 were Black women, and one in six child-care jobs lost during the pandemic have not returned.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s time for the Biden administration and Congress to deliver for women by investing in a family-friendly care infrastructure that works for the millions of people who need care and support, those who have had to leave the workforce to become unpaid caregivers, and for the paid caregivers who have been historically undervalued,&#34; the letter said.</p><p>The letter, which was signed by the Service Employees International Union and MomsRising, said that to rebuild the economy, Biden must invest in measures including:</p><ul><li>High-quality child care and and long-term support services for aging adults and people with disabilities;</li><li>Creating millions of new care jobs and ensuring workers are paid family-sustaining wages with benefits and the option to unionize;</li><li>Creating a national paid family and medical leave program;</li><li>And updating the tax code to focus on women and communities of color, including permanently expanding the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).</li></ul><p>The letter also called for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers to provide them with economic security and opportunity.</p><p>Some of the measures the letter called for were already included in the first part of the infrastructure plan. For example, the plan proposed a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-in-bidens-infrastructure-bill-package-american-jobs-plan-2021-3\">$400 billion investment</a> toward home and community care for the elderly and disabled, along with $48 billion toward an expansion of apprenticeships with a particular focus on women and people of color.</p><p>The letter echoes other efforts to encourage the creation of a national paid leave and a permanent expansion of tax credits. On April 5, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/child-care-infrastructure-plan-richard-neal-democrat-2021-4\">sent a letter</a> to Democratic committee members calling for the permanent expansion of the CTC and EITC, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-senators-permanent-child-tax-credit-expanded-stimulus-2021-3\">41 Democratic senators</a> sent a letter to Biden on March 26 requesting the same thing.</p><p>Neal also said he will give every worker the right to paid family and medical leave in the infrastructure bill, and if employers or states already have paid leave policies in place, the bill will provide support to maintain and improve them.</p><p>Republican leadership argues that care-economy funding doesn&#39;t belong in an infrastructure bill.

Blockchain&#39;s</a> stock jumped as much as 12% on Monday after the company announced an 80% increase in bitcoin mining production and the cryptocurrency briefly pushed <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-btc-near-record-high-coinbase-ipo-cryptocurrencies-2021-4-1030293956\">past $60,000 per coin</a>.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/105/riot-blockchain-announces-march-production-and-operations\">press release</a> that came out early Monday morning, Riot Blockchain said that in March 2021, it produced 187 bitcoin. That&#39;s 80% more than the company&#39;s mining operations produced a year ago, before bitcoin&#39;s halving.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-undergoes-third-halving-falls-vs-us-dollar-2020-5\">bitcoin &#34;halving&#34;</a> is when the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is cut in half. The last halving occurred on May 11, 2020.</p><p>The 80% jump in bitcoin mining production despite a tough comparison from the pre-halving quarter is illustrative of Riot&#39;s continued push for mining dominance.</p><p>Riot produced 491 bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 75% over its pre-halving first quarter 2020 production of 281 BTC.</p><p>The bitcoin mining company now holds some 1,565 bitcoin on its balance sheet, worth roughly $94 million at current prices, according to <a href=\"https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/103/riot-blockchain-announces-milestone-purchase-order-of\">data from the company</a>.</p><p>The news of Riot&#39;s rising bitcoin production comes after the firm <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/riot-blockchain-acquire-largest-north-american-bitcoin-hosting-facility-whinestone-2021-4-1030286353\">inked a deal to acquire</a> the largest bitcoin mining facility in North America, Whinstone US, for roughly $650 million last week.</p><p>Riot also recently <a href=\"https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/103/riot-blockchain-announces-milestone-purchase-order-of\">announced</a> that it picked up an additional 42,000 S19j Antminers from Bitmain for $138.5 million on April 7.</p><p>By the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm expects to have a total hash rate capacity of 7.7 exahash per second (EH/s) and a fleet of roughly 81,146 Antminers.</p><p>Riot also recently bolstered its management team with the addition of Megan Brooks as Chief Operating Officer, Phil McPherson as Vice President of Capital Markets, and Ryan Werner as Vice President of Finance.</p><p>HC Wainwright &#38; Co. reiterated its &#34;buy&#34; rating on shares of Riot and tagged the firm with a $64 price target on April 1 as well.</p><p>Shares of Riot traded up 8.75% as of 11:28 a.m. ET on Monday.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607467473e3fe7001882a1b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Riot chart 4\" height=\"670\" width=\"820\"

perspectives on developments relating to Taiwan</em>.</p><p>John Culver retired in 2020 after a distinguished 35-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency. During that time, he analyzed East Asian affairs, including security, economic, and foreign policy dimensions.</p><p>As national intelligence officer for East Asia from 2015 to 2018, he drove the intelligence community&#39;s support to top policymakers on East Asian issues. He routinely participated in meetings at the White House, with leaders throughout the United States government, and with foreign government officials.</p><p>In a conversation with Brookings Senior Fellow and interim Koo Chair in Taiwan Studies Ryan Hass, the two discussed the risk of future conflict in the Taiwan Strait, how Taiwan is responding to rising pressure from China, and steps the United States could take to support Taiwan in consideration of its interests.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f50213ce6ff30001d4e6c57?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Shiyu Kinmen County Taiwan China\" height=\"1673\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Shiyu, or Lion Islet, one of Taiwan&#39;s offshore islands, seen in front of the Chinese city of Xiamen, April 20, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Carl Court/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Ryan Hass: How do you see cross-Strait issues playing in China&#39;s domestic politics? Is Taiwan policy a high priority or a source of debate? And do you expect the role of Taiwan in China&#39;s politics to change as the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) draws nearer in fall 2022?</strong></p><p><strong>John Culver</strong>: One of my core assumptions is that things said by the CCP about Taiwan are generally not directed solely or principally at the Taiwan public, but instead at China&#39;s own domestic population, or at the US government and a few other foreign governments - principally Tokyo and Canberra.</p><p>This reflects the fact that Taipei has not taken highly provocative or precipitous actions since 2008, when then-President Chen Shui-bian stirred controversy by advocating, through a public referendum, for Taipei to pursue UN membership under the name &#34;Taiwan.&#34;</p><p>In this vein, I don&#39;t expect the role of Taiwan in China&#39;s politics to change due solely - or even mostly - to the 20th Party Congress in 2022, unless provoked by Taiwan&#39;s own election cycle, which would be gearing up for the January 2024 polls.</p><p>Thinking back over the past 30 to 40 years, we&#39;ve seen street demonstrations in China (officially the People&#39;s Republic of China, or PRC) - some violent - over Japan and domestic local issues (land use, pollution, ethnic strife). Some have even been directed at the United States, after events like the 1999 accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade or the 2001 People&#39;s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy fighter collision with a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft. But I don&#39;t recall ever seeing a major protest in China over Taiwan policy, which to me says that the PRC public isn&#39;t on tenterhooks over the issue and generally thinks that the CCP&#39;s policies toward Taiwan are &#34;tough enough&#34; and correct.</p><p>In other words, President Xi Jinping and the CCP are not facing much domestic pressure to do something, or at least to do something different. But galvanizing Chinese public opinion to justify harsher policies is a card Beijing could always play - we should keep in mind that it has not.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f501e89e6ff30001d4e6c54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"China amphibious tanks invasion\" height=\"1694\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chinese Army amphibious tanks land on a beach during a Sino-Russian military exercise near China&#39;s Shandong Peninsula, August 24, 2005.\n<p class=\"copyright\">China Photos/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>RH: Part of China&#39;s strategy appears to be placing psychological stress upon the people of Taiwan, both to raise perceptions of the costs and risks of independence and also to seed the idea that unification ultimately is inevitable. Do you agree? If so, how (in)effective do you China&#39;s efforts have been?</strong></p><p><strong>JC</strong>: Taiwan is an issue that the CCP sees as a threat to its legitimacy, not an opportunity to be seized. That has meant that CCP policy toward Taiwan is largely about what it wants to avoid, not what it wants to achieve - reactionary, not exploitative.</p><p>But that is changing, especially since Xi in 2019 and more recently has framed &#34;reunification&#34; as a requirement for achieving the &#34;China Dream&#34; tied to the CCP&#39;s longstanding goals for 2049, the 100th anniversary of the PRC&#39;s founding. We should worry that Xi may decide to take risks that his more constrained predecessors since Mao Zedong would not.</p><p>I don&#39;t think China today actually seeks to place severe psychological stress on Taiwan. Most of its actions are more formal and symbolic - like the current &#34;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-taiwan-face-off-pineapple-220804121.html?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pineapple boycott</a>&#34; - and are meant to stay ahead of Chinese domestic opinion, or warn against exploitation by the United States or another outside power.</p><p>Beijing is rigorous about cataloging and protesting every &#34;improper&#34; action by the United States, Taiwan, or occasionally by third parties, to ensure that it is vocal in opposition to continued erosion. And yet, by most measures, the situation continues to erode. For Washington, dating back almost a decade now, there are diminishing incentives to &#34;please Beijing&#34; by <em>not</em> doing something with Taiwan - they&#39;re going to protest anyway, even to modest arms sales, official visits, etc.</p><p>Some have interpreted President Xi&#39;s 2017 19th Party Congress report as setting a deadline for reunification by 2049, <a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when he stated</a> that &#34;complete national reunification is an inevitable requirement for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.&#34;</p><p>I approach the &#34;deadline&#34; interpretation with caution, since there&#39;s a pattern of previous leaders setting somewhat vague deadlines or timelines in order to look tough about &#34;solving&#34; the problem while at the same time kicking the can down the road for the successors. In other words, &#34;deadlines for unification&#34; typically have been driven more by internal CCP leadership dynamics and legacy-making than ordering a firm set of multi-domain operations to commence to produce something the CCP can call &#34;unification&#34; by a certain date.</p><p>I don&#39;t dismiss Xi&#39;s 2049 framing for the party&#39;s lofty ambitions that would include Taiwan. At some point in the not-too-distant future, perhaps 2030 or 2035, the PLA probably will have the organizational and warfighting capacity for a Taiwan operation that it has always lacked. China will probably be the largest economy, and an even more dominant trading and advanced manufacturing powerhouse. Weakness could no longer be an excuse for an increasingly nationalistic population that has only known China&#39;s rise.</p><p>As I noted <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/unfinished-chinese-civil-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in an article last year</a> about China&#39;s &#34;unfinished civil war,&#34; the CCP&#39;s ultimate objective isn&#39;t invasion but instead a process between China and Taiwan authorities to negotiate the formal, long-term political relationship across the strait. Military, economic, information, and diplomatic coercion and inducements would all be in play, and the red line for threatened military force would shift from preventing permanent separation to a refusal by Taipei to begin the political process - <a href=\"http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/999999999/t187406.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there is language in the 2005 anti-secession law along these lines</a>.</p><p>If 2049 is the CCP&#39;s goal for beginning a formal unification process, China&#39;s cross-strait policies would clearly break from the past sometime after 2030. China&#39;s proposals initially could be fairly lenient, <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/english/taiwan/7943.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not dissimilar from the CCP&#39;s 1979 letter to the Taiwan compatriots</a>, but a key condition would be the end of a US-Taiwan security framework without Beijing&#39;s explicit approval.</p><p>Perhaps a longer-term US goal, short of war, should be a strategy designed to change the CCP&#39;s definition of &#34;unification&#34; to something like a commonwealth or confederation, or even one similar to the US-Canada arrangement.</p><p>But even that would be a fraught domestic political step for the United States. It would require a consensus here that &#34;solving&#34; the Taiwan issue should even be our goal. Like so many of our culture-war issues in the US, there are powerful interests that are deeply invested in not solving these problems.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/58759233ee14b62b008b7a8d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tsai Ing-wen\" height=\"3264\" width=\"4896\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen during a visit in Managua, Nicaragua, January 10, 2017.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://pictures.reuters.com/archive/NICARAGUA-TAIWAN--RC1FE1166590.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oswaldo Rivas/Reuters</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>RH: How do you expect Taiwan will respond to rising Chinese pressure in the next year?</strong></p><p><strong>JC</strong>: It&#39;s become very common in the United States to frame Taiwan as the embattled, doughty democracy withstanding building pressure from the authoritarian mainland lusting to launch an invasion. We seem to yearn for a second cold war, because we think we know how to &#34;fight&#34; and win that scenario, so it&#39;s tempting to cast Taiwan as another Hungary or Czechoslovakia.</p><p>In reality, and in the history of the past 40 years, Taiwan has emerged as a vibrant democracy, and polling indicates that most Taiwanese don&#39;t feel very threatened - there&#39;s little domestic pressure to massively increase military spending or return to lengthy universal conscription.</p><p>Most Taiwan people aren&#39;t worried about imminent attack, because 40 years since US derecognition of the Republic of China (ROC) have passed without war, but also because some think that Taiwan could not prevail without massive US military intervention so there&#39;s little point in building up Taiwan&#39;s own military.</p><p>The Taiwan public also continues to mistrust its military as an institution because of the ROC military&#39;s standing as a pro-Kuomintang (KMT) mainlander-dominated stronghold.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f0dbe8a4dca68713f141422?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Taiwan navy frigate missile\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Taiwanese frigate fires an anti-submarine missile during an exercise near Hualien, Taiwan, May 22, 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Tyrone Siu</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>RH: There is growing talk in the United States about the rising risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.

Where do you fall in this debate?</strong></p><p><strong>JC</strong>: I disagree with the tone and import of recent public pronouncements by Davidson or former National Security Advisor <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-in-danger-from-2022-on-expert-warns-US-Congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">H.R. McMaster</a> that war is likely in a defined span of a few years.</p><p>Intentionally or not, they convey that China has a fixed timeline and agenda for compelling Taiwan, whether based on some assumption that as soon as the PLA is &#34;ready,&#34; China will launch an invasion, or that the CCP will launch an opportunistic war to shore up domestic legitimacy. None of this is true in terms of China&#39;s goals, its view of the usefulness of military force, or how the CCP&#39;s legitimacy has been trending or is likely to trend over the decade.</p><p>I&#39;m not predicting or forecasting that war <em>won&#39;t</em> happen. I&#39;m just saying that war isn&#39;t &#34;the plan&#34; for the CCP. The real danger is that all of the factors that tended to preserve the status quo since US-China diplomatic recognition in 1979 have eroded and are likely to continue to erode.</p><p>These include the military balance - which has swung decisively in China&#39;s favor - but in many ways that&#39;s the least consequential change in and of itself because even now, China is not building the invasion fleet. The more destabilizing factors driving the dynamic are:</p><ul><li>Taiwan&#39;s domestic political and identity development, where even the KMT is unlikely to sustain its prior position on the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/04/22/cross-strait-relations-not-a-one-way-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1992 consensus</a>.&#34; To avoid political oblivion, the KMT continues to transition into a fully Taiwan-centric party that must appeal to domestic sentiment, which is turning even more strongly against any form of unification under any timeline.</li><li>The emergence of full-blown US-China strategic rivalry, which increases Taiwan&#39;s attraction to both major US political parties as a litmus test of &#34;standing up to China.&#34; There&#39;s a myth that the main constraint against Taiwan independence has been the threat of Chinese military action. At least since the mid-1990s, the main constraint against more independence-focused policies and election outcomes on Taiwan has been pressure on Taipei by Washington - this is really clear from US policies and actions over the course of the Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-jeou administrations. We are much more incentivized today and looking forward to &#34;play the Taiwan card&#34; due to our own bipartisan political dynamic than because of actions by even an explicitly pro-independence leader in Taipei (which President Tsai Ing-wen is not).</li><li>China&#39;s own emergence as a great power with clear military dominance over Taiwan and seeming parity versus the US. The CCP no longer has the excuse of not acting violently because it is &#34;weak.&#34; Chinese domestic public opinion has grown more nationalistic as its relative governance success compared to the United States throughout the trade war and the pandemic have played out.</li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60632b08c9d73b00186e91c8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Palau Taiwan ambassador John Hennessey-Niland\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, left, Palau President Surangel Whipps, center, and US Ambassador to Palau John Hennessey-Niland in Taipei, March 29, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Ann Wang</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>RH: In the face of rising pressure from China on Taiwan, how should the United States most effectively signal support and reassurance to Taiwan in a manner that advances US interests?</strong></p><p><strong>JC</strong>: Foremost, the United States should try to separate its growing appetite for great power competition with China as much as possible from Taiwan policy. For me this means not falling victim to the recent preoccupation with imminent conflict due to the designs of the CCP.</p><p>Washington&#39;s actions to enhance Taiwan&#39;s freedom from Chinese coercion should be driven by substance, not symbolism. If the United States previously erred on the side of &#34;pleasing China&#34; by treating Taipei in ways that Taipei found insulting, it should resist the strong temptation to take actions primarily to antagonize and insult Beijing.</p><p>US policy for Taiwan should follow the Tsai administration&#39;s example of basing its legitimacy on the vibrant quality of its democracy and economic freedom. There are an array of steps the United States can take with regard to Taiwan on trade, multinational democratic forums, health policy, and even security affairs that neither stretch Washington&#39;s standard invocation of the <a href=\"https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/taiwan-relations-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Communiques, the Taiwan Relations Act</a>, and other assurances nor risk abandonment.</p><p>And especially with regard to US security policy toward Taiwan, cooperation with Taipei should focus on steps that make a use-of-force decision by Beijing a difficult one, fraught with risk, that relies less on big-ticket, budget-busting weapons purchases and more on public determination and capacity to resist military force.</p><p>This should include US advice and assistance to enhance the credibility of Taiwan&#39;s military as a <em>Taiwanese</em> institution, not a legacy of the Chinese civil war that enforced martial law on the island until the late 1980s. Building public trust in the Taiwan military is essential to overcome lack of serious focus on the threat of military conflict and defeatism.</p><p><em>All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official position or views of the US government.

This idea is known as the 80/20 rule, which states that 80% of a situation&#39;s outputs result from only 20% of inputs. To put it in simpler terms, it means the majority of results come from a minority of causes. </p><p>Although it&#39;s most commonly applied to business and economics, the 80/20 rule can also be applied to fields like investing and personal finance. Professionals advise against trying to use this rule to actively guide investment strategy, since the stock market can be so unpredictable, but find that it can hold true when evaluating or reflecting on past investments. </p><h2>What is the 80/20 rule?</h2><p>Referred to as the Pareto Principle after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, the 80/20 rule finds that 80% of the outcomes or results in a given situation stem from only 20% of what went into it. It&#39;s often used to identify the most efficient way of doing things and focus on developing them to maximize productivity.</p><p>The 80/20 rule can help individuals either identify and target problem areas and refine current strategies, or understand where a process or input is doing especially well and work to replicate it elsewhere. </p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>Where does the 80/20 rule apply?</strong></h2><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>In the business setting:</strong> This principle has been used to evaluate and improve management (when 20% of employees produce 80% of results), sales strategies (20% of customers bring in 80% sales) and operations (80% of product defects come from 20% of production problems).</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>In personal finance: </strong>The 80/20 rule is often used to guide budgeting. It directs individuals to put 20% of their monthly income into savings, whether that&#39;s a traditional savings account or a brokerage or retirement account, to ensure that there&#39;s enough set aside in the event of financial difficulty, and use the remaining 80% as expendable income.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>In investing:</strong> It&#39;s been found that 20% of a portfolio&#39;s holdings often lead to 80% of its growth. The opposite can also be true, with 80% of investment losses tracing back to 20% of holdings. But because of the stock market&#39;s unpredictable nature, this rule is often seen as an effective way to evaluate past investments instead of guide future ones.</li></ul></aside><h2>Understanding the 80/20 rule</h2><p>The 80/20 rule first originated when Pareto observed that 20% of the pea pods in his garden yielded 80% of its peas. He went on to apply the concept on a much broader scale, noting that 20% of Italy&#39;s population owned 80% of its wealth. Since then, the concept has been applied to business strategies, software development, healthcare, and more.</p><p>It should be noted that the 80/20 rule is not a strict or definite mathematical law, and is backed by more anecdotal evidence than scientific analysis. It&#39;s mere coincidence that the two numbers add up to 100%, and the inputs (80%) and outputs (20%) are simply meant to represent different units rather than be used to guide precise calculations.</p><h2>What does the 80/20 rule mean for my portfolio?</h2><p>Though its applications can be widely observed, investment professionals advise against trying to apply the 80/20 rule when building a portfolio. </p><p>The 80/20 rule can be effectively used to guard against risk when individuals put 80% of their money into safer investments, like savings bonds and CDs, and the remaining 20% into riskier growth stocks. However, using the 80/20 rule to try and hand-pick stocks that will potentially yield 80% of your returns is ill-advised.</p><p>&#34;It tells you about history, it doesn&#39;t tell you about the future - nobody knows the future,&#34; says <a href=\"https://www.jillonmoney.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jill Schlesinger</a>, CBS business analyst and host of Jill on Money. &#34;80% of the people who hit their goals concentrate on their goals, not on their investments.&#34;</p><p>In this regard, the 80/20 rule is most relevant as a metric for evaluation, not prediction.</p><p>&#34;Upon reflection, you [may be able to] look back and say, &#39;You know what, for the forty years that I was an investor, 80% of my returns came from 20% of my portfolio.&#39; You&#39;re probably not going to know until after the fact, or a period of time, when you can see what that 20% was,&#34; says Schlesinger.</p><p>It can also be argued that if only 20% of the investments in an equity portfolio are contributing to 80% of its gains, it&#39;s a rather poor portfolio allocation. </p><p>Generally speaking, each investment in your portfolio should serve a specific purpose and contribute toward the overall goal, whether that&#39;s investing for growth, risk-adjustment, or diversification. Placing too much emphasis on which equities might spur the most growth can distract investors from the bigger picture.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>The 80/20 rule finds that most (80%) of a situation or process&#39;s results come from only a few (20%) of its causes. This rule can be applied in a diverse range of fields, but investment professionals advise against using this principle to guide portfolio decisions. </p><p>Instead of using the 80/20 rule to try and curate a portfolio where a few investments will shine, it&#39;s best to establish clear, quantitative investment goals with a diversified portfolio to guard against risk.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\" class=\"mceNonEditable\"><a data-type=\"5f986a5397b25511b847eb03\" data-title=\"The Rule of 72 is a quick, simple way to figure how long it'll take for your savings and investments to double in valuealue\" data-url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rule-of-72\" data-vertical=\"clusterstock\" data-image=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9898b969331a0011bc59c9\">The Rule of 72 is a quick, simple way to figure how long it&#39;ll take for your savings and investments to double in value</a><a data-type=\"601243004296d77a977bf4c4\" data-title=\"How to invest in the S&P 500 -

raising its estimate from an initial $2 billion-$5 billion - with Credit Suisse Group and Nomura Holding hardest hit.</p><p>&#34;One line of argument which could explain why the scale of losses suffered by [Credit Suisse] and Nomura was higher could be a higher level of leverage extended by these banks compared to [Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley], which seem to have suffered smaller losses if any,&#34; JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said in a research note Monday. </p><p>JPMorgan clarified that there may also be additional considerations that determined the sizable difference between the scale of losses suffered, such as the timing of the sale of positions, among others. Nonetheless, the entire episode affects the industry overall, given that global banks could end up losing five times the normal loss level for a collateralized daily mark-to-market business.</p><p>JPMorgan cites three lessons the industry could take away from the fund&#39;s implosion. </p><p>First, investment banks in general are in better shape today and are more focused on high-volume execution platforms.</p><p>&#34;There is no excessive leverage in the [investment banking] or [private banking] industry,&#34; JPMorgan said.  &#34;Although [private banking] leverage has been increasing, it is nowhere near prior peaks.&#34;</p><p>The bank also said it sees no excessive equity-swap growth, a simple instrument all parties will benefit from.  </p><p>Second, US regulatory frameworks like Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act have improved the risk profile of investment banks. JPMorgan, however, noted that there is still weak oversight for non-bank entities, especially when it comes to family offices.</p><p>Archegos, a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bill-hwang-lost-8-billion-during-archegos-meltdown-reports-say-2021-4-1030272030\">family office</a> founded in 2012, did not have to disclose investments, unlike traditional hedge funds. JPMorgan also pointed to the lack of transparency when it came to equity-swap filings.</p><p>The Archegos sell-off exposed the fragility of the financial system, especially those involving lesser-known practices such as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sec-action-bill-hwang-archegos-implosion-experts-say-13fs-swaps-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">total return swaps</a>, a derivative instrument that enabled Bill Hwang&#39;s office not to have ownership of the underlying securities his firm was betting on and the secrecy of family offices. Typically, family offices enjoy the &#34;private adviser exemption&#34; provided under the Advisers Act to firms as these usually advise less than 15 clients, among other conditions.</p><p>But JPMorgan said, &#34;filing requirements would have applied to Archegos given its sizable exposure to some US securities. However, the fact that Archegos did not file with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] can be explained by the usage of total return swaps, which seems to be the primary method through which the sizable positions were built by Archegos.&#34;</p><p>Dan Berkovitz, a Democratic commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, denounced family offices and their ability to skirt some oversight.</p><p>&#34;A &#39;family office&#39; has nothing to do with ordinary families,&#34; he <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/berkovitzstatement040121\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said in a statement</a> on April 1. &#34;Rather, it is an investment vehicle used by centimillionaires and billionaires to grow their wealth, reduce their taxes, and plan their estates.&#34;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/berkovitzstatement040121\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>Third, JPMorgan said private banks, specifically those linked to Archegos, moving forward could improve their onboarding, especially with clients with backgrounds such as Hwang, who has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/who-is-bill-hwang-archegos-tiger-cub-christian-insider-trading-2021-3-1030255723?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">run into trouble in the past</a>. Private banks could also strengthen their risk management by giving less leverage to non-transparent family offices with concentrated positions and ensure checking the clients&#39; <a href=\"https://repowatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jpmtripartyrehypo.pdf\">rehypothecation risk</a>, among others.</p><p>Archegos in late March used borrowed money to make large bets on some stocks until Wall Street banks forced Archegos to sell over $20 billion worth of its shares after failing to meet a margin call. Hwang grew his family office&#39;s $200 million investment to $10 billion. Reports say the former Tiger Management trader <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bill-hwang-lost-8-billion-during-archegos-meltdown-reports-say-2021-4-1030272030\">lost $8

investors should keep an eye out for, Goldman&#39;s Fadi Abuali said in a recent in-house interview.</p><p>As the CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, Abuali oversees work with both large institutional investor clients and third party banks who are wholesalers to retail investors. </p><p>Here are four megatrends Goldman Sachs Asset Management is focused on in the retail investing space: </p><p><strong>Thinking like a Millennial </strong></p><p>How the largest generation in mankind&#39;s history saves their money, spends their money, and uses their time is a major area of focus for Goldman, Abuali said. </p><p>&#34;They&#39;re tech enabled. They prefer healthy lifestyles. Focus on sustainable living. They also prefer experiences over things,&#34; said Abuali, who suggests investors seek out companies that will benefit from millennials&#39; lifestyle choices. <br><br><strong>The Green Revolution </strong><br><br>ESG investing  is also a major area of focus for Abuali, particularly because many COVID-related fiscal packages in economies across the globe include funding for renewable power, electric vehicles, and grid infrastructure.</p><p>Abuali said companies that invest in automation efficiencies, renewables, sustainable transportation, recycling, packaging, and plant-based proteins  will &#34;generate meaningful alpha opportunities&#34; for Goldman and their clients.</p><p><strong>Emerging Technology </strong></p><p>While technology was an attractive area of the market through the COVID-19 crisis, the demand for working online and transacting remotely won&#39;t die down after the pandemic, Abuali said.</p><p>He said investors should seek out companies that involve cybersecurity, software as a service, cloud platforms, and data centers. These will all be &#34;big beneficiaries&#34; of the continued trend of working from home. </p><p><strong>Healthcare </strong><br><br>Abuali also sees key opportunities in the healthcare industry as a result of the coordination between the private sector and public sector during the pandemic.</p><p>&#34;..With greater regulatory comfort and better access to capital, we expect to see the emergence of many new solutions for challenging diseases,&#34; said the CEO. &#34;And so, genomics, gene sequencing, gene editing, gene therapy, and concerning supply side manufacturing opportunities will present some terrific investment opportunities for us.&#34;</p><p> </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/apha-stock\">Aphria</a> saw its stock fall as much as 15% on Monday after the company turned in a disappointing fiscal third-quarter earnings report.</p><p>Aphria said it generated revenue of $153.6 million in the quarter compared to analysts&#39; consensus expectations for $163.3 million. Revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year, but sequentially it fell 4.3%.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA came in at $12.7 million in the fiscal third quarter, which was below analyst consensus estimates for $14.9 million.</p><p>Aphria also turned in a record net loss of $361.0 million, or $1.14 per share, in the fiscal third quarter. The loss was partly due to increasing production costs at the firm.</p><p>The cash cost to produce dried cannabis per gram rose 13.9% quarter-over-quarter in Aphria&#39;s quarterly report and adjusted cannabis gross margin sank to 39.2% vs. 45.9% in the prior quarter.</p><p>The Leamington, Canada-based company saw its cannabis sales fall to 18,695 kgs in the fiscal third quarter as well, a decrease of 30.1% compared to the fiscal second quarter.</p><p>The company&#39;s CEO Irwin Simon pointed to the impact of lockdowns as his reasoning for the disappointing results.  </p><p>&#34;The duration and impact of lockdowns across many of the regions we operate in, particularly in Canada, were greater than we initially anticipated for the cannabis industry and our business; however, we believe Aphria remains well-positioned with our leading brands and market share to experience a robust increase in our top-line as the market improves.&#34; the chief executive officer wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-301266533.html\">press release</a>.</p><p>One bright spot in the fiscal third-quarter report came from SweetWater, a cannabis brewing company Aphria acquired for $300 million in 2020. SweetWater saw sales climb from $0.9 million last quarter to nearly $15 million. </p><p>Aphria is set to merge with fellow cannabis producer <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tlry-stock\">Tilray</a> to make the largest cannabis company in the world in terms of revenue pending shareholder approval on Wednesday.  </p><p>The combined company has plans to continue its international expansion as the regulatory environment for cannabis producers and retailers continues to improve. </p><p>Aphria traded down 14.71% as of 11:49

economic-recovery wish list, Goldman Sachs economists said Sunday.</p><p>Despite passing $1.9 trillion in new stimulus just one month ago, the White House is already prepping another massive spending effort. The president <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-roads-bridges-broadband-power-2021-3\">unveiled the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan</a> in late March and is reportedly teeing up another package that would set the two plans&#39; combined price tag <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-infrastructure-bill-package-4-trillion-with-tax-hikes-2021-3\">at roughly $4 trillion</a>. Biden also proposed a handful of tax hikes set to offset the spending measures&#39; hefty costs.</p><p>The White House will be successful in pushing the proposals over the finish line, but the policies won&#39;t look the same once they get there, economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a note to clients. Congress will pass nearly all of the &#34;hard infrastructure&#34; Biden has proposed, such as road and bridge renovation, updates to federal buildings, and clean water initiatives, they added.</p><p>Biden&#39;s American Families Plan won&#39;t be so untouched. The bank said Congress will likely approve the package - which is expected to include spending on education and child care - but only as a slimmed-down version. All told, it sees about $3.3 trillion in spending making its way back to Biden&#39;s desk for his final signature, roughly $700 billion less than the president pushed for.</p><p>The Biden administration won&#39;t see its tax plans come to fruition, either. Congressional Democrats will end up lifting the corporate tax rate to 25% from 21%, Goldman said, coming in shy of the 28% rate sought by the president.</p><p>The tax rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends will reach 28%, the team added. That compares to the 39.6% rate proposed by the White House. Revenue raised by international tax proposals like a global minimum corporate tax rate would likely be cut in half, according to the bank.</p><p>The smaller tax hikes and cuts to spending stand to garner additional support for the two plans, but Democrats are still most likely to lump the proposals together and pass them through reconciliation, Goldman said. The process was used for Biden&#39;s stimulus plan and allows Democrats to approve legislation with a simple majority.</p><p>The bank&#39;s most probable scenario sees Democrats skirting GOP opposition and passing a single package through budget reconciliation sometime between July and September. The plan will cost roughly $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years and will be partially offset by $1.5 trillion in new tax revenues over the same period, the team said. </p><p>&#34;The risk in this approach is that some centrist Democrats might balk at passing such a large bill through the reconciliation process, which could delay or potentially imperil passage,&#34; they added.</p><p>Other, less likely options include passing two separate bills through reconciliation and passing three measures through a mix of reconciliation votes and regular Congressional process. Pursuing regular votes would likely punt some bills into the fall as Democrats work to win Republican support, according to Goldman.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-infrastructure-spending-plan-tax-hikes-compromise-democrats-goldman-sachs-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/sc-vuoVHKVc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:06:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607451453e3fe7001882a145?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"da2ad195051b93780f9923c0e3204046","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-10-842_d64294c237212622.webp","destWidth":3216,"destHeight":2412,"sourceBytes":767578,"destBytes":767578,"author":"bwinck@businessinsider.com (Ben Winck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6074511f2cc1ef0018da1311?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-11-877_f226999551d0b9be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-16-326_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn2@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-18-264_e5328066b4eb7a7e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-888_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sc-vuoVHKVc:P6KrbfWjsSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn28@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-12-622_89f69cf000079cd0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/sc-vuoVHKVc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn60@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-14-441_2c0beb003bfd494d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245786307},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","title":"A new DEA map shows where cartels have influence in the US.

They have been doing this for years, and it just doesn&#39;t make sense. Cartels today are not structured [like] a hierarchy organization, but more like a decentralized network,&#34; Hope told Insider.</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;The logic behind the DEA [report] is to argue there is an invasion of external forces so they can justify more budget and support from the US,&#34; he said.</p><p align=\"left\">Neither DEA headquarters nor its offices in Texas and Arizona responded to requests for comment on the map.</p><p align=\"left\">The report describes the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion as &#34;one of the fastest growing cartels&#34; and says the organization &#34;smuggles illicit drugs into the United States by accessing various trafficking corridors in northern Mexico along the SWB including Tijuana, Juarez and Nuevo Laredo.&#34;</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;The cartels dominate the drug trade influencing the United States market, with most cartels having a poly drug market approach that allows for maximum flexibility and resiliency of their operations,&#34; the report states.</p><p align=\"left\">The report doesn&#39;t describe how these organizations maintain their presence in the US.</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;The DEA has a problem with semantics. What does influence actually mean? What does presence even mean? An associate is no other thing but a client,&#34; Hope said.</p><p align=\"left\"></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5852f090a1a45e8b3f8b532f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"US drug market mexican cartel control DEA map\" height=\"790\" width=\"984\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The cartel areas of influence map from the 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment.\n<p class=\"copyright\">DEA NDTA 2016</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p align=\"left\">An operative for Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion said the organization maintained a large group of members in Mexico who are &#34;mostly on the armed side of the operations,&#34; while most contacts in the US were clients.</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;Most of what we can call members of the Jalisco organization are on the arms [side], like sicarios, and some producers that are on a payroll, but everyone else is either a client we are selling to or an association to have access to certain route&#34; for distribution in the US, he said.</p><p align=\"left\">Some intelligence officials believe Mexican cartels do have a real presence on US soil but function differently there.</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;The substantial difference is that drug criminal enterprises are not displaying force at the border with the US because it is not needed. We should take into account that keeping a low profile is good for their activities and business, just as any other corporation,&#34; said a high-level foreign intelligence official in Mexico who asked for anonymity.</p><p align=\"left\">The official said cartel associates in the US have something like membership, even if they aren&#39;t part of the cartel structure, and &#34;are using the brand&#34; to prove their drugs&#39; quality.</p><p align=\"left\">&#34;We need to consider that they act just as another transnational company, with their level of organization, distribution, reach, and territory control. They do have a presence in the US in how their drug has a brand backing up certain quality,&#34; the official said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

While it&#39;s also been known as Outlook Web App, it&#39;s now more commonly referred to as Outlook on the web. </p><p>OWA once applied exclusively to the online version of Outlook which came with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/microsoft-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Exchange</a> Server. These days, Outlook on the web is more commonly accessed from a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft 365</a> or free Outlook.com account.</p><p>While the version of Outlook that runs on your desktop as an app for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mac</a> still gives you the most flexibility, power, and features, you don&#39;t need to use it - Microsoft makes it easy to open your Outlook inbox in a web browser instead. That means you can see your Outlook inbox from any computer. </p><h2>How to open Outlook on the web</h2><p>To open Outlook on the web, just open the URL that&#39;s associated with your Outlook account. That should be the<a href=\"http://outlook.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Microsoft 365 sign-in page</a> or, if you have a free Outlook account, <a href=\"https://outlook.live.com/owa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outlook.com</a>. Enter your email address and password and then select &#34;Sign in.&#34; </p><p>If you do happen to be using an Exchange Server rather than a Microsoft 365 account, you might need to ask your network administrator for the URL to the OWA website for your account. </p><h2>How to use Outlook on the web</h2><p>While Outlook on the web is a simplified version of Outlook, you&#39;ll probably still recognize it as the email program you already know from the desktop.

Here are some ways to get more out of Outlook on the web:</p><ul><li><strong>Filter your email</strong>. You can control what email is displayed and how it&#39;s sorted. At the top right of the message pane click &#34;Filter.&#34; In the dropdown menu, you can choose which messages you want to see - such as all messages, only unread, messages directly addressed to you, flagged messages, and so on. To change the sorting method, at the bottom of the dropdown menu choose &#34;Sort&#34; and select how you&#39;d like the messages to be organized. </li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60707fcf4943790018bb1a54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_Outlook_on_the_web 7\" height=\"1142\" width=\"1810\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Outlook on the web gives you a variety of sorting options.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>Configure the reading pane.</strong> You can set the Reading pane to appear on the right of the message pane (which is the default), underneath the message pane, or you can even disable it entirely. Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top-right of the page and, in the Reading pane section at the bottom of the page, choose &#34;Show on the right,&#34; &#34;Show on the bottom,&#34; or &#34;Hide.&#34; If you choose to hide the pane, messages will appear in a new window and take over the Outlook webpage when you click on a message in the message list. </li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607081aa4943790018bb1a61?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_Outlook_on_the_web 8\" height=\"1516\" width=\"2029\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Reading pane can appear to the right or below the message list - or you can turn it off entirely.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>Change your theme</strong>. Want a different theme for Outlook? Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top right of the page and then choose a theme from the top of the Settings pane. There are more themes available than what you see here - click &#34;View all&#34; to see more. </li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607086444943790018bb1a8f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_Outlook_on_the_web 9\" height=\"1504\" width=\"2042\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Use the Settings icon to change the visual theme of Outlook on the web.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>Turn on dark mode</strong>. Dark mode is a popular feature that some people find easier on the eyes, especially in the evening hours.  Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top right of the page and then and then turn on Dark mode by swiping the button to the right. </li><li><strong>Turn on desktop notifications</strong>. If you&#39;d like to see a pop-up notification about new messages even when your browser is not the focus of your desktop, you can turn on desktop notifications. Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top right of the page and then turn on Desktop notifications by swiping the button to the right. In most cases, you&#39;ll also need to enable your browser to show notifications - look for a pop-up from your browser to enable these notifications. If you&#39;re using Chrome, for example, click &#34;Allow.&#34; In Firefox, click &#34;Allow Notifications.&#34;</li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607086c34943790018bb1a93?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What_is_Outlook_on_the_web 10\" height=\"1205\" width=\"2035\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>If you turn on notifications, be sure to enable notifications in the browser as well.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>Customize display settings with display density</strong>. You can vary how many messages appear in the message list at once - you can pack them in more tightly or space them out, making them easier to browse. Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top right of the page and find the Display density section. Choose &#34;Full,&#34; &#34;Medium,&#34; or &#34;Compact.&#34; Full is the most relaxed view and each message includes a small icon representing the sender. Medium removes the icon, which shrinks the size of each message slightly. Compact tightens up the spacing and puts the most messages on the page at once. </li><li><strong>View and group your conversations</strong>. You might be familiar with Outlook&#39;s Conversation view from the desktop version of the email app. Conversation view groups related emails together, making it easier to follow a conversation thread. You can control this setting in Outlook on the web as well. Click the Settings icon (shaped like a gear) at the top right of the page and find the Conversation view section. You can arrange your email so the newest replies in a conversation appear on top, appear on the bottom, or you can turn off conversation view entirely. If you do that, every message appears independently in the message pane, regardless of its relationship to other messages. </li></ul><figure>\n\t<img

This is merely an opening salvo in a widespread assault on the right to vote, and other Republican-controlled state legislatures are hoping to pass similar bills. The only way to head off the wave of attacks on the fundamental right of all citizens to have equal access to vote is for Democrats to use their slim majorities to immediately pass new voter protections. If HR 1 (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">the For The People Act</a>) and the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4/text\">John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</a> don&#39;t become law, Georgia&#39;s anti-voting law will become just one of many.</p><h2>Republicans are moving the goal-post </h2><p>A New York Times analysis of the new Georgia elections law (SB 202) found that, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html\">among other things</a>, it limits the window of time to request an absentee ballot, makes it illegal for election officials to mail absentee ballots to all voters, levies criminal penalties for anyone who gives water to voters in long lines, severely limits the number of ballot drop boxes, and replaces the secretary of state as chair of the State Election Board with someone elected from the state legislature. The Georgia legislature (which has been under Republican control <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_Georgia_state_government\">since 2005</a>) also now has the power to remove municipal and county election officials and replace them with people appointed by partisan state lawmakers. </p><p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/25/981357583/georgia-legislature-approves-election-overhaul-including-changes-to-absentee-vot\">argued</a> the new law is necessary to make the state&#39;s elections &#34;secure, accessible, and fair.&#34; This is despite Georgia&#39;s Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/21/brad-raffensperger-georgia-results-2020-election-trustworthy/\">stating in a Washington Post op-ed</a> that &#34;Georgia&#39;s voting system has never been more secure or trustworthy.&#34; Even Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan (R) <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kemp-deputy-expresses-concerns-about-georgias-new-voting-law-there-were-some-things-i-didnt-like-214143449.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALoc0xScjRXSOrL3zk-riewIMpEYIdxcCmaBpJdTBvoFGdXdv8XMDGRG7TGAxVxphmhNcqvE2YMkuKjNKGK-4rw4CQoEAJc8SR2zicTt4Je0u3_IOFErg97ovymX2BsEv86-BcgzVeAHhjKMriNNV7EsioLl6_P6PvpCj8Q_NpERj8Q_NpER\">thought the bill went too far</a> to curb access to voting. </p><p>Various civil rights groups have since <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/georgias-sweeping-elections-overhaul-faces-new-legal-challenge/ARLWEI7SENEKNC4VUGWSHGGUIA/\">filed a legal challenge</a> to SB 202, petitioning for the law to be rendered unconstitutional and in violation of the Voting Rights Act. But because Georgia is part of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and because a majority of the circuit&#39;s judges were <a href=\"https://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/eleventh-circuit-judges\">appointed by Republican presidents</a>, SB 202 may very well be upheld. Even if the 11th Circuit struck down the law, appellants could end up swaying the United States Supreme Court, which maintains a 6-3 conservative majority. Moreover, Chief Justice John Roberts even <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96\">wrote the majority opinion</a> in the landmark voting rights case that opened the door for bills like SB 202 to become law across the country. </p><p>The 2013 <em>Shelby County vs. Holder</em> decision will undoubtedly be remembered in history books with the same level of disdain as the 1857 <em>Dred Scott vs. Sandford</em> decision. Both decisions created false racial hierarchies rendering Black people to second-class citizen status. Whereas <em>Dred Scott</em> declared Black people did not have the rights of citizenship, <em>Shelby County</em> declared that the portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 pertaining to protections for Black voters <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/shelby-county-v-holder/\">was unconstitutional</a>. This released <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/25/18701277/shelby-county-v-holder-anniversary-voting-rights-suppression-congress\">nine mostly Southern states</a> - Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia - from getting &#34;pre-clearance&#34; from the federal judiciary before changing laws pertaining to voting rights. At the time, Justice Antonin Scalia justified his vote to eliminate those protections by saying the Voting Rights Act created &#34;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-voting-rights-scalia-sees-a-racial-entitlement\">racial entitlement</a>&#34; for Black voters. </p><p>Just days after the <em>Shelby County</em> decision, the League of Women Voters warned that &#34;<a href=\"https://www.lwv.org/blog/supreme-court-ruling-opens-door-widespread-voter-suppression\">the floodgates have opened</a>&#34; for widespread voter suppression legislation across the country and called for Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing everyone the right to vote. They were right: according to the Brennan Center for Justice, there are <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-march-2021\">at least 361 bills</a> awaiting action in 47 states that aim to curtail ballot access for voters. Five of those bills have already become law this year, and 29 bills have been passed by at least one legislative chamber. 49 of those bills are in Texas. And in Arizona and Georgia - states with Republican-controlled legislatures where Joe Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 election - there are 23 and 25 pending voter suppression bills, respectively.</p><h2>For Democrats, it&#39;s now or never</h2><p>The best way to beat back this wave of anti-voting bills is to pass federal legislation guaranteeing the absolute right of all citizens to cast a ballot. HR 1, which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/politics/house-democrats-hr1-vote/index.html\">passed the House in March</a> and is currently awaiting action in the Senate, would go a long way toward advancing that goal. Among other things, the bill would establish automatic voter registration, in which citizens are automatically registered on their state&#39;s voter rolls when getting state-issued driver&#39;s licenses and ID cards. It would also guarantee same-day voter registration for federal elections, which allows citizens to register to vote at their polling precinct on the day of the election. HR 1 also requires states to open up the early voting period at least two weeks before an election. </p><p>The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was introduced in the Senate in the 116th Congress, is the perfect companion to HR 1. That bill restores the preclearance requirement in the Voting Rights Act that was undone by the <em>Shelby County</em> decision, forcing state governments to win approval from the federal bench before changing election laws. The Act also broadens cases in which the Department of Justice can send federal election observers to states that federal courts have deemed necessary to ensure adequate protections are in place for all voters. </p><p>While these bills are great antidotes for the wave of voter suppression bills being introduced across the country, they still have yet to overcome the key hurdle of the filibuster. Even though they don&#39;t control the Senate, Republicans can still invoke the filibuster for any non-budgetary legislation, requiring an impenetrable 60-vote threshold first be met before a bill can even get an up-or-down vote. If they had a unified bloc, Democrats could make procedural maneuvers to eliminate the filibuster with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. Centrist Democrat senators like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are still currently in favor of keeping the filibuster, dooming voting rights legislation to the legislative graveyard. However, President Joe Biden may be warming to the idea of limiting the power of the filibuster and could even be making moves behind the scenes to eliminate it entirely.</p><p>Biden has also notably <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dlippman/status/1375430289313398788\">appointed Gayle Manchin</a>, Joe Manchin&#39;s wife, to a &#34;key position&#34; in the White House, essentially tying Manchin&#39;s family to his administration. It&#39;s difficult to see how this isn&#39;t a maneuver to placate Manchin in an effort to soften the senator&#39;s position on the filibuster (admittedly a tall order given Manchin&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html\">recent op-ed</a> in favor of keeping it). In the event Manchin does eventually flip on the filibuster, Sinema could soon follow, not wanting to be seen as the lone obstacle in the way of significant voting rights expansion.</p><p>If Senate Democrats act to eliminate the filibuster, it should be done right away. As The Daily Poster <a href=\"https://www.dailyposter.com/p/dems-could-lose-their-majority-at?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MjMxMzQ1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozNDI4NTMxMywiXyI6Ijc3cTE5IiwiaWF0IjoxNjE2Nzc3MzM1LCJleHAiOjE2MTY3ODA5MzUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zNzc3OCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.cSuGIvQ34ytv70KlF_ipe_coSrpBo6dUElBcOU6YdUc\">recently pointed out</a>, there are multiple septuagenarian senators from states with Republican governors. Should anything happen to aging senators like Patrick Leahy, Ed Markey, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, any one of them could be replaced with a Republican, abruptly ending Democrats&#39; control of the Senate and putting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell back in the driver&#39;s seat.</p><p>Democrats will have to decide relatively soon whether they&#39;d rather keep a Jim Crow relic like the filibuster, or have new federal voting rights legislation. If they want any hope of stopping the relentless march of state-level, Republican-led voter suppression efforts, it&#39;s obvious what must be done: Democrats should immediately nuke the filibuster and pass HR 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, or kiss their majorities goodbye.</p><p><em>Carl Gibson is a freelance journalist whose work has been published in CNN, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Houston Chronicle, Barron&#39;s, The Independent, and NPR, among others.

On March 25, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed a law pushed through by state Republicans. Among other things, the law <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/georgia-voting-restrictions/2021/03/25/91009e72-8da1-11eb-9423-04079921c915_story.html\">strips some of the power to run Georgia elections</a> from the secretary of state and local counties and transfers oversight to a state board that conservatives likely will dominate. The law infamously includes <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kemp-sign-sweeping-elections-bill-passed-georgia-legislature/story?id=76677927\">a ban on providing food and water to people waiting in line to vote</a>. Gov. Kemp justified the law, citing <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-03-25/georgia-house-passes-gop-election-bill-despite-criticism\">dubious questions about whether the 2020 election in Georgia was fair</a>. </p><p>You also likely know the challenges placed on voters in Florida. In the run up to the 2020 elections, State Republicans, led by Gov. Ron DeSantis, erected a huge barrier to the state&#39;s amendment granting voting rights to people with felony records. The amendment was approved by 64% of voters. Republicans inserted a poll tax requirement to the amendment that required those with felony records to <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2020/09/11/florida-felons-cant-vote-until-they-pay-fines-judge-rules/\">pay all fines and fees</a> from their sentence before they could vote. </p><p>However, you likely don&#39;t know the challenges that New York City voters have. In New York, a diverse, global, and decidedly liberal city, people in pre-trial detention are free to vote. However, as the June 22 primary nears, featuring dozens of candidates representing the city&#39;s diversity, the New York Department of Corrections is <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/city-ignoring-mandate-informing-a-detainees-right-to-vote-legal-advocates-say\">not meeting its obligations to voting access in NYC jails</a>. The overwhelming majority of people have not received voter registration information, there are no posters or signs with voter information, and people have not received voter registration education. The failure to take these steps only increases the barriers to voting among this population.</p><p>The New York City Charter requires DOC to implement a program to assist individuals with voting. Because people in NYC jails are required to vote by absentee ballot, they must rely entirely on DOC staff to exercise their right to vote. More importantly, a loophole in the registration rules further disenfranchises some people in NYC jails. For the upcoming election, the last day to postmark an application for an absentee ballot is June 15 and the last day to postmark an absentee ballot is June 22. This means eligible voters admitted into DOC custody after June 15 and held through June 22 won&#39;t be able to vote.</p><p>In order to ensure all New Yorkers can vote, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Deputy Mayor Phillip Thompson, Executive Director Margaret Egan, Commissioner Andrew Spano, and Commissioner Cynthia Brann must listen to <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04-02-21-LAS-and-35-Organizations-Call-for-Greater-Access-to-Voter-Registration-in-NYC-Jails.pdf\">the Legal Aid Society</a> and ensure eligible voters in New York City jails have prompt and secure ballot access without hindrance. In order to accomplish this, they must:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">Provide a report on what steps have been taken to implement the voting policy in New York City jails announced last year at the September Board of Corrections (BOC) meeting.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Show that the BOC works with the DOC and the Board of Elections (BOE) to get &#34;emergency&#34; poll sites set up in every jail, and allows every eligible incarcerated person to i) register, and ii) vote by affidavit on election day.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Prove that the BOC requests from both the DOC and the BOE to report the number of eligible voters in DOC custody, the number of registration forms they received, the number of registration forms they considered valid, the number of absentee ballot applications they received and accepted as valid, and the number of absentee ballots received and accepted as valid. </li></ul><p>There is an incredible amount of confusion and misinformation surrounding access to voting that systematically deprives people the right to vote. Ensuring appropriate accommodations for all voters - South and North of the Mason-Dixon Line, in jail or free - is the crucial first step in protecting a fundamental right to our democracy.</p><p><em>Ashish Prashar is the Global CMO at R/GA and a justice reform activist.

Michele Bachmann a &#34;lunatic.&#34;</p><p>But Boehner, who served as speaker from 2011-2015, was overpowered by more right-wing forces in his party and is now out of step with a voter base that remains deeply loyal to Trump and more focused on culture wars than policy change. </p><p>Boehner has repeatedly taken aim at Cruz since leaving office. In 2016, he called the senator &#34;Lucifer in the flesh&#34; and told an audience that he&#39;d &#34;never worked with a more miserable son of a b---- in my life.&#34; </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-The Recount  (@therecount) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1381602500713795585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p> </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/john-boehner-jackass-ted-cruz-stirring-up-the-gop-crazies-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/-wJ2kCcXdZY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:56:26 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607454672cc1ef0018da1321?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"45bb1c850c09aaf4e8c6e9c3842ef766","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-10-624_66bcb3e780458a82.webp","destWidth":956,"destHeight":717,"sourceBytes":25420,"destBytes":25420,"author":"insider@insider.com (Eliza Relman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606dbe3070954f00191959b9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn13@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-15-177_0f53809d230feb1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-16-326_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn87@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-12-292_f9fde108d1075c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-13-274_e08952c13f1cc42d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-888_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=-wJ2kCcXdZY:_waA9-QotYM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-11-450_42dd8618acfbbf7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/-wJ2kCcXdZY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-14-930_0b348f4a2c3a6896.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245786341},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","title":"How Dwight D.

Another is the myriad ways that the ultrawealthy use to hide their wealth and assets from taxation.</p><p>A recent study from the IRS and economists found that America&#39;s richest seem to have been hiding <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/irs-tax-evasion-high-income-one-percent-households-new-research-2021-3\">billions from the agency</a>.

As Bloomberg reports, he&#39;s currently leading an expert panel in the UK that&#39;s aimed at reducing inequality. In December, another panel in the UK - the Wealth Tax Commission - recommended a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-one-time-wealth-ultrawealthy-tax-arizona-san-francisco-argentina-2020-12\">one-off tax</a> on the UK&#39;s wealthiest residents.

A source close to the deal told Insider that the new round put the company&#39;s valuation at around $2.6 billion. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mlb-topps-baseball-cards-nft-buy-sell-trade-online-wax-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8kSH9onDGwU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:51:17 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607469ce3e3fe7001882a1c5?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b15422c7bcf15006c1cbbdc9f2829bfb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-10-823_b51d2f61c26b09a7.webp","destWidth":2089,"destHeight":1567,"sourceBytes":213692,"destBytes":213692,"author":"awilliams@insider.com (Annabelle Williams)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606bc68ea7d803001963eded?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-12-634_85644a812d2f3f03.webp","https://i.insider.com/607468e73e3fe7001882a1c1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-27-491_98ab86131ff2327a.webp","https://i.insider.com/607469813e3fe7001882a1c3?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn29@2020_5/2021/04/12/16-44-17-689_8a325751e0c3e5db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-16-326_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn96@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-12-649_ab44ad9909b28631.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-16-226_badda81ff5330694.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-13-888_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8kSH9onDGwU:nx0ZZCzYYXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-12-190_42b34b16f16fd826.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8kSH9onDGwU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn38@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-14-941_cbd995eeaeddf3ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245786418},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:06","title":"What you should know about coronavirus variants, according to a virologist","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-variants-what-to-know-according-to-virologist-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6017fefb6dfbe10018e01025?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid vaccine development\" height=\"1464\" width=\"1952\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>(Author not pictured) Epidemiologists predict that within a year current vaccines could need to be updated to better handle new variants.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pedro Vilela/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Dr. Paulo Verardi is an associate professor of virology and vaccinology at the University of Connecticut.</li>\n<li>He says people should be aware of the currently identified five COVID-19 variants.</li>\n<li>Assume these variants will continue to evolve and adapt, stay vigilant, and get vaccinated. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Spring has sprung, and there is a sense of relief in the air. After one year of lockdowns and social distancing, more than 171 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the US and <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">about 19.4% of the population is fully vaccinated</a>. But there is something else in the air: ominous SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>I am a <a href=\"https://pathobiology.cahnr.uconn.edu/paulo-h-verardi/\">virologist and vaccinologist</a>, which means that I spend my days studying viruses and designing and testing vaccine strategies against viral diseases. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this work has taken on greater urgency. We humans are in a race to become immune against this cagey virus, whose ability to mutate and adapt seems to be a step ahead of our capacity to gain herd immunity. Because of the variants that are emerging, it could be a race to the wire.</p><h2>Five variants to watch</h2><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/1389202916666150707160613\">RNA viruses</a> like SARS-CoV-2 constantly mutate as they make more copies of themselves. Most of these mutations end up being disadvantageous to the virus and therefore disappear through natural selection.</p><p>Occasionally, though, they offer a benefit to the mutated or so-called genetic-variant virus. An example would be a mutation that improves the ability of the virus to attach more tightly to human cells, thus enhancing viral replication. Another would be a mutation that allows the virus to spread more easily from person to person, thus increasing transmissibility.</p><p>None of this is surprising for a virus that is a fresh arrival in the human population and still adapting to humans as hosts. While viruses don&#39;t think, they are governed by the same evolutionary drive that all organisms are - their first order of business is to perpetuate themselves.</p><p>These mutations have resulted in several new SARS-CoV-2 variants, leading to outbreak clusters, and in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/06/us/variants-cases-spread.html\">global spread</a>. They are broadly classified as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html\">variants of interest, concern or high consequence</a>.</p><p>Currently there are five variants of concern circulating in the US: the B.1.1.7, which originated in the UK; the B.1.351., of South African origin; the P.1., first seen in Brazil; and the B.1.427 and B.1.429, both originating in California.</p><p>Each of these variants has a number of mutations, and some of these are key mutations in critical regions of the viral genome. Because the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0485-4\">spike protein</a> is required for the virus to attach to human cells, it carries a number of these key mutations. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Neutralizing-Antibodies.aspx\">antibodies that neutralize</a> the virus typically bind to the spike protein, thus making the spike sequence or protein a key component of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-california-india-2021-4\">India and California have recently detected &#34;double mutant&#34; variants</a> that, although not yet classified, have gained international interest. They have one key mutation in the spike protein similar to one found in the Brazilian and South African variants, and another already found in the B.1.427 and B.1.429 California variants. As of today, no variant has been classified as of high consequence, although the concern is that this could change as new variants emerge and we learn more about the variants already circulating.</p><h2>More transmission and worse disease</h2><p>These variants are worrisome for several reasons. First, the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern generally spread from person to person at least <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html\">20% to 50% more easily</a>. This allows them to infect more people and to spread more quickly and widely, eventually becoming the predominant strain.</p><p>For example, the B.1.1.7 UK variant that was first detected in the US in December 2020 is now the prevalent circulating strain in the US, accounting for an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-proportions.html\">estimated 27.2% of all cases by mid-March</a>. Likewise, the P.1 variant first detected in travelers from Brazil in January is now wreaking havoc in Brazil, where it is causing a collapse of the health care system and led to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n879\">at least 60,000 deaths in the month of March</a>.</p><p>Second, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern can also lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations and deaths. In other words, they may have enhanced virulence. Indeed, a recent study in England suggests that the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03426-1\">B.1.1.7 variant causes more severe illness and mortality</a>.</p><p>Another concern is that these new variants can escape the immunity elicited by natural infection or our current vaccination efforts. For example, antibodies from people who recovered after infection or who have received a vaccine may not be able to bind as efficiently to a new variant virus, resulting in reduced neutralization of that variant virus. This could lead to reinfections and lower the effectiveness of current <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19\">monoclonal antibody treatments</a> and vaccines.</p><p>Researchers are intensely investigating whether there will be reduced vaccine efficacy against these variants. While most vaccines seem to remain effective against the UK variant, one recent study showed that <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214\">the AstraZeneca vaccine lacks efficacy in preventing mild to moderate COVID-19</a> due to the B.1.351 South African variant.</p><p>On the other hand, Pfizer recently announced data from a subset of volunteers in South Africa that supports <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious\">high efficacy of its mRNA vaccine against the B.1.351 variant</a>. Other encouraging news is that <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-T-Cells.aspx\">T-cell immune responses</a> elicited by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab143\">natural SARS-CoV-2 infection</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.27.433180\">mRNA vaccination</a> recognize all three UK, South Africa, and Brazil variants. This suggests that even with reduced neutralizing antibody activity, T-cell responses stimulated by vaccination or natural infection will provide a degree of protection against such variants.</p><h2>Stay vigilant, and get vaccinated</h2><p>What does this all mean? While current vaccines may not prevent mild symptomatic COVID-19 caused by these variants, they will likely prevent moderate and severe disease, and in particular hospitalizations and deaths. That is the good news.</p><p>However, it is imperative to assume that current SARS-CoV-2 variants will likely continue to evolve and adapt. In a recent survey of 77 epidemiologists from 28 countries, the majority believed that within a year current vaccines could need to be updated to better handle new variants, and that low vaccine coverage will <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/two-thirds-epidemiologists-warn-mutations-could-render-current-covid-vaccines\">likely facilitate the emergence of such variants</a>.</p><p>What do we need to do? We need to keep doing what we have been doing: using masks, avoiding poorly ventilated areas, and practicing social distancing techniques to slow transmission and avert further waves driven by these new variants. We also need to vaccinate as many people in as many places and as soon as possible to reduce the number of cases and the likelihood for the virus to generate new variants and escape mutants. And for that, it is vital that public health officials, governments, and nongovernmental organizations address vaccine hesitancy and equity both locally and globally.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.
