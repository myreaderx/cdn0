It started to grow and over time it became clear that it was going to be something important. A community flourished and there was a tremendous uptake for this little tool.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to present, starting soon I will be focused solely on Chocolatey as the Founder of Chocolatey Software, Inc*! It&#8217;s an exciting opportunity to really see where we can take this Windows software management thing!</p>\n<p>I also could not have had the opportunity to move forward without the support of a tremendous community, who has contributed to Chocolatey&#8217;s success in many ways. Your support does not go unnoticed &#8211; we will continue to make open source improvements, along with ensuring that organizations can take Chocolatey to the next level with <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/compare\">Chocolatey for Business</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-152\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/robreynolds/files/2017/01/logo_square_slogan_300.png\" alt=\"Chocolatey.IO - Software Management Automation\" width=\"378\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit bittersweet as I&#8217;ve had the opportunity work with a lot of fantastic folks at Puppet and do some really awesome things for furthering automation on Windows. In many ways Puppet has been an amazing place to work (I highly recommend it, they have the remote employee situation handled). However, an opportunity to follow my first love, Chocolatey, is a dream I won&#8217;t pass up.</p>\n<p>Not everyone gets the opportunity to follow their dreams, so when you get a chance it can be both a thrilling and scary experience!
