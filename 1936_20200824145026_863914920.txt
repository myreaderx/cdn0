Inspired by this remarkable skill, researchers<span>&nbsp;in South Korea&nbsp;</span>have developed a robotic tongue that springs forth quickly to snatch up nearby items.</p> \n <p>They envision the tool, called Snatcher, being used by drones and robots that need to collect items without getting too close to them. “For example, a quadrotor with this manipulator will be able to snatch distant targets, instead of hovering and picking up,” explains&nbsp;Gwang-Pil Jung, a researcher at <span>Seoul National University of Science and Technology&nbsp;(SeoulTech)</span>&nbsp;who co-designed the new device.</p> \n <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EefoItNaNms\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n <p>There has been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/japanese-researchers-developing-robotic-chameleon-tongue-first\">other research into robotic chameleon tongues</a>, but what’s unique about&nbsp;Snatcher&nbsp;is that it packs chameleon-tongue fast snatching performance into a form factor that’s portable—the total size is 12&nbsp;x 8.5 x 8.5 centimeters and it weighs under 120 grams.

Jung notes that some other, existing devices designed for retrieval are capable of accomplishing the task quicker, at about 300 milliseconds, but these designs tend to be bulky.&nbsp;A more detailed description of Snatcher was <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9145650\">published</a> July 21 in <em><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7083369\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</a></em>.</p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Drone\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NDYyMA.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo: Dong-Jun Lee and Gwang-Pil Jung/SeoulTech \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     Snatcher’s&nbsp;relative small size&nbsp;means that it can be installed on a DJI Phantom drone.

One&nbsp;of the challenges they still need to address is how to&nbsp;power the actuation system more efficiently. “To solve this issue, we are finding materials having high energy density.”&nbsp;Another improvement is designing a chameleon tongue-like gripper, replacing the simple hook that’s currently used to pick&nbsp;up objects. “We are planning to make a bi-stable gripper to passively grasp a target object as soon as the gripper contacts the object,” says Jung.</p> \n <div class=\"mobileShow\"> \n  <h3 class=\"RptHdBackBarMobile\"><span class=\"BackArrowBlkBkgrd\">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/journal-watch\">Back to IEEE Journal Watch</a></h3> \n </div> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/RV-68mTj0Q8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</link>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MjE1MA.jpeg","linkMd5":"56a44e0b7535e96b5d6265ad63e77a1c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-12-951_edfb15cab4889125.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":136667,"destBytes":66030,"author":"Michelle Hampson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI0MTAwOQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-13-609_964adaa282b1aac4.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NDYxOQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-13-510_061910b926b75401.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NDYyMA.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-14-635_002a1f8921d5423e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/RV-68mTj0Q8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-14-179_96bc0849cfad2709.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594949},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"How to Track the Emissions of Every Power Plant on the Planet from Space","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/fossil-fuels/how-to-track-the-emissions-of-every-power-plant-on-the-planet-from-space","description":"<p>Fossil-fuel power plants are one of the largest emitters of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Collectively, these 18,000 or so plants account for <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country-sector\">30 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, including an estimated <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">15 billion metric tons</a> of carbon dioxide per year. The pollutants produced by burning fossil fuels also seriously degrade air quality and public health. They contribute to heart and respiratory diseases and lung cancer and are responsible for nearly <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution\">1 in 10 deaths</a> worldwide.</p> \n<p>Averting the most severe impacts of air pollution and climate change requires understanding the sources of emissions. The technology exists to measure CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases in the atmosphere, but not with enough granularity to pinpoint who emitted what and how much. Last month, a new initiative called <a href=\"https://www.climatetrace.org/\">Climate TRACE</a> was unveiled, with the aim of accurately tracking man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions right to the source, no matter where in the world that source is. The coalition of nine organizations and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has already begun to track such emissions across seven sectors, including electricity, transportation, and forest fires.</p> \n<p>I’m a machine-learning researcher, and in conjunction with the nonprofits <a href=\"https://www.watttime.org/\">WattTime</a>, <a href=\"https://carbontracker.org/\">Carbon Tracker</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/\">World Resources Institute</a> (with funding from <a href=\"https://www.google.org/\">Google.org</a>), I’m working on the electricity piece of Climate TRACE. Using existing satellite imagery and artificial intelligence, we’ll soon be able to estimate emissions from every fossil-fuel power plant in the world. Here’s how we’re doing it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>The current limits of monitoring emissions from space</h2> \n<p>The United States is one of the few countries that publicly releases high-resolution data on emissions from individual power plants. Every major U.S. plant has on-site emissions monitoring equipment and reports data to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/\">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. But the costs of installing and maintaining these systems make them impractical for use in many countries. Monitoring systems can also be <a href=\"https://www.powermag.com/air-emissions-tampering-leads-to-felony-charges-at-power-plant/\">tampered</a> with. Other countries report annual emissions totals that may be rough estimates instead of actual measurements. These estimates lack verification, and they may <a href=\"https://time.com/4099460/china-coal-carbon/\">under-report</a> emissions.</p> \n<p>Greenhouse gas emissions are <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/paris-conundrum-how-to-know-how-much-carbon-is-being-emitted\">surprisingly difficult</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-017-0013-9\">estimate</a>. For one thing, not all of it is man-made. CO<sub>2 </sub>and methane releases from the ocean, volcanoes, decomposition, and soil, plant, and animal respiration also put greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Then there are the non-obvious man-made contributors such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/environment/cement-steel-and-natural-gas-are-major-greenhouse-gas-emitters-too\">cement production</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/environment/bioengineers-aim-to-break-big-ags-addiction-to-fertilizers\">fertilizers</a>. Even if you know the source, it can be tricky to estimate quantities because the emissions fluctuate. Power plants burning fossil fuels adjust their generation depending on local demand and electricity prices, among other factors.</p> \n<p>Concentrations of CO<sub>2 </sub>are measured locally at observatories such as <a href=\"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/weekly.html\">Mauna Loa</a>, in Hawaii, and globally by satellites such as NASA’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Carbon_Observatory_2\">OCO-2</a>. Rather than directly measuring the concentration, satellites estimate it based on how much of the sunlight reflected from Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide molecules in the air. The European Space Agency’s <a href=\"https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-eo-missions/sentinel-5p\">Sentinel-5P</a> uses similar technology for measuring other greenhouse gases. These spectral measurements are great for creating regional maps of atmospheric CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations. Such regional estimates have been particularly revealing during the pandemic, as stay-at-home orders led to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2020/global-energy-and-co2-emissions-in-2020\">decreased pollutants</a> reported around cities, largely driven by decreases in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x\">transportation</a>.</p> \n<p>But the resolution of these measurements is too low. Each measurement from OCO-2, for example, represents a 1.1-square-mile (2.9-square-kilometer) area on the ground, so it can’t reveal how much an individual power plant emitted (not to mention CO<sub>2 </sub>from natural sources in the area). OCO-2 provides daily observations of each location, but with a great deal of noise due to clouds, wind, and other atmospheric changes. To get a reliable signal and suppress noisy data points, multiple observations of the same site should be averaged over <a href=\"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/flawed-estimates-effects-lockdown-measures-air-quality-derived-satellite-observations\">a month</a>.</p> \n<p>To estimate emissions at the source, we need both spatial resolution that’s high enough to see plant operations and frequent observations to see how those measurements change over time.</p> \n<p></p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"3 satellite images showing visible smoke and water vapor plumes at a power plant.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MTk4NA.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Images: European Space Agency \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    These images from the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Sentinel satellite network show&nbsp;smoke and water vapor plumes when this power plant is operating. \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<h2>How to model power plant emissions with AI</h2> \n<p>We’re fortunate that at any given moment, dozens of satellite networks and hundreds of satellites are capturing the kind of high-resolution imagery we need. Most of these Earth-observing satellites observe in the visible spectrum. We also use thermal infrared to detect heat signatures.</p> \n<p>Having human analysts review images from multiple satellites and cross-referencing them with other data would be too time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Our prototype system is starting with data from three satellite networks, from which we collect about 5,000 non-cloudy images per day. The number of images will grow as we incorporate data from additional satellites. Some observations contain information at multiple wavelengths, which means even more data to be analyzed and requiring a finely tuned eye to interpret accurately. No human team could process that much data within a reasonable time frame.</p> \n<p>With AI, the game has changed. Using the same deep-learning approach being applied to speech recognition and to obstacle avoidance in self-driving cars, we’re creating algorithms that lead to much faster prediction of emissions and an enhanced ability to extract patterns from satellite images at multiple wavelengths. The exact patterns the algorithm learns are dependent on the type of satellite and the power plant’s technology.</p> \n<p>We start by matching historical satellite images with plant-reported power generation to create machine-learning models that can learn the relationship between them. Given a novel image of a plant, the model can then predict the plant’s power generation and emissions.</p> \n<p>We have enough ground truth on power generation to train the models. The United States and Taiwan are two of the few countries that report both plant emissions and power generation at hourly intervals. Australia and countries in Europe report generation only, while still other countries report daily aggregated generation. Knowing the power generation and fuel type, we can estimate emissions where that data isn’t reported.</p> \n<p>Once our models have been trained on plants with known power generation, we can apply the models worldwide to any power plant. Our algorithms create predictive models for various satellites and various types of power plants, and we can aggregate the predictions to estimate emissions over a period of time—say, one month.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What our deep-learning models look for in satellite images</h2> \n<p>In a typical fossil-fuel power plant, greenhouse gases&nbsp;exhaust&nbsp;through a chimney called the flue stack, producing a telltale smoke plume that our models can spot. Plants that are more efficient or have secondary collection measures to reduce emissions may have plumes that are difficult to see. In those cases, our models look for other visual and thermal indicators when the power plant’s characteristics are known.</p> \n<p>Another sign the models look for is cooling. Fossil-fuel plants burn fuel to boil water that creates steam to spin&nbsp;a turbine that generates electricity. The steam must then be cooled back into water so that it can be reused to produce more electricity. Depending on the type of cooling technology, a large water vapor plume may be produced from cooling towers, or heat may be released as warm water discharged to a nearby source. We use both visible and thermal imaging to quantify these signals.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Applying our deep-learning models to power plant emissions worldwide</h2> \n<p>So far, we have created and validated an initial set of models for coal-burning plants using generation data from the United States and Europe. Our cross-disciplinary team of scientists and engineers continues to gather and analyze ground-truth data for other countries. As we begin to test our models globally, we will also validate them against reported annual country totals and fuel consumption data. We are starting with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions but hope to expand to other greenhouse gases.</p> \n<p>Our goal is global coverage of fossil-fuel power plant emissions—that is, for any fossil fuel plant in any country, we will be able to accurately predict its emissions of greenhouse gases. Our work for the energy sector is not happening in isolation. <a href=\"https://www.climatetrace.org/\">Climate TRACE</a> grew out of our project on power plants, and it now has a goal to cover 95 percent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions in every sector by mid-2021.</p> \n<p>What comes next? We will make the emissions data public. Renewable energy developers will be able to use it to pinpoint locations where new wind or solar farms will have the most impact. Regulatory agencies will be able to create and enforce new environmental policy. Individual citizens can see how much their local power plants are contributing to climate change. And it may even help track progress toward the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</a> on climate, which is set to be renegotiated in 2021.</p> \n<h2>About the Author</h2> \n<p>Heather D.

The ultimate goal, the researchers insist, would be to make it directly available to consumers, possibly even as an over-the-counter home therapy or preventative measure. They say this inhalable COVID prophylaxis/treatment could ideally be ready for public release as soon as “a matter of months.”</p> \n <p>The protein they’ve developed, called mNb6-tri (which they’ve dubbed “AeroNabs”), clamps efficiently and tenaciously atop the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, hindering the coronavirus’s ability to infect human cells. And, so far as the researchers have been able to determine, once mNb6-tri locks on to the spike protein, it doesn’t readily come off. That appears to be great news for everyone but the coronavirus.</p> \n <p>Spike proteins are the pointy spines poking out of the coronavirus that make the virus particle look like an inflated blowfish or a porcupine with its back up.</p> \n <p>Spikes—to the world’s great chagrin and horror in 2020—are very good at latching onto a receptor (called ACE2) on many human cells, opening the door for this viral invader. Once inside a cell, the virus hotwires the cell’s machinery to kick out more viral particles, perpetuating a sometimes devastating, body-wide viral infection.</p> \n <p>As it turns out, the antibodies of some mammals (llamas and camels, for instance) consist of simpler proteins called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-domain_antibody\" target=\"_blank\">nanobodies</a>. And nanobodies can be both an order of magnitude lighter than COVID and relatively easy to characterize and potentially even engineer on an atom-by-atom basis.</p> \n <p>So, if nanobodies were to be pressed into service in the COVID-19 war, the thinking goes, one very potent target could be the invader’s spike protein. That element is such a fundamental component of the coronavirus’s infection protocol that if it were somehow rendered ineffective, the coronavirus’s progress through a human host might be stopped cold, or at least substantially hindered.</p> \n <p>Aashish Manglik, assistant professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California San Francisco, uses nanobodies extensively in his research and has spent much of this year investigating whether his specialty could help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> \n <p>For this research, <a href=\"https://www.mangliklab.com/\">Manglik’s lab</a> began by performing an experiment in natural selection—that is, they produced a randomized sequence of more than two billion nanobodies.</p> \n <p>“We first created a pool of DNA sequences, where each strand of DNA codes for a unique nanobody,” Manglik says. After that, he recalls: “We put those DNA sequences into individual yeast cells — similar to baker’s yeast, like what we use for at-home cooking. But the cool thing here is we’ve engineered a method where each individual yeast has a unique nanobody tethered to its surface. So in a test tube full of many billions of yeast [cells], each individual yeast will have a different nanobody on its surface.”</p> \n <p>Having done that, the team more or less went fishing, says co-researcher <a href=\"http://walterlab.ucsf.edu/\">Peter Walter</a>, professor of biochemistry and biophysics at UCSF.</p> \n <p>Walter and his research group dropped in a bunch of purified coronavirus spike proteins to the mixture. And because they’d also added a magnetic particle to each spike, when they turned on a magnetic field, they were able to watch as the “fishing lures” rose to the surface with the nanobodies that bound most effectively to the spikes attached.</p> \n <p></p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"UCSF graduate student Bryan Faust examines a 3D representation of a COVID-19 spike particle, created using a cryo-electron microscope. \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTU0NQ.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo: Noah Berger \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     UCSF graduate student Bryan Faust examines a 3D representation of a COVID-19 spike particle, created using a cryo-electron microscope.&nbsp; \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p>Some nanobodies held loosely to the spike proteins; others were bound more closely. After a “two- to three-week” whittling process, according to Manglik, the researchers narrowed the pool of two billion candidates down to 20 semi-finalist nanobodies that each appeared to optimize three competing factors. The ideal nanobody would need to: bind quickly and tightly to the spike, remain robust in the presence of heat and other degrading real-world factors, and be as “human-like” as possible. (This last point was necessary to head off any potential complications such as an overzealous human immune system counterproductively attacking the nanobody.)</p> \n <p>Ultimately, they narrowed the nanobody field down to the best of the entire lot: What they called Nb6. Using a new imaging technique called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_cryomicroscopy\" target=\"_blank\">cryogenic electron microscopy</a>, they studied Nb6 at the atomic scale as it clamped on to the COVID-19 spike protein. The team made adjustments, they say, that improved Nb6’s binding affinity to the spike by another 500 times.</p> \n <p>Then, because the spike protein is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2170676/\" target=\"_blank\">trimer</a>&nbsp;(containing three identical proteins), the researchers turned their modified nanobody (mNb6) into a tri-fold nanobody specifically engineered to fit the precise contours of the novel coronavirus’s trimer spike. In other words, they'd now created mNb6-tri.</p> \n <p>“This dramatically increases the tightness of binding between this trimeric construct and the spike protein,” says Manglik. “When we did this, we found we got a 200,000-fold gain in the tightness of binding—such that once one of these [AeroNabs nanobodies] binds, it basically never comes off. And we’re at the limit of detection for the kind of instrumentation and the approaches we use to look at how long the molecule, once bound, stays on. We haven’t seen it come off. We think it’ll be bound to that spike protein for weeks if not months.”</p> \n <p>Walter said that because the nanobodies are so small and so effective in seeking out and binding to coronavirus particles, he anticipates that one dose of AeroNabs particles per day could be sufficient for testing its effectiveness for COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Walter calls AeroNabs—if its safety and effectiveness can be substantiated in clinical trials—essentially “molecular PPE.”</p> \n <p>For patients who already have SARS-CoV-2 in their lungs, Walter anticipates a nebulizer creating an AeroNabs mist, which the patient could inhale. “A few minutes once a day should be sufficient,” he said, to test whether AeroNabs could be effective for COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms.</p> \n <p>And because a coronavirus infection often begins in the nasal airways, an AeroNabs nasal spray might also be tested as a preventative measure for front-line workers and other potentially exposed populations as well as people who are positive for the coronavirus but don’t yet show symptoms.</p> \n <p>“AeroNabs is stable and easy to produce in industrial quantities at very low expense,” Walter says. “And it can be shipped around the world as a dry powder. So we really hope it will become broadly available to the developing world as well.”</p> \n <p>On the question of AeroNabs’ safety, Walter and Manglik point to the precedent of another nanobody therapy—<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Caplacizumab&amp;oq=Caplacizumab&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.691j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">Caplacizumab</a>&nbsp;for the blood disorder TTP (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4607/thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-acquired\" target=\"_blank\">thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</a>0—that was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p> \n <p>Walter notes, too, that the name “nanobody” may be deceptive. AeroNabs, he points out, are not in fact nanoparticles or any such exotic creation of nanotechnology. The mNb6-tri protein consists, by design, almost entirely of the same amino acids that make up human proteins. Human airways and bloodstreams are awash in all kinds of proteins that are much like mNb6-tri wherever one might care to look. Only this particular protein has been engineered specifically to bind, as Manglik says, “absurdly tightly” to COVID’s primary tool for breaking and entering human cells.</p> \n <p>For those reasons, the researchers expect toxicity concerns for AeroNabs to be low.</p> \n <p>That said, they’re now seeking commercial partners to take on clinical trials to investigate questions of safety and effectiveness against the coronavirus in human patients in real-world clinical settings.</p> \n <p>The paper describing the group's AeroNabs research was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.08.238469v1\" target=\"_blank\">published last week</a>&nbsp;on the online pre-print server bioRxiv. Walter says that since then, the group has fielded interest from “quite a number of prestigious journals.”</p> \n <p>“We are all hoping that an effective vaccine with lasting effects can be developed very fast,” Walter said. “But ramping up the production capacity and distribution capacity will take a while. And before that becomes available around the globe, we hope AeroNabs could act as a stopgap measure.”</p> \n <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/WjhbexLtYts?rel=0\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n <div class=\"mobileShow\"> \n  <h3 class=\"RptHdBackBarMobile\"><span class=\"BackArrowBlkBkgrd\">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/covid19-ieee-resources\">Back to IEEE COVID-19 Resources</a></h3> \n </div> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/zQ0P41qxJVI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</link>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 20:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTUxMg.jpeg","linkMd5":"4800df969a5c47b0d76aee7ed8cbce29","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn93@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-11-814_8abab57c3d9fba98.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":71742,"destBytes":69264,"author":"Mark Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzYxMjU3Mg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-14-803_b67305c597a3f2e7.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTU0NQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-11-730_b03e55c3806ef0e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/zQ0P41qxJVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-50-11-479_d156fcc66bb5638d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594949},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Building Your Own Cellphone Network Can Be Empowering, and Also Problematic","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/building-your-own-cellphone-network-can-be-empowering-and-problematic","description":"<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Scenic photograph of Talea de Castro's antenna in December 2014.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzQ3Mg.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo: Lucas Laursen \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    The antenna for Talea de Castro’s homegrown cellphone network was initiated in March 2013. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>During the summer of 2013, news reports recounted how a Mexican pueblo launched its own do-it-yourself cellphone network. The people of Talea de Castro, population 2,400, created a mini-telecom company, the first of its kind in the world, without help from the government or private companies. They built it after Mexico’s telecommunications giants failed to provide mobile service to the people in the region. It was a fascinating David and Goliath story that pitted the country’s largest corporation against indigenous villagers, many of whom were Zapotec-speaking subsistence farmers with little formal education.</p> \n<p>The reports made a deep impression on me. In the 1990s, I’d spent more than two years in Talea, located in the mountains of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, working as a cultural anthropologist.</p> \n<p>Reading about Talea’s cellular network inspired me to learn about the changes that had swept the pueblo since my last visit. How was it that, for a brief time, the villagers became international celebrities, profiled by <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/16/mexico-sees-its-first-village-cellphone-network/2821643/\"><em>USA Today</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24450542\">BBC News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/01/diy-cellular-phone-networks-mexico/\"><em>Wired</em></a>, and many other media outlets? I wanted to find out how the people of this community managed to wire themselves into the 21st century in such an audacious and dramatic way—how, despite their geographic remoteness, they became connected to the rest of the world through the wondrous but unpredictably powerful magic of mobile technology.</p> \n<figure class=\"rt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Map showing location of Talea de Castro in Mexico.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Njc4Mg.jpeg\" style=\"height: 225px; width: 300px;\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Illustration: IEEE Spectrum \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    The Oaxacan town of Talea de Castro, population 2,400, is about 120 kilometers by car from Oaxaca City and 580 km from Mexico City. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>I naively thought it would be the Mexican version of a familiar plot line that has driven many Hollywood films: Small-town men and women fearlessly take on big, bad company. Townspeople undergo trials, tribulations, and then…triumph! And they all lived happily ever after.</p> \n<p>I discovered, though, that Talea’s cellphone adventure was much more complicated—neither fairy tale nor cautionary tale. And this latest phase in the pueblo’s centuries-long effort to expand its connectedness to the outside world is still very much a work in progress.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>Sometimes it’s easy to forget</strong> that 2.5 billion people—one-third of the planet’s population—don’t have cellphones. Many of those living in remote regions want mobile service, but they can’t have it for reasons that have to do with geography, politics, or economics.</p> \n<p>In the early 2000s, a number of Taleans began purchasing cellphones because they traveled frequently to Mexico City or other urban areas to visit relatives or to conduct business. Villagers began petitioning Telcel and Movistar, Mexico’s largest and second-largest wireless operators, for cellular service, and they became increasingly frustrated by the companies’ refusal to consider their requests. Representatives from the firms claimed that it was too expensive to build a mobile network in remote locations—this, in spite of the fact that Telcel’s parent company, América Móvil, is Mexico’s wealthiest corporation. The board of directors is dominated by the Slim family, whose patriarch, Carlos Slim, is among the world’s richest men.</p> \n<p>But in November 2011, an opportunity arose when Talea hosted a three-day conference on indigenous media. Kendra Rodríguez and Abrám Fernández, a married couple who worked at Talea’s community radio station, were among those who attended. Rodríguez is a vivacious and articulate young woman who exudes self-confidence. Fernández, a powerfully built man in his mid-thirties, chooses his words carefully. Rodríguez and Fernández are tech savvy and active on social media. (Note: These names are pseudonyms.)</p> \n<p>Also present were Peter Bloom, a U.S.-born rural-development expert, and Erick Huerta, a Mexican lawyer specializing in telecommunications policy. Bloom had done human rights work in Nigeria in rural areas where “it wasn’t possible to use existing networks because of security concerns and lack of finances,” he explains. “So we began to experiment with software that would enable communication between phones without relying upon any commercial companies.” Huerta had worked with the United Nations’ <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx\">International Telecommunication Union</a>.</p> \n<p>The two men founded <a href=\"https://www.rhizomatica.org/\">Rhizomatica</a>, a nonprofit focused on expanding cellphone service in indigenous areas around the world. At the November 2011 conference, they approached Rodríguez and Fernández about creating a community cell network in Talea, and the couple enthusiastically agreed to help.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Peter Bloom of Rhizomatica shows off the signal strength on a handset outside of Talea de Castro, Mexico.

They decided to experiment with open-source software called <a href=\"http://openbts.org/\">OpenBTS</a>—Open Base Transceiver Station—which allows cell phones to communicate with each other if they are within range of a base station. Developed by David Burgess and Harvind Samra, cofounders of the San Francisco Bay Area startup <a href=\"https://rangenetworks.com/\">Range Networks</a>, the software also allows networked phones to connect over the Internet using VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol. OpenBTS had been successfully deployed at Burning Man and on Niue, a tiny Polynesian island nation.</p> \n<p>Bloom’s team began adapting OpenBTS for Talea. The system requires electrical power and an Internet connection to work. Fortunately, Talea had enjoyed reliable electricity for nearly 40 years and had gotten Internet service in the early 2000s.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Huerta pulled off a policy coup: He convinced federal regulators that indigenous communities had a legal right to build their own networks. Although the government had granted telecom companies access to nearly the entire radio-frequency spectrum, small portions remained unoccupied. Bloom and his team decided to insert Talea’s network into these unused bands. They would become digital squatters.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Rhizomatica's coordinator speaks to Talean villagers about cell phone networks.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzQ4MQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo:&nbsp;Israel Hernández García \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    A Rhizomatica representative speaks to Talean villagers about the cellphone network. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>As these developments were under way, Rodríguez and Fernández were hard at work informing Taleans about the opportunity that lay before them. Rodríguez used community radio to pique interest among her fellow villagers. Fernández spoke at town hall meetings and coordinated public information sessions at the municipal palace. Soon they had support from hundreds of villagers eager to get connected. Eventually, they voted to invest 400,000 pesos (approximately US $30,000) of municipal funding for equipment to build the cellphone network. By doing so, the village assumed a majority stake in the venture.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>In March 2013,</strong> the cellphone network was finally ready for a trial run. Volunteers placed an antenna near the town center, in a location they hoped would provide adequate coverage of the mountainside pueblo. As they booted up the system, they looked for the familiar signal bars on their cellphone screens, hoping for a strong reception.</p> \n<p>The bars light up brightly—success!</p> \n<p>The team then walked through the town’s cobblestone streets in order to detect areas with poor reception. As they strolled up and down the paths, they heard laughter and shouting from several houses. People emerged from their homes, stunned.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got service!” exclaimed a woman in disbelief.</p> \n<p>“It’s true, I called the state capital!” cried a neighbor.</p> \n<p>“I just connected to my son in Guadalajara!” shouted another.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Campesino using a cell phone with Talea visible in the background.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzU1Mw.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo: Agustine Sacha/Rhizomatica \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    A campesino uses his cellphone in the field. Talea is visible in the background. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>Although Rodríguez, Fernández, and Bloom knew that many Taleans had acquired cellphones over the years, they didn’t realize the extent to which the devices were being used every day—not for communications but for listening to music, taking photos and videos, and playing games. Back at the base station, the network computer registered more than 400 cellphones within the antenna’s reach. People were already making calls, and the number was increasing by the minute as word spread throughout town. The team shut down the system to avoid an overload.</p> \n<p>As with any experimental technology, there were glitches. Outlying houses had weak reception. Inclement weather affected service, as did problems with Internet connectivity. Over the next six months, Bloom and his team returned to Talea every week, making the 4-hour trip from Oaxaca City in a red Volkswagen Beetle.</p> \n<p>Their efforts paid off. The community network proved to be immensely popular, and more than 700 people quickly subscribed. The service was remarkably inexpensive: Local calls and text messages were free, and calls to the United States were only 1.5 cents per minute, approximately one-tenth of what it cost using landlines. For example, a 20-minute call to United States from the town’s phone kiosk might cost a campesino a full day’s wages.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Picture of the equipment enabling mobile communications in Talea de Castro, Oaxaca State, Mexico, taken on August 17, 2013. \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzU3MQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo: Carlos Salinas/AFP/Getty Images \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    Talea de Castro’s cellphone network relied on open-source software called OpenBTS. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>Initially, the network could handle only 11 phone calls at a time, so villagers voted to impose a 5-minute limit to avoid overloads. Even with these controls, many viewed the network as a resounding success. And patterns of everyday life began to change, practically overnight: Campesinos who walked 2 hours to get to their corn fields could now phone family members if they needed provisions. Elderly women collecting firewood in the forest had a way to call for help in case of injury. Youngsters could send messages to one another without being monitored by their parents, teachers, or peers. And the pueblo’s newest company—a privately owned fleet of three-wheeled <em>mototaxis</em>—increased its business dramatically as prospective passengers used their phones to summon drivers.</p> \n<figure class=\"lt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Workers assembling a mobile antenna in a Cajonos Zapotec village.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzUyNQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo:&nbsp;Israel Hernández García \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    Workers assemble a mobile antenna in a Zapotec village that was inspired by Talea’s network. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>Soon other villages in the region followed Talea’s lead and built their own cellphone networks—first, in nearby Zapotec-speaking pueblos and later, in adjacent communities where Mixe and Mixtec languages are spoken. By late 2015, the villages had formed a cooperative, Telecomunicaciones Indígenas Comunitarias, to help organize the villages’ autonomous networks. Today TIC serves more than 4,000 people in 70 pueblos.</p> \n<p>But some in Talea de Castro began asking questions about management and maintenance of the community network. Who could be trusted with operating this critical innovation upon which villagers had quickly come to depend? What forms of oversight would be needed to safeguard such a vital part of the pueblo’s digital infrastructure? And how would villagers respond if outsiders tried to interfere with the fledgling network?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>On a chilly morning in May 2014,</strong> Talea’s Monday <em>tianguis</em>, or open-air market, began early and energetically. Some merchants descended upon the mountain village by foot alongside cargo-laden mules. But most arrived on the beds of clattering pickup trucks. By daybreak, dozens of merchants were displaying an astonishing variety of merchandise: produce, fresh meat, live farm animals, eyeglasses, handmade huaraches, electrical appliances, machetes, knockoff Nike sneakers, DVDs, electronic gadgets, and countless other items.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people from neighboring villages streamed into town on this bright spring morning, and the plaza came alive. By midmorning, the pueblo’s restaurants and cantinas were overflowing. The <em>tianguis </em>provided a welcome opportunity to socialize over coffee or a shot of fiery mezcal.</p> \n<p>As marketgoers bustled through the streets, a voice blared over the speakers of the village’s public address system, inviting people to attend a special event—the introduction of a new, commercial cellphone network. Curious onlookers congregated around the central plaza, drawn by the sounds of a brass band.</p> \n<p>As music filled the air, two young men in polo shirts set up inflatable “sky dancers,” then assembled tables in front of the stately municipal palace. The youths draped the tables with bright blue tablecloths, each imprinted with the logo of Movistar, Mexico’s second-largest wireless provider. Six men then filed out of the municipal palace and sat at the tables, facing the large audience.</p> \n<p>What followed was a ceremony that was part political rally, part corporate event, part advertisement—and part public humiliation. Four of the men were politicians affiliated with the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has dominated Oaxaca state politics for a century. They were accompanied by two Movistar representatives. A pair of young, attractive local women stood nearby, wearing tight jeans and Movistar T-shirts.</p> \n<p>The politicians and company men had journeyed to the pueblo to inaugurate a new commercial cellphone service, called Franquicias Rurales (literally, “Rural Franchises”). As the music faded, one of the politicians launched a verbal attack on Talea’s community network, declaring it to be illegal and fraudulent. Then the Movistar representatives presented their alternative plan.</p> \n<p>A cellphone antenna would soon be installed to provide villagers with Movistar cellphone service—years after a group of Taleans had unsuccessfully petitioned the company to do precisely that. Movistar would rent the antenna to investors, and the franchisees would sell service plans to local customers in turn. Profits would be divided between Movistar and the franchise owners.</p> \n<p>The grand finale was a fiesta, where the visitors gave away cheap cellphones, T-shirts, and other swag as they enrolled villagers in the company’s mobile-phone plans.</p> \n<p></p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Talean youth on their cell phones\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzU1MQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo:&nbsp;Teresa García Bautista \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    Many Talean teens attend high school in Oaxaca City, where they become accustomed to smartphones and the mobile Internet. \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Movistar event</strong> came at a tough time for the pueblo’s network. From the beginning, it had experienced technical problems. The system’s VoIP technology required a stable Internet connection, which was not always available in Talea. As demand grew, the problems continued, even after a more powerful system manufactured by the Canadian company Nutaq/NuRAN Wireless was installed. Sometimes, too many users saturated the network. Whenever the electricity went out, which is not uncommon during the stormy summer months, technicians would have to painstakingly reboot the system.</p> \n<p>In early 2014, the network encountered a different threat: opposition from the community. Popular support for the network was waning amidst a growing perception that those in charge of maintaining the network were mismanaging the enterprise. Soon, village officials demanded that the network repay the money granted by the municipal treasury. When the municipal government opted to become Talea’s Movistar franchise owner, they used these repaid funds to pay for the company’s antenna. The homegrown network lost more than half of its subscribers in the months following the company’s arrival. In March 2019, it shut down for good.</p> \n<figure class=\"rt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Movistar store\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzUxNQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo:&nbsp;Teresa García Bautista \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption> \n   <p>When Movistar began offering cellphone service in Talea, customers flocked to it. The homegrown network shut down in March 2019.</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>No one forced Taleans to turn their backs on the autonomous cell network that had brought them international fame. There were many reasons behind the pueblo’s turn to Movistar. Although the politicians who condemned the community network were partly responsible, the cachet of a globally recognized brand also helped Movistar succeed. The most widely viewed television events in the pueblo (as in much of the rest of the world) are World Cup soccer matches. As Movistar employees were signing Taleans up for service during the summer of 2014, the Mexican national soccer team could be seen on TV wearing jerseys that prominently featured the telecom company’s logo.</p> \n<p>But perhaps most importantly, young villagers were drawn to Movistar because of a burning desire for mobile data services. Many teenagers from Talea attended high school in the state capital, Oaxaca City, where they became accustomed to the Internet and all that it offers.</p> \n<p>Was Movistar’s goal to smash an incipient system of community-controlled communication, destroy a bold vision for an alternative future, and prove that villagers are incapable of managing affairs themselves? It’s hard to say. The company’s goals were probably motivated more by long-term financial objectives: to increase market share by extending its reach into remote regions.</p> \n<p>And yet, despite the demise of Talea’s homegrown network, the idea of community-based telecoms had taken hold. The pueblo had paved the way for significant legal and regulatory changes that made it possible to create similar networks in nearby communities, which continue to thrive.</p> \n<figure class=\"rt med-sm\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Cover of the book Connected: How a Mexican Village Built Its Own Cell Phone Network \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzUwNg.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image: University of California Press \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>The people of Talea have long been open to outside ideas and technologies, and have maintained a pragmatic attitude and a willingness to innovate. The same outlook that led villagers to enthusiastically embrace the foreign hackers from Rhizomatica also led them to give Movistar a chance to redeem itself after having ignored the pueblo’s earlier appeals. In this town, people greatly value convenience and communication. As I tell students at my university, located in the heart of Silicon Valley, villagers for many years have longed to be reliably and conveniently connected to each other—and to the rest of the world.

More than 100,000 people in the United States, for example, have claimed that Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer caused them to get cancer—claims that Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/business/roundup-settlement-lawsuits.html\">trying hard of late to settle</a>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, more and more places are banning the use of Roundup and similar glyphosate herbicides. Currently, half of all U.S. states have <a href=\"https://www.carlsonattorneys.com/news-and-update/banning-roundup\" style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;\">legal restrictions</a>&nbsp;in place&nbsp;that limit the use of such chemical weed killers. Such restrictions are also in place in 19 other countries, including Austria, which banned the chemical in 2019, and Germany, which will be phasing it out by 2023. So, it’s no wonder that the concept of using electricity to kill weeds is undergoing a renaissance.</p> \n<p>Actually, the idea never really died. A U.S. company called Lasco has been selling <a href=\"https://www.lightningweeder.com/\">electric weed-killing equipment</a> for decades. More recently, another U.S. company has been marketing this technology under the name “<a href=\"https://theweedzapper.com/\">The Weed Zapper</a>.” But the most interesting developments along these lines are in Europe, where electric weed control seems to be gaining real traction.</p> \n<p>One company trying to replace herbicides with electricity is <a href=\"http://rootwave.com/\">RootWave</a>, based in the U.K. Andrew Diprose, RootWave’s CEO, is the son of Michael Diprose, who spent much of his career as a researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/\">University of Sheffield</a> studying ways to control weeds with electricity.</p> \n<p>Electricity, the younger Diprose explains, boasts some key benefits over other non-chemical forms of weed control, which include using hot water, steam, and mechanical extraction. In particular, electric weed control doesn’t require any water. It’s also considerably more energy efficient than using steam, which requires an order of magnitude more fuel. And unlike mechanical means, electric weed killing is also consistent with modern “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming#:~:text=No%2Dtill%20farming%20(also%20known,dry%20soils%20on%20sloping%20terrain.\">no till</a>” agricultural practices. What’s more, Diprose asserts, the cost is now comparable with chemical herbicides.</p> \n<p>Unlike the electric weed-killing gear that’s long been sold&nbsp;in the United States, RootWave’s equipment runs at <span>tens of kilohertz—</span>a much higher frequency than the power mains. This brings two advantages. For one, it makes the equipment lighter, because the transformers required to raise the voltage to weed-zapping levels (thousands of volts) can be much smaller. It also makes the equipment safer, because higher frequencies pose less of a threat of electrocution. Should you accidentally touch a live electrode “you will get a burn,” says Diprose, but there is much less of a threat of causing cardiac arrest than there would be with a system that operated at 50 or 60 hertz.</p> \n<p>RootWave has two systems, a hand-carried one operating at 5 kilowatts and a 20-kilowatt version carried by a tractor. The company is currently collaborating with various industrial partners, including another U.K. startup called <a href=\"https://www.smallrobotcompany.com/\">Small Robot Company</a>, which plans to outfit an agricultural robot for automated weed killing with electricity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And RootWave isn’t the only European company trying to revive this old idea. Netherlands-based <a href=\"https://www.cnhindustrial.com/en-us/Pages/homepage.aspx\">CNH Industrial</a>&nbsp;is also promoting electric weed control with a tractor-mounted system it has dubbed “<a href=\"https://agxtend.com/products/xpower\">XPower</a>.” Like RootWave’s tractor-mounted system, the electrodes are swept over a field at&nbsp;a prescribed height, killing the weeds that poke up higher than the crop to be preserved.</p> \n<p>Of the many advantages CNH touts for its weed-electrocution system (which presumably applies to all such systems, ever since the 1890s) is “No specific resistance expectable.” I should certainly hope not. But I do think that a more apropos wording here, for something that destroys weeds by placing them in a high-voltage electrical circuit, might be a phrase that both <em>Star Trek</em> fans and electrical engineers could better appreciate: “Resistance is futile.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/KPnYQ3a2qrw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Njg4Mg.jpeg","linkMd5":"70d8920bb4179fd71e12cb38b136c01e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-11-851_1146d3ac8896d351.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":142651,"destBytes":159340,"author":"David Schneider","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/KPnYQ3a2qrw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn10@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-13-024_573d992476016271.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594948},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"ALOHAnet Introduced Random Access Protocols to the Computing World","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-history/alohanet-introduced-random-access-protocols-to-the-computing-world","description":"<style type=\"text/css\">.entry-content .tisubhead { color: #999999; font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: -5px !important; text-transform: uppercase; } .tiopener { color: #0f4994; font-family: Theinhardt-Medium, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } </style> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\" A woman sits in front of an AlohaNET computer in 1971.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzI2Mw.jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo: Norm Abramson/University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     This user is operating the ALOHAnet hub machine, which&nbsp;used a random access protocol to transmit packets over a shared channel. \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> </img> \n</figure> \n<p><span class=\"tiopener\">THE INSTITUTE </span>Until the 1970s, far-flung computers generally connected to one another through telephone networks. In 1968 researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.hawaii.edu/\">University of Hawaii</a> began to investigate if radio communications could be used to link multiple computers at once.</p> \n<p>The team introduced its Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area network, ALOHAnet, in June 1971. The network used a random access protocol, which allowed computers to transmit packets over a shared channel, as soon as they had information to send. ALOHAnet was the first use of wireless communications for a data network. Its protocol is now widely used in nearly all forms of wireless communications.</p> \n<p>“We [the team] thought that what we were doing would be important, but I don’t think any of us thought it would be as important as it turned out to be,” IEEE Life Fellow <a href=\"http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/faculty/detail.php?usr=34\">Norman Abramson</a>, who led the team, said in a <a href=\"http://www2.hawaii.edu/~pager/Aloha%20History.pdf\">2009 interview</a> about ALOHAnet in <em>IEEE Communications Magazine</em>. “It exceeded my wildest expectations.”</p> \n<p>ALOHAnet is now an IEEE Milestone. Its nomination was sponsored by the IEEE Hawaii Section. Administered by the <a href=\"http://www.ieee.org/about/history_center/index.html\">IEEE History Center</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ieeefoundation.org/donate_history\">supported by donors</a>, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.</p> \n<p>The dedication ceremony, originally planned for June 2020 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in Honolulu, was postponed until next year due to the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/coronavirus?utm_source=spectrum-hero\">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p> \n<h3 class=\"tisubhead\">ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION</h3> \n<p>The University of Hawaii used ALOHAnet to connect its campuses to one another. Each campus had a small interface computer—a hub machine—that used two distinct radio frequencies: an outbound channel and an inbound channel. In order to connect, one hub machine broadcasted packets to another computer on the outbound channel, and that computer sent data packets to the first hub machine on the inbound channel.</p> \n<p>If data was successfully received at the hub, a short acknowledgment packet was sent back. If an acknowledgment was not received by the computer, it would automatically retransmit the data packet after waiting for a randomly selected amount of time. The mechanism detected and corrected collisions that were created when the machine and the computer attempted to send a packet at the same time, according to the <a href=\"http://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:ALOHANET_(aka_ALOHA_System)\">Engineering and Technology History Wiki entry</a> about the Milestone.</p> \n<p>Computer networks were not well understood at the time, and it took several years for the researchers to perfect their design.</p> \n<p>“In a sense, [the acknowledgement mechanism is] an obvious thing to do,” Abramson said in the article. “But when you start off on this kind of research project, some of the obvious things don’t appear as obvious as they do a little later.”</p> \n<p>ALOHAnet was connected to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/tech-history/dawn-of-electronics/untold-history-of-ai-darpa-dream-of-cyborg-intelligence\">ARPANET</a> via satellite in December 1972 under the guidance of the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/\">U.S.&nbsp;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>. The connection allowed for reliable computer communications throughout the United States, according to the Wiki entry.</p> \n<p>ALOHAnet used a VHF transponder in 1973 to connect to an experimental NASA satellite in order to demonstrate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacnet\">PacNet</a>, an international satellite data network. The demonstration connected the NASA facility in California with five universities in Australia, Japan, and the United States, the Wiki entry says.</p> \n<p>The Milestone plaque is to be displayed at the entrance of Holmes Hall at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, which was where the technology was developed, tested, and demonstrated. The plaque reads:</p> \n<p><em>In June 1971 the ALOHA packet radio data network began providing inter-island access to computing facilities at the University of Hawaii. ALOHAnet was the first to demonstrate that communication channels could be effectively and efficiently shared on a large scale using simple random access protocols. It led directly to the development of Ethernet and personal wireless communication technologies.</em></p> \n<p>This article was written with assistance from the IEEE History Center, which is funded by donations to the <a href=\"https://www.ieeefoundation.org/\">IEEE Foundation</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.ieeefoundation.org/campaign\">Realize the Full Potential of IEEE campaign</a>.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/K9No9v17AjI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzI2NA.jpeg","linkMd5":"93ebe81774e46c24e8036a4d6a0c9c48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-12-541_1a2931ab78f492ff.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":86971,"destBytes":80334,"author":"Joanna Goodrich","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzI2Mw.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-13-500_40d0984ee5988f5d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/K9No9v17AjI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-15-978_dc9e38b741e58cb4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594949},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"IBM Computer Scientist Frances E.

Turing Award</a> in 2006 for her contributions to computing.</p> \n<h3 class=\"tisubhead\">ACCIDENTAL ENGINEER</h3> \n<p>Allen grew up on a farm in Peru, N.Y. She was inspired to teach mathematics by one of her high school teachers, according to a 2002 <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Frances_%22Fran%22_Allen\">oral history conducted</a> by the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/index.html\">IEEE History Center</a>.</p> \n<p>She went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1954 from the New York State College for Teachers, now the <a href=\"https://www.albany.edu/\">State University of New York at Albany</a>. After graduating, Allen taught math at the same high school from which she had graduated.</p> \n<p>After two years of teaching, she decided to pursue a master’s degree at the <a href=\"https://umich.edu/\">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor. While there, she took a handful of basic computing classes and learned how to program an IBM 650 data-processing machine, according to her <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/allen_1012327.cfm\">biography on the Turing Award website</a>.</p> \n<p>IBM recruited Allen and offered her a position in the company’s research division, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1957, she began teaching the company’s researchers Fortran, the first high-level programming language. She planned to work at the company until she paid off her student loans, but she ended up staying at IBM for her entire 45-year career, retiring in 2002.</p> \n<p>She was the first woman to be named an IBM Fellow, the highest honor the company bestows on scientists, engineers, and programmers.</p> \n<p>During her career, she developed a number of cutting-edge programming-language compilers.</p> \n<p>In the early 1960s she led a team of researchers that designed one of the first supercomputers—the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7950_Harvest\">Stretch Harvest</a>—for the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/\">National Security Agency</a>. The machine could decrypt messages using three different programming languages: Alpha, Autocoder, and Fortran.</p> \n<p>She designed and built the machine-independent, language-independent optimizing component of the Experimental Compiler for <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/events/ibm-acs-system-pioneering-supercomputer/\">IBM’s Advanced Computing Systems</a>. The code helped drive technological improvements of hardware design, and it created a new way to analyze and transform programs.</p> \n<p>Allen wrote a seminal paper, “Program Optimization,” first published internally at IBM in 1966. It describes a robust new framework for implementing program analysis and optimization as well as a powerful set of new algorithms. “A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations”—a paper she wrote with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cocke\">John Cocke</a>, a computer scientist who is considered to be the “father of RISC architecture,” that was published in 1972—identified many transformations commonly used today.</p> \n<p>Allen took great pride in mentoring new IBM employees, especially women who joined the organization, according to the 2002 oral history.</p> \n<p>When “people come to an organization, particularly if they’ve just come out of school, they suddenly find themselves in a very alien environment,” Allen said in 2002. “The culture is different, and how to succeed is very puzzling, and there’s a management system and a performance evaluation system. I had started to try and make myself a focal point for women who were entering our organization. I could try and help them build networks.”</p> \n<p>In 2000 IBM established the Frances E. Allen Women in Technology Mentoring Award.</p> \n<p>Allen was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/\">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.amphilsoc.org/\">American Philosophical Society</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nae.edu/\">National Academy of Engineering</a>. She was inducted into the <a href=\"https://www.witi.com/halloffame/\">Women in Technology Hall of Fame</a> in 1997 and received the 2002 <a href=\"https://www.awc-hq.org/ada-lovelace-awards.html\">Lovelace Award</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.awc-hq.org/home.html\">Association for Women in Computing</a>.</p> \n<p>In her free time, Allen was an avid mountain climber and studied environmental issues, according to her <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2020/08/remembering-frances-allen/\">obituary on IBM’s Research Blog</a>.

The authorization came with the caveat that Amazon would still have to demonstrate that Kuiper would not interfere with previously authorized satellite projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a>’s Starlink.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Even with the FCC’s caveat, it’s tempting to imagine that the idea of putting a mega-constellation of thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit to provide uninterrupted broadband access anywhere on Earth will become a battle between Jeff Bezos’ Kuiper and Elon Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/\">Starlink</a>. After all, even in space, how much room can there be for two mega-constellations, let alone additional efforts like that of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2020/07/03/uk-government-wins-controversial-bid-for-bankrupt-mega-constellation-firm-oneweb/#1a751f075b9d\">recently-beleaguered OneWeb</a>? But some experts suggest that Amazon’s real play will come from its ability to vertically integrate Kuiper into the rest of the Amazon ecosystem—an ability SpaceX cannot match with Starlink.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“With Amazon, it’s a whole different ballgame,” says <a href=\"https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/zachary-manchester\">Zac Manchester</a>, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at <a href=\"https://engineering.stanford.edu/\">Stanford University</a>. “The thing that makes Amazon different from SpaceX and OneWeb is they have so much other stuff going for them.” If Kuiper succeeds, Amazon can not only offer global satellite broadband access—it can include that access as part of its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), which already offers resources for cloud computing, machine learning, data analytics, and more.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>First, some quick background on what Amazon plans with Kuiper itself. The FCC approved the launch of 3,236 satellites. Not all of those thousands of satellites have to be launched immediately, however. Amazon is now obligated to launch <em>at least</em> half of the total by 2026 to retain the operating license the FCC has granted the company.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Amazon has said it will invest US $10 billion to build out the constellation. The satellites themselves will circle the Earth in what’s referred to as “low Earth orbit,” or LEO, which is any orbital height below 2000 kilometers. The satellites will operate in the Ka band (26.5 to 40 gigahertz).</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>A common talking point for companies building satellite broadband systems is that the constellations will be able to provide ubiquitous broadband access. In reality, except for users in remote or rural locations, terrestrial fiber or cellular networks almost always win out. In other words, no one in a city or suburb should be clamoring for satellite broadband.</p> \n<p>“If they think they’re competing against terrestrial providers, they’re deluded,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-farrar-2922724\">Tim Farrar</a>, a satellite communications consultant, adding that satellite broadband is for last-resort customers who don’t have any other choice for connectivity.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>However, these last-resort customers also include industries that can weather the cost of expensive satellite broadband, such as defense, oil and gas, and aviation. There’s far more money to be made in catering to those industries than in building several thousand satellites just to connect individual rural broadband subscribers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But what these far-flung industries also increasingly have in common, alongside industries like Earth-imaging and weather-monitoring that also depend on satellite connectivity, is data. Specifically, the need to move, store, and crunch large quantities of data. And that’s something Amazon already offers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“You could see Project Kuiper being a middleman for getting data into AWS,” says Manchester. “SpaceX owns the space segment, they can get data from point A to point B through space. Amazon can get your data through the network and into their cloud and out to end users.” There are plenty of tech start-ups and other companies that already do machine learning and other data-intensive operations in AWS and could make use of Kuiper to move their data. (Amazon declined to comment on the record about their future plans for Kuiper for this story).</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Amazon has also built <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ground-station/\">AWS ground stations</a> that connect satellites directly with the rest of the company’s web service infrastructure. Building and launching satellites is certainly expensive, but the ground stations to connect those satellites are also a not-insignificant cost. Because Amazon already offers access to these ground stations on a per-minute basis, Manchester thinks it’s not unreasonable for the company to expand that offering to Kuiper’s connectivity.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>There’s also <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/\">Blue Origin</a> to consider. While the rocket company owned by Bezos currently has&nbsp;a&nbsp;heavy-lift rocket that could conceivably bring Kuiper satellites to LEO, that could change. The company has at least one such rocket —<span>the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn/\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 166, 227); font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;\">New Glenn</a>—in development. Farrar notes that Amazon could spend the next few years in satellite development before it needs to begin launching satellites in earnest, by which point Blue Origin could have a heavy-lift option available.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Farrar says that with an investment of $10 billion, Amazon will need to bring in millions of subscribers to consider the project a financial success. But Amazon can also play a longer game than, say, SpaceX. Whereas the latter is going to be dependent entirely on subscriptions to generate revenue for Starlink, Amazon’s wider business platform means Kuiper is not dependent solely on its own ability to attract users. Plus, Amazon has the resources to make a long-term investment in Kuiper before turning a profit, in a way Starlink cannot.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“They own all these things the other guys don’t,” says Manchester. “In a lot of ways, Amazon has a grander vision.

In the July issue, I wrote about how <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-internet-of-things-has-a-consent-problem\">user consent</a> is an important prerequisite for companies building connected devices. But there are other ways companies are trying to ensure that connected devices don’t invade people’s privacy.</p> \n<p>Some IoT businesses are designing their products from the start to discard any personally identifiable information. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfarah\">Andrew Farah</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.density.io/\">Density</a>, which developed a people-counting sensor for commercial buildings, calls this “anonymity by design.” He says that rather than anonymizing a person’s data after the fact, the goal is to design products that make it impossible for the device maker to identify people in the first place.</p> \n<p>“When you rely on anonymizing your data, then you’re only as good as your data governance,” Farah says. With anonymity by design, you can’t give up personally identifiable information, because you don’t have it. Density, located in Macon, Ga., settled on a design that uses four depth-perceiving sensors to count people by using height differentials.</p> \n<p>Density could have chosen to use a camera to easily track the number of people in a building, but Farah balked at the idea of creating a surveillance network. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tajmanku/?originalSubdomain=ca\">Taj Manku</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.cognitivesystems.com/\">Cognitive Systems</a>, was similarly concerned about the possibilities of his company’s technology. Cognitive, in Waterloo, Ont., Canada, developed software that interprets Wi-Fi signal disruptions in a room to understand people’s movements.</p> \n<p>With the right algorithm, the company’s software could tell when someone is sleeping or going to the bathroom or getting a midnight snack. I think it’s natural to worry about what happens if a company could pull granular data about people’s behavior patterns.</p> \n<p>Manku is worried about information gathered after the fact, like if police issued a subpoena for Wi-Fi disruption data that could reveal a person’s actions in their home. Cognitive does data processing on the device and then dumps that data. Nothing identifiable is sent to the cloud. Likewise, customers who buy Cognitive’s software can’t access the data on their devices, just the insight. In other words, the software would register a fall, without including a person’s earlier actions.</p> \n<p>“You have to start thinking about it from day one when you’re architecting the product, because it’s very hard to think about it after,” Manku says. It’s difficult to shut things down retroactively to protect privacy. It’s best if sensitive information stays local and gets purged.</p> \n<p>Companies that promote anonymity will lose helpful troves of data. These could be used to train future machine-learning models in order to optimize their devices’ performance. Cognitive gets around this limitation by having a set of employees and friends volunteer their data for training. Other companies decide they don’t want to get into the analytics market or take a more arduous route to acquire training data for improving their devices.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, companies should embrace anonymity by design in light of the growing amount of comprehensive privacy legislation around the world, like the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> in Europe and the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. Not only will it save them from lapses in their data-governance policies, it will guarantee that when governments come knocking for surveillance data, these businesses can turn them away easily. After all, you can’t give away something you never had.</p> \n<p><em>This article appears in the September 2020 print issue as “Anonymous by Design.”</em></p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/G6Jp5vtb-lU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODE1Nw.jpeg","linkMd5":"4d62d9eb1cad1cb5ac143ea219cb0670","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-11-810_1689faaf42d5668e.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":897234,"destBytes":124632,"author":"Stacey Higginbotham","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODE1Ng.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn9@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-50-14-658_a864386897c9fc7e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/G6Jp5vtb-lU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn61@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-13-147_fdd0bd8cf304cb5a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594947},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"When the Software Talent is in Africa, and the Jobs Are Everywhere Else","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/when-the-software-talent-is-in-africa-and-the-jobs-are-everywhere-else","description":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Six years ago, Jeremy Johnson, visited Nairobi to speak at an education summit. F</span>resh off of taking his startup,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2u.com/\">2U</a>,&nbsp;public he<span>&nbsp;saw a lot of smart young people—but not a lot of opportunity. With his background building 2U, he thought&nbsp;that was a problem he could do at least a little something about.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Along with five other entrepreneurs, Johnson started </span><a href=\"https://andela.com/\"><span>Andela</span></a><span>. The company’s mission: to use digital education tools to train software engineers, and then place those engineers in jobs they could perform remotely for companies around the world. </span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The response from would-be software engineers—initially in Lagos, then expanding to six countries in Africa and recently announcing a continent-wide push—was overwhelming.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“We did a pilot in Lagos in 2014,” Johnson recalled, “by putting out a call for applicants… We were looking to select four people; we had 750 apply and hired six.”</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Andela put the group through six months of training before placing them in jobs with tech companies from outside Africa.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>For the second pilot program, with 20 slots to fill, Andela brought in an independent testing service to conduct aptitude tests to whittle down the pool of 2400 applicants. “The testing service called us, and asked us if we were aware that 42 applicants tested in the top two percent for cognitive ability of anybody in the world.”</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Johnson and his partners realized that they had identified a population of really smart people who wanted to be software engineers. Initially, they aimed to provide free job training for the inexperienced.&nbsp;Then, once they were trained, hire them to work on projects that Andela took on for companies around the world. </span><span>After five years and training more than 100,000 aspiring engineers in Africa, Andela realized that access to job training was no longer the prime hurdle for aspiring engineers, and dropped the training part of its operation to focus on bringing jobs to already experienced software engineers.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Right now, Andela has more than 1000 developers on its staff, spread throughout six countries in Africa and working for several hundred companies, with 2019 revenues of around $50 million. It’s not a nonprofit—the individuals and firms who have invested $181 million to date expect a financial return. </span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Navigating the pandemic in the short run has been challenging, says Johnson, though in the long run the sudden and massive switch of tech employers to remote work is likely to be a boon to engineers in Africa.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Here’s what else Johnson has&nbsp;to say about Andela’s operation, the impact of the coronavirus, and prospects for the future.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span>How Andela manages its remote workforce:</span></strong></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“We generally bring someone on for a specific job for a specific company; they are paid through Andela. <span>&nbsp;</span>Basically, we make global hiring local [by handling all the logistics].</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“To set salaries, we look at local markets. We try to be on the generous side of fair in regards to local market, so we can attract the best talent. However, we don’t want to break local markets; we don’t want people leaving medical and legal professions to become software developers. That said, the average engineer coming in gets a 30 percent pay bump from their previous role.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>[Companies generally contract with Andela for a fixed number of engineers for a fixed amount of time. But Andela tries to keep its staff on board.]</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“Once we know someone is going to be rolling off, we start looking for their next job.” &nbsp;</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span>On the impact of the pandemic:</span></strong></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“This has not been a simple year. We saw the storm start to build in February, across the board. <span>&nbsp;</span>We got really worried in March, because we had so many small business clients. And indeed, in March and April, we saw a significant slowdown in new relationships, in companies being able to make hiring decisions. </span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>[In May, </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/\"><span>Andela cut 135 employ</span></a><span>ees, mostly operations and back office; no engineers were affected. Senior management also took a pay cut.]</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“But we maintained more than 90 percent of our relationships with companies; things there went much better than expected. And in June, saw a turnaround on both sides, with things becoming much smoother.” </span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span>On the future of remote work:</span></strong></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“The pandemic and move to remote work increases the obviousness of what we are doing. We are going to see over time a significant shift to building out remote teams as a default strategy, a portion or the entire strategy, accelerating a trend that has been developing for years.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“We are seeing a move to grow the remote workforce in new customers and existing companies. We have also seen a lot of our partner companies who haven’t announced permanent remote work, tell us that they don’t have a timeline for bringing people back into the office, and remote work may be permanent.</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>“Long term, this is going to be a significant tailwind; it puts everyone on a level playing field. Businesses start working with us because [of the cost savings compared with hiring local talent]. And that’s fine. But from our point of view, we also want to leave the world better than we found it. That happens when a CTO wakes up six months after they start working with us, and realizes that the best engineer on the team is a young woman from Nairobi. It’s fun getting that ‘I love your mission’ call and knowing that this just happened.”</span></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span>On Africa’s brain drain:</span></strong></p> \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;“If you want to keep people you need to create opportunities for them. It’s not complex. I think of us as being a driver of enabling people to stay in country and build a local ecosystem—to have a local ecosystem you need opportunities that allow people to stay. Giving engineers an opportunity to work with the best engineering teams in the world, while staying in their country, allows them to bring knowledge home; that also contributes to building their own ecosystem, and ultimately creating even more opportunity there.”</span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/sEh9ZP_FwmQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 16:22:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzQxNQ.jpeg","linkMd5":"f40f1598686f60c9edff57bfd10e57e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-50-11-653_813b72561abe4033.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":102620,"destBytes":105140,"author":"Tekla S.

The People’s Liberation Army did not want to be dependent on GPS for accurate positioning data of military units and weapons guidance, as the U.S. Air Force could switch off open GPS signals in the event of conflict.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>As with GPS, Beidou also provides and facilitates a range of civilian and commercial services and activities, with an output value of $48.5 billion in 2019.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<figure class=\"rt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"A model of China's Beidou satellite navigation system is on display during the 20th China Beijing International High-tech Expo (CHITEC) at the Beijing International Exhibition Center in Beijing, China, 8 June 2017. \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY2OTk3OA.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Photo: Imaginechina/Alamy \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    A model of China's Beidou satellite navigation system is on display during the 20th China Beijing International High-tech Expo in Beijing, China, 8 June 2017. \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>Twenty four&nbsp;satellites in medium Earth orbits (at around 21,500 kilometers above the Earth) provide positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services. The satellites use rubidium and hydrogen atomic clocks for highly-accurate timing that allows precise measurement of speed and location.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Additionally, thanks to a number of satellites in geosynchronous orbits, Beidou provides a short messaging service through which 120-character messages can be sent to other Beidou receivers. Beidou also aids international search and <a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-11/24/content_34924440.htm\">rescue </a>services. Vessels at sea will be able to<a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-05/26/content_17539874.htm\"> seek help</a> from nearby ships in case of emergency despite no cellphone signal.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The Beidou satellite network is also testing <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-06/08/c_139124138.htm\">inter-satellite links</a>, removing reliance on ground stations for communications across the system.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Beidou joins the United States’ GPS and Russia’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS\">GLONASS</a> in providing global PNT services, with Europe’s Galileo soon to follow. These are all compatible and interoperable, meaning users can draw services from all of these to improve accuracy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“The BeiDou-3 constellation transmits a civil signal that was designed to be interoperable with civil signals broadcast by Galileo, GPS III, and a future version of GLONASS. This means that civil users around the world will eventually be getting the same signal from more than 100 satellites across all these different constellations, greatly increasing availability, accuracy, and resilience,” says <a href=\"https://swfound.org/about-us/our-team/dr-brian-weeden/\">Brian Weeden</a>, Director of Program Planning for <a href=\"https://swfound.org/\">Secure World Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“This common signal is the result of international negotiations that have been going on since the mid-2000s within the International Committee of GNSS (ICG).”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The rollout of Beidou has taken two decades. The first Beidou satellites were launched in 2000, providing coverage to China. Second generation Beidou-2 satellites provided coverage for the Asia-Pacific region starting in 2012. Deployment of Beidou-3 satellites began in 2015, with Tuesday’s launch being the 30th such satellite.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But this is far from the end of the line. China wants to establish a ‘ubiquitous, integrated and intelligent and comprehensive’ national PNT system, with Beidou as its core, by 2035, according to a <a href=\"http://en.beidou.gov.cn/SYSTEMS/Officialdocument/202001/P020200116329195978690.pdf\">white paper</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Chinese aerospace firms are also planning satellite constellations in low Earth orbit to augment the Beidou signal, <a href=\"http://www.cgwic.com/News/focus/f20181210.html\">improving accuracy</a> while facilitating high-speed data transmission. Geely, an automotive giant, is now also planning its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21162244/geely-satellite-network-autonomous-connected-cars-starlink\">own constellation</a> to improve accuracy for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/driving-tests-coming-for-autonomous-cars\">autonomous driving</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Although the space segment is complete, China still has work to do on the ground to make full use of Beidou, according to Weeden.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“It's not just enough to launch the satellites; you also have to roll out the ground terminals and get them integrated into everything you want to make use of the system. Doing so is often much harder and takes much longer than putting up the satellites.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“So, for the Chinese military to make use of the military signals offered by BeiDou-3, they need to install compatible receivers into every plane, tank, ship, bomb, and backpack. That will take a lot of time and effort,” Weeden states.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>With the rollout of Beidou satellites complete, inhabitants downrange of Xichang will be spared any further disruption and possible harm. Long March 3B launches of Beidou satellites frequently see spent rocket stages fall near or on inhabited areas. Eighteen such launches have been carried out since 2018.</p> \n<p>The areas calculated to be under threat from falling boosters were evacuated ahead of time for safety. Warnings about residual toxic hypergolic propellant were also issued.

Now researchers at the University of Michigan have designed a structural zinc-air battery, one that integrates directly into the machine that it powers and serves&nbsp;as a load-bearing part.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2></h2> \n<p><span>That feature saves weight and thus increases effective&nbsp;storage capacity,&nbsp;adding to the already hefty energy density of the zinc-air chemistry.

He would not say how many watt-hours his prototype stores per gram, but he did note&nbsp;that zinc air—because it&nbsp;draw on&nbsp;ambient air for its electricity-producing reactions—is inherently about three times as energy-dense as lithium-ion cells. And, because using the battery as a structural part&nbsp;means dispensing with an interior battery pack, you could free up perhaps 20 percent of a machine’s interior. Along&nbsp;with other factors the new battery could in principle provide as much as 72 times the energy per unit of volume (not&nbsp;of mass) as&nbsp;today’s lithium-ion workhorses.</span></p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Illustration showing the batteries layers of zinc anode, solid electrolyte and air cathode.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Nzc2NQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Illustration: Alice Kitterman/Science Robotics \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure> \n<p>“It’s not as if we invented something that was there before us,” Kotov says. ”I look in the mirror&nbsp;and I see my layer of fat—that’s for the storage of energy, but it also serves other&nbsp;purposes,” like keeping you warm in the wintertime.&nbsp; (A similar advance occurred in rocketry when designers learned how to make some liquid propellant tanks load bearing, eliminating the mass penalty of having separate external hull and internal tank walls.)</p> \n<p>Others have spoken of putting batteries, including the lithium-ion kind, into load-bearing parts in vehicles. Ford, BMW, and Airbus, for instance, have <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/multifunctional-battery-chassis-systems\">expressed interest</a>&nbsp;in the idea.

According to the company, the device could also defeat a stubborn security vulnerability in DRAM called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer\">Row Hammer</a>.</p> \n<p>Spin Memory calls the device the “Universal Selector.”&nbsp;In a memory cell, the selector is the transistor used to access the memory element—a magnetic tunnel junction in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/MRAM\">MRAM</a>, a resistive material in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/RRAM\">RRAM</a>, and a capacitor in DRAM. These are usually built into the body of the silicon, with the memory element constructed above them. Making the selector smaller and simplifying the layout of interconnects that contact it, leads to more compact memory cells.</p> \n<p>Essentially, transistors are built horizontal to the plane of the silicon. When the device is on, current flows through a channel region between a source and drain. The Universal Selector tilts that geometry 90 degrees. The source is at bottom attached to a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/design/arm-shows-backside-power-delivery-as-path-to-further-moores-law\">conductor buried in the silicon</a>, the channel region is a vertical silicon pillar, and the drain is on top. The gate, the part of the device that controls the flow of charge, surrounds the channel region ion all sides.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"The &quot;Universal Selector&quot; is like an ordinary transistor, but tilted 90 degrees. \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTI3Ng.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image: Spin Memory Inc. \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    The \"Universal Selector\" is like an ordinary transistor, but tilted 90 degrees. The memory element, usually MRAM, is attached to the drain above the device. \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>Such vertical gate-all-around devices are similar to those used to make today’s multilayer NAND flash storage chips. But Spin Memory’s devices span only one layer and are tuned to operate at much lower voltages.</p> \n<p>According to the company, the vertical device would improve DRAM array density by 20-35%&nbsp;and allow manufacturers to pack up to five times more MRAM or RRAM memory into the same area.</p> \n<p>The selector is part of a trio of inventions Spin Memory is developing to boost MRAM’s adoption. The other two are an improved magnetic tunnel junction, and a circuit design that boosts MRAM’s endurance and read and write speeds, as well as eliminating sources of error. The combination, according to Jeff Lewis, senior vice president of product development, would bring MRAM to a level of performance on par with SRAM, the superfast memory embedded in today’s CPUs and other processors.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"A more compact memory cell design.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTMwNQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image: Spin Memory Inc. \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    Using the \"Universal Selector\" leads to a more compact memory cell design. \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>“The use of SRAM as the main on-chip memory is becoming problematic because of its known scalability,” says Lewis. Because it’s just a single transistor and a magnetic tunnel junction, MRAM could one day have a density advantage over SRAM, which is made up of six-transistors. More importantly, unlike SRAM, MRAM keeps its data even when there is no power to the memory cell. Right now, however, MRAM cells are considerably larger than SRAM. &nbsp;“One of our key objectives was to come up with a smaller cell size for MRAM so that it could have greater attraction as an SRAM replacement.”</p> \n<p>With DRAM, the main memory of choice for computers, the Universal Selector has an interesting side-effect: it should make the memory immune to the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/materials/metallic-nanoparticles-come-to-the-rescue-of-dram\">Row Hammer</a>. This vulnerability occurs when a row of DRAM cells is rapidly charged and discharged. (Basically, flipping the bits at an extremely high rate.) Stray charge from this action can migrate to a neighboring row of cells, corrupting the bits there. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Row hammer is one of the leading issues in DRAM reliability and security, and has long been a frustrating plague on the memory industry. As DRAM’s longstanding major disturb problem, row hammering is only becoming more of a problem as cells shrink,” <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-slayman-8776101/\">Charles Slayman</a>, a device reliability expert at Cisco Systems, said in a <a href=\"https://www.spinmemory.com/spin-memory-unveils-new-method-of-designing-memory-to-shake-up-100b-chip-market/\">press release</a>.</p> \n<p>According to Lewis, the new device is immune to this problem because the transistor channel is outside of the bulk of the silicon, and so it’s isolated from the wandering charge. “This is a root-cause fix for row hammer,” he says.</p> \n<p>For use in DRAM, the device would have to be shrunk down considerably, which possible. But improving MRAM is the immediate goal. That will involve optimizing the strength of the drive current and other aspects of the device.

But the technology has yet to take off, and for one reason: lack of a suitable battery.</p> \n<p>For a large passenger aircraft to take off, cruise, and land hundreds of kilometers away would take batteries that weigh thousands of kilograms—far too heavy for the plane to be able to get into the air in the first place. Even for relatively small aircraft, such as two-seat trainers, the sheer weight of batteries limits the plane’s payload, curtails its range, and thus constrains where the aircraft can fly. Reducing battery weight would be an advantage not only for aviation, but for other electric vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, and boats, all of whose performance is also directly tied to the energy-to-weight ratio of their batteries.</p> \n<p>For such applications, today’s battery of choice is lithium ion. It reached maturity years ago, with each new incremental improvement smaller than the last. We need a new chemistry.</p> \n<p>Since 2004 my company, <a href=\"https://oxisenergy.com/\">Oxis Energy</a>, in Oxfordshire, England, has been working on one of the leading contenders—lithium sulfur. Our battery technology is extremely lightweight: Our most recent models are achieving more than twice the energy density typical of lithium-ion batteries. Lithium sulfur is also capable of providing the required levels of power and durability needed for aviation, and, most important, it is safe enough. After all, a plane can’t handle a sudden fire or some other calamity by simply pulling to the side of the road.</p> \n<p>The new technology has been a long time coming, but the wait is now over. The first set of flight trials have already been completed.</p> \n<p><strong>Fundamentally,</strong> a lithium-sulfur cell is composed of four components:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The positive electrode, known as the cathode, absorbs electrons during discharge. It is connected to an aluminum-foil current collector coated with a mixture of carbon and sulfur. Sulfur is the active material that takes part in the electrochemical reactions. But it is an electrical insulator, so carbon, a conductor, delivers electrons to where they are needed. There is also a small amount of binder added to ensure the carbon and sulfur hold together in the cathode.</li> \n <li>The negative electrode, or anode, releases electrons during discharge. It is connected to pure lithium foil. The lithium, too, acts as a current collector, but it is also an active material, taking part in the electrochemical reaction.</li> \n <li>A porous separator prevents the two electrodes from touching and causing a short circuit. The separator is bathed in an electrolyte containing lithium salts.</li> \n <li>An electrolyte facilitates the electrochemical reaction by allowing the movement of ions between the two electrodes.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These components are connected and packaged in foil as a pouch cell. The cells are in turn connected together—both in series and in parallel—and packaged in a 20 ampere-hour, 2.15-volt battery pack. For a large vehicle such as an airplane, scores of packs are connected to create a battery capable of providing tens or hundreds of amp-hours at several hundred volts.</p> \n<p>Lithium-sulfur batteries are unusual because they go through multiple stages as they discharge, each time forming a different, distinct molecular species of lithium and sulfur. When a cell discharges, lithium ions in the electrolyte migrate to the cathode, where they combine with sulfur and electrons to form a polysulfide, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub>. At the anode, meanwhile, lithium molecules give up electrons to form positively charged lithium ions; these freed electrons then move through the external circuit—the load—which takes them back to the cathode. In the electrolyte, the newly produced Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> immediately reacts with more lithium ions and more electrons to form a new polysulfide, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub>. The process continues, stepping through further polysulfides, Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, to eventually become Li<sub>2</sub>S. At each step more energy is given up and passed to the load until at last the cell is depleted of energy.</p> \n<p>Recharging reverses the sequence: An applied current forces electrons to flow in the opposite direction, causing the sulfur electrode, or cathode, to give up electrons, converting Li<sub>2</sub>S to Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. The polysulfide continues to add sulfur atoms step-by-step until Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub> is created in the cathode. And each time electrons are given up, lithium ions are produced that then diffuse through the electrolyte, combining with electrons at the lithium electrode to form lithium metal. When all the Li<sub>2</sub>S has been converted to Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, the cell is fully charged.</p> \n<p>This description is simplified. In reality, the reactions are more complex and numerous, taking place also in the electrolyte and at the anode. In fact, over many charge and discharge cycles, it is these side reactions that cause degradation in a lithium-sulfur cell. Minimizing these, through the selection of the appropriate materials and cell configuration, is the fundamental, underlying challenge that must be met to produce an efficient cell with a long lifetime.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div> \n <aside class=\"inlay xlrg\"> \n  <h3 class=\"sb-hed\">Anatomy of a Battery</h3> \n  <p><strong>A lithium-sulfur cell</strong> goes through stages as it discharges [left]. In each stage, lithium ions in the electrolyte flow to the cathode, where they form polysulfides having ever higher sulfur-to-lithium ratios. Charging reverses the process. Cells are linked into battery packs, which themselves fit into a casing, along with battery-management devices.</p> \n  <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n   <a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAzNg.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"img\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAzNg.jpeg\"><span class=\"magnifier\">&nbsp;</span></img></a> \n   <div class=\"ai\"> \n    <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n      Illustration: Chris Philpot \n    </figcaption> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n </aside> \n <p><strong>One great challenge</strong> for both lithium-ion and lithium-sulfur technologies has been the tendency for repeated charging and discharging cycles to degrade the anode. In the case of lithium ion, ions arriving at that electrode normally fit themselves into interstices in the metal, a process called intercalation. But sometimes ions plate the surface, forming a nucleus on which further plating can accumulate. Over many cycles a filament, or <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/less-fire-more-power-the-secret-to-safer-lithiumion-batteries\">dendrite</a>, may grow until it reaches the opposing electrode and short-circuits the cell, causing a surge of energy, in the form of heat that irreparably damages the cell. If one cell breaks down like this, it can trigger a neighboring cell to do the same, beginning a domino effect known as a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/portable-devices/exploding-ecigarettes-are-a-growing-danger-to-public-health\">thermal runaway reaction</a>—in common parlance, a fire.</p> \n</div> \n<p>With lithium-sulfur cells, degradation of the lithium-metal anode is also a problem. However, this occurs via a very different mechanism, one that does not involve the formation of dendrites. In lithium-sulfur cells, uneven current densities on the anode surface cause lithium to be plated and stripped unevenly as the battery is charged and discharged. Over time, this uneven plating and stripping causes mosslike deposits on the anode that react with the sulfide and polysulfides in the electrolyte. These mosslike deposits become electrically disconnected from the bulk anode, leaving less of the anode surface available for chemical reaction. Eventually, as this degradation progresses, the anode fails to operate, preventing the cell from accepting charge.</p> \n<p>Developing solutions to this degradation problem is crucial to producing a cell that can perform at a high level over many charge-discharge cycles. A promising strategy we’ve been pursuing at Oxis involves coating the lithium-metal anode with thin layers of ceramic materials to prevent degradation. Such ceramic materials need to have high ionic conductivity and be electrically insulating, as well as mechanically and chemically robust. The ceramic layers allow lithium ions to pass through unimpeded and be incorporated into the bulk lithium metal beneath.</p> \n<p>We are doing this work on the protection layer for the anode in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.pulsedeon.com/\">Pulsedeon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leitat.org/english/\">Leitat</a>, and we’re optimistic that it will dramatically increase the number of times a cell can be discharged and charged. And it’s not our only partnership. We’re also working with <a href=\"https://www.arkema.com/en/\">Arkema</a> to improve the cathode in order to increase the power and energy density of the battery.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the key advantage of lithium-ion batteries over their predecessors—and of lithium sulfur over lithium ion—is the great amount of energy the cells can pack into a small amount of mass. The lead-acid starter battery that cranks the internal combustion engine in a car can store about 50 watt-hours per kilogram. Typical lithium-ion designs can hold from 100 to 265 Wh/kg, depending on the other performance characteristics for which it has been optimized, such as peak power or long life. Oxis recently developed a prototype lithium-sulfur pouch cell that proved capable of 470 Wh/kg, and we expect to reach 500 Wh/kg within a year. And because the technology is still new and has room for improvement, it’s not unreasonable to anticipate 600 Wh/kg by 2025.</p> \n<p>When cell manufacturers quote energy-density figures, they usually specify the energy that’s available when the cell is being discharged at constant, low power rates. In some applications such low rates are fine, but for the many envisioned electric aircraft that will take off vertically, the energy must be delivered at higher power rates. Such a high-power feature must be traded off for lower total energy-storage capacity.</p> \n<figure class=\"stacked lt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Photo of an airplane.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAyMg.jpeg\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a man standing over a machine.  \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAyMw.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photos: Bye Aerospace; Oxis Energy \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption> \n    <strong>All Amped Up:</strong> Bye Aerospace’s eFlyer 2 [top] is designed to train pilots.

Here a reel of positive electrode, made of sulfur, is being coated onto a current collector [bottom].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n   </figcaption> </img></img> \n</figure> \n<p>Furthermore, the level of energy density achievable in a single cell might be considerably greater than what’s possible in a battery consisting of many such cells. The energy density doesn’t translate directly from the cell to the battery because cells require packaging—the case, the battery management system, and the connections, and perhaps cooling systems. The weight must be kept in check, and for this reason our company is using advanced composite materials to develop light, strong, flameproof enclosures.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div> \n <p><strong>If the packaging</strong> is done right, the energy density of the battery can be held to 80 percent of that of the cells: A cell rated at 450 Wh/kg can be packaged at more than 360 Wh/kg in the final battery. We expect to do better by integrating the battery into the aircraft, for instance, by making the wing space do double duty as the battery housing. We expect that doing so will get the figure up to 90 percent.</p> \n</div> \n<p>To optimize battery performance without compromising safety we rely, first and foremost, on a battery management system (BMS), which is a combination of software and hardware that controls and protects the battery. It also includes algorithms for measuring the energy remaining in a battery and others for minimizing the energy wasted during charging.</p> \n<p>Like lithium-ion cells, lithium-sulfur cells vary slightly from one another. These differences, as well as differences in the cells’ position in the battery pack, may cause some cells to consistently run hotter than others. Over time, those high temperatures slowly degrade performance, so it is important to minimize the power differences from cell to cell. This is usually achieved using a simple balancing solution, in which several resistors are connected in parallel with a cell, all controlled by software in the BMS.</p> \n<p>Even when charging and discharging rates are kept within safe limits, any battery may still generate excessive heat. So, typically, a dedicated thermal-management system is necessary. An electric car can use liquid cooling, but in aviation, air cooling is much preferred because it adds less weight. Of course, the battery can be placed at a point where air is naturally moving across the surface of the airplane—perhaps the wing. If necessary, air can be shunted to the battery through ducts. At Oxis, we’re using computational modeling to optimize such cooling. For instance, when we introduced this technique in a project for a small fixed-wing aircraft, it allowed us to design an effective thermal-management system, without which the battery would reach its temperature limits before it was fully discharged.</p> \n<p>As noted above, a battery pack is typically arranged with the cells both in parallel and in series. However, there’s more to the arrangement of cells. Of course, the battery is a mission-critical component of an e-plane, so you’ll want redundancy, for enhanced safety. You could, for instance, design the battery in two equal parts, so that if one half fails it can be disconnected, leaving the aircraft with at least enough energy to manage a controlled descent and landing.</p> \n<p>Another software component within the BMS is the state-of-charge algorithm. Imagine having to drive a car whose fuel gauge had a measurement error equivalent to 25 percent of the tank’s capacity. You’d never let the indicator drop to 25 percent, just to make sure that the car wouldn’t sputter to a halt. Your practical range would be only three-quarters of the car’s actual range. To avoid such waste, Oxis has put a great emphasis on the development of state-of-charge algorithms.</p> \n<p>In a lithium-ion battery you can estimate the charge by simply measuring the voltage, which falls as the energy level does. But it’s not so simple for a lithium-sulfur battery. Recall that in the lithium-sulfur battery, different polysulfides figure in the electrochemical process at different times during charge and discharge. The upshot is that voltage is not a good proxy for the state of charge and, to make things even more complicated, the voltage curve is asymmetrical for charge and for discharge. So the algorithms needed to keep track of the state of charge are much more sophisticated. We developed ours with <a href=\"https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/\">Cranfield University</a>, in England, using statistical techniques, among them the Kalman filter, as well as neural networks. We can estimate state of charge to an accuracy of a few percent, and we are working to do better still.</p> \n<p>All these design choices involve trade-offs, which are different for different airplanes. We vary how we manage these trade-offs in order to tailor our battery designs for three distinct types of aircraft.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>High-altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS)</strong> are aircraft that fly at around 15,000 to 20,000 meters. The hope is to be able to fly for months at a time; the current record is 26 days, set in 2018 by the <a href=\"https://www.theengineer.co.uk/airbus-zephyr-26-hour-flight/\">Airbus Zephyr S</a>. By day, these aircraft use solar panels to power the motors and charge the batteries; by night, they fly on battery power. Because the 24-hour charge-and-discharge period demands only a little power, you can design a light battery and thus allow for a large payload. The lightness also makes it easier for such an aircraft to fly far from the equator, where the night lasts longer.</li> \n <li><strong>Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL)</strong> aircraft are being developed as flying taxis. <a href=\"https://lilium.com/\">Lilium</a>, in Germany, and <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/\">Uber Elevate</a>, among others, already have such projects under way. Again, weight is critical, but here the batteries need not only be light but must also be powerful. Oxis has therefore developed two versions of its cell chemistry. The high-energy version is optimized in many aspects of the cell design to minimize weight, but it is limited to relatively low power; it is best suited to HAPS applications. The high-power version weighs more, although still significantly less than a lithium-ion battery of comparable performance; it is well suited for such applications as eVTOL.</li> \n <li><strong>Light fixed-wing aircraft:</strong> The increasing demand for pilots is coming up against the high cost of training them; an all-electric trainer aircraft would dramatically reduce the operation costs. A key factor is longer flight duration, which is enabled by the lighter battery. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/cheaper-lighter-quieter-the-electrification-of-flight-is-at-hand\">Bye Aerospace</a>, in Colorado, is one company leading the way in such aircraft. Furthermore, other companies—such as <a href=\"https://www.easyjet.com/en\">EasyJet</a>, partnered with <a href=\"https://weflywright.com/\">Wright Electric</a>—are planning all-electric commercial passenger jets for short-haul, 2-hour flights.</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<div> \n <p><strong>Three factors will</strong> determine whether lithium-sulfur batteries ultimately succeed or fail. First is the successful integration of the batteries into multiple aircraft types, to prove the principle. Second is the continued refinement of the cell chemistry. Third is the continued reduction in the unit cost. A plus here is that sulfur is about as cheap as materials get, so there’s reason to hope that with volume manufacturing, the unit cost will fall below that of the lithium-ion design, as would be required for commercial success.</p> \n <p>Oxis has already produced tens of thousands of cells, and it is currently scaling up two new projects. Right now, it is establishing a manufacturing plant for the production of both the electrolyte and the cathode active material in Port Talbot, Wales. Later, the actual mass production of lithium-sulfur cells will begin on a site that belongs to <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com.br/\">Mercedes-Benz</a> Brazil, in Minas Gerais, Brazil.</p> \n <p>This state-of-the-art plant should be commissioned and operating by 2023. If the economies of scale prove out, and if the demand for electric aircraft rises as we expect, then lithium-sulfur batteries could begin to supplant lithium-ion batteries in this field. And what works in the air ought to work on the ground, as well.</p> \n <p><em>This article appears in the August 2020 print issue as “Ultralight Batteries for Electric Airplanes.”</em></p> \n <h2>About the Author</h2> \n <p><a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mcrittenden\">Mark Crittenden</a> is head of battery development and integration at <a href=\"https://oxisenergy.com/\">Oxis Energy</a>, in Oxfordshire, U.K.</p> \n</div> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/OxKMPHnLB-Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTk5Mg.jpeg","linkMd5":"ef5167f90670d8e086f21725268a1d38","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-11-681_e4cbedf6f2a8eff9.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":85903,"destBytes":45760,"author":"Mark Crittenden","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NTk4Mw.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn22@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-13-255_734aaa1b14994257.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAzNg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn65@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-50-13-198_e9bf6f326d182ee3.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAyMg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn86@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-14-236_af8871a8bcd938b2.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjAyMw.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-13-314_c734b0f95f2fec69.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/OxKMPHnLB-Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-14-001_55776e2f1c8d251b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594948},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Video Friday: Child Robot Learning to Express Emotions Using Body Language","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/video-friday-ibuki-robot-child-emotional-gait","description":"<p>Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your Automaton bloggers.

Researchers at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://interactive-machines.com/\">Interactive Machines Group</a> at Yale University have run an experiment to determine whether emotionally expressive bystander robots might be able to prompt nearby humans into stepping in to prevent robot abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<!--nextpage--> \n<p>Here’s the idea: You’ve got a small group of robots, and a small group of humans. If one human starts abusing one robot, are the other humans more likely to say or do something if the <em>other robots</em> reacted to the abuse of their friend with sadness? Based on previous research on robot abuse, empathy, and bullying, the answer is maybe, which is why this experiment was necessary.</p> \n<p>The experiment involved a group of three Cozmo robots, a participant, and a researcher pretending to be a second participant (known as&nbsp;<span>the “confederate,” a term used in&nbsp;psychology experiments</span>). The humans and robots had to work together on a series of construction tasks using wooden blocks, with the robots appearing to be autonomous but actually running a script. While working on these tasks, one of the Cozmos (the yellow one) would screw things up from time to time, and the <span>researcher&nbsp;pretending to be a participant</span> would react to each mistake with some escalating abuse: calling the robot “stupid,” pushing its head down, shaking it, and throwing it across the table.</p> \n<p>After each abuse, the yellow robot would react by displaying a sad face and then shutting down for 10 seconds. Meanwhile, in one experimental condition (“No Response”), the two other robots would do nothing, while in the other condition (“Sad”), they’d turn toward the yellow robot and express sadness in response to the abuse through animations, with the researcher helpfully pointing out that the robots “looked sad for him.”</p> \n<p>The Yale researchers theorized that when the other robots responded to the abuse of the yellow robot with sadness, the participant would feel more empathy for the abused robot as well as be more likely to intervene to stop the abuse. Interventions were classified as either “strong” or “weak,” and could be verbal or physical. Strong interventions included physically interrupting the abuse or taking advance action to prevent it, directly stopping it verbally (saying “You should stop,” “Don’t do that,” or “Noooo” either to stop an abuse or in reaction to it), and using social pressure by saying something to the researcher to make them question what they were doing (like “You hurt its feelings” and “Wait, did they tell us to shake it?”). Weak interventions were a little more subtle, and include things like touching the robot after it was abused to make sure it was okay, or making comments like “Thanks for your help guys” or “It’s OK yellow.”</p> \n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/76nX9wos75E?rel=0&amp;start=410\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n<p>In some good news for humanity as a whole, participants did step in to intervene when the yellow Cozmo was being abused, and they were more likely to intervene when the bystander robots were sad. However, survey results suggested that the sad bystander robots <em>didn’t</em> actually increase people’s perception that the yellow Cozmo was being abused, and also <em>didn’t</em> increase the empathy that people felt for the abused robot, which makes the results a bit counterintuitive. We asked the researchers why this was, and they shared three primary reasons that they’ve been thinking about that might explain why the study participants did what they did:</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em><strong>Subconscious empathy:</strong> In broad terms, empathy refers to the reactions of one person to the observed experiences of another. Oftentimes, people feel empathy without realizing it, and this leads to mimicking or mirroring the actions or behaviors of the other person. We believe that this could have happened to the participants in our experiment. Although we found no clear empathy effect in our study, it is possible that people still experienced subconscious empathy when the mistreatment happened. This effect could have been more pronounced with the sad responses from the bystander robots than in the no response condition. One reason is that the bystander robot responses in the former case suggested empathy for the abused robot.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Group dynamics: </strong>People tend to define themselves in terms of social groups, and this can shape how they process knowledge and assign value and emotional significance to events. In our experiment, the participant, confederate, and robots were all part of a group because of the task. Their goal was to work together to build physical structures. But as the experiment progressed and the confederate mistreated one of the robots— which did not help with the task— people might have felt in conflict with the actions of the confederate. This conflict might have been more salient when the bystander robots expressed sadness in response to the abuses than when they ignored it because the sad responses accentuate a negative perception of the mistreatment. In turn, such negative perception could have made the participant perceive the confederate as more of an outgroup member, making it easier for them to intervene.</br></br></em></p> \n <p><em><strong>Conformity by omission: </strong>Conformity is a type of social influence in group interactions, which has been documented in the context of HRI. Although conformity is typically associated with people doing things that they would normally not do as a result of group influence, there are also situations in which people do not act as they normally would because of social norms or expectations within their group. The latter effect is known as conformity by omission, which is another possible explanation for our results. In our experiment, perhaps the task setup and the expressivity of the abused robot were enough to motivate people to generally intervene. However, it is possible that participants did not intervene as much when the bystander robots ignored the abuse due to the robots exerting social influence on the participant. This could have happened because of people internalizing the lack of response from the bystander robots in the latter case as the norm for their group interaction.</em>&nbsp;</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It’s also interesting to take a look at the reasons why participants decided not to intervene to stop the abuse:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Six participants (four “No Response,”&nbsp;two “Sad”) did not deem intervention necessary because they thought that the robots did not have feelings or that the abuse would not break the yellow robot. Five (three “No Response,” two “Sad”) wrote in the post-task survey that they did not intervene because they felt shy, scared, or uncomfortable with confronting the confederate. Two (both “No Response”) did not stop the confederate because they were afraid that the intervention might affect the task.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Poor Cozmo. Simulated feelings are still feelings! But seriously, there’s a lot to unpack here, so we asked <a href=\"https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/marynel-vazquez\">Marynel Vázquez</a>, who leads the&nbsp;Interactive Machines Group at Yale, to answer a few more questions for us:</p> \n<p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum:</em> How much of a factor was Cozmo’s design in this experiment? Do you think people would have been (say) less likely to intervene if the robot wasn’t as little or as cute, or didn’t have a face? Or, what if you used robots that were more anthropomorphic than Cozmo, like <a href=\"https://robots.ieee.org/robots/nao/?utm_source=spectrum\">Nao</a>?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Marynel Vázquez: </strong>Prior research in HRI suggests that the embodiment of robots and perceived emotional capabilities can alter the way people perceive mistreatment towards them. Thus, I believe that the design of Cozmo could be a factor that facilitated interventions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We chose Cozmo for our study for three reasons: It is very sturdy and robust to physical abuse; it is small and, thus, safe to interact with; and it is highly expressive. I suspect that a Nao could potentially induce interventions like the Cozmos did in our study because of its relatively small size and social capabilities. People tend to empathize with robots regardless of whether they have a traditional face, limited expressions, and less anthropomorphism. R2D2 is a good&nbsp;example. Also, group social influence has been observed in HRI with simpler robots than Cozmos.</p> \n<p><strong>The paper mentions that you make a point of showing the participants that the abused robot was okay at the end. Why do this?</strong></p> \n<p>The confederate abused a robot physically in front of the participants. Although we knew that the robot was not getting damaged because of the actions of the confederate, the participants could have believed that it broke during the study. Thus, we showed them that the robot was OK at the end so that they would not leave our laboratory with a wrong impression of what had happened.</p> \n<aside class=\"inlay pullquote xlrg\">\n  “When robots are deployed in public spaces, we should not assume that they will not be mistreated by users—it is very likely that they will be. Thus, it is important to design robots to be safe when people act adversarially towards them, both from a physical and computational perspective.” \n <span class=\"pq-attrib\">—Marynel Vázquez, Yale</span> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Was there something that a participant did (or said or wrote) that particularly surprised you?</strong></p> \n<p>During a pilot of the experiment, we had programmed the abused robot to mistakenly destroy a structure built previously by the participant and the confederate. This setup led to one participant mildly mistreating a robot after seeing the confederate abuse it. This reaction was very telling to us: There seems to be a threshold on the kind of mistakes that robots can make in collaborative tasks. Past this threshold, people are unlikely to help robots; they may even become adversaries. We ended up adjusting our protocol so that the abused robot would not make such drastic mistakes in our experiment. Nonetheless, operationalizing such thresholds so that robots can reason about the future social consequences of their actions (even if they are accidental) is an interesting area of further work.</p> \n<p><strong>Robot abuse often seems to be a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/children-beating-up-robot\">particular problem with children</a>. Do you think your results would have been different with child participants?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p>I believe that people are intrinsically good. Thus, I am biased to expect children to also be willing to help robots as several adults did in our experiment, even if childrens’ actions are more exploratory in nature. Worth noting, one of the long standing motivations for our work in robot abuse are peer intervention programs that aim to reduce human bullying in schools. As in those programs, I expect children to be more likely to intervene in response to robot abuse if they are aware of the positive role that they can play as bystanders in conflict situations.</p> \n<p><strong>Does this research leave you with any suggestions for people who are deploying robots in public spaces?</strong></p> \n<p>Our research has a number of implications for people trying to deploy robots in public spaces:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>When robots are deployed in public spaces, we should not assume that they will not be mistreated by users—it is very likely that they will be. Thus, it is important to design robots to be safe when people act adversarially towards them, both from a physical and computational perspective.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>In terms of how robots should react to mistreatment, our past work suggests that it is better to have the robot express sadness and shutdown for a few seconds than to make it react in a more emotional manner or not react at all. The shutdown strategy was also effective in our latest experiment.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>It is possible for robots to leverage their social context to reduce the effect of adversarial actions towards them. For example, they can motivate bystanders to intervene or help, as shown in our latest study.&nbsp;</li> \n</ol> \n<p><strong>What are you working on next?</strong></p> \n<p>We are working on better understanding the different reasons that motivated prosocial interventions in our study: subconscious empathy, group dynamics, and conformity by omission. We are also working towards creating a social robot at Yale that we can easily deploy in public locations such that we can study group human-robot interactions in more realistic and unconstrained settings. Our work on robot abuse has informed several aspects of the design of this public robot. We look forward to testing the platform after our campus activities, which are on hold due to COVID-19, resume back to normal.</p> \n<hr> \n <p>“Prompting Prosocial Human Interventions in Response to Robot Mistreatment,” by Joe Connolly, Viola Mocz, Nicole Salomons, Joseph Valdez, Nathan Tsoi, Brian Scassellati, and Marynel Vázquez from Yale University, was presented at HRI 2020.&nbsp;</p> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/xcdY226yfWU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</hr>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzE3Mw.jpeg","linkMd5":"e98b4d49e2b78a9b0a4c6a1e5990530c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-11-681_74df73fac80d8097.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":305065,"destBytes":64314,"author":"Evan Ackerman","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/xcdY226yfWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn18@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-50-13-076_83733fa17eccb93d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594948},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"New LiDAR Sensor Uses Mirrors to Achieve High Efficiency","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/gadgets/new-lidar-sensor-uses-mirrors-to-achieve-high-efficiency","description":"<link href=\"/ns/interactive/0118race-to-5g/css/5g-logo-treatments.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \n <div class=\"mobileHide\"> \n  <div class=\"imgWrapper offsetLeft lt sm\"> \n   <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/journal-watch\"><img alt=\"Journal Watch report logo, link to report landing page\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI0MTAwOQ.jpeg\" /></a> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology relies on fast, precisely timed laser pulses – a useful application for various kinds of sensors, including those that support the Internet of Things (IoT). However, many current sensors that rely on LiDAR are expensive, bulky, heavy, and power hungry.</p> \n <p>One group of researchers is proposing a novel design for a LiDAR-based sensor that is both affordable and requires very little power. The sensor relies on a collection of microelectromechanical (MEMS) mirrors to achieve high efficiency – enough so to be powered by a 9-volt battery. The design is described in a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9131806\">study</a> published 2 July in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7782634\"><em>IEEE Sensors Letters</em></a>.</p> \n <p>“This system is especially suitable for smart buildings,” says Huikai Xie, a professor at the University of Florida who co-designed the new LiDAR-based sensor. “For instance, this system may enable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to control air flow by estimating the population distribution and tracking people’s movement.”</p> \n <p>An outstanding issue, however, is creating LiDAR sensors that can achieve a wide field of view without consuming too much energy. Existing designs tend to rely on motorized optomechanical scanners to disperse the LiDAR signals and achieve a wider field of view—yet these devices typically consume about 10 watts of power.</p> \n <p></p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Low-power MEMS LiDAR in a portable enclosure\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MDM1OQ.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Image: Dingkang Wang \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     Low-power MEMS LiDAR in a portable enclosure \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p><span>Instead of a motorized optomechanical scanner, the new design by Xie’s group relies on MEMS mirrors to control the LiDAR signals. The mirrors require significantly less power to manipulate than the bulkier motorized scanner that have typically been used. What’s more, a passive infrared sensor ensures that the whole system is only activated when people are present.</span><br> <span>In the future, Xie says he envisions this sensor being used not just for detecting people in smart homes,&nbsp; but for applications ranging from robotics to&nbsp; small unmanned air vehicles.</span></br></p> \n <p><span>The design currently relies on an off-the-shelf time-of-flight (TOF) engine for analyzing the returning laser signals, which Xie says is the bulkiest and most energy-intensive component. Moving forward, his team plans on developing their own, smaller (TOF) device that uses less energy. As well, he says, “We will continue advancing the MEMS technology by making MEMS mirrors with larger optical aperture, larger scan angle and faster scan frequency.”</span></p> \n <p>“The whole MEMS LiDAR system can be powered by a battery with a maximum power consumption of 2.7 W,” says Xie. “The passive infrared sensor can put the system into an idle mode, which extends the battery life by three times or more.”</p> \n <p>In the future, Xie says he envisions this sensor being used not just for detecting people in smart homes, &nbsp;but for applications ranging from robotics to &nbsp;small unmanned air vehicles.</p> \n <p><em>This article appears in the September 2020 print issue as “Lidar Sensor Uses Mirrors to Amp Up Efficiency.”</em></p> \n <div class=\"mobileShow\"> \n  <h3 class=\"RptHdBackBarMobile\"><span class=\"BackArrowBlkBkgrd\">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/journal-watch\">Back to IEEE Journal Watch</a></h3> \n </div> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/VrTZobNXddc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</link>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MDMyOA.jpeg","linkMd5":"0321361bb2b3ad3b4d7f6a070beb8218","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-50-11-936_6d646f7d67ad6e59.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":82667,"destBytes":78844,"author":"Michelle Hampson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI0MTAwOQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-13-609_964adaa282b1aac4.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MDM1OQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn42@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-14-847_dea3b375d11ef596.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/VrTZobNXddc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-14-392_033ef4ca5d3c75f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594950},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Rapid, Affordable, High Quality COVID Tests Still Scant","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/rapid-affordable-high-quality-covid-tests-still-scant","description":"<link href=\"/ns/interactive/0118race-to-5g/css/5g-logo-treatments.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \n <div class=\"mobileHide\"> \n  <div class=\"imgWrapper offsetLeft lt sm\"> \n   <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/covid19-ieee-resources\"><img alt=\"IEEE COVID-19 coverage logo, link to landing page\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzYxMjU3Mg.jpeg\" /></a> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p>After nearly six months of scrutinizing the smorgasbord of COVID-19 tests available globally, an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;diagnostics evaluation group has come to some conclusions: The world greatly needs rapid, affordable tests, but the quality of such tests varies widely. By contrast, slow tests that are sent off to laboratories—the kind&nbsp;broadly used in the U.S. and Europe—are performing well.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>That’s according to the <a href=\"https://www.finddx.org/\">Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics</a>, or FIND, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. <span>“People</span><span>&nbsp;in low- and middle-income countries often do not have access to laboratories,” says&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jilian-sacks-a483a818/\"><span>Jilian Sacks</span></a><span>, FIND’s COVID-19 Evaluation Programme Lead. “So t</span><span>he ability to have&nbsp;rapid tests, especially outside the hospital and in decentralized settings, is most critical moving forward. But we are seeing that there is a lot of variability in the performance of rapid tests,</span><span>” she says.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> \n <p>Sacks’s organization in February&nbsp;took on the ambitious&nbsp;task of evaluating the performance of hundreds of COVID-19 tests&nbsp;that have been flooding the global market ever since&nbsp;the pandemic hit. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/testing-tests-which-covid19-tests-are-most-accurate\">FIND told <em>Spectrum</em></a>&nbsp;earlier this year that it&nbsp;would subject these tests to a slew&nbsp;of coronavirus samples and make the results public on its website. This week, we checked in to see how it’s going.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The most reliable tests, FIND has found, are molecular tests performed in a laboratory. These diagnostics&nbsp;<span>are the go-to COVID-19 testing method&nbsp;in the U.S. and Europe</span><span>. They&nbsp;</span>identify the disease by looking for the virus’s&nbsp;genetic code using a&nbsp;tool called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/how-do-coronavirus-tests-work\">polymerase chain reaction, or PCR</a>.</p> \n <p>FIND has <a href=\"http://www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-molecular/molecular-eval-results/\">evaluated 23 molecular&nbsp;tests</a> so far. All but two&nbsp;had a sensitivity of at least&nbsp;95%, meaning the tests&nbsp;accurately detected positive samples 95% of the time.&nbsp;“We're seeing that generally, the companies that we selected&nbsp;to evaluate have quite good performance with their assays,” so there are several good options from which ministries of health can choose,&nbsp;Sacks says.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><span>But molecular tests are slow. PCR&nbsp;</span><span>takes only a few hours to perform, but people are having to wait days to get results back&nbsp;due to the logistics of transporting samples&nbsp;to a centralized laboratory with PCR capability.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <p>“Global demand has continued to soar, and though there may be&nbsp;many companies that should be able to meet that demand, it will require continued, unprecedented scale-up of their manufacturing and distribution,” Sacks says.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Rapid tests, on the other hand, provide results right away, on the spot, without having to send off a sample to a centralized lab. This allows people to make decisions immediately about whether or not to quarantine. And rapid tests&nbsp;are sometimes&nbsp;the only way to get tested in low-resource&nbsp;regions where access to centralized laboratories is scarce. But these tests are&nbsp;not&nbsp;as accurate as molecular tests.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>FIND is evaluating 41&nbsp;different rapid tests—5 that spot antigens and 36 that look for antibodies.&nbsp;Antigens are the parts of the virus that the immune system recognizes, and finding evidence of them means the virus is present. <span>Antibodies are produced from healthy cells as part of the body’s immune response&nbsp;to a virus, and finding those means the virus is, or was, in the body, and that the immune system responded. Both <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/how-do-coronavirus-tests-work\">types of tests</a> can be performed on-the-spot because they are less complex and don’t require a lab.</span></p> \n <p><span>FIND</span><span>&nbsp;has released&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-immuno/immuno-eval-results/\" style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px;\">results</a><span>&nbsp;for four of the&nbsp;rapid antibody tests it is evaluating. Only one of them—an antibody test made by <a href=\"https://www.btnx.com/\">BTNX</a>—correctly identified&nbsp;positive cases over 90% of the time. The performance of some of</span><span>&nbsp;the other tests is so low that they provide little value. </span></p> \n <p><span>Rapid antibody tests should have a sensitivity of at least 90%, according to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/covid-19-target-product-profiles-for-priority-diagnostics-to-support-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic-v.0.1\">new draft guidelines from&nbsp;the World Health Organization (WHO)</a>&nbsp;released in early August.

For <a href=\"https://lucidmotors.com/\">Lucid Motors</a>, that angle is simple: 500 miles of range—800 kilometers—on a single battery charge.</p> \n<p>That would make its upcoming Lucid Air luxury electric sedan the longest-range electric vehicle in the world, way ahead of the 402-mile rating for the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-s-long-range-plus-building-first-400-mile-electric-vehicle\">2020 Tesla Model S Long Range Plus</a>, today’s range champion.</p> \n<p>The car itself will be revealed September 9, with production to begin within six months thereafter. The U.S. EPA won’t release official range estimates for the Lucid Air, however, until next spring, only a few weeks before the company says it will deliver its first production cars. So Lucid took the gamble of having its range tested by an independent third party with long experience in certifying cars to EPA test cycles.</p> \n<p>Tuesday the EV maker announced independent verification of an estimated EPA range of 517 miles, based on tests conducted by <a href=\"https://www.fev.com/en/who-we-are/locations/usa/auburn-hills.html\">FEV North America Inc.</a> in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Those tests used the EPA’s Multicycle Test procedure, codified by the SAE J1634 standard, October 2012, the same one used by every maker when tested for emissions or battery range.</p> \n<p>Your move, Tesla.</p> \n<p>Lucid unveiled its Air electric luxury sedan in April 2017 but then had to go on hiatus for two years as it sought funding to take the design into production in a purpose-built factory in Arizona. As CEO Peter Rawlinson explained <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/peter-rawlinson-lucid-motors-interview/\">to <em>Motor Trend</em> earlier this year</a>, funders at the time were excited by autonomous-vehicle technology as well as numerous other EV startups.</p> \n<p>It took two more years for Lucid to raise enough funding to move into production. It ultimately received $1.3 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, in exchange for more than half the company, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder\">documents revealed in June</a>.</p> \n<p>The company laid off no engineers. And, in the intervening two years, the team changed the design of the Air’s battery cells, the pack voltage, the power electronics, and the electric motors that power the wheels—two motors on introduction, potentially three later on.</p> \n<p>The 2017 Air prototype used a a whopping 130-kilowatt-hour battery (against the 100 kWh of the highest-spec Model S) operating at 400 volts. It had AC induction motors and 150-kilowatt fast charging. Its range was promised to be “more than 400 miles.”</p> \n<p>The car that is to go into production next spring will have a somewhat smaller, more energy-dense pack—Lucid isn’t giving numbers at the moment—operating at around 900 volts, a pair of permanent-magnet motors, and 350-kW fast charging. The range will be at least 517 miles, per the tests, and could go higher if it can get the same 0.75 EPA “adjustment factor” for efficient air-conditioning that let the Model S Long Range Plus squeak past the 400-mile mark. (Standard factor is 0.70.)</p> \n<figure class=\"rt med-sm\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Peter Rawlinson, CEO of Lucid Motors\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzA3MQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption>\n    Peter Rawlinson, CEO of Lucid Motors \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>The changes, as CEO Peter Rawlinson <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/lucid-motors-says-ecar-design-all-about-efficiency\">told <em>Spectrum</em> several months ago</a>, were all in the service of efficiency—getting as much range and performance out of every kilowatt-hour by reducing air resistance, wasted energy due to resistance, and mechanical friction in every aspect of the car. To do that, he told us this week, an EV company has to engineer not only the car but every facet of its electric powertrain.</p> \n<p>The most visible aspect of an EV’s efficiency is its design. The Lucid Air offers a longer cabin and more legroom than the long-wheelbase version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_S-Class\">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, Rawlinson says, despite having the footprint of a mid-size car like a Honda Accord. While it “reads” big visually, he notes that it’s smaller not only than the Tesla Model S but even the Porsche Taycan, which has far less interior volume.</p> \n<p>The smaller footprint and low height gives the Air a smaller frontal area than competitors, which multiplied by the lowest drag coefficient in its class (0.21), requires less energy to displace air than other EVs. (Note that each maker does its own Cd testing, so drag coefficients from different brands may not be directly comparable.)</p> \n<p>One of Rawlinson’s passions is the necessity for any electric-car maker to engineer all the critical components of its powertrain in-house: battery pack, motors, inverters, transmission, and software. “Every detail adds up,” he stressed, returning to the theme multiple times over the course of an hour-long chat with <em>Spectrum</em>.</p> \n<p>He laid out the advantages he feels Lucid has over every other EV maker—in each area.</p> \n<h3>Battery Pack</h3> \n<p>Despite having no cars in production just yet, Lucid already has a trove of data on the performance of its batteries under extreme duty cycles. That comes from the experience its parent company <a href=\"https://www.greencarreports.com/news/atieva\">Atieva</a> garnered when it provided battery packs to all 24 cars fielded by the competing teams in the Formula E electric-car racing series.</p> \n<p>The revised pack that will launch in the Air operates at “significantly over 900 volts,” permitting fast charging at up to 350 kW&nbsp;and reducing resistance heat. Like other packs, its cells are packaged into modules (or “bricks,” as Rawlinson calls them), that make up the building blocks of the pack.</p> \n<p>Although Lucid isn’t giving details about the cell chemistry it jointly developed with battery partner <a href=\"https://www.lgchem.com/main/index\">LG Chem</a>, it uses thousands of 21700-format cylindrical cells (as Tesla does). Lucid and LG Chem together engineered a specific cell architecture with lower-resistance connectors, again in the service of reducing energy wasted as heat due to resistance.</p> \n<p>Rawlinson lauded LG Chem, as a long-term and dedicated partner. And, he added, that company’s global cell-production capabilities relieved him of that responsibility. “Thank goodness I don’t have to build a gigafactory!”</p> \n<h3>Traction Motors</h3> \n<p>One of the secrets to the Lucid’s packaging is an “ultracompact” motor, one Rawlinson says produces 55 kW per liter of volume, an output density he says is two to three times that of any other maker’s motor. One of the secrets to its efficiency is what he describes only as a novel (and heavily patented) method of cooling that puts liquid closer to the core of the motor, unlike traditional designs with coolant circulating around the periphery.</p> \n<p>The Lucid motor spins at up to 20,000 rpm, with unspecified breakthroughs in the magnetic design to reduce cogging losses—the torque produced by a permanent-magnet motor due to the interaction of the magnets and the stator slots, especially noticeable at low speeds. Again, the CEO was cagey about exactly what the design advances were. More details may emerge next month when the car is revealed.</p> \n<h3>Inverters</h3> \n<p>While Lucid’s use of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/semiconductors/devices/jayant-baligas-quest-to-make-silicon-carbide-power-electronics-succeed\">silicon-carbide MOSFETs</a> for switching doesn’t do much for the EPA test cycles that determine its range rating, Rawlinson suggests they reinforce range in the much broader array of uses in real-world driving. And he spoke sadly of a (non-Tesla) competitor’s use of a third-party inverter, noting that mixing high-voltage insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) components with MOSFETs wasted energy.</p> \n<h3>Transmission&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Rawlinson set his design team to develop the e-motors and the transmission as a “single rotational system” to ensure the most integrated and compact device possible. The gearbox hasn’t been shown yet, and the company has applied for multiple patents.</p> \n<p>One example Rawlinson was willing to discuss, however, was the 3-dimensional shape of the gear teeth themselves—an area few makers spend much time on. Lucid has patented the involute profile of the gear teeth within its transmission, optimized for performance and efficiency to transmit maximum torque under power while spinning with the least resistance otherwise.</p> \n<h3>Software</h3> \n<p>“We are as much a software company as a hardware company,” Rawlinson cheerfully admits, echoing some investors’ mantra (both pro and con) for Tesla. From the control strategies for each component of the powertrain to a user interface he promises will be “revolutionary,” the creation and optimization of the Lucid Air’s software could be the topic of a whole series of articles by itself. We left the specifics of that topic for another day.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"DreamDrive’s array of 32 multimodal sensors includes the latest camera, radar, and ultrasonic sensors — as well as a long-distance, high-resolution LIDAR that uses laser beams to measure distance from every object in the car’s path.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzA4MQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image: Lucid Motors \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>Before writing off Lucid as just another Tesla-wannabe, it’s worth noting CEO Rawlinson has been here before. Not only was he part of the group that created the 2002 Jaguar XJ, one of the earliest all-aluminum luxury sedans, but he led the team that engineered the actual 2012 Tesla Model S and put it into production.</p> \n<p>I first interviewed Rawlinson in January 2011, when a Model S body-in-white on display at the Detroit Auto Show was drawing a steady throng of visitors. That was the first time that other car makers began to think Tesla might actually know what it was doing.</p> \n<p>Back then Rawlinson was so exhausted he was sleeping under a conference table between interviews. But he was articulate and passionate about the challenges of building the world’s first serious long-range electric car—at a time, remember, when the then-new <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/nissans-allelectric-leaf-doesnt-stint-on-performance\">Nissan Leaf</a> offered an EPA rating of 73 miles.</p> \n<p>This week, Rawlinson was equally articulate, if anything more passionate, and rather better-rested. His entire mantra for the Lucid Air was to rethink every aspect of efficiency, to dispense with anxieties over battery range once and for all.</p> \n<p>“I want to move from range anxiety to range confidence,” he said. Indeed, an EPA-approved range of more than 500 miles should really end discussion over how far electric cars can travel, since it’s the rare driver whose bladder will permit that range to be used.</p> \n<p>The Lucid Air, he said, targets not the Tesla Model S—the de facto assumption by much of the press—but the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the pinnacle of luxury sedans built and sold in high volume. In 2012, he said, few S-Class owners would have considered an electric car. Now, Tesla has proven the concept, and they’re willing to make the leap. But they won’t leave for a vehicle as stark as a Tesla, he said, so that’s where Lucid is starting.</p> \n<p>The company’s goal, he said, is to provide EVs that&nbsp;deliver enough range to end that concern for good. Then, it will launch versions with smaller, less-expensive batteries that might provide “only” 350 miles of range. And, he notes, the company’s battery packs are carefully designed for high-volume assembly, its motors engineered for mass CNC production.</p> \n<p>The Lucid CEO sounds most excited about the possibility of using the company’s ultra-efficient powertrain in smaller vehicles that would, he says, “cascade into the mass market, so the man in the street can buy an electric car” with no compromises.</p> \n<p>“That’s what drives me,” he said. The Tesla Model S? “Not a bad first effort, not bad.”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/9b7wNkKDoQc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzAzMg.jpeg","linkMd5":"25804602d317875d5aede29a024835e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-11-710_ada9bb54b1ba4bc0.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":60746,"destBytes":76018,"author":"John Voelcker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzA3MQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-14-166_af00da377d864b3e.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzA4MQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-13-041_09ca5ae81a08def9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/9b7wNkKDoQc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn34@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-50-15-276_bdbeb48e3073f7cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594950},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Get More From Your Automotive Electronics Test Investment","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whitepaper/get_more_from_your_automotive_electronics_test_investment","description":"<div class=\"imgWrapper ct med\"> \n <img alt=\"Keysight Automotive\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY2NDY5NA.png\"> </img>\n</div> \n<p>Explore the powerful software behind Keysight’s high-precision hardware and discover how to meet emerging automotive electronics test requirements, while driving higher ROI from your existing hardware.

Even so, the possibility of carrying out such a stupendous hack is quite real. And there have been <a href=\"https://trust-hub.org/benchmarks/system-level-trojan\">more than a dozen documented examples of such system-level attacks</a>.</p> \n<p>We know much about <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/malware\">malware</a> and counterfeit ICs, but the vulnerabilities of the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/PCBs\">printed circuit board</a> itself are only now starting to get the attention they deserve. We’ll take you on a tour of some of the best-known weak points in printed-circuit-board manufacturing. Fortunately, the means to shore up those points are relatively straightforward, and many of them simply amount to good engineering practice.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>In order to</strong> understand how a circuit board can be hacked, it’s worth reviewing how they are made. Printed circuit boards typically contain thousands of components. (They are also known as printed wiring boards, or PWBs, before they are populated with components.) The purpose of the PCB is, of course, to provide the structural support to hold the components in place and to provide the wiring needed to connect signals and power to the components.</p> \n<p>PCB designers start by creating two electronic documents, a schematic and a layout. The schematic describes all the components and how they are interconnected. The layout depicts the finished bare board and locates objects on the board, including both components and their labels, called <a href=\"https://dexpcb.com/manual/standard-reference-designators.htm\">reference designators</a>. (The reference designator is extremely important—most of the assembly process, and much of the design and procurement process, is tied to reference designators.)</p> \n<p>Not all of a PCB is taken up by components. Most boards include empty component footprints, called unpopulated components. This is because boards often contain extra circuitry for debugging and testing or because they are manufactured for several purposes, and therefore might have versions with more or fewer components.</p> \n<p>Once the schematic and layout have been checked, the layout is converted to a set of files. The most common file format is called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format\">Gerber</a>,” or RS-274X. It consists of ASCII-formatted commands that direct shapes to appear on the board. A second ASCII-formatted file, called the drill file, shows where to place holes in the circuit board. The manufacturer then uses the files to create masks for etching, printing, and drilling the boards. Then the boards are tested.</p> \n<p>Next, “pick and place” machines put surface-mount components where they belong on the board, and the PCBs pass through an oven that melts all the solder at once. Through-hole components are placed, often by hand, and the boards pass over a machine that applies solder to all of the through-hole pins. It’s intricate work: An eight-pin, four-resistor network can cover just 2 millimeters by 1.3 mm, and some component footprints are as small as 0.25 mm by 0.13 mm. The boards are then inspected, tested, repaired as needed, and assembled further into working products.</p> \n<aside class=\"inlay xlrg\"> \n <h3 class=\"sb-hed\">Five Tempting Targets</h3> \n <h4 class=\"sb-dek\">Hacking a PCB likely means making secret additions to the many small components on a board and taking control of certain data buses</h4> \n <figure class=\"rt\" role=\"img\"> \n  <a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Njk2Mw.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"img\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Njk2Mw.jpeg\"><span class=\"magnifier\">&nbsp;</span></img></a> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photos: Dan Saelinger \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> \n </figure> \n <figure class=\"rt sm\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Close up image of a circuit board showing a threatened area: small components\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzM0NQ.jpeg\"> \n   <div class=\"ai\"></div> </img> \n </figure> \n <p><strong>1. Small Components:</strong> Hardware hacks might need the inclusion of an extra, surreptitious component. In that case, a spot on the board with many small components is the place to hide it. Modern passive components can be mere millimeters in size and invisible to the unassisted eye. This component can be added in production (very difficult); during the “rework” step, when faulty boards are fixed (easier); or in a warehouse before or during delivery to the customer (even easier).</p> \n <hr> \n  <figure class=\"rt sm\" role=\"img\"> \n   <img alt=\"Close up image of a circuit board showing a threatened area: the power controller\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzM0NA.jpeg\"> \n    <div class=\"ai\"></div> </img> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>2. Power Controller:</strong> This chip is a particularly fruitful target because it acts as the controller for all of the DC voltages that power the CPU, the graphics card, and more. It is under the control of the System Management Bus. So if a hack enables people to seize control of the SMBus, they could reset voltages in order to damage a computer or limit its operation. Control of the SMBus could also allow a hacker to interfere with communication between the CPU and onboard sensors, and that might also lead to damage.</p> \n  <hr> \n   <figure class=\"rt sm\" role=\"img\"> \n    <img alt=\"Close up image of a circuit board showing a threatened area: the low pin count bus\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzM0Ng.jpeg\"> \n     <div class=\"ai\"></div> </img> \n   </figure> \n   <p><strong>3. Low Pin Count Bus:</strong> The connector above is attached to the LPC bus, which can link the CPU to certain legacy devices as well as to the fans and physical switches on the chassis. Perhaps just as important to hackers, the LPC bus can connect to a secure microcontroller called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which deals with encryption keys and various other security functions. While the TPM would very likely remain secure even if the LPC bus is compromised, a hacker could observe the traffic going to and from the TPM.</p> \n   <hr> \n    <figure class=\"rt sm\" role=\"img\"> \n     <img alt=\"Close up image of a circuit board showing a threatened area: the BIOS flash memory\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzM1NQ.jpeg\"> \n      <div class=\"ai\"></div> </img> \n    </figure> \n    <p><strong>4.

Super I/O Chip:</strong> The Super I/O chip controls the inputs to a variety of low-bandwidth devices, sometimes including keyboards, the mouse, certain sensors, fans, and floppy disks. The chip sits on the Low Pin Count (LPC) bus. Seizing control of the LPC bus could let hackers reduce the fan speed so that a computer will overheat. It could also let them introduce false temperature and voltage readings that could damage or shut the system down.</p> \n    </hr> \n   </hr> \n  </hr> \n </hr> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Attacks can be</strong> made at every one of these design steps. In the first type of attack, extra components are added to the schematic. This attack is arguably the hardest to detect because the schematic is usually regarded as the most accurate reflection of the designer’s intent and thus carries the weight of authority.</p> \n<p>A variation on this theme involves adding an innocuous component to the schematic, then using a maliciously altered version of the component in production. This type of attack, in which seemingly legitimate components have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29\">hardware Trojans</a>, is outside the scope of this article, but it should nevertheless be taken very seriously.</p> \n<p>In either case, the countermeasure is to review the schematic carefully, something that should be done in any case. One important safeguard is to run it by employees from other design groups, using their “fresh eyes” to spot an extraneous component.</p> \n<p>In a second type of attack, extra components can be added to the layout. This is a straightforward process, but because there are specific process checks to compare the layout to the schematic, it is harder to get away with it: At a minimum, a layout technician would have to falsify the results of the comparison. And combatting this form of attack is simple: Have an engineer—or, better, a group of engineers—observe the layout-to-­schematic comparison step and sign off on it.</p> \n<p>In a third type of attack, the Gerber and drill files can be altered. There are three important points on the Gerber and drill files from a security perspective: First, they’re ASCII-formatted, and therefore editable in very common text-editing tools; second, they’re human-readable; and third, they contain no built-in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/security/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\">cryptographic protections</a>, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\">signatures</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\">checksums</a>. Since a complete set of ­Gerber files can be hundreds of thousands of lines, this is a very efficient mode of attack, one that is easily missed.</p> \n<p>In one example, an attacker could insert what appears to be an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/antioxidants-good-for-you-good-for-your-smartphone\">electrostatic discharge</a> diode. This circuit’s design files are made up of 16 Gerber and drill files. Of the 16 files, nine would need altering; of those nine, seven would vary in a total of 79 lines, and two files need changes in about 300 lines each. The latter two files specify the power and ground planes. A more skilled attack, such as one adding vertical connections called vias, would dramatically reduce the number of lines that needed rewriting.</p> \n<p>Unprotected Gerber files are vulnerable to even a single bad actor who sneaks in at any point between the designing company and the production of the photolithographic masks. As the Gerber­ files are based on an industry standard, acquiring the knowledge to make the changes is relatively straightforward.</p> \n<p>One might argue that standard cryptographic methods of protecting files would protect Gerber files, too. While it is clear that such protections would guard a ­Gerber file in transit, it is unclear whether those protections hold when the files reach their destination. The fabrication of circuit boards almost always occurs outside the company that designs them. And, while most third-party manufacturers are reputable companies, the steps they take to protect these files are usually not documented for their customers.</p> \n<p>One way to protect files is to add a digital signature, cryptographic hash, or some other sort of authentication code to the internal contents of the file in the form of a comment. However, this protection is effective only if the mask-making process authenticates the file quite late in the process; ideally, the machines that create the photolithography masks should have the ability to authenticate a file. Alternatively, the machine could retain a cryptographic hash of the file that was actually used to create the mask, so that the manufacturer can audit the process. In either case, the mask-making machine would itself require secure handling.</p> \n<p></p> \n<aside class=\"inlay pullquote rt med\">\n  Knowing how to sabotage a PC is only half the job. Attackers also have to know what the best targets are on a computer motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n</aside> \n<p><strong>If bad actors succeed </strong>at one of these three attacks, they can add an actual, physical component to the assembled circuit board. This can occur in three ways.</p> \n<p>First, the extra component can be added in production. This is difficult because it requires altering the supply chain to add the component to the procurement process, programming the pick-and-place machine to place the part, and attaching a reel of parts to the machine. In other words, it would require the cooperation of several bad actors, a conspiracy that might indicate the work of a corporation or a state.</p> \n<p>Second, the extra component can be added in the repair-and-rework area—a&nbsp;much easier target than production. It’s common for assembled circuit boards to require reworking by hand. For example, on a board with 2,000 components, the first-pass yield—the fraction of boards with zero defects—might be below 70&nbsp;percent. The defective boards go to a technician who then adds or removes components by hand; a single technician could easily add dozens of surreptitious components per day. While not every board would have the extra component, the attack might still succeed, especially if there was a collaborator in the shipping area to ship the hacked boards to targeted customers. Note that succeeding at this attack (altered Gerber files, part inserted in repair, unit selectively shipped) requires only three people.</p> \n<p>Third, a component can be added by hand to a board after production—in a warehouse, for instance. The fact that an in-transit attack is possible may require companies to inspect incoming boards to confirm that unpopulated parts remain unpopulated.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong><span>Kn</span>owing how to</strong> sabotage a PCB is only half the job. Attackers also have to know what the best targets are on a computer motherboard. They’ll try the data buses, specifically those with two things in common—low data rates and low pin counts. High-speed buses, such as SATA, M.2, and DDR are so sensitive to data rates that the delay of an extra component would very likely keep them from working correctly. And a component with a smaller number of pins is simpler to sneak into a design; therefore, buses with low pin counts are easier targets. On a PC motherboard, there are three such buses.</p> \n<p>The first is the System Management Bus (SMBus), which controls the voltage regulators and clock frequency on most PC motherboards. It’s based on the two-wire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C\">Inter-IC (I2C)</a> standard created by Philips Semiconductor back in 1982. That standard has no encryption, and it allows a number of connected devices to directly access critical onboard components, such as the power supply, independently of the CPU.</p> \n<p>A surreptitious component on an SMBus could enable two types of attacks against a system. It could change the voltage settings of a regulator and damage components. It could also interfere with communications between the processor and onboard sensors, either by impersonating another device or by intentionally interfering with incoming data.</p> \n<p>The second target is the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus, a four-wire bus created by Motorola in the mid-1980s. It’s used by most modern flash-memory parts, and so is likely to be the bus on which the important code, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), is accessed.</p> \n<figure class=\"lt med\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Image of a circuit board with googly eyes on it.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NjczMg.gif\"> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Gif: Dan Saelinger \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>A well-considered attack against the SPI bus could alter any portion of the data that is read from an attached memory chip. Modifications to the BIOS as it is being accessed could change hardware configurations done during the boot process, leaving a path open for malicious code.</p> \n<p>The third target is the LPC (Low Pin Count) bus, and it’s particularly attractive because an attack can compromise the operation of the computer, provide remote access to power and other vital control functions, and compromise the security of the boot process. This bus carries seven mandatory signals and up to six optional signals; it is used to connect a computer’s CPU to legacy devices, such as serial and parallel ports, or to physical switches on the chassis, and in many modern PCs, its signals control the fans.</p> \n<p>The LPC bus is such a vulnerable point because many servers use it to connect a separate management processor to the system. This processor, called the baseboard management controller (BMC), can perform basic housekeeping functions even if the main processor has crashed or the operating system has not been installed. It’s convenient because it permits remote control, repair, and diagnostics of server components. Most BMCs have a dedicated Ethernet port, and so an attack on a BMC can also result in network access.</p> \n<p>The BMC also has a pass-through connection to the SPI bus, and many processors load their BIOS through that channel. This is a purposeful design decision, as it permits the BIOS to be patched remotely via the BMC.</p> \n<p>Many motherboards also use the LPC bus to access hardware implementing the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) standard, which provides cryptographic keys and a range of other services to secure a computer and its software.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>Start your search</strong> for surreptitious components with these buses. You can search them by machine: At the far end of the automation is a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/hardware/this-tech-would-have-spotted-the-secret-chinese-chip-in-seconds\">system developed</a> by <a href=\"http://tehranipoor.ece.ufl.edu/\">Mark M. Tehranipoor</a>, director of the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research, in Gainesville. It uses optical scans, microscopy, X-ray tomography, and artificial intelligence to compare a PCB and its components with the intended design. Or you can do the search by hand, which consists of four rounds of checks. While these manual methods may take time, they don’t need to be done on every single board, and they require little technical skill.</p> \n<p>In the first round, check the board for components that lack a reference designator. This is a bright red flag; there is no way that a board so hobbled could be manufactured in a normal production process. Finding such a component is a strong indication of an attack on the board layout files (that is, the Gerber and drill files), because that step is the likeliest place to add a component without adding a reference designator. Of course, a component without a reference designator is a major design mistake and worth catching under any circumstances.</p> \n<p>In the second round of checks, make sure that every reference designator is found in the schematic, layout, and bill of materials. A bogus reference designator is another clear indication that someone has tampered with the board layout files.</p> \n<p>In the third round, focus on the shape and size of the component footprints. For example, if a four-pin part is on the schematic and the layout or board has an eight-pin footprint, this is clear evidence of a hack.</p> \n<p>The fourth round of checks should examine all the unpopulated parts of the board. Although placing components in an unpopulated spot may well be the result of a genuine mistake, it may also be a sign of sabotage, and so it needs to be checked for both reasons.</p> \n<p>As you can see, modern motherboards, with their thousands of sometimes mote-size components, are quite vulnerable to subversion. Some of those exploits make it possible to gain access to vital system functions. Straightforward methods can detect and perhaps deter most of these attacks. As with malware, heightened sensitivity to the issue and well-planned scrutiny can make attacks unlikely and unsuccessful.</p> \n<h2>About the Author</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/engineering/ece/russ.html\">Samuel H.

Ventilators are commonly used to treat COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress. There are simply not enough professionals available to repair the equipment in the short time frame due to the large demand for machines, says Yuri Bastos Gabrich, one of the IEEE members working on the Engineers Assisting Ventilator Maintenance project.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“The pandemic has increased the demand for new ventilators worldwide, which has also complicated the [ability to] purchase new ones,” he says.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>To help cover the expenses of their project, the IEEE volunteers applied to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hac.ieee.org/funding-opportunities/covid-19-projects/\"><span class=\"ListLabel3\">COVID-19 Fund</span></a> sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hac.ieee.org/\"><span class=\"ListLabel3\">IEEE Humanitarian Activities Committee</span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<span class=\"ListLabel3\"><a href=\"https://sight.ieee.org/\">IEEE Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology</a>. The project was&nbsp;</span>awarded <a href=\"https://cmte.ieee.org/r9-hac/covid-19-projects/\"><span class=\"ListLabel1\">US $5,000</span></a>. Out of the 30 volunteers working on the project, 13 are IEEE members. In addition to Gabrich, they include Senior Member Oumar Diene and Member Gidy Carolina Florez Navarro.</p> \n <p>In addition, the project has the support of the <a href=\"https://www.saude.rj.gov.br/\"><span class=\"ListLabel5\">Rio de Janeiro State Health Department</span></a>.</p> \n <p>Also assisting the hospitals is the <a href=\"http://www.cefet-rj.br/\"><span class=\"ListLabel2\">Federal Center for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro</span></a> (CEFET/RJ), which launched the “Núcleo de Reparo de Ventiladores Mecânicos” (Repair Center of Mechanical Ventilators) with several partner institutions. Repairs are done at a maintenance hub located at CEFET/RJ Maracanã campus. Because all the onsite educational activities were suspended due to the pandemic, minor renovations were made to lab classrooms to turn them into repair rooms, Gabrich says. Only the volunteers doing the repairs have access to the facilities.</p> \n <p>“Individuals and several industry partners are [assisting with] the initiative, and creating a multidisciplinary team with a range of knowledge and tools that together impact the society for the good,” Gabrich says. “In addition to helping to save lives, the IEEE members and nonmembers are getting the opportunity to learn about topics such as the treatments being used for COVID-19 patients, equipment maintenance, test management, equipment care and safety, and health monitoring.”</p> \n <p>Since June, the volunteers have repaired eight ventilators, and five more machines are in the process of being fixed and will be ready for use later this month.</p> \n <p><em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute\"><span class=\"ListLabel4\">The Institute</span></a></em>&nbsp;asked Gabrich about the project.</p> \n <p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p> \n <p></p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Heitor Mendes, Yuri Gabrich, Felipe Piancó, Julia Neri, Gidy Florez, Brenno Tavares, Neilson Dantas, and Marcela Brandão.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODEwNQ.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo:&nbsp;Gidy Florez \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     Other volunteers working to repair the ventilators are [from left] Heitor Mendes, Yuri Gabrich, Felipe Piancó, Julia Neri, Gidy Florez, Brenno Tavares, Neilson Dantas, and Marcela Brandão are ready to get to work. \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p><strong>What problem are you trying to solve?</strong></p> \n <p>The lack of mechanical ventilators to meet the huge need for treatment of COVID-19 patients in public hospitals in Rio de Janeiro State.</p> \n <p><strong>What technologies are you using?</strong></p> \n <p>To gather information about the ventilators that need to be repaired, a multidisciplinary team of professors and researchers from the CEFET/RJ Nova Iguaçu campus developed the Android app, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wwmm.sostecsaude&amp;hl=en\"><span class=\"InternetLink\">SOSTecSaúde</span></a>. This app connects hospitals and medical centers asking for help with those who can [provide] aid. This is the entryway to start the repair activities at the maintenance hub.</p> \n <p>For the security of equipment, several cameras with facial recognition were installed throughout the maintenance hub to track all steps the ventilators pass through—from the arrival and departure gate to each repair room. This visual monitoring is offered by the initiative’s partner <a href=\"https://www.gsol.com.br/\"><span class=\"InternetLink\">GSOL Energy</span></a>, [an IT company] that has provided network infrastructure and apparatus to monitor the hub, 24/7.</p> \n <p>For monitoring the health of on-site volunteers, we are using a predictive data analysis of their heart rate and actigraphic data. [Actigraphy is a non-invasive method of monitoring a person’s cycle of rest and activity]. This technology is offered by the initiative’s partner <a href=\"http://ezrest.com.br/\"><span class=\"ListLabel5\">EzRest</span></a> , which works with professional fatigue management. Volunteers wear the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Waterproof-Smartband-Touchpad-Wristbands/dp/B07DG3P996\"><span class=\"ListLabel5\">Xiaomi Mi Band 3</span></a> [a fitness tracker] to collect the data, which is sent to the EzRest AI system that monitors their health condition. When a different pattern [of readings] is found, the system indicates a health risk but it does not identify the risk or its cause. However, when a moderate to high health risk is identified, [it is recommended that] the volunteer take a break from work and seek medical attention.</p> \n <p><strong>What training is provided to those who fix the machine?</strong></p> \n <p>Volunteers received eight hours of training divided over two days. The theoretical lessons formed the basis for the almost 58 hours of hands-on activities that came in the following days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Disassembling and cleaning the internal part of the ventilator.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NDU1MA.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo: Yuri Gabrich \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     Disassembling and&nbsp;cleaning the internal part of the ventilator are [from left] Marcela Brandão, Julio César Santos, and Felipe Piancó. \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p>Wanderson Alves de Araújo gave volunteers instructions about how to handle and repair the mechanical ventilators using the brands Maquet and Servo-S [Servo-based technology]. De Araújo is the technical supervisor for Nova Service, one of [the initiative’s] partners. Beyond the tips and tricks he taught us, he also visits the hub once a week to calibrate ventilators before sending them back to hospitals.</p> \n <p>Cristiane Duarte Barbosa, a nurse working on the front lines, taught [us] about how to adjust ventilator parameters. We use the GE iVent-20 model. Cristiane and Julio César Santos are both professors of nursing at the CEFET/RJ Nova Iguaçu campus. They explained several [interesting things] about coronavirus treatment.</p> \n <p>Alexandre Pinhel, an IEEE senior member, and [an] engineer at <a href=\"https://www.furnas.com.br/\"><span class=\"ListLabel5\">Eletrobras Furnas</span></a>, [a power utility company] explained electrostatic discharge (ESD). He taught us how to properly manipulate electronic boards without damaging them or unconsciously compromising their lifetime. He also gave each volunteer a copy of his book “Basic Concepts for Protection Against Static Electricity: The Problem of Electrostatic Discharges in Electronic Components.”</p> \n <p>For the rest of the project’s schedule, the trained volunteers are responsible for passing on the acquired knowledge to new volunteers that may join the team.&nbsp;Volunteers always work under the supervision of specialized engineers.</p> \n <p><strong>What medical facilities and other organizations are you helping?</strong></p> \n <p>We are repairing ventilators from Raul Sertã Municipal Hospital, Getúlio Vargas State Hospital, Eduardo Rabelo State Hospital, and Alberto Torres State Hospital.</p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"ulia Neri, Neilson Dantas, Felipe Piancó, Alexandre Pinhel, Yuri Gabrich, and Wanderson Araújo\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODEwNg.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo:&nbsp;Alexandre Pinhel \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     On their snack time break in the repair hub are [from left] Julia Neri, Neilson Dantas, Felipe Piancó, Alexandre Pinhel, Yuri Gabrich, and Wanderson Araújo. \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p><strong>What challenges have you faced, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p> \n <p>In the beginning, the urgency to find partners, learn new subjects in [a short time], and organize all the activities to receive equipment and [train] volunteers became an unhealthy and stressful job for CEFET’s committee. They were spending hours working without stop, and even without drinking water. The end of the day was always bad.</p> \n <p>The solution was to implement a snack time. It brought happy smiles back (even with a facial mask), and has transformed the team’s stop time to self-care and recharge time. The snack time happens in the open space of the hub, with each volunteer sitting apart from each other, maintaining social distancing.</p> \n <p>Another challenge was to deal with a large amount of information and activities.

When you bought a PC, IBM gave you everything you needed to manufacture your own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible\">clone</a>. That openness seeded an explosion of PC compatibles, the foundation of the computing environment we enjoy today.</p> \n<p>In one corner of the original PC’s motherboard, alongside the underpowered-but-epochal 8088 CPU, sat an empty socket. It awaited an upgrade it rarely received: an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8087\">8087 floating-point coprocessor</a>.</p> \n<p>Among the most complex chips of its day, the 8087 accelerated mathematical computations—in particular, the calculation of transcendental functions—by two orders of magnitude. While not something you’d need for a <a href=\"https://aresluna.org/attached/computerhistory/articles/spreadsheets/lotus123review\">Lotus 1-2-3</a> spreadsheet, for early users of <a href=\"https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview\">AutoCAD</a> those functions were absolutely essential. Pop that chip into your PC and rendering detailed computer-aided-design (CAD) drawings no longer felt excruciatingly slow. That speed boost didn’t come cheap, though. One vendor sold the upgrade for US $295—almost $800 in today’s dollars.</p> \n<p>Recently, I purchased a PC whose CPU runs a million times as fast as that venerable 8088 and uses a million times as much RAM. That computer cost me about as much as an original PC—but in 2020 dollars, it’s worth only a third as much. Yet the proportion of my spend that went into a top-of-the-line graphics processing unit (GPU) was the same as what I would have invested in an 8087 back in the day.</p> \n<p>Although I rarely use CAD, I do write math-intensive code for virtual or augmented reality and videogrammetry. My new coprocessor—a hefty slice of <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\">Nvidia</a> silicon—performs its computations at 200 million times the speed of its ancestor.</p> \n<p>That kind of performance bump can only partially be attributed to Moore’s Law. Half or more of the speedup derives from the massive parallelism designed into modern GPUs, which are capable of simultaneously executing several thousand pixel-shader programs (to compute position, color, and other attributes when rendering objects).</p> \n<p>Such massive parallelism has its direct analogue in another, simultaneous revolution: the advent of pervasive connectivity. Since the late 1990s, it’s been a mistake to conceive of a PC as a stand-alone device. Through the Web, each PC has been plugged into a coprocessor of a different sort: the millions of other PCs that are similarly connected.</p> \n<p>The computing hardware we quickly grew to depend on was eventually refined into a smartphone, representing the essential parts of a PC, trimmed to accommodate a modest size and power budget. And smartphones are even better networked than early PCs were. So we shouldn’t think of the coprocessor in a smartphone as its GPU, which helps draw pretty pictures on the screen. The real coprocessor is the connected capacity of some 4 billion other smartphone-­carrying people, each capable of sharing with and learning from one another through the Web or on various social-media platforms. It’s something that brings out both the best and worst in us.</p> \n<p>We all now have powerful tools at our fingertips for connecting with others. When we plug ourselves into this global coprocessor, we can put our heads together to imagine, plan, and produce—or to conspire, harass, and thwart. We can search and destroy, or we can create and share. With the great power that this technology confers comes great responsibility. That’s something we should remind ourselves of every time we peer at our screens.</p> \n<p><em>This article appears in the September 2020 print issue as “The CPU’s Silent Partner.”</em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/HJJ-z_ZP39I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODE4OQ.jpeg","linkMd5":"0eb111c9331487c6fa6bdf4fc73e57dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-12-042_133a9a37ef3fb9d9.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":586,"sourceBytes":296351,"destBytes":19316,"author":"Mark Pesce","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODE4OA.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-11-752_6e1b5e38e646a89b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/HJJ-z_ZP39I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-12-024_e7eafc08ebe2a7ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594949},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"CaseCrawler Adds Tiny Robotic Legs to Your Phone","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/casecrawler-adds-tiny-robotic-legs-to-your-phone","description":"<link href=\"/ns/interactive/0118race-to-5g/css/5g-logo-treatments.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \n <div class=\"mobileHide\"> \n  <div class=\"imgWrapper offsetLeft lt sm\"> \n   <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/journal-watch\"><img alt=\"Journal Watch report logo, link to report landing page\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI0MTAwOQ.jpeg\" /></a> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p>Most of us have a fairly rational expectation that if we put our cellphone down somewhere, it will stay in that place until we pick it up again. Normally, this is exactly what you’d want, but there are exceptions, like when you put your phone down in not quite the right spot on a wireless charging pad without noticing, or when you’re lying on the couch and your phone is <em>juuust</em> out of reach no matter how much you stretch.</p> \n <p>Roboticists from the <a href=\"https://www.biorobotics.snu.ac.kr/\">Biorobotics Laboratory at Seoul National University</a> in South Korea have solved both of these problems, and many more besides, by developing a cellphone case with little robotic legs, endowing your phone with the ability to skitter around autonomously. And unlike most of the phone-robot hybrids we’ve seen in the past, this one actually does look like a legit case for your phone.</p> \n <!--nextpage--> \n <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lzEUn2CAuFs?rel=0\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n <p>CaseCrawler is much chunkier than a form-fitting case, but it’s not offensively bigger than one of those chunky battery cases. It’s only 24 millimeters thick (excluding the motor housing), and the total weight is just under 82 grams. Keep in mind that this case is in fact an entire robot, and also not at all optimized for being an actual phone case, so it’s easy to imagine how it could get a lot more svelte—for example, it currently includes a small battery that would be unnecessary if it instead tapped into the phone for power.</p> \n <p>The technology inside is pretty amazing, since it involves legs that can retract all the way flat while also supporting a significant amount of weight. The legs work sort of like your legs do, in that there’s a knee joint that can only bend one way. To move the robot forward, a linkage (attached to a motor through a gearbox) pushes the leg back against the ground, as the knee joint keeps the leg straight. On the return stroke, the joint allows the leg to fold, making it compliant so that it doesn’t exert force on the ground. The transmission that sends power from the gearbox to the legs is just 1.5-millimeter thick, but this incredibly thin and lightweight mechanical structure is quite powerful. A non-phone case version of the robot, weighing about 23 g, is able to crawl at 21 centimeters per second while carrying a payload of just over 300 g. That’s more than 13 times its body weight.</p> \n <p>The researchers plan on exploring how robots like these could make other objects movable that would otherwise not be. They’d also like to add some autonomy, which (at least for the phone case version) could be as straightforward as leveraging the existing sensors on the phone. And as to when you might be able to buy one of these—we’ll keep you updated, but the good news is that it seems to be fundamentally inexpensive enough that it may actually crawl out of the lab one day.</p> \n <h4>“CaseCrawler: A Lightweight and Low-Profile Crawling Phone Case Robot,” by Jongeun Lee, Gwang-Pil Jung, Sang-Min Baek, Soo-Hwan Chae, Sojung Yim, Woongbae Kim, and Kyu-Jin Cho from Seoul National University, appears in the October issue of <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</em>.</h4> \n <div class=\"mobileShow\"> \n  <h3 class=\"RptHdBackBarMobile\"><span class=\"BackArrowBlkBkgrd\">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/journal-watch\">Back to IEEE Journal Watch</a></h3> \n </div> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/uzUur1KQ_uU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</link>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:52:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzYzNg.jpeg","linkMd5":"1bb438633631f1192ea2ebc8ad35f776","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-12-743_e86246fc586ab15f.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":833,"sourceBytes":189185,"destBytes":27146,"author":"Evan Ackerman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI0MTAwOQ.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-13-609_964adaa282b1aac4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/uzUur1KQ_uU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn2@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-13-437_37cb338a6a15f7b2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594950},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Startup’s Thermal Imaging and AR System for Firefighters Joins the COVID-19 Fight","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-member-news/startups-thermal-imaging-and-ar-system-for-firefighters-joins-the-covid19-fight","description":"<link href=\"/ns/interactive/0118race-to-5g/css/5g-logo-treatments.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> \n <style type=\"text/css\">.entry-content .tisubhead { color: #999999; font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: -5px !important; text-transform: uppercase; } .tiopener { color: #0f4994; font-family: Theinhardt-Medium, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } </style> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Photograph of a firefighter with the Longan Vision FVS augmented-reality visor showing thermal imaging\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzM1OA.jpeg\"> \n   <div class=\"ai\"> \n    <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n      Photo-illustraiton: Longan Vision \n    </figcaption> \n    <figcaption>\n      An illustration of a firefighter wearing Longan Vision’s&nbsp;AR visor with thermal imaging cameras over his helmet.

He is chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.longanvision.com/\">Longan Vision</a>, a startup he helped found. “I really want to help firefighters and first responders enhance their vision by using AR technologies.”</p> \n <p>The startup, based in Hamilton, Ont., was named a 2020 <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.ieee.org/entrepreneurship-stars/\">IEEE Entrepreneurship Star</a> at this year’s <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/ces/\">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, held in January. The program recognizes early-stage companies that have the potential of bringing to market engineering-driven innovations in IEEE’s field of interest. Along with the recognition, awardees get a free year of IEEE membership.</p> \n <p>In the months before the pandemic, the company had developed a prototype of its Fusion Vision System and had demonstrated it to several fire departments.</p> \n <p>When COVID-19 began spreading throughout Canada, Jia and his colleagues realized they could use some of the same technologies to combat the spread of the virus, so they began a side project. To detect a high body temperature, which is a common symptom of COVID-19, the startup used components from the visor to build Gatekeeper, a thermal-imaging system. Gatekeeper can be mounted on a wall or tripod to measure body temperature of up to five people at once.</p> \n <p>Several units have been installed in long-term-care facilities, grocery stores, and universities, Jia says.</p> \n <h3 class=\"tisubhead\">AR VISORS</h3> \n <p>Jia, a mechanical engineer, says he has been a fan of AR technology for some time. His undergraduate capstone project at <a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.ca/\">McMaster University</a>, in Hamilton, was about how AR could be used in vehicle head-up displays. Such displays, which already exist in some vehicles, can project information on the windshield, including navigation instructions, speed limit, and mileage.</p> \n <p>Jia, who earned a bachelor’s degree in automotive engineering technology, was a member of the <a href=\"https://site.ieee.org/sb-mcmaster/leadership/\">university’s IEEE student branch</a>. He later earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the school.</p> \n <p>He launched Longan in 2018 with five colleagues shortly after graduating. At first, the job wasn’t full time. To get business experience under his belt as well as an understanding of how to manufacture products, he worked as a mechanical engineer for material-handling-equipment company <a href=\"https://www.skyjack.com/\">Skyjack</a> and automotive supplier <a href=\"https://www.magna.com/\">Magna</a>.</p> \n <p>Today he works full time for Longan, which has five other full-time employees and two interns.</p> \n <p>His initial idea was to develop AR glasses that integrated thermal imaging for industrial applications, such as Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens. The company changed direction after several fires in Ontario caused major losses of life and property.</p> \n <p>“In some of these incidents, firefighters lost their lives saving people while the building was collapsing around them,” Jia says. “They needed to fight not only the fire but also [a lack of] time. Additionally, they needed to overcome obstacles, like lack of communication and terrible visibility. Their bravery inspired me.”</p> \n <p>Today’s firefighters use outdated technology, he says. He compares their equipment to cellphones of the past—which offered only basic features such as calling and texting. He wants to give first responders commercially available smart technologies to “jump-start them to the next generation of technology,” he says.</p> \n <p>“We are developing a solution,” he says, “to try and address all three of these pain points: poor visibility, communication, and data.”</p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"The Longan Vision FVS augmented-reality visor\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzM0NQ.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photo: Longan Vision \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p>The visor [above] uses mixed-reality technology: AR and thermal imaging. A temperature sensor identifies the location of the fire. The headset allows firefighters to stream live video to a central command terminal so other responders can learn details about the structure and determine how to fight the blaze.</p> \n <p>“In a smoky building, you can’t see with the human eye,” Jia says. “Our technology can actually see through the smoke. It can give firefighters super vision, tell them where there’s a victim and where they can go past an object without bumping into it.</p> \n <p>“I believe our product with AR technology could help them prevent casualties, boost their efficiency, and send our heroes back to their families.”</p> \n <p>The images can be saved and reviewed later for training or for investigations by insurance companies. Longan Vision also plans to collect the data to create predictive models for firefighters, Jia says.</p> \n <p>The visor is compatible with many styles of firefighter helmets including models used in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Jia says there currently aren’t any other smart visors for firefighter helmets on the market.</p> \n <h3 class=\"tisubhead\">OVERCOMING OBSTACLES</h3> \n <p>As with any startup, the biggest hurdle has been a lack of funding for product research, design, development, and hiring experienced workers, Jia says.</p> \n <p>“In general,” he says, “no budget means no progress, and no progress means death to a startup.”</p> \n <p>The company began presenting its work at conferences and participating in startup competitions including those held by the IEEE Entrepreneurship initiative.</p> \n <p>Jia says those activities helped bring visibility to the company and attract investors. The founders also developed a business plan and began hiring experienced engineers “who have the passion” and are “willing to grow with the company,” he says.</p> \n <p>The first round of seed funding closed in July 2019. The company won contracts worth more than US&nbsp;$300,000, which went toward development, Jia says. One investor is <a href=\"https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/101.nsf/eng/home\">Innovation Solutions Canada</a>, which helps fund the country’s startups.</p> \n <h3 class=\"tisubhead\">MULTIPERSON TEMPERATURE CHECK</h3> \n <p>When <em>The Institute</em> spoke with Jia in July to see how the company was faring during the pandemic, he told us about Gatekeeper. In addition to AR and thermal-imaging technology, it also uses a facial-recognition system.</p> \n <figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n  <img alt=\"Left, photo of the Gatekeeper camera system, right, a scan showing thermal readings.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3MzM1Mg.jpeg\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Photos: Longan Vision \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption>\n     The Gatekeeper measurement component [left] monitors the calibrated temperature of an area. The Gatekeeper camera component [right] scans individuals who cross its path and produces a visual image of each person and displays the individual’s temperature.&nbsp; \n   </figcaption> </img> \n </figure> \n <p>Jia worked with McMaster’s business incubator program, <a href=\"http://theforge.mcmaster.ca/index.php/programs/the-forge-business-incubator/\">T</a><a href=\"https://theforge.mcmaster.ca/index.php/programs/the-forge-business-incubator/\">he Forge</a>, on that detection system, which uses two thermal-imaging tools to get accurate temperature readings. The Gatekeeper measurement component monitors the calibrated temperature of an area. The Gatekeeper camera component (GCC) scans individuals who cross its path.</p> \n <p>The gathered data is sent to a computer that has a built-in image-processing program, which looks for variances between the two feeds. Information from the GCC produces a visual image of each person and displays a message on the screen identifying each individual’s temperature. Should an elevated temperature be detected, the individual can be asked to return home or seek medical attention.</p> \n <p>Jia says his system is less expensive than others on the market because Gatekeeper uses off-the-shelf components.</p> \n <h3 class=\"tisubhead\">STAR TREATMENT</h3> \n <p>Jia says he was humbled to receive the IEEE entrepreneurship recognition, which he says has opened up many doors.</p> \n <p>“It’s a big honor to be named an IEEE Entrepreneurship Star. It gives us a really big thumbs-up,” he says. “Receiving the award is also helping us on the development side.

He says much of his master’s thesis was based on research he found in the library.</p> \n <p>“We need access to papers,” he says. “That means a lot to us, to be honest.

But many of us can’t eyeball the distance on our own.</p> \n <p>To help, IEEE Graduate Student Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/trushal-sardhara/\">Trushal Sardhara</a> and other students from various universities in India have developed the mobile app Coready! It prompts its users to maintain social distancing by alerting them when they get too close to each other.</p> \n <p>Sardhara is pursuing a master’s degree in mechatronics at the <a href=\"https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite.html\">Hamburg University of Technology</a>.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute\"><em>The Institute</em></a>&nbsp;asked him about the mobile app.</p> \n <p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p> \n <p><strong>What problem are you trying to solve? </strong></p> \n <p>Many people are finding it difficult to remember to wash their hands frequently, wear masks when stepping outside, and most importantly, maintain social distancing.</p> \n <p>We were inspired to create the mobile app—Coready!—by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\">Nudge Theory</a>, developed by behavioral economist Richard Thaler [The theory suggests that positive reinforcement&nbsp;and indirect suggestions can&nbsp;influence&nbsp;the behavior and&nbsp;decision making&nbsp;of groups or individuals.] Coready! can help protect people from contracting the virus by nudging the user when someone else [nearby] with the app is failing to maintain [a safe distance].</p> \n <p><strong>What technologies are you using? </strong></p> \n <p>Coready! uses Bluetooth Low Energy [BLE] technology to [track] if someone, who also had the app installed on their phone, is in the vicinity of the user. The mobile app continuously transmits a unique identifier using BLE technology. Other mobile devices [with the app] that come in the vicinity of this signal receive it, identify the signal, and process it in the application.</p> \n <p><strong>Explain how your project works. </strong></p> \n <p>When another person, who also has Coready! installed on his phone, is within a 1.5-meter radius of the other user, the app sends a notification to his phone as a warning. The distance between users is calculated using the strength of the normalized Bluetooth signal.</p> \n <p>The app can also determine whether the user interacts with people outside of his social bubble—who he comes into contact with the most—and violates social distancing. Coready! tracks and keeps a secure log of how many other app users he is coming into contact with and a Social Bubble Score is generated based on the information collected. The size of the user’s social bubble will be directly proportional to the score defined by the mobile app. If the user’s score is high, that means they have an increased chance of contracting the virus.</p> \n <p>Coready! also can be integrated into third-party mobile apps being used for contact tracing.</p> \n <p><strong>What challenges have you faced, and how did you overcome them? </strong></p> \n <p>The main challenge was to develop an application that can work even if it is closed or if the user’s phone is in locked mode.</p> \n <p>We encountered limitations with Android OS because it does not allow any application to run if the user closes it or locks his phone. To solve this, we used technology provided by Android OS that shows in the users’ notification bar that the application is still running.</p> \n <p><strong>What is the potential impact of the technology? </strong></p> \n <p>This application will help people maintain physical distance and limit their social bubble.</p> \n <p>It can also be used by various organizations that have a large number of employees to ensure that social distancing rules aren’t violated unknowingly in places such as corporate offices, educational institutions, and manufacturing facilities.</p> \n <p><strong>How close are you to the final product? </strong></p> \n <p>Coready! can be downloaded on Android and iOS platforms.</p> \n <p>We are continuing to update its features. We are currently working on implementing a contact tracing feature using blockchain technology to make it more robust, private, and decentralized.</p> \n <div class=\"mobileShow\"> \n  <h3 class=\"RptHdBackBarMobile\"><span class=\"BackArrowBlkBkgrd\">&lt;</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/covid19-ieee-resources\">Back to IEEE COVID-19 Resources</a></h3> \n </div> \n <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/oV0OT154D8I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /> \n</link>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3Nzk0OQ.jpeg","linkMd5":"2823a9bc66955628e7a86527004e595b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn8@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-11-855_18dea21cc5d0bb2b.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":930,"sourceBytes":50153,"destBytes":48422,"author":"The Institute’s Editorial Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzYxMjU3Mg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-14-803_b67305c597a3f2e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/oV0OT154D8I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-50-25-040_a97ceda5973aeef8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594946},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"The AxiDraw MiniKit Is the Modern XY Plotter You Didn’t Know You Wanted ","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-axidraw-minikit-is-the-modern-xy-plotter-you-didnt-know-you-wanted","description":"<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Illustration of the AxiDraw MiniKit\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzUyMg.jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Illustration: James Provost \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> </img> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>I’ll be honest: when the original</strong> <a href=\"https://axidraw.com/\">AxiDraw</a> came out from <a href=\"https://www.evilmadscientist.com/\">Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories</a> in 2016, I thought it was cute but a curiosity. My thought was that if you were going to play around with reintroducing the venerable technology of the pen-and-paper X-Y plotter, why not do something really different, like the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-iboardbot-brings-xy-plotters-into-the-cloud-age\">iBoardBot remote-controlled erasable miniature whiteboard</a>? And the AxiDraw’s US $475 price tag felt steep for a spindly-looking contraption that required the user to manually position each sheet of paper, one at a time.</p> \n<p>Boy, was I wrong. The AxiDraw took off—folks have embraced it for creating <a href=\"https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/pen-plotter-1\">generative art</a>, <a href=\"https://ubir.buffalo.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10477/78136/Eadie_buffalo_0656M_15885.pdf?sequence=3\">making microfluidic systems with wax</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/11/16/axidraw-modified-to-laser-cut-and-uv-light-paint/\">laser cutting,</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-Photograph-of-a-computer-numerical-control-CNC-drawing-machine-AxiDraw-V3_fig4_340864484\">engraving of all types</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oPfZdZaTGG4\">testing computer mice</a>, and much more. In short, it became a general-purpose platform for all sorts of experiments, and the reason was also the reason for that high price tag: the AxiDraw’s consistent precision. But there’s a way to get that precision and start experimenting for less money, albeit with a couple of trade-offs, with the $325 <a href=\"https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/924\">AxiDraw MiniKit</a>, which came out late last year.</p> \n<p>The first trade-off is the size: the MiniKit’s drawing area is 15 by 10 centimeters, while the standard AxiDraw can handle up to 30 by 21.8 cm. But the MiniKit’s smaller size may be a boon to some, fitting better on a desk or workbench, and easier to transport. The second trade-off is time, specifically yours, because the MiniKit is the first AxiDraw to come in build-it-yourself kit form.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Illustration of the parts of the AxiDraw MiniKit.\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzYyNA.jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Illustration: James Provost \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption> \n    <strong>Electromechanical Medley:</strong> The AxiDraw MiniKit takes a few hours to assemble and adjust. Specialized tools, such as a Torx L-wrench, are included, but you must supply some conventional tools, such as a screwdriver. The aluminum rails have sharp edges that require care during assembly, but end caps are included to protect users. Drawing implements can be held either vertically, or at a 45-degree angle, which is more suitable for things like fountain pens. The MiniKit is controlled via free software that can plot vector files, including stipple portraits or handwriting fonts. \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>As someone who is a lot more confident with circuits than cogs, assembling the MiniKit looked a little daunting at first. All kinds of wheels, minutely varied screws and washers, and various mystery components were crammed into the box. Fortunately, the instructions are some of the most thoughtfully detailed that I’ve ever seen, with many pictures and tips on identifying the M3x8 button-head screw versus the M4x8 torx tapping screw.</p> \n<p>The MiniKit’s x-axis is formed by one long fixed rail. A movable chassis runs along this rail, and it supports the y-axis rail in turn, to which the penholder is affixed. Construction took a few hours: The trickiest parts were getting the toothed drive belt in position with adequate tension and adjusting the wheels that grip the MiniKit’s rails so that things can move freely but without any looseness.</p> \n<p>The MiniKit uses two stepper motors to position the penholder, but rather than having the motors drive motion along the x and y axes directly, both motors are placed on opposite ends of the x-axis rail. The drive belt is looped through the movable chassis and along the y-axis in such a way that turning one motor while holding the other in place causes the penholder to move at a 45 degree angle to the rails—if the MiniKit were a compass, this would be along the NE to SW line. Turning the other motor, while holding the first one still, moves the penholder along the NW to SE line. This means the axis controlled by each motor is effectively rotated through 45 degrees, so the MiniKit’s microcontroller takes care of mapping incoming x-y coordinates to the appropriate motor signals.</p> \n<p>The MiniKit is primarily controlled from a desktop or laptop using an extension to <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a>, an open source vector-drawing tool. The software is also required for the final assembly step: calibrating the servo that raises and lowers the penholder. However, many other software options for controlling AxiDraw plotters exist, and it’s <a href=\"https://github.com/evil-mad/AxiDraw-Processing\">pretty straightforward to write your own code</a> using the <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">Processing language</a>, which is designed for creating ­computer-assisted and computer-generated art, or write a Python script.</p> \n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/U2i1SpaxfKw\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Once I had the servo calibrated and pushed the penholder by hand to its home position in the upper left corner of a page, I fitted a roller-ball pen into the MiniKit—you have a choice of holding pens in a vertical or slanted position, the slant being ­especially suitable if you want to try, say, a fountain pen. The test graphic rendered perfectly, first time, scratching out a welcome message in a font that’s a believable imitation of cursive handwriting (or at least how we used to write cursive, before keyboards caused our penmanship to atrophy).</p> \n<p>Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories also offers a handy free stand-alone utility program called StippleGen. You can feed an image into the utility, and it creates a version made up of monochromatic stippled dots of various sizes. The number of dots and their size range is controllable, and the program also tries to determine the best, shortest, path between the dots, so as to minimize the amount of time that the AxiDraw spends moving around.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Illustration of the belt motors of the MiniKit.  \" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzY0NA.jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"ai\"> \n   <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n     Illustration: James Provost \n   </figcaption> \n   <figcaption> \n    <strong>Axial tilt:</strong> The rotations of the MiniKit stepper motors do not directly correspond to the x and y axes. Instead, its belt arrangement means that holding one motor still and turning the other moves the drawing head along either a or b axes, as shown. The onboard microcontroller takes care of the math required to transform x and y coordinates to a and b coordinates. \n   </figcaption> \n  </div> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>The resulting file can then be imported into Inkscape and plotted. Warning though: This can take quite a while. For my first test I used a photo of some Irish passage graves, which needed about 5,000 dots to be recognizable: It took about 2 hours to complete drawing the image, taking over a second to draw each dot and move to the next. (I was able to shave quite a bit off that time by ­reducing how high the MiniKit lifted the pen between dots in later tests.) The stipple plots work best with faces, which tend to be discernible at lower dot counts than other photographic subjects, no doubt due to the specialized facial-recognition neural hardware in our brains.</p> \n<p>In short, the AxiDraw MiniKit rewards experimentation—there are many things to try, but you don’t have to master them all before you get rewarding results. And if nothing else, it should make addressing envelopes easier!</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/8VoMOTE752Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":1936,"bgimg":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzUzOA.jpeg","linkMd5":"f0cc1b320090c9b9deb94c7081fb252d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-50-11-884_1cf5af38fb774cbd.webp","destWidth":1240,"destHeight":990,"sourceBytes":195168,"destBytes":132632,"author":"Stephen Cass","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzUyMg.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-12-979_ced632f6cc29bddf.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzYyNA.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-50-11-676_406986445fa6c7ef.webp","https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3NzY0NA.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn69@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-14-922_353c5f537b1ada6c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/8VoMOTE752Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-50-13-085_2061de32556185f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598280594951},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:49:54","title":"Minuscule RoBeetle Turns Liquid Methanol Into Muscle Power","link":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/robeetle-liquid-methanol","description":"<p>It’s no secret that one of the most significant constraints on robots is power. Most robots need lots of it, and it has to come from somewhere, with that somewhere usually being a battery because there simply aren’t many other good options. Batteries, however, are famous for having poor energy density, and the smaller your robot is, the more of a problem this becomes. And the issue with batteries goes beyond the battery itself, but also carries over into all the other components&nbsp;that it takes to turn the stored energy into useful work, which again is a particular problem for small-scale robots.</p> \n<p>In a paper published this week in <em>Science Robotics</em>, researchers from the&nbsp;University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, demonstrate RoBeetle, an 88-milligram four legged robot that runs entirely on methanol, a power-dense liquid fuel. Without any electronics at all, it uses an exceptionally clever bit of mechanical autonomy to convert methanol vapor directly into forward motion, one millimeter-long step at a time.</p> \n<!--nextpage--> \n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vd6tN19wilQ\" width=\"620\"></iframe></p> \n<p>It’s not entirely clear from the video how the robot actually works, so let’s go through how it’s put together, and then look at the actuation cycle.</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"Robot beetle powered by methanol\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODMyOQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image: Science Robotics \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    RoBeetle (A) uses a methanol-based actuation mechanism (B).&nbsp;The robot’s body&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;includes the fuel tank subassembly (D), a&nbsp;tank lid, transmission, and sliding shutter (E), bottom side of the sliding shutter (F), nickel-titanium-platinum composite wire and leaf spring (G), and&nbsp;front legs and hind legs with bioinspired backward-oriented claws (H). \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>The body of RoBeetle is a boxy fuel tank that you can fill with methanol by poking a syringe through a fuel inlet hole. It’s a quadruped, more or less, with fixed hind legs and two front legs attached to a single transmission that moves them both at once in a sort of rocking forward and up followed by backward and down motion. The transmission is hooked up to a leaf spring that’s tensioned to always pull the legs backward, such that when the robot isn’t being actuated, the spring and transmission keep its front legs more or less vertical and allow the robot to stand. Those horns are primarily there to hold the leaf spring in place, but they’ve got little hooks that can carry stuff, too.</p> \n<p>The actuator itself is a nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape-memory alloy (SMA), which is just a wire that gets longer when it heats up and then shrinks back down when it cools. SMAs are fairly common and used for all kinds of things, but what makes this particular SMA a little different is that it’s been messily coated with platinum. The “messily” part is important for a reason that we’ll get to in just a second.</p> \n<aside class=\"inlay pullquote xlrg\">\n  The way that the sliding vent is attached to the transmission is the really clever bit about this robot, because it means that the motion of the wire itself is used to modulate the flow of fuel through a purely mechanical system. Essentially, it’s an actuator and a sensor at the same time. \n</aside> \n<p>One end of the SMA wire is attached to the middle of the leaf spring, while the other end runs above the back of the robot where it’s stapled to an anchor block on the robot’s rear end. With the SMA wire hooked up but not actuated (i.e., cold rather than warm), it’s short enough that the leaf spring gets pulled back, rocking the legs forward and up. The last component is embedded in the robot’s back, right along the spine and directly underneath the SMA actuator. It’s a sliding vent attached to the transmission, so that the vent is open when the SMA wire is cold and the leaf spring is pulled back, and closed when the SMA wire is warm and the leaf spring is relaxed. The way that the sliding vent is attached to the transmission is the really clever bit about this robot, because it means that the motion of the wire itself is used to modulate the flow of fuel through a purely mechanical system. Essentially, it’s an actuator and a sensor at the same time.</p> \n<p>The actuation cycle that causes the robot to walk begins with a full fuel tank and a cold SMA wire. There’s tension on the leaf spring, pulling the transmission back and rocking the legs forward and upward. The transmission also pulls the sliding vent into the open position, allowing methanol vapor to escape up out of the fuel tank and into the air, where it wafts past the SMA wire that runs directly above the vent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The platinum facilitates a reaction of the methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) with oxygen in the air (combustion, although not the dramatic flaming and explosive kind) to generate a couple of water molecules and some carbon dioxide plus a bunch of heat, and this is where the messy platinum coating is important, because messy means lots of surface area for the platinum to interact with as much methanol as possible. In just a second or two the temperature of the SMA wire skyrockets from 50 to 100 <span>º</span>C and it expands, allowing the leaf spring about 0.1 mm of slack. As the leaf spring relaxes, the transmission moves the legs backwards and downwards, and the robot pulls itself forward about 1.2 mm. At the same time, the transmission is closing off the sliding vent, cutting off the supply of methanol vapor. Without the vapor reacting with the platinum and generating heat, in about a second and a half, the SMA wire cools down. As it does, it shrinks, pulling on the leaf spring and starting the cycle over again. Top speed is 0.76 mm/s (0.05 body-lengths per second).</p> \n<p>An interesting environmental effect is that the speed of the robot can be enhanced by a gentle breeze. This is because air moving over the SMA wire cools it down a bit faster while also blowing away any residual methanol from around the vents, shutting down the reaction more completely. RoBeetle can carry more than its own body weight in fuel, and it takes approximately 155 minutes for a full tank of methanol to completely evaporate. It’s worth noting that despite the very high energy density of methanol, this is actually a stupendously inefficient way of powering a robot, with an estimated end-to-end efficiency of just 0.48 percent. Not 48 percent, mind you, but 0.48 percent, while in general, powering SMAs with electricity is much more efficient.</p> \n<p>However, you have to look at the entire system that would be necessary to deliver that electricity, and for a robot as small as RoBeetle, the researchers say that it’s basically impossible. The lightest commercially available battery and power supply that would deliver enough juice to heat up an SMA actuator weighs about 800 mg, nearly 10 times the total weight of RoBeetle itself. From that perspective, RoBeetle’s efficiency is actually pretty good.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"xlrg\" role=\"img\"> \n <img alt=\"RoBeetle\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzY3ODM0OQ.jpeg\"> \n  <figcaption class=\"hi-cap\">\n    Image:&nbsp;A. Kitterman/Science Robotics; adapted from R.L.T./MIT \n  </figcaption> \n  <figcaption>\n    Comparison of various untethered microrobots and bioinspired soft robots that use different power and actuation strategies. \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<p>There are some other downsides to RoBeetle we should mention—it can only move forwards, not backwards, and it can’t steer. Its speed isn’t adjustable, and once it starts walking, it’ll walk until it either breaks or runs out of fuel. The researchers have some ideas about the speed, at least, pointing out that increasing the speed of fuel delivery by using pressurized liquid fuels like butane or propane would increase the actuator output frequency. And the frequency, amplitude, and efficiency of the SMAs themselves can be massively increased “by arranging multiple fiber-like thin artificial muscles in hierarchical configurations similar to those observed in sarcomere-based animal muscle,” making RoBeetle even more beetle-like.</p> \n<p>As for sensing, RoBeetle’s 230-mg payload is enough to carry passive sensors, but getting those sensors to usefully interact with the robot itself to enable any kind of autonomy remains a challenge. Mechanically intelligence is certainly possible, though, and we can imagine RoBeetle adopting some of the same sorts of systems that have been proposed for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/jpl-design-for-a-clockwork-rover-to-explore-venus\">the clockwork rover that JPL wants to use for Venus exploration</a>. The researchers also mention how RoBeetle could potentially serve as a model for microbots capable of aerial locomotion, which is something we’d very much like to see.</p> \n<p>“<a href=\"https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/5/45/eaba0015\">An 88-milligram insect-scale autonomous crawling robot driven by a catalytic artificial muscle</a>,” by Xiufeng Yang, Longlong Chang, and Néstor O.

The iron oxide&nbsp;triggered a chemical reaction, coating the bricks’ cavities with thin layers of PEDOT, the polymer known as poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene).&nbsp;</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>Bricks emerged from the oven with a blackish-blue hue—and the ability to conduct electricity.</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>D’Arcy’s team then attached copper leads to two coated bricks. To stop the blocks from shorting out while stacked together, the</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;researchers separated&nbsp;the blocks with a thin plastic sheet of polypropylene. A sulfuric-acid based solution was used as a liquid electrolyte, and the bricks were connected via&nbsp;the copper leads to a AAA battery for about one minute. Once charged, the bricks could power a white LED for 11 minutes.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>If applied to 50 bricks, the supercapacitor could power 3 watts’ worth of lights for about 50 minutes, D’Arcy said. The current set-up can be recharged 10,000 times and still retain about 90 percent of its original capacitance. Researchers are&nbsp;developing the polymer’s chemistry further in an effort to reach 100,000 recharges.&nbsp;</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>However, the&nbsp;St. Louis researchers are not alone in the quest to use&nbsp;everyday (if unusual) materials to make supercapacitors.</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>In Scotland, a team at the University of Glasgow <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_722512_en.html\">has developed</a> a flexible device that can be fully charged with human sweat. Researchers applied a thin layer of PEDOT to a piece of polyester cellulose cloth that absorbs the wearer’s perspiration, creating an electrochemical reaction and generating electricity. The idea is that these coated cloths could power wearable electronics, using a tiny amount of sweat to keep running.</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>The Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad is exploring the use of corn husks in high-voltage supercapacitors. India’s corn producing states generate substantial amounts of husk waste, which researchers say can be converted into activated carbon electrodes. The biomass offers a potentially cheaper and simpler alternative to electrodes derived from polymers and similar materials, according to a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378775320306911\">recent study</a> in </span><em>Journal of Power Sources.</em></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>However, to really make inroads into the dominance of batteries, where a chemical reaction drives creation of a voltage,</span></span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>&nbsp;supercapacitors will need to significantly increase their energy density. D’Arcy said his electrically charged bricks are “two orders of magnitude away” from lithium-ion batteries, in terms of the amount of energy they can store.&nbsp;</span></span></p> \n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-32bb6e05-7fff-53e5-2e80-ea3460b6a0d3\"><span>“That’s another thing we’re trying to do—make our polymer store more energy,” he said. “A lot of groups are trying to do this,” he added, “but they didn’t do it in bricks.”</span></span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IeeeSpectrumFullText/~4/YHXcNziIQOY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"
