One of our most requested features from the past year is cherry-picking, and we’re excited to release it in GitHub Desktop 2.7.</p> \n<p>Cherry-picking is a handy feature for when you would like to copy commits from one branch to another. What more intuitive way to copy a commit than by simply picking it up, dragging it to your branch, and dropping it there!</p> \n<p>For example, you start working on a new feature, and several commits into development you identify an existing bug in the underlying architecture. You create a couple of commits to fix that bug. Then, you decide that the fix needs to go into production and can’t wait until this feature is finished. No problem! Just create a release branch and use GitHub Desktop to cherry-pick those commits to your new branch for the hotfix.</p> \n<h2 id=\"drag-and-dropping-commits\">Drag and dropping commits<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57058#drag-and-dropping-commits\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Drag and dropping commits\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Want to cherry-pick a single commit? Just start dragging it.</p> \n<p>What about multiple commits? Shift+click the range you would like to copy, and drag away.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/multiple-commits.gif\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"cherry-picking-features\">Cherry-picking features<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57058#cherry-picking-features\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Cherry-picking features\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>There are several goodies that come with cherry-picking:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Undo</strong>: You cherry-picked a group of commits and immediately realized that you cherry-picked one too many. That’s not a problem. Just click undo in the success banner to remove those commits, and it puts you back on the branch you started from.</li> \n <li><strong>Conflict resolution</strong>: Not all cherry-picks are this easy, and conflicts may arise. The same conflict resolution dialog you’re familiar with from merging and rebasing is available for taking care of merge conflicts. </li> \n <li><strong>Context menu</strong>: Not a fan of drag and drop? Just right click on a commit or set of commits, and select the cherry-pick option to open a branch dialog to select your target branch.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2 id=\"commit-attribution-improvements\">Commit attribution improvements<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57058#commit-attribution-improvements\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"Commit attribution improvements\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Cherry-picking isn’t all that is new since version 2.6. Switching between personal and work repos? GitHub Desktop helps you avoid making misattributed commits. Now, your avatar will display a warning icon, and clicking it provides an easy way for you to update your Git config to match an email associated with your GitHub account.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-57062\" srcset=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=2400 2400w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=1536 1536w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/112536176-5eb67e00-8d6a-11eb-91c3-764192f78eb7.png?resize=1024%2C538?w=2048 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"what-else-would-you-like-to-see-in-github-desktop\">What else would you like to see in GitHub Desktop?<a href=\"https://github.blog/?p=57058#what-else-would-you-like-to-see-in-github-desktop\" class=\"heading-link\" aria-label=\"What else would you like to see in GitHub Desktop?\" data-anchorjs-icon=\"#\" style=\"padding-left: 0.375em;\"></a></h2> \n<p>Our users requested cherry-picking and we listened.
