As Apple seems to get even more aggressive in forcing developers to integrate in-app purchase frameworks into their apps, this change sets Apple up to avoid upsetting users.</p>\n<p>The text of the announcement reads that, &#8220;bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal issues.&#8221; Developers won&#8217;t be able to submit updates with new features or content updates, the focus of this rule change is firmly on the security/usability front.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This change was<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-reveals-new-developer-technologies-to-foster-the-next-generation-of-apps/\"> previously announced</a> in June.</p>\n<p>This change is unlikely to satiate critics hoping for more sweeping changes. In many ways this change helps Apple avoid being painted as the villain in new developer skirmishes. The stars were aligning for Apple to shoot itself in the foot by not allowing a developer to fix any vulnerabilities in their app while they were in a standoff with the company.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oSQM2gqAZm8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:49:12 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"6fb2d7ffd24049c17d7ce1e2b1ae2e42","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Lucas Matney","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-252_d6a9c649c1d03013.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oSQM2gqAZm8:aL-zTM7QkYI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-244_3b4aeb432ecbb5bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oSQM2gqAZm8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn50@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-01-087_cbc6bce224a468fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726654},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Daily Crunch: Netflix sets some content free","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038292","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\">Netflix <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> tests a free promotional offering, Amazon&#8217;s drone delivery gets trial flight approval from the FAA and Neuralink shows off its human-brain tech.

The service is an expansion on PayPal&#8217;s existing lineup of Pay Later solutions, which also includes<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/home\"> PayPal Credit&#8217;s</a> revolving credit line and its <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/credit-pala-easy-payments#payments\">Easy Payments</a>.</p>\n<p>With Pay in 4, customers can choose to pay for purchases between $30 and $600 over a six-week period. Because it&#8217;s included with the merchant&#8217;s existing PayPal pricing, they won&#8217;t have to pay more fees to offer the option to their customers &#8212; as they do with several competitive &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; services.</p>\n<p>For customers, the short-term payment option allows U.S. customers to pay for a purchase over time, without fees or interest. After their initial payment, the remaining three payments are automated. The feature will also appear in the customer&#8217;s PayPal wallet, where the payments can be managed.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Pay in 4 builds on PayPal&#8217;s tests with Easy Payments. The company says it learned that, at some price points, customers preferred the option to pay over a six-week period.</p>\n<p>The service clearly is meant to compete with rival fintech services like Klarna, AfterPay, Affirm and others, which may or may not charge fees or interest up front, <a href=\"https://money.com/affirm-afterpay-klarna-interest-fees/\">but do often tack on late fees when consumers can&#8217;t pay.</a> Klarna, for example, <a href=\"https://www.klarna.com/us/what-is-klarna/\">even offers a direct competitor</a> with its program offering four interest-free payments charged to your card every two weeks.</p>\n<p>Because PayPal is tied to a customer&#8217;s payment card or bank account, it reduces the chance of a forgotten payment. But if the customer can&#8217;t pay, there will be fees involved. These will vary by state, as each state has its own late fee structure which PayPal will abide by, the company says.</p>\n<p>“In today’s challenging retail and economic environment, merchants are looking for trusted ways to help drive average order values and conversion, without taking on additional costs. At the same time, consumers are looking for more flexible and responsible ways to pay, especially online,” said Doug Bland, SVP, Global Credit at PayPal, in a statement about the launch. “With Pay in 4, we’re building on our history as the originator in the buy now, pay later space, coupled with PayPal’s trust and ubiquity, to enable a responsible and flexible way for consumers to shop while providing merchants with a tool that helps drive sales, loyalty and customer choice,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vAk4bEjsbwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 21:59:24 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"6f0b1986fb1071394297cc04c5a36d92","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:-BTjWOF_DHI":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vAk4bEjsbwM:decy_EcelVs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn6@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-606_8000aebae944b294.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vAk4bEjsbwM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn54@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-283_5bb13385d67a1e5c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726654},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Reid Hoffman, Zynga’s Mark Pincus aim to raise $600M for tech-focused SPAC","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038283","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Reinvent Technology Partners, a new special purpose acquisition company formed by famed investor and serial entrepreneur <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"reid-hoffman\">Reid Hoffman, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Zynga founder Mark Pincus and veteran hedge fund manager Michael Thompson, filed Monday for a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819848/000121390020024426/fs12020_reinventtech.htm#T991\">$600 million initial public offering</a>.</p>\n<p>The SPAC was formed by Hoffman, Pincus and Thompson, formerly of BHR Capital, with the intention of merging with a technology company.

Often people view these companies from the outside in<br />\nas perfect, uninterrupted growth stories that were almost pre-ordained. However, we realize that behind these mythical growth stories are many hard fought cycles of invention and reinvention. Invention is when a company builds a new product and achieves growth in an adjacent market, such as Amazon developing AWS. Reinvention is when a company has to adapt its core products and services to continue growing in an existing market, as Netflix did moving from DVDs to streaming.</p>\n<p>For many public tech companies &#8212; especially mid-cap sized &#8212; these cycles can prove challenging to navigate while maintaining investor alignment. We went through our own invention and reinvention cycles while public at Zynga and LinkedIn, and it wasn&#8217;t easy.</p>\n<p>We are excited to be a new kind of venture capital partner at the table for one of the many tech companies set to go public over the next few years and to help it maintain a growth mindset, be bold, and go for it in the face of pressure to deliver quarterly results.</p>\n<p>We hope our experience, ideas, and insights can make a difference as we partner with a founder and CEO as they build a market-leading company that delivers products and services that matter in people&#8217;s lives.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lyvE7sFVgTY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 22:52:17 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"50cb52186c544d00092f7073a9523798","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn18@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-283_f8763ead184bbff7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lyvE7sFVgTY:uDG-_LsWiAs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_6/2020/09/01/01-28-59-189_36017ddcf1748113.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lyvE7sFVgTY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-28-59-275_1f000df242f0fc1c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726655},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Dorian raises $3.25M for its no-code, interactive storytelling platform","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038176","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">With <a href=\"http://dorian.live\">Dorian</a>, co-founder and CEO Julia Palatovska said she&#8217;s hoping to empower fiction writers and other storytellers to create their own games.</p>\n<p>The startup is announcing that it has raised $3.25 million in seed funding led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/march-capital-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"march-capital-partners\">March Capital Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> with participation from VGames, Konvoy Ventures, London Venture Partners, Michael Chow (co-creator of the Twitch series &#8220;Artificial&#8221;), Andover Ventures and talent management company Night Media.</p>\n<p>In addition, John Howell, the former vice president of partnerships at Twitch, has joined the board as an independent director.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Palatskova previously worked in gaming as the head of business development at G5 Entertainment, and she said she&#8217;d also become entranced by narrative games and interactive fiction.

And as Palatskova noted, you can also collaborate on a story in real-time with other writers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of writer productivity, I would say there is almost no difference between creating interactive fiction on our engine and just writing fiction,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038207\" style=\"width: 393px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038207\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2038207\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?w=383\" alt=\"Dorian Gunmen Scene\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dorian</p></div></p>\n<p>From what I could see, the resulting games look similar to what you&#8217;d find on platforms like<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/pocket-gems-launches-episode/\"> Pocket Gems&#8217; Episode</a>, where there aren&#8217;t a lot of technical bells and whistles, so the story, dialogue and character choices move to the forefront.</p>\n<p>When I brought up the open-source game creation software <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine_(software)\">Twine</a>, Palatskova said Twine is &#8220;just a tool.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to be more like Roblox, both the tools and the distribution,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>In other words, writers use Dorian to create interactive stories, but they also publish those stories using the Dorian app. (The writer still owns the resulting intellectual property.) Palatskova noted that Dorian also provides detailed analytics on how readers are responding, which is helpful not just for creating stories, but also for monetizing via premium story choices.</p>\n<p>In fact, Dorian says that in early tests involving around 50,000 players, writers were able to improve monetization by 70% after only one or two iterations. And Palatskova noted that with Dorian&#8217;s games — unlike an interactive film such as &#8220;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&#8221; —&#8221;It&#8217;s fast and easy to test multiple branches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dorian is currently invite-only, but the plan is to launch more broadly later this year.

As a part of the deal, OfferUp said it planned to eventually combine the businesses&#8217; respective marketplaces into one but didn&#8217;t get into specifics of how that merger would take place. Today, OfferUp <a href=\"https://blog.offerup.com/download-offerup-letgo-today-5795e213d5d5\">says</a> it has now combined the OfferUp and letgo marketplaces into a new app and explained how the transition will work for former letgo users.</p>\n<p>The newly combined OfferUp and letgo application is available across both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/offerup-buy-sell-simple/id468996152\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.offerup&#38;hl=en_US\">Android</a>, and expands the number of deals, buyers and sellers, by nature of its combined communities. With the expansion and merger, users on the new marketplace will also gain access to features like nationwide shipping and OfferUp&#8217;s safety programs like TruYou and Community MeetUp Spots. In addition, the listings on the app will never expire, though letgo had expired them after 30 days.</p>\n<p>Existing letgo users will be directed to download the new OfferUp &#38; letgo app, then use their letgo sign-in information to create their new OfferUp account. When they sign in, their account&#8217;s reputation, including their ratings, sales and purchase history, and join date, will transfer from letgo to OfferUp.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>However, items users had listed on letgo will not move over to OfferUp. Instead, they&#8217;ll need to be reposted. For customers who were in the middle of transactions, the company is offering a website legacy.letgo.com where those transactions can be completed. This site will be shut down after September 21, so it&#8217;s being advised that all parties quickly complete their sales.</p>\n<p>As a result of the merger, customers with an active subscription to Super Boost Mode on letgo will have that subscription automatically cancelled. They can choose to use OfferUp&#8217;s Promote Plus service instead, but won&#8217;t be automatically signed up or opted in.</p>\n<p>There will be some other differences between the two marketplaces that letgo users should understand. While the merger does bring nationwide shipping to former letgo users, it also means that some of letgo&#8217;s categories are no longer supported. These <a href=\"https://help.offerup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032329711-Prohibited-items-guidelines\">include</a> jobs, services, rental listings and gift cards.</p>\n<p>In addition, letgo won&#8217;t be supported in Canada due to the merger and OfferUp hasn&#8217;t yet reached Canada either. That means the company will lose some number of Canadian users as a part of the deal.</p>\n<p>At the time of the deal, letgo brought to the table an app that had over 100 million worldwide downloads, so there is potential for at least some portion of its lapsed users to reactivate their accounts upon their next launch. The two apps had also been neck-and-neck in terms of their App Store category rankings before the acquisition, though the iPhone version of OfferUp had a slight lead.</p>\n<p>As of yesterday, OfferUp was still ahead with a ranking of No. 4 in iPhone&#8217;s Shopping category, compared with letgo at No. 12, per data from Sensor Tower.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/IMg_jxi8NNQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:03:14 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ad244f9b58f03e64183fb06c1d2c21ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-29-01-229_359105e13f4e88c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IMg_jxi8NNQ:gE-_tCfpW2Y:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn98@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-29-02-275_afa795d1c7901881.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/IMg_jxi8NNQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn61@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-28-59-292_36881e994dba0e27.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726655},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"The New Paper offers a ‘fact-first’ news digest in text message form","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038011","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Tired of signing up for <a href=\"http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters\">email newsletters</a>?

(Think of it as the digital equivalent of those piles of unread New Yorkers.)</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that text messaging is such a personal channel also means that readers aren&#8217;t likely to stick around unless they&#8217;re actually getting what they want.

And more than 7,000 paying subscribers have already signed up.</p>\n<p>Currently, the digest consists of six headlines, all linking to reporting from other publications, plus a link to The Daily Dash, which provides a high-level snapshot of stock market performance, the current state of the coronavirus pandemic and more.</p>\n<p>Both Aft and Necef emphasized that The New Paper&#8217;s approach is &#8220;fact first.&#8221; Of course, there are plenty of news organizations that tout their objectivity and devotion to accuracy, but the pair seemed particularly determined to present their readers with a &#8220;common set of facts&#8221; about a story that everyone can agree on, regardless of their political leanings.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the company&#8217;s approach, Aft pointed to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html\">the recent report on Russian election interference</a> by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Rather than trying to make any &#8220;second order conclusions&#8221; about the report — conclusions that could be influenced by a writer or editor&#8217;s political beliefs — he said The New Paper focused on what was factually indisputable, namely that the committee had released its report.</p>\n<p>As soon as he said that, I imagined my editors past and present tearing their hair out — not because they&#8217;re liberals determined to make the Trump administration look bad, but because the report&#8217;s findings (that Russian intelligence worked to interfere with the election, and that members of the Trump campaign were happy to accept the help) is the real news, rather than the simple fact of the report&#8217;s release.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038074\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038074\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2038074\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"The New Paper Daily Dash\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_Product_Image-Daily-Dash-Top-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The New Paper</p></div></p>\n<p>In other words, emphasizing objectivity and facts sounds good, but it also risks leaving out crucial context or analysis. Plus, it has become increasingly clear that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/fact-checking-trumps-lies-is-essential-its-also-increasingly-pointless/2020/08/28/35fb41de-e947-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html\">facts rarely change people&#8217;s minds</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, despite my quibbles with the approach, I&#8217;m happy to report that I&#8217;ve been receiving the digest for the past week, and I&#8217;ve found it to be a convenient, comprehensive catch-up on the day&#8217;s news, with links that make it easy to learn more.</p>\n<p>For now, Aft and Necef are writing the digest themselves, though they said much of the ranking and sorting is done by algorithms. Over time, they&#8217;re hoping to hire on both the technology side and the editorial side. They also plan to expand into other channels like email and voice.</p>\n<p>Asked whether the subscription business model means that they don&#8217;t have to pursue a mass audience, Aft replied, &#8220;We think it’s so critically important to give people a common set of information. To make this a viable business model, do we need to be 100 million strong?

That&#8217;s quickly changing now, though, in part because of the promise of IoT, which isn&#8217;t just a boon to renters looking for modern solutions in their apartments but also represents the possibility of significant cost savings for the industry. RealPage argues that smart technology can generate a revenue lift of $55 per unit, for example, and that&#8217;s the kind of saving (and higher revenues) that will push even legacy B2B platforms to modernize.</p>\n<p>One area where Stratis stands out is its ability to integrate with a wide variety of <a href=\"https://stratisiot.com/connected-solutions/\">third-party solutions</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holistic building-wide access and utility management and control are integral to building optimization and the resident experience, which have become increasingly intertwined,&#8221; said Stratis IoT CEO Felicite Moorman. &#8220;RealPage and Stratis IoT combine two industry-leading, best-in-class platforms to create a powerhouse of control and single-app resident experience for multifamily, student housing, and beyond.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition. It&#8217;s worth noting that RealPage isn&#8217;t a stranger to making acquisitions to bring its technology up to speed. A year ago, the company <a href=\"https://www.realpage.com/news/realpage-to-acquire-hipercept/\">acquired</a> Hipercept, for example, a firm that provided data services and data analytics to the institutional real estate market. Then, in December, it also <a href=\"https://www.realpage.com/news/realpage-closes-acquisition-of-buildium/\">acquired Buildium</a>, a SaaS property management solution with over 2 million units under management. In 2019, the company said planned to spend <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2019/08/16/realpage-acquisitions.html\">just over $100 million</a> on acquisitions.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OkZSFTpm6E\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/the-last-decade-in-real-estate-and-a-peek-into-the-next-one/\">The last decade in real estate, and a peek into the next one</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The last decade in real estate, and a peek into the next one&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/the-last-decade-in-real-estate-and-a-peek-into-the-next-one/embed/#?secret=OkZSFTpm6E\" data-secret=\"OkZSFTpm6E\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pcrVJQPNNLw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:10:17 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cluster-for-website.png","linkMd5":"cba42e59c7f926374dfbd21592b67227","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-48-059_ccf82751893b8608.webp","destWidth":3017,"destHeight":2128,"sourceBytes":1751592,"destBytes":226302,"author":"Frederic Lardinois","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cluster-for-website.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-48-059_ccf82751893b8608.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn77@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-29-00-143_93ccec5d58568f1c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pcrVJQPNNLw:RYx6DFZM1C8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_8a5a33d22a2ce78e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pcrVJQPNNLw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn22@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-467_b74c8690735ff006.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726655},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Facebook partially documents its content recommendation system","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2037990","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Algorithmic recommendation systems on social media sites like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html\">YouTube</a>, Facebook and Twitter have shouldered much of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-misinformation-faceboook.html\">blame</a> for the spread of misinformation, propaganda, hate speech, conspiracy theories and other harmful content. Facebook, in particular, has come under fire in recent days for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/technology/facebook-qanon-groups-takedown.html\">allowing QAnon conspiracy groups to thrive</a> on its platform and for <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/kenosha-militia-facebook-reported-455-times-moderators\">helping militia groups to scale membership</a>. Today, Facebook is attempting to combat claims that its recommendation systems are at any way at fault for how people are exposed to troubling, objectionable, dangerous, misleading and untruthful content.</p>\n<p>The company has, for the first time, made public how its content recommendation guidelines work.</p>\n<p>In new documentation available in<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246\"> Facebook&#8217;s Help Center</a> and <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/313829416281232\">Instagram&#8217;s Help Center,</a> the company details how Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s algorithms work to filter out content, accounts, Pages, Groups and Events from its recommendations.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Currently, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Suggestions may appear as Pages You May Like, “Suggested For You” posts in News Feed, People You May Know, or Groups You Should Join. Instagram&#8217;s suggestions are found within Instagram Explore, Accounts You May Like and IGTV Discover.</p>\n<p>The company says Facebook&#8217;s existing guidelines have been in place since 2016 under a strategy it references as &#8220;<a href=\"https://about.fb.com/2018/05/inside-feed-reduce-remove-inform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-lynx-mode=\"asynclazy\" data-lynx-uri=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2F2018%2F05%2Finside-feed-reduce-remove-inform%2F&#38;h=AT2pV-oAORCWBVJL7I7mMMlN5uAHZmHR21nGII8MwEq0YwrRSW_txuGk0KaiY7dSIrLb95tiBWYd88IiZH4ROHppQJWvuxVexrT3ZPMIInd8W6IkgVSva1NnL9lBITCoar42SL00UxOouFgsA9TW1srK\">remove, reduce, and inform</a>.&#8221; This strategy focuses on removing content that violates Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards, reducing the spread of problematic content that does not violate its standards, and informing people with additional information so they can choose what to click, read or share, Facebook explains.</p>\n<p>The Recommendation Guidelines typically fall under Facebook&#8217;s efforts in the &#8220;reduce&#8221; area, and are designed to maintain a higher standard than Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards, because they push users to follow new accounts, groups, Pages and the like.</p>\n<p>Facebook, in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246\">new documentation</a>, details five key categories that are not eligible for recommendations. <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/313829416281232\">Instagram&#8217;s guidelines</a> are similar. However, the documentation offers no deep insight into how Facebook actually chooses what to recommend to a given user. That&#8217;s a key piece to understanding recommendation technology, and one Facebook intentionally left out.</p>\n<p>One obvious category of content that many not be eligible for recommendation includes those that would impede Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;ability to foster a safe community,&#8221; such as content focused on self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, violence, sexually explicit content, regulated content like tobacco or drugs or content shared by non-recommendable accounts or entities.</p>\n<p>Facebook also claims to not recommend sensitive or low-quality content, content users frequently say they dislike and content associated with low-quality publishings. These further categories include things like clickbait, deceptive business models, payday loans, products making exaggerated health claims or offering &#8220;miracle cures,&#8221; content promoting cosmetic procedures, contests, giveaways, engagement bait, unoriginal <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/people-publishers-the-community/\">content stolen from another source</a>, content from websites that get <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/remove-reduce-inform-new-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-lynx-mode=\"asynclazy\" data-lynx-uri=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F04%2Fremove-reduce-inform-new-steps%2F&#38;h=AT01PIKL9EewymcV7AwjXMwEwmemhkRbxpqDLzKJDM3bjD4wLUp1Ros86SvpAVAf1KJnDeKFngUDy79iNVxhsoAymBqpgVhrahpMNiPNTjLUBR3_cyY3FXbjJzrhvxW_5wN9zJqUEfXudVJ1AE44wEb_\">a disproportionate number of clicks from Facebook versus other places on the web</a> or news that doesn&#8217;t include transparent information about the authorship or staff.</p>\n<p>In addition, Facebook claims it won&#8217;t recommend fake or misleading content, like those making claims found false by independent fact checkers, vaccine-related misinformation and content promoting the use of fraudulent documents.</p>\n<p>It says it will also <em>&#8220;try&#8221;</em> not to recommend accounts or entities that recently violated Community Standards, shared content Facebook tries to not recommend, posted vaccine-related misinformation, engaged in purchasing &#8220;Likes,&#8221; has been banned from running ads, posted false information or are associated with movements tied to violence.</p>\n<p>The latter claim, of course, follows recent news that a Kenosha militia Facebook Event <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/kenosha-militia-facebook-reported-455-times-moderators\">remained</a> on the platform after being flagged 455 times after its creation, and had been cleared by four moderators as non-violating content. The associated Page had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403004/facebook-kenosha-militia-groups-shooting-blm-protest\">issued</a> a &#8220;call to arms&#8221; and hosted comments about people asking what types of weapons to bring. Ultimately, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/facebook-kenosha-guard-militia-protest/\">two people were killed</a> and a third was injured at protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin when a 17-year old armed with an AR-15-style rifle broke curfew, crossed state lines and shot at protestors.</p>\n<p>Given Facebook&#8217;s track record, it&#8217;s worth considering how well Facebook is capable of abiding by its own stated guidelines. Plenty of people have found their way to what should be ineligible content, like conspiracy theories, dangerous health content, COVID-19 misinformation and more by clicking through on suggestions at times when the guidelines failed. QAnon grew through Facebook recommendations,<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-have-millions-members-facebook-documents-show-n1236317\"> it&#8217;s been reported</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting, there are many gray areas that guidelines like these fail to cover.</p>\n<p>Militia groups and conspiracy theories are only a couple of examples. Amid the pandemic, U.S. users who disagreed with government guidelines on business closures can easily find themselves pointed toward various &#8220;reopen&#8221; groups where members don&#8217;t just discuss politics, but openly brag about not wearing masks in public or even when required to do so at their workplace. They offer tips on how to get away with not wearing masks, and celebrate their successes with selfies. These groups may not technically break rules by their description alone, but encourage behavior that constitutes a threat to public health.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, even if Facebook doesn&#8217;t directly recommend a group, a quick search for a topic will direct you to what would otherwise be ineligible content within Facebook&#8217;s recommendation system.</p>\n<p>For instance, a quick search for the word &#8220;vaccines&#8221; currently suggests a number of groups focused on vaccine injuries, alternative cures and general anti-vax content. These even outnumber the pro-vax content. At a time when the world&#8217;s scientists are trying to develop protection against the novel coronavirus in the form of a vaccine, allowing anti-vaxxers a massive public forum to spread their ideas is just one example of how Facebook is enabling the spread of ideas that may ultimately become a global public health threat.</p>\n<p>The more complicated question, however, is where does Facebook draw the line in terms of policing users having these discussions versus favoring an environment that supports free speech? With few government regulations in place, Facebook ultimately gets to make this decision for itself.</p>\n<p>Recommendations are only a part of Facebook&#8217;s overall engagement system, and one that&#8217;s often blamed for directing users to harmful content. But much of the harmful content that users find could be those groups and Pages that show up at the top of Facebook search results when users turn to Facebook for general information on a topic. Facebook&#8217;s search engine favors engagement and activity &#8212; like how many members a group has or how often users post &#8212; not how close its content aligns with accepted truths or medical guidelines.</p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s search algorithms aren&#8217;t being <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/113625708804960?helpref=search&#38;sr=1&#38;query=facebook%20search%20results&#38;search_session_id=3d7ba3e7bddadc12c3f4ea4f583708c7\">similarly documented</a> in as much detail.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hCDYKUHeOyM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:36:16 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"25224a8ebfcfc0e31e24509b366ef8a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn51@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-59-189_4e5f7fa1d25b480d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hCDYKUHeOyM:mwf5Vv4jg6I:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-29-00-259_0eaca5b02cd5b832.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hCDYKUHeOyM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-28-59-271_9dd8db782742b663.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726656},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery fleet gains FAA approval for trial commercial flights","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038035","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has been granted an approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that will allow it to start trialing commercial deliveries via drone, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/amazon-s-drone-delivery-fleet-hits-milestone-with-faa-clearance\">Bloomberg reports</a>.

The FAA clearance for these trials is adapted from the safety rules and regulations it imposes for companies operating a commercial airline service, with special exceptions allowing for companies to bypass the requirements that specifically deal with onboard crew and staff working the aircraft, as the drones don&#8217;t have any.</p>\n<p>These guidelines are at best a patchwork solution designed by the agency and its commercial partners to help provide a way for them to get underway with crucial systems development and safety testing and design, but the FAA is working toward a more fit-for-purpose set of regulations to govern drone airline operation for later this year. That will mostly be related to authorizing flights over crowds &#8212; but any drone flights will still require constant human observation.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Ultimately, any actual viable and practical system of drone delivery will require fully autonomous operation, without direct line-of-sight observation.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Traditional roadmaps for startups center around this idea of the exit. Oftentimes, the ideal exit in the minds of startups and venture capitalists goes one of two ways: IPO or acquisition by another company.</p>\n<p>But there are other ways for startups to exit that could potentially bring more value to a larger variety of stakeholders. Exit to Community (E2C), a collaborative working project led by the University of Colorado Boulder&#8217;s Media Enterprise Design Lab and Zebras Unite, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">explores ways to help startups transition investor-owned to community ownership, which could include users, customers, workers or some combination of all stakeholders. </span>Today, the group released a <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2020/08/31/exit-community-community-primer\">digital and physical zine</a> designed to serve as an introduction to Exit to Community.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The purpose of the zine is to provide an initial roadmap to all of the aspects of the conversation that need to happen so we can save founders pain in recognizing and validating they’re in the wrong fit and we need to co-create what does fit,” Zebras Unite co-founder and zine co-author Mara Zepeda told TechCrunch. “It’s not a silver bullet. It’s not like there’s this other perfect thing that everyone needs to do. I describe it as running a Cambrian explosion of experiments in order to figure out what this future is. It’s not just one thing. That’s how what we’re doing is really different. Sometimes there are these niche products or movements that pop up and say, “this is the answer. There isn’t one answer for this moment.” </span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>These alternative exit models also have the potential to open the door for founders in other markets, E2C co-organizer Nathan Schneider told TechCrunch. He pointed to <a href=\"https://tiphub.vc/\">tiphub</a>, a company focused on Africa and the African Diaspora, that had been looking for alternative ways to support founders, given there isn&#8217;t a huge mergers and acquisitions market in Africa.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of the infrastructure that exists in the financial market, we don&#8217;t have the same set of realities that a very active VC industry does in Europe or the U.S.,&#8221; tiphub partner Chika Umeadi told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s just not as much private equity activity or M&#38;A activity. We believe we have a strong hypothesis for how we can manufacture companies quickly, but we still need to build the other side of the market. There are companies that are valuable, but we now have to think about alternative methods of exiting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Already, there are a handful of examples out there of what exiting to community can look like. Buffer, a social media management platform, bought out its investors in 2018 because it became &#8220;clear that Buffer had become less of a fit for VC funding,&#8221; <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/buying-out-investors/\">Buffer CEO and co-founder Joel Gascoigne wrote in a blog post at the time.</a></p>\n<p>Then, in 2019, SEO and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/condutor-wework-buyout/\">Conductor bought back its content marketing company from WeWork</a>. Now, the company is majority employee-owned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a dream that we always had that we would own the company and we gave a huge amount of ownership to all the people and now the company is almost entirely employee-owned,&#8221; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/how-to-buy-back-your-startup-from-a-tech-giant-like-wework/\">Conductor CEO Seth Besmertnik told me earlier this year</a>. &#8220;And now we have everything we want to go and make our mission a reality.”</p>\n<p>Outside of the tech industry, E2C points to Organically Grown Company, an organic produce distributor based in Oregon that transitioned from an employee- and grocer-owned operation into a community-owned one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These types of glimpses suggest that it&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Schneider said.</p>\n<p>For investors, while IPOs and acquisitions can elicit high returns, not all of the startups in their portfolios will be candidates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Their current exit options limit what kind of returns and outcomes they can see for their portfolio companies,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;If a startup ends up not being a candidate for an IPO or acquisition, E2C can still help them get their money back, or get a decent return. There&#8217;s also a class of investors trying to thread the needle of financial return with social return, and are looking for models that can help facilitate that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond the zine, the next step is to crate a peer learning cohort of founders who are exploring some of these options. Down the road, the hope is to create standard documents for startups that make it easy for founders to pursue these alternative paths.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lSFoIcIJthM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:30:17 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"550a705c65af67fcd4249880646eebcd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Megan Rose Dickey","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn45@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-01-862_3a683d6dbb028454.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lSFoIcIJthM:0sM-4fbXklI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn53@2020_6/2020/09/01/01-28-59-167_ed31b37a9c621a07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lSFoIcIJthM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn33@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-229_069a55edf8c15aa2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726656},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Decrypted: Tesla’s ransomware near miss, Palantir’s S-1 risk factors","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038126","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Another busy week in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>In case you missed it: A widely used messaging app used by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/08/bridgefy-the-app-promoted-for-mass-protests-is-a-privacy-disaster/\">over a million protesters</a> has several major security flaws; a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep47na/dmv-dppa-drivers-privacy-protection-act-buy-data-private-investigators?\">little-known loophole</a> has let the DMV sell driver&#8217;s licenses and Social Security records to private investigators; and the U.S. government is <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-sues-to-recover-cryptocurrency-funds-stolen-by-north-korean-hackers/\">suing to reclaim</a> over $2.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hackers from two major exchanges.</p>\n<p>But this week we are focusing on how a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> employee foiled a ransomware attack, and, ahead of Palantir&#8217;s debut on the stock market, how much of a risk factor is the company&#8217;s public image?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"the-big-picture\">THE BIG PICTURE</h2>\n<h2 id=\"tesla-almost-ransomware-attack\">Russian charged with attempted Tesla ransomware attack</h2>\n<p>$1 million.

According to the indictment, his plan was to ask the employee to deliberately deploy ransomware on the Gigafactory&#8217;s network, grinding the network to a halt for a ransom of several million dollars. The would-be insider threat is likely the first of its kind, one ransomware expert <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-ransomware-insider-hack-attempt/\">told Wired</a>, as financially driven hackers continue to up their game.</p>\n<p>Tesla founder Elon Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/elon-musk-confirms-tesla-was-target-of-foiled-ransomware-attack/\">tweeted</a> earlier this week confirming that Tesla was the target of the failed attack.</p>\n<p>The attack, if carried out, could have been devastating. The indictment said that the malware was designed to extract data from the network before locking its files. This data-stealing ransomware is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/\">an increasing trend</a>. These hacker groups not only encrypt a victim&#8217;s files but also exfiltrate the data to their servers.

But sometimes, they just need cash, and cash as quickly as possible. Startups sign contracts with customers that might be paid over a year or more, but they want to access that cash now, and at the best terms possible. The product that solves this problem is known as an accounts receivable line, and you can go to many banks to get them, with all the drudgery of that process.</p>\n<p>Or, four founders hope, you’ll head to <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/capchase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"capchase\">Capchase <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.capchase.com__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!UAW0lTUMmr13dT98tBBxxnra4urM9X42ORq2OsIFDLyjOZDGbg4vJyEa-cmDo2w$ \">Capchase</a> is an online platform for rapidly getting cash from your accounts receivable. Startups upload key details of their customer contracts and financial history to Capchase, and the company uses its underwriting algorithms to quickly assess the quality of those contracts and extend a debt line. The startup calls itself part of the “non-dilutive revolution,” and it’s headquartered in Boston.</p>\n<p>“We&#8217;re targeting B2B SaaS or ‘X-as-a-service’ companies with recurring revenue, and we&#8217;re targeting companies around the seed to Series B/C stage having more than $1 million of ARR and at least eight months of revenue generating history,” Miguel Fernández, CEO and co-founder, said.</p>\n<p>He linked up with three other founders earlier this year to launch Capchase: Luis Basagoiti, Ignacio Moreno, and Przemek Gotfryd. Fernández and Gotfryd met while at Harvard Business School where Fernández was thinking about “working capital and cash conversion cycle optimization” after his previous experiences at SaaS companies. Gotfryd had previously worked at growth investor TCV in London, where he acutely saw the challenges of raising non-dilutive cash.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2037969\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2037969\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2037969\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png 2736w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2037969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Capchase&#8217;s team (Photo via Capchase)</p></div></p>\n<p>Despite its early operational history, the company has already raised its own cash quickly. It closed on $4.6 million in VC seed funding led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/caffeinated-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"caffeinated-capital\">Caffeinated Capital, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Bling Capital and SciFi VC, along with BoxGroup, ONEVC and a number of angels.</p>\n<p>To get cash early today, startups often resort to negotiating terms with their customers, offering discounts — sometimes massive discounts — for them to pay an entire contract’s value upfront. Fernández saw an opportunity to arbitrage the difference between interest rates and those discounts with Capchase.</p>\n<p>From a user’s perspective, after syncing their startup’s financial data to Capchase, they will see a projection of what their runway extension will look like after selecting a debt line, and then Capchase will extend its terms after going through an underwriting process (“which takes a couple hours now, and is very rapidly decreasing to take minutes” Fernández said). In terms of traction, he said that “we&#8217;re working with around 3-4 customers right now.”</p>\n<p>Startups are charged a discount on their total contract value, which is where Capchase makes its money. For instance, if $100,000 is going to be paid by a customer over the next 12 months, Capchase may offer $95,000 to the startup upfront, and keep the remaining $5,000 as those payments roll in. That discount fluctuates based on the startup in question and the payment risk of the underlying customer contracts.</p>\n<p>Fernández said that venture debt is often cheaper on a pure interest rate basis, but that once additional elements of those products are added in, such as warrants, the simplicity of Capchase’s product will prove competitive for founders.</p>\n<p>Simpler, easier and fully digital financial products are always welcome, and Capchase hopes that it will nestle itself in a suite of new financial products for SaaS founders looking to avoid dilution and extend their cash longer.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yZDxBALdZTI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:30:17 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?w=680","linkMd5":"c0939e56b0ad6bded27e784bf1619d3c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-28-58-009_915e088cfbdda71a.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":453,"sourceBytes":86746,"destBytes":86746,"author":"Danny Crichton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Capchase_teampic.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-28-58-009_915e088cfbdda71a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-29-00-082_4fc552c5f6210728.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZDxBALdZTI:sDVQAncItXQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_6/2020/09/01/01-29-02-219_fe873ba8d6e2f439.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yZDxBALdZTI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn78@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-28-59-306_30cb6abd92194d3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726655},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Gillmor Gang: Platforming","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2038317","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/woVlXcDqGSM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Much was made during the Republican Convention of the lack of a party platform. The media characterized this as a capitulation to the Cult of Trump phenomenon, but the questioned begged was: so what? If you’re running as a candidate to disrupt the status quo&#8230;. But beneath the media framing, an important question emerges. What exactly is the platform we need to emerge from the toxic situation we find ourselves in?</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>For months, if not years, the technology industry has been working on a new platform to succeed the previous one. Mobile would seem to be that fundamental shift from the desktop world of Windows and PCs. The twin dominance of powerful phones by Google and Apple has created a new language of notifications and streaming video perfectly timed for the devastating pandemic. Our devices are now the front lines for managing the struggle to stay alive for our loved ones, the economy, and our future.</p>\n<p>Zoom is of course the poster child for all that it enables, and certainly what it doesn’t. The notion of work from home is more likely a question of what is home and what’s the difference with work? The routines of life are congealing around the interactions with phone, watch, iPad, laptop, and TV. When I wake up, the first dive is for the notification stream built up overnight from overseas and then the East Coast. The rhythm varies from day to day: intense on Monday as the weekend cobwebs dissipate, more issue oriented through the middle of the week, and finally a thank-god-it’s Friday feel. Email, text messages, media updates, and work calendar reminders.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the outline of the new platform — live streaming notifications from what some call citizen media, or the influencer network, or the loyal opposition. That last one refers to the decline in trust of the mainstream media. Maybe it’s just me, but the cable model of host-driven cyclical repetition of the headlines, talking heads, and medical ads adds up to a trip first to the mute button and eventually the off switch. Which plugs me right back into the notification stream and a new contract with us based on whether we click on the link or even allow the notification in the first place.</p>\n<p>And these new voices are networks of one or a few, broadcasting on a global reach pastiche of cloud services that begin with the ubiquity of Zoom and its click and you’re there ease of on boarding. Then there are the key networks of record as it were: Facebook Live, Twitter/Periscope, YouTube, and maybe LinkedIn if you’re <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/brent-leary\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brent-leary\">Brent Leary <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and got an early invite. There’s a whole bunch of streaming accelerators like Restream and StreamYard and Just Streams (I made that up) to use software and a dash of hardware to do what it took many thousands of dollars and cables just a few years ago. Right now it’s early days, but soon you’ll be seeing something that looks like the media it’s replacing as the OG buys in.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? Just look at how streaming has disrupted the television industry. Or the music business. Or the reemergence of podcasting and newsletters. Or how messaging is growing rapidly as a preferred digital commerce and marketing channel. The pandemic has certainly had a devastating effect with the loss of theaters, events, and travel that drive so much of our economy and the emotional underpinning of our lives. But as we learn to respect the power of the virus to force this digital wave of transformation, we fuel the winners that emerge from a new hybrid blend of evolution and adaptation.</p>\n<p>Technology has often been seen as impersonal and cold to the touch. But now we should be making friends with robots for touchless shopping, At the beginning of this Gillmor Gang session, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/frank-radice\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"frank-radice\">Frank Radice <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> seemed stunned by the administration’s takeover of the symbols of our Washington monuments for political purposes. By the end, he seemed more hopeful of a different result. We have more ways now of making our voices heard, broadcasting our own names in fireworks above and beyond the fake news and suppression. Our platform: suppress the virus, not the vote.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">__________________</p>\n<p>The Gillmor Gang — Frank Radice, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/michael-markman-6388\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"michael-markman-6388\">Michael Markman, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/keith-teare\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"keith-teare\">Keith Teare, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/denis-pombriant\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"denis-pombriant\">Denis Pombriant, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Brent Leary, and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/steve-gillmor\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"steve-gillmor\">Steve Gillmor <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.

After searching for more than a year, Alamgir found an investor who understood his vision. Better yet, the investor had connections to restaurants in New York City that Alamgir wanted to land. So, Alamgir shared everything about <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lunchbox-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lunchbox-technologies\">Lunchbox, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> from the financials, to the product integration road map and go-to-market strategy.</p>\n<p>After a month of due diligence, the investor ghosted Alamgir. Four months later, that same investor’s portfolio company launched a product mimicking Lunchbox.</p>\n<p>“I did not do due diligence on them as they were doing on me,” he said. “And I forgot all my rules. Most rules go out the window as cash is running out.”</p>\n<p>Alamgir’s experience is a classic case of back-channeling, a sometimes unfortunate yet uncommon occurrence for founders in Silicon Valley. It’s not a secret that investors share intel with each other as a competitive advantage; but as venture capital grows as an asset class and more investors break into the industry, the way information disseminates will become even more elusive and broad.</p>\n<p>Alamgir advises early-stage founders who are looking to raise their first check to “contain excitement.”<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/89R-f5Acako\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:47:40 +0000","feedId":307,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"dc9342912ea6fd5dcb7ce656ebbd2c4d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-28-46-956_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-285_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn59@2020_6/2020/09/01/01-28-59-259_3d238f7ead8fa2c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=89R-f5Acako:fGGzno7SJiw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn94@2020_4/2020/09/01/01-28-59-194_4b089fc4d9eb6179.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/01/01-29-00-238_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/89R-f5Acako":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn47@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-28-59-138_6612281fbda13682.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598923726654},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:28:46","title":"Virtual Mobility startup pitch night applications open","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2033908","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">TechCrunch is on the hunt to feature 10 early-stage mobility startups at our virtual TC Sessions: Mobility 2020 pitch night.
