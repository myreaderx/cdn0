The <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3590295/creepshow-breaking-streaming-records-shudder/#:~:text=The%20first%20week%20of%20Creepshow,of%20the%20top%2025%20days.\">record-breaking</a> anthology series is back once more from the freaks over at <strong>Shudder</strong>, and it aims to continue the cursed legacy of Stephen King and George Romero&#8217;s classic with episodic double bills of comeuppance-riddled spooky stories. The inimitable <strong>Rob Hunter </strong>and I <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/creepshow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviewed</a> and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/creepshow-season-one-ranked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranked</a> each episode of season 1, and while it left us wanting better it also left us wanting more. Some episodes/segments captured the pulpy, morbid glee of the original film, and it&#8217;s those glimmers of genuinely ghoulish goodies that have us enticed for season 2. Rob has already covered the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/creepshow-season-2-episode-1-review/\">mixed bag premiere</a>, so let&#8217;s shamble on over to the second showing of the series!</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Dead &#38; Breakfast&#8221;</strong><br />\nDirector: Axelle Carolyn<br />\nWriter: Michael Rousselet and Erik Sandoval</p>\n<p>Pam and Sam Spinster (Ali Larter and C. Thomas Howell) run an especially morbid hotel: a bed and breakfast situated in the boarding house where their grandmother supposedly murdered a good portion of her patrons. Only the siblings aren&#8217;t “running” much of anything these days. Their haunted house/hospitality combo isn’t bringing in the customers. Sam wants out, but Pam thinks they just need to find the right audience. They offer a free stay to an influencer named Morgue (Iman Benson) who specializes in true crime, hoping to curry her online favor. But when Morgue begins to doubt the veracity of the house’s murderous history, the siblings cook up a plan to scare her straight.</p>\n<p>The idea of making a bed and breakfast out of an H.H. Holmes-style murder house — with secret passageways, murder shoots, and sound-muffling steel walls — is a great idea, and the modern wrinkle that bed and breakfasts live and die by their online social currency is astute. One thing this segment absolutely gets right is pacing, but unfortunately, the speed does make some of the pivotal character moments blur in the rear-view mirror. The final release of Pam’s murderous impulses feels rushed, but her aggressive obsession with her grandmother’s legacy has a precedent, at least. The same cannot be said of Sam’s final act of violence: a cunning and wildly out of character move to further the house’s value as a murder hot spot.</p>\n<p>The segment’s apparent target is the commercialization of serial killing. The fact that serial murder has, in recent years, exploded into an unsettling fandom that frequently forgets how genuinely horrifying murder can be. But the power of a critique never really comes into focus. Pam’s obsession with her grandmother’s “place in history” has the best arc, thematically, as her idolization sours into outright mimicry.</p>\n<p>Morgue’s contribution to the theme is less straightforward. Benson’s likable performance makes it difficult to know how the segment wants us to feel, both about true crime as a fandom and about the siblings&#8217; hatred for her as an influential, passionate young person. It could be that the segment is trying to say that some forms of true crime fandom are less egregious than others. But for a segment that moves as quickly as this, that’s a tricky tightrope walk to dance across in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>The final ironic twist reveals that the grandma was, in fact, a mass murderer. So, in the end, Morgue’s fatal skepticism and Sam’s hail mary to re-brand the house in authenticity were all for naught. It’s a twist that would feel more like, well, a twist, had Sam’s Big Plan been more present throughout the segment. In the end, it&#8217;s a little messy, but as <em>Creepshow</em> segments go it’s better than most. Low bar cleared.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>&#8220;Pesticide&#8221;</strong><br />\nDirector: Greg Nicotero<br />\nWriter: Frank Dietz</p>\n<p>Harlan King (Josh McDermitt) stomps through yards with one, singular purpose: to eradicate pests. After a routine job at a therapy clinic, King pops off to his next gig at a derelict property. Out of the shadows steps Murdoch (Keith David), whose Luciferian bargain fails to raise alarm bells in King’s fume-addled brain. Murdoch can&#8217;t tear the property down to build condos until he deals with his pest problem. King is horrified to learn that Murdoch’s scourge is, in fact, the unhoused community living on the premises.</p>\n<p>While he initially refuses to exterminate a group of human beings, Murdoch’s large suitcase full of cash prevails and King takes the job. While he ultimately opts not to follow through, King winds up murdering the community anyway, accidentally dropping a poisonous cocktail into the communal soup pot during a scuffle with an agitated man. King’s guilt eats him up, and some of the hallucinations prove more real than others.</p>\n<p>The segment has several fingers in several different pies. And on paper the multiple-pie-jamming maneuver makes sense. It&#8217;s a kind of <em>Tell-Tale Heart</em> meets <em>Street Trash</em> meets “They’re Creeping Up on You,” a.k.a. the wildly underrated cockroach revenge segment from the original film. Unfortunately, the segment itself seems to get lost in its own sauce. Murdoch’s identity is less mysterious than it is mystifying: is he the Devil, as King claims? Or is he some vengeful Pest Deity who&#8217;s come to wreak unholy revenge on the exterminator so mindlessly slaughtering his denizens? I fully expected the final reveal to be that Murdoch was some giant cockroach. Instead, he’s just&#8230;vague Satan? I guess?</p>\n<p>Another issue (that births others) is King’s comeuppance. In the beginning of the segment, McDermitt is doing his best John Goodman in <em>Arachnophobia</em> impression. And despite lacking social graces, the occupational passion and quirks are more endearing than they are repulsive. We aren’t really provided with enough evidence in these earlier segments to believe that King’s cruelty towards pests might extend towards his fellow man. Heck even when the money sways him his heart’s not in it. And his hand being forced makes his fate unfulfilling. But, more troublingly, it makes the big weighty point the segment is trying to make a little … messy.</p>\n<p>I want to give the episode the benefit of the doubt: that the explicit comparison between unhoused folks and rats is <em>meant</em> to repulse and shock us. But just after King scrambles last-minute onto the moral high ground, the script still necessitates the murder of the community. Not only that, it can’t help but indulge the tired trope of unhoused people as jumpscare fodder. Social commentary and horror are long-standing bedfellows, and there’s plenty of punching up to do when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/02/17/the-unhoused-are-5-times-more-likely-to-die-within-21-days-of-a-positive-covid-19-test-how-toronto-is-failing-people-living-outside-in-the-cold.html\">the very real horrors faced by people experiencing homelessness</a>. Here, their stigma and less-dead status serve a protagonist’s punchline. Which, in the end, is a distracting sin no amount of Keith David scene-chewing and enormous practical insects can forgive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/creepshow/\"><em>Follow all of our Creepshow coverage!</em></a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/mas2b7Ytukc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 21:04:54 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"08174d0530a896918583d917b9eda39f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/mas2b7Ytukc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-55-107_d15cc1cab0a2d126.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026309246},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","title":"‘Thunder Force’ Packs a Fun and Funny Punch","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364630","description":"<p>The world is often unkind to film collaborations between real-life couples, but while Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow called it quits after <em>Bounce</em> (2000) and Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez called it quits after <em>Jersey Girl</em> (2004), others keep right on trucking through the negativity. <strong>Ben Falcone</strong> has directed four previous features starring <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong>, his wife and one of the world&#8217;s funniest humans, and while the three theatrical releases all made a profit, they&#8217;re also almost universally reviled. The fourth, <em>Superintelligence</em> (2020), went straight to HBO Max where it also <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/superintelligence-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found itself lambasted</a> critically. Turns out the fifth time is the charm, though, as their latest collaboration, Netflix&#8217;s <strong><em>Thunder Force</em></strong>, is a silly, warm, and frequently funny time at the movies.</p>\n<p>Lydia and Emily have been best friends since grade school where the former helped the latter stand up to obnoxious bullies. Emily was orphaned after a Miscreant &#8212; one of a group of sociopaths who were mutated by cosmic rays in the early &#8217;80s and given superpowers, which they now use for evil &#8212; killed her parents, and starting from a young age, she&#8217;s dedicated herself to finding a way to fight back. The two parted ways for years, but in the present day, when Lydia (McCarthy) goes to visit Emily (<strong>Octavia Spencer</strong>) at her high-tech lab, she accidentally injects herself with a newly invented super serum that was meant for her friend. Emily takes the other half, and soon the two have powers of their own: Lydia is super strong, and Emily can turn invisible.</p>\n<p>And just like that, the super duo known as Thunder Force is born.</p>\n<p><i>Thunder Force </i>takes the basic template of numerous superhero movies, dumbs it down, and then proceeds to have an utterly silly time with the concept. Falcone, who also wrote the script (and plays a small but funny role), keeps things loose and playful, despite the threat of carnage, with frequent dips into absurdity that actively repel any feeling of seriousness. The movie <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">arguably would have benefited from a more consistent commitment to goofiness &#8212; think </span><a style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em></a><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"> (2021) &#8212; but it still delivers entertaining action, a little heart, and more laughs than all four previous Falcone/McCarthy comedies combined.</span></p>\n<p>As should be expected, McCarthy is front and center on the comedy front as she continues to be a master at drawing out the giggles from nearly any situation. Some bits get away from her, but others highlight her comedic creativity and delivery with laugh-out-loud results &#8212; come for her Urkel impression, but stay for her Jodie Foster riff. She&#8217;s matched beat for beat by one of the film&#8217;s Miscreant villains, The Crab (<strong>Jason Bateman</strong>), a normal guy who chose a life of crime after developing crab arms from his shoulders down to his pincers. The character would feel right at home in <em>Mystery Men </em>(1999), and Bateman&#8217;s dry delivery squeezes every last laugh out of the ridiculous premise. His &#8220;crab walk&#8221; out of the frame, pincers snapping in the air, is the definition of stupidly fun. He and McCarthy even share an &#8217;80s-inspired dance number that is pure joy on wires, and that&#8217;s not even the most ridiculous moment we get between them.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast may not be up to their level with the laughs, but they&#8217;re all in on the goofiness. Emily is a character afraid to cut loose, and Spencer&#8217;s performance follows suit before eventually relaxing into the silliness. <strong>Pom Klementieff</strong> nails a mean little Miscreant called Laser, <strong>Melissa Leo</strong> keeps a straight face as Emily&#8217;s assistant, and <strong>Taylor Mosby</strong> does good work as Emily&#8217;s brilliant daughter Tracy. The always great <strong>Bobby Cannavale</strong> plays a mayoral candidate who goes by the name The King, and he absolutely revels in the character&#8217;s shadiness.</p>\n<p>Falcone&#8217;s script does layer in a handful of reveals, but all of them, without fail, will be seen miles away by anyone who&#8217;s watched more than a dozen movies. The obviousness doesn&#8217;t hurt <em>Thunder Force</em>, though, as its mandate towards goofy fun takes precedence over all else. The same goes for lip service paid to the idea that the damage done by heroes might outweigh the good they do as the idea is broached and then quickly forgotten. The friendship at the film&#8217;s core works a bit better, as does the relationship between Emily and Tracy, but it&#8217;s all slight asides next to the jokes and smashy-bashy action.</p>\n<p>No one will mistake the action set-pieces here for a Marvel film, but it is entertaining even on a budget. Walls crumble, lightning strikes, and McCarthy clocks more hours on wires as she leaps, falls, and flips through the air. The action is creatively staged to make McCarthy and Spencer viable superheroes, and it&#8217;s engaging stuff wrapped in silliness.</p>\n<p>One hopes that <em>Thunder Force</em> marks a turning point for Team Falcone/McCarthy, even if that means the duo&#8217;s future collaborations are limited to sequels on Netflix. There&#8217;s a whole world of Miscreants out there, and only a fool would pass up the opportunity to watch a crab-loving, raw chicken-eating, ass-kicking Melissa McCarthy reign ridiculous hell down upon them all.</p>\n<p><em>Thunder Force is now exclusively available to stream <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81079259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Netflix</a>. </em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/u65wLNHguL0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:35:39 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"beb0d85953e3635be04c917ea649f78d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/u65wLNHguL0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-18-575_be5c4d2980c99ba1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026309246},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","title":"Dr. Erskine is Still Right in ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Episode 4","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364621","description":"<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-explained\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Explained</a></strong> is our ongoing series delving into Marvel’s grand new bromance between Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes. In this entry, we examine The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Episode 4 (“The Whole World is Watching”) and consider how it confirms what we already know about the Super-Soldier serum. Yes, prepare for SPOILERS.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>What&#8217;s so special about Captain America? Nothing. It&#8217;s a costume, and we&#8217;ve already seen multiple people wear it within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What&#8217;s so special about Steve Rogers? There&#8217;s only one of him. He was a little fella with a good heart.</p>\n<p>Around the midpoint of <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong> Episode 4, which is entitled &#8220;<strong>The Whole World is Watching</strong>,&#8221; John Walker (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>) asks his buddy Lemar Hoskins (<strong>Clé Bennett</strong>) if he would take the Super-Soldier serum given the chance. Without skipping a beat, Hoskins answers, &#8220;Hells yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Walker is impressed with his quick response. He worries that the serum would alter his biology somehow, making him something he&#8217;s not. Hoskins has no concern. He says a line that purposefully echoes something Dr. Abraham Erskine told Steve Rogers before the young soldier went under the needle in <strong><em>Captain America</em>: <em>The First Avenger</em></strong>, &#8220;Power just makes a person more of themselves, right?&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the United States government was considering the Super-Soldier program, they gathered the best of the best. In their minds, that meant the beefiest and toughest bodies amongst their ranks. Dr. Erskine, however, saw something unique in Steve when the scientist stumbled upon him during the first <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Stark_Expo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stark Expo in 1943</a>.</p>\n<p>Steve wanted nothing more than to help those who couldn&#8217;t fight back. He was a scrawny asthmatic who weighed little more than a wet blanket, but he did not like bullies. And he wouldn&#8217;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer. Rejection after rejection, Steve returned to the army recruitment office. In that determination, Dr. Erskine identified what was missing from his musclehead test subjects: heart.</p>\n<p>On the eve of the Super-Soldier procedure, Dr. Erskine jabbed his finger into Steve&#8217;s chest. He would repeat the gesture as his final act before perishing from an assassin&#8217;s bullet. Steve would struggle with his scientific gift throughout the MCU, but he never forgot why the doctor chose him. He owed Erskine and the world his good nature.</p>\n<p>The Super-Soldier serum doesn&#8217;t make you better than what you are, it makes what&#8217;s you <em>more</em> you. Power amplifies your capabilities. It&#8217;s a miracle in that way, but it&#8217;s not going to save you from yourself. There&#8217;s no escaping you.</p>\n<p>John Walker desperately wants to be all that he can be, and when he&#8217;s in combat against the Flag-Smashers, all that he can be matters very little. He&#8217;s too human, and his body constantly fails him during combat with superior soldiers. Even as a tough brawler, he&#8217;s never in a fair fight, and he&#8217;s eager to even the playing field.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Episode 4</em>, Zemo (<strong>Daniel Brühl</strong>) wrestles the remaining Super-Soldier vials from Karli Morgenthau (<strong>Erin Kellyman</strong>) and goes stomp-crazy, smashing as many of them as he can before getting Cap&#8217;s shield bounced off his head. Walker sees his moment and snatches a vial for himself. After his conversation with Hoskins, injecting the serum into his blood seems like the logical option. He wants to do good, and the juice will help him do so.</p>\n<p>Except doing good and being good are two different things. When we first properly <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-episode-2-exposes-our-bloody-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">met John Walker in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> Episode 2</a>, we&#8217;re told by Hoskins that the new Captain America can no longer solve problems with his fists. It&#8217;s a solution that would reflect poorly on the flag he carries on his chest. Walker knows no other way, and every moment leading toward this week&#8217;s climax further solidifies this macho imperfection.</p>\n<p>Walker, at his core, is an angry dude. We already know how such a hot emotion can play out with an enhanced creature with the Hulk. Bruce Banner put in the work, and he made his mission the ability to temper and manipulate his rage. Walker needs to do the same, but it might already be too late for him.</p>\n<p>As we see at the end of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </em>Episode 4, the Super-Soldier serum in his veins does for Walker what it did for Dr. Erskine&#8217;s first test subject, Red Skull. All that pent-up aggression bubbling below the surface bursts forth.</p>\n<p>Karli lets loose her full might upon Hoskins during the heat of battle, and it caves his frail, very human chest. With his pal a corpse, Walker explodes. He chases the Flag-Smashers into the streets and corners one in the public square. Seeing red, he pounds the terrorist into the concrete, lifting Captain America&#8217;s shield over his head and slamming it into his opponent&#8217;s body over and over and over again while the whole world watches. Whatever the crimes of the dead guy at his feet, the action brands Captain America a stone-cold killer.</p>\n<p>Who&#8217;s to blame? Walker, certainly. But Sam Wilson (<strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>) and Bucky Barnes (<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>) are standing not too far away. One of them rejected Rogers&#8217; offer of the shield. The other orchestrated Zemo&#8217;s escape, propelling all these deadly chess pieces into place. They can no longer ignore the Captain America problem.</p>\n<p>Sam and Bucky have to deal with John Walker, now. Once they do, they have to deal with the shield. If they leave it on the ground, someone else will pick it up. To halt others from perverting Steve Rogers&#8217; legacy, Sam or Bucky have to fill that suit. They either stand back and watch Captain America become a monster, or they show folks how it&#8217;s meant to be done.</p>\n<p>Dr. Erskine believed in Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers believes in Sam and Bucky. The titular BFFs of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> should rest their faith there and continue to doubt their abilities. Constant questioning of self is crucial, and it&#8217;s what made Steve Rogers a great Captain America. Bucky is already a master of internal reflection, and Sam is well on his way. He already knows he doesn&#8217;t need the Super-Soldier serum to do good in the world. That gives him a jump on John Walker.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Episode 4 is now available to stream <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/video/2789e5b4-8d1b-4174-b8ab-99dc0e855a05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Disney+</a>.</em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/NQ2vr0QMGgo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:16:53 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9931cb8f5c2361f30b4e0d4591ee9a7e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/NQ2vr0QMGgo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-09-488_970c96572a0f04b5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026309247},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:09","title":"The Art and Nostalgia of the Film Company Logo","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=364502","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Blood-red roses swaying against a pristine white picket fence tell you everything you need to know about the suburban horror of <em>Blue Velvet</em>. The bright, sparkling eye that opens <em>Blade Runner</em> reflects not only plumes of industrial flames but the oracular imagery of the film to come.</p>\n<p>But most movies don&#8217;t start with the film itself. First come the logos: the (sometimes wildly long) string of corporate thumbprints from the film&#8217;s production companies and distributors. And some production logos are built better than others. Some incorporate evocative symbols to get moviegoing audiences in the mood: fireworks; the open sky; physics-defying light sources.</p>\n<p>The escalating boom of the THX logo is itself a pavlovian signal to brace yourself for the heightened spectacle of being in a movie theater. Some movie studio logos go one step further and literally shape themselves after the films they introduce, integrating color filters, match transitions, and other impressive sleight-of-hand to seamlessly blur the line between logo and film.</p>\n<p>The following video essay unpacks what makes a great film company logo <em>great, </em>from subtle designs to brazen appeals to nostalgia.

In this edition, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\">Rob Hunter</a> enjoys the commentary for one of the year&#8217;s funniest films, Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</i>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve gotten a truly silly comedy out of Hollywood, so the arrival of <strong><em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em></strong> earlier this year was <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a gloriously fun gift for laugh lovers</a>. It is ridiculous, and now that it&#8217;s on home video, you&#8217;ll be happy to know that the humor holds up on repeat viewings. The Blu-ray/DVD features some fun special features including a commentary with the two leads/co-writers and the director, so you better believe we gave it a listen.</p>\n<p>Keep reading to see what I heard on the commentary for <em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em>!</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (2021)</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Commentators: <strong>Josh Greenbaum</strong> (director), <strong>Annie Mumolo</strong> (writer/actor), <strong>Kristen Wiig</strong> (writer/actor)</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>1.</strong> The opening onscreen definition of &#8220;culottes&#8221; was added late in editing as they all realized that most folks don&#8217;t know and love them to the same degree as these three filmmakers.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> It took Reyn Doi (he plays Yoyo) a single take to land that newspaper on the front step as planned. That&#8217;s not true. &#8220;I think he had to fake it, then we dropped it right in front of the lens.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> They refer to Barb&#8217;s and Star&#8217;s wigs as the film&#8217;s other stars. &#8220;We fought with them, we loved them, we hated them.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> They wrote and/or shot scenes for a montage of reasons why they&#8217;d be fired including writing notes with a Sharpie on the furniture, riding a moped through the store, and jumping out of a cabinet to scare a customer who then proceeded to have a heart attack.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> &#8220;We always write roles for Wendi [McLendon-Covey],&#8221; as in addition to being a supremely nice person she delivers pure gold with her every utterance. They add Michael Hitchcock to that shortlist as well.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Wiig and Mumolo have been writing comedic, middle-aged ladies since their days back in The Groundlings, the legendary LA improv group.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> They were all constantly aware of nailing the tone they aimed for, as &#8220;if it&#8217;s too saccharine it&#8217;s not our movie&#8221; but if they steamroll through the characters without &#8220;getting real&#8221; at times then viewers won&#8217;t care about them.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Barb (Mumolo) and Star&#8217;s (Wiig) decision to take the trip was originally followed by a scene where they leave the house and are attacked by an owl. &#8220;You mean when the owl sexually assaulted us? And hammered on Kristen?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Jamie Dornan apparently had a big crush on Estelle Getty, circa <em>The Golden Girls</em>, when he was a child.</p>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> The mice originally had bigger roles before &#8220;other people had a say in things and made us cut things.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> They reached out to Don Cheadle to make sure he was okay with them mispronouncing his name.</p>\n<p><strong>12.</strong> Gary the Concierge (Hitchcock) wears a three-piece suit, and as the daily temperatures were usually over a hundred degrees he would sweat in it. They ultimately decided to hide the sweat stains by drenching the entire suit in water. (This is one of the commentary&#8217;s many &#8220;factual&#8221; moments that I&#8217;m not entirely sure is factual.)</p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> The missing microchip originally ended up in Star&#8217;s hair, and the search for it led to an adventure on a glass-bottom boat.</p>\n<p><strong>14.</strong> That&#8217;s really Dornan singing, and it was his choice to tear his shirt off at the end of the song. He wasn&#8217;t supposed to &#8212; they mention the shirt wasn&#8217;t designed as a tear-away &#8212; but he felt it was necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>15.</strong> Production designer Steve Saklad cameos as the author photo on the back of the self-help book that Edgar (Dornan) is reading.</p>\n<p><strong>16.</strong> The ice cream at 47:25 is actually mashed potatoes. The cotton candy is insulation material.</p>\n<p><strong>17.</strong> There were alligators in those canals that they&#8217;re water-biking through, and Greenbaum didn&#8217;t tell either of them until after they finished filming.</p>\n<p><strong>18.</strong> Damon Wayans Jr. plays Darlie Bunkle, and his first scene with Dornan sees him wearing a face mask which, while funny at the time, plays differently for the trio watching it during a pandemic. &#8220;Hopefully when you&#8217;re watching this in a decade it&#8217;s not normal anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>19.</strong> They shot a scene with Darlie and Edgar meeting up at a Pasta &#38; Stuff restaurant that results in disaster, but it was cut for pacing.</p>\n<p><strong>20.</strong> The Tommy Bahama (Andy Garcia) appearance was originally meant to include Panama Jack &#8212; and they really wanted Barack Obama to play him.</p>\n<p><strong>21.</strong> Barb&#8217;s line about Edgar &#8220;pleasuring&#8221; her was originally &#8220;penetrating,&#8221; but that was enough to earn an R rating so they made the change.</p>\n<p><strong>22.</strong> The crab that talks to Star was brought to life by two puppeteers. They don&#8217;t mention Morgan Freeman&#8217;s name, but while the voice certainly sounds like Morgan Freeman, it most definitely is <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/morgan-freeman-crab-in-barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not Morgan Freeman</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>23.</strong> Early screenings left people wondering who was playing Sharon Gordon Fisherman. &#8220;That&#8217;s insane to me,&#8221; replies Wiig.</p>\n<p><strong>24.</strong> They shot the end water fight in the actual ocean, not a water tank.</p>\n<p><strong>25.</strong> The montage while Barb and Star are underwater thinking they&#8217;re about to die is an encapsulation of the film&#8217;s themes and tone too. &#8220;It is kind of emotional and sweet, and then it&#8217;s really absurdist and silly at the same time.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>26.</strong> The banana boat was deflated a bit and towed slower than usual for the safety of Wiig and Mumolo, but it meant they had to pretend it was bouncy making for an awkward ride.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Best in Context-Free Commentary</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote\">“Should we just go through and say everything that went wrong?”</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks, Getty Images!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No one can wear a floral blouse like Jamie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely came up with multiple different positions for you to wake up in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Despite appearances, those bracelets were not expensive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re still listening, well done.&#8221;</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It&#8217;s clear that these three had an absolute blast making this bonkers movie. <em>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</em> is silliness distilled, and their appreciation for that absurdity comes through in the film and in their commentary. The big takeaway here, beyond the laughs, is the lesson to be true to your own vision. Sure Wiig and Mumolo came into this with past credits, but they still had to fight for the things they felt strongly about in the telling of their story. The results speak for themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Read more <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/commentary/\">Commentary Commentary</a> from the archives.</p>\n<img
