In Ireland, there&#39;s been a recent resurgence in the Irish language, and a lot of movement to promote Irish speaking throughout the countries. This resulted in an Irish speaking bar being opened in Dublin. I didn&#39;t grow up in Ireland, so I don&#39;t speak a word of Irish- but my best friend was begging me to go with her to this bar.

Our plan goes off without a hitch, and we&#39;re in! I turn, ready to ask my friend to order me a drink, to find her lost in the eyes of a boy she&#39;d met a few nights previously.
