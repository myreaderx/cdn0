The league is set to resume play on Thursday, September 10 and we have all the details on how you can stream all 250+ games this season.</p>\n\n<p>The 2020-21 NFL season is already shaping up to be a bit different than past seasons since all of the preseason games have been cancelled. Instead of playing exhibition games, NFL teams started their training camps late and they will now go directly from training to week 1 of the regular season.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully though, the schedule for the NFL's regular season remains unchanged and each team will play 16 games during a 17-week period. As usual, there will also be Bye Weeks where each team will get a week off between weeks 5 and 13 to rest and recover before returning to the fray. Bye Weeks are not determined by the teams themselves but by the NFL schedule makers which include SVP of scheduling Howard Katz, senior director of broadcasting Blake Jones, director of broadcasting Charlotte Carey, VP of broadcasting Michael North and VP of broadcasting Onnie Bose.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-watch-2020-nfl-season-online-anywhere\" title=\"NFL live stream: How to watch every Week 2 NFL game from anywhere\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/09/nfl-stadium-espn.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>While the regular season will proceed as it normally does, there have been some changes made to the format of the 2020-21 playoffs. The NFL has officially expanded its playoff format from 12 to 14 teams which will allow for one more wild-card team from each conference. This means that the AFC and NFC will each have seven playoff teams but only the top seed from each conference will receive a first-round bye in the playoffs. The NFL first expanded the playoffs to ten teams in 1978 and then to twelve teams in 1990.</p>\n\n<p>Although the pandemic won't be stopping the 2020-21 NFL season from proceeding, there will be some changes made for both player and team safety. First off, there will be no fans in attendance at the stadiums of most teams with the exception of the Cowboys, Colts, Jaguars, Chiefs and Dolphins who have all announced that they will allow fans to attend games in limited capacity. For stadiums where no fans will be in attendance, NFL Films has created artificial crowd noise unique to each stadium. At the same time, so far 67 NFL players have decided to sit out of the upcoming season including the Jets' C.J. Mosley, the Giants' Nate Solder, the Bears' Eddie Goldman and the Patriots' Dont'a Hightower among others.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you've been eagerly awaiting the start of the 2020-21 NFL season or just want to tune in to watch some football this fall, we'll show you exactly how to watch all 250+ games live on TV or online from wherever you are in the world.</p>\n\n<h2>How to watch the NFL from anywhere</h2>\n\n<p>We have all the details on how you can watch the NFL in the U.S., Canada, UK and Australia further down in this guide.

For the price though, you get access to almost all of the channels you'll need to watch the NFL this season including ESPN, Fox, and NBC but not the NFL Network or CBS. However, the company is <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU93448YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fprogramming%2Fsports%2Fnfl&#38;token=tQrfjp1V\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">running a promotion</a> where it will send new customers an over-the-air antenna for free if they prepay the first two months so you can also watch games on CBS.

The fact that Sling is sending out free over-the-air antennas to customers who prepay the first two months just sweetens the deal by giving you access to local regional sports networks and CBS. You can also add NFL RedZone to your plan with the Sports Extra pack for an extra $10 per month.</p>\n\n<div class=\"rows left collection\">\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK MINI -->\n\n<h4 class=\"product reco-block\">Sling TV</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-watch-2020-nfl-season-online-anywhere\" title=\"NFL live stream: How to watch every Week 2 NFL game from anywhere\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/04/sling-logo.jpg?itok=U9CaBDB0\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUnU93448YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F&#38;token=UEskzIfv\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$45 at Sling</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">To maximize your NFL viewing this season you'll need both the Orange and Blue plans from Sling.

The service offers access to CBS, NBC, FOX, NFL Network, ESPN, &#38; Redzone, which covers nearly every single option that you need in order to be able to watch the games each week as they take place. It's a bit more expensive than Sling, but if keeping up on all the action is important to you, this is the way to go.</p>\n\n<div class=\"rows left collection\">\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK MINI -->\n\n<h4 class=\"product reco-block\">Fubo.TV</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-watch-2020-nfl-season-online-anywhere\" title=\"NFL live stream: How to watch every Week 2 NFL game from anywhere\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/08/fubo-logo-ait.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv?irad=343747&#38;irmp=221109&#38;subId1=UUacUdUnU93448YYr&#38;subId2=dac\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$54.99 per month at Fubo</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Fubo TV offers access to just about every single NFL game that will take place during the 2020-2021 NFL season.

You'll probably often get RedZone with it. The two channels are very different, though. NFL Network is more like a 24/7 news channel for football. You'll get analysis, breaking news, and original programming. It also airs some full Primetime games over the course of the season. The original programming includes shows like NFL GameDay, a year-round news show called Good Morning Football, and a nightly news show that covers top headlines called NFL Total Access.</p>\n\n<p>NFL RedZone, on the other hand, is geared more towards football fans who just want to see everything happening on game day. After all, on any given Sunday during the season there are usually a dozen games being played at the same time. RedZone makes it easy to keep tabs on several at once. Using the RedZone's Octobox, you can watch eight at once. The \"red zone\" in football is the area between the 20 yard line and the end zone. It signifies when a team is close to scoring points. When a team reaches that point, RedZone cuts to the local broadcast. So you can't use this channel to watch an entire game, but you can use it to watch all the exciting points from several games. This is also a great channel if you play fantasy football because you can keep tabs on different scoring players on different teams.</p>\n\n<h2>Live stream the NFL in Canada</h2>\n\n<p>Canadian football fans can catch every game in the 2020 NFL season by signing up for <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.flexlinkspro.com%2Fa.ashx%3Ffoid%3D1147316.140861241%26foc%3D1%26fot%3D9999%26fos%3D1%26fobs%3DUUacUdUnU93448YYr%26fobs2%3Ddac%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.dazn.com%252Fen-CA%252Fl%252Fnfl%252F&#38;token=5mURiYcK\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">DAZN</a>. With DAZN, you can watch football on a wide variety of streaming devices including Roku, AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV and more as well as on your computer, smartphone, tablet and game consoles. The streaming service costs either $20 per month or $150 for the year.</p>\n\n<h2>How to watch NFL in the UK</h2>\n\n<p>American football fans in the UK can watch a number of NFL games on <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/watch/nfl-on-sky\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Sky Sports</a> this season as the network will show more than 100 live games on its Sky Sports NFL and Sky Sports Main Event channels. Sky will show at least five live games per week including every Thursday, Sunday and Monday Night Football game.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not a Sky Sports subscriber yet or aren't interested in committing to a lengthy contract, you can also get access to the network's content with a <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinmid%3D11006%26awinaffid%3D103504%26clickref%3DUUacUdUnU93448YYr%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nowtv.com%252Fsports-purchase&#38;token=IeXKUEQo\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">NOW TV</a> pass.

Australian viewers will also be able to watch two games per week free over-the-air on <a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/09/nfl-returns-to-7mate.html\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">7Mate</a> and some games will be available to stream on the network's streaming service 7Plus.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not interested in signing up for Foxtel, the over-the-top service <a href=\"https://kayosports.com.au/sports/sport!gridiron/series-national-football-league!271\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Kayo Sports</a> will show a selection of NFL games each week via ESPN.
