And at the same time, it is one of my most favorite!

Some less expensive than others, but none as inexpensive as the one we were able to make ourselves. Plus, isn't it always the greatest when you can customize it to fit your space in size and color? Yes and yes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />To get started, I ran to Home Depot to pick up a \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/34HRA6f\" target=\"_blank\">1\" x 2\" oak wood board</a>, which I purchased by the linear foot (2 feet @ $0.81/foot). I also found \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2X10UPL\" target=\"_blank\">an oak dowel</a> to coordinate, and decided to go with the 3/4\" diameter. The best part about this project is that you can determine the length and number of pegs that you would like select your sizes accordingly.\n<br />\n<br />The only tools that we used to assemble the rail of pegs is \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NUpHAZ\" target=\"_blank\">our miter saw</a> (you could also use \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Q2pKxu\" target=\"_blank\">a simple miter box</a>), and \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Q39XOI\" target=\"_blank\">our drill</a> with \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/34RdO5X\" target=\"_blank\">a 3/4\" spade bit</a>&nbsp;and \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/36OzKAs\" target=\"_blank\">a bottle of wood glue</a>.\n<br />\n<br />Step one is to measure the desired length and cut the 1\" x 2\" board to size. I only had a small spot to fill and planned to use the rail to hold hand towels and small cleaning supplies, so I decided on 16\" in length.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dPIlO3fYxuc/XccHLHql1yI/AAAAAAABPV8/XxumYu_3acobamrKMLvFletin7DGpJqLgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dPIlO3fYxuc/XccHLHql1yI/AAAAAAABPV8/XxumYu_3acobamrKMLvFletin7DGpJqLgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_2.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I then decided that I wanted the rail to have a total of four peg hooks, so we cut a portion of the dowel into four, two-inch pieces.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MhXpUR8sB7w/XccHLKO9YwI/AAAAAAABPV4/qB64bOcY8Do72O_0D2St0v1DjKsiXOSuACEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MhXpUR8sB7w/XccHLKO9YwI/AAAAAAABPV4/qB64bOcY8Do72O_0D2St0v1DjKsiXOSuACEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_3.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />To inset the pegs we used the 3/4\" spade bit and our drill.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5DV9_36OBwI/XccHM69GFzI/AAAAAAABPV8/gv4C7FxNdSU3Pi3bcyUzSZW5pKcQhND9gCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_6.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5DV9_36OBwI/XccHM69GFzI/AAAAAAABPV8/gv4C7FxNdSU3Pi3bcyUzSZW5pKcQhND9gCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_DIY_Peg_Rail_Organizer_Wood_Project_6.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Wood Peg Rail Organizer\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />To determine the spacing on the rail, I decided on how much space I wanted on each end and marked accordingly.

You can see more of the blank slate photos of our son's room in \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/02/progress-report-teen-boy-bedroom-closet.html\" target=\"_blank\">this post here</a>. It can be frustrating at times, but it is probably better that I allow myself to take these rooms at a snail's pace. I have never been one to pull off a room that I love with longevity if I race to the finish line.\n<br />\n<br />In our son's room, I got stuck on such an odd detail, and that was the shelf to install over his new desk. I tried three options before I landed on the right one so I felt a lot of thankfulness for nice return policies! (In case you are curious about the shelves I checked out for&nbsp;the space, they were \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70292104/?query=702.921.04\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90292103/?query=902.921.03\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, and&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10300499/\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>.) After holding each one up and also asking my&nbsp;son to offer up his opinion, we decided that maybe we would be better off finding one that matched the stain in the nearby DIY wall map, which tends to be the main focus in the room.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lte9TeZ_osM/WvAtkc_IGNI/AAAAAAABMRE/ujVq4zAXhHcKFwb6z03EBHQGH-nkGI-9ACLcBGAs/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_10.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lte9TeZ_osM/WvAtkc_IGNI/AAAAAAABMRE/ujVq4zAXhHcKFwb6z03EBHQGH-nkGI-9ACLcBGAs/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_10.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Why was a shelf important? Well, my goal is to give my&nbsp;son a workspace that is easy to keep wide open and clear of clutter. He tends to be more productive and efficient when he is free of distractions and has simple organization. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree!\n<br />\n<br />So, a shelf not only would add a nice decorative touch to the space, it would also function as a place to toss some of those extra office supplies that tend to land on a desk. When the other shelves didn't feel right, I found \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2IlbAnz\" target=\"_blank\">these</a> and used them as our inspiration to DIY something. We needed something that was a good depth for holding books and boxes, but not too deep that it felt heavy and out of place.\n<br />\n<br />We already had a pair of the \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10136135/#/90136136\" target=\"_blank\">7 1/2\" EKBY shelf brackets from IKEA</a>, so I thought it would be quick and easy to just head to the hardware store and grab a piece of standard lumbar to stain. I took the brackets with me only to realize that the common boards are generally a 3/4\" thickness, and the brackets really needed something closer to an inch thick. I searched the store for something that would be a better fit, and then I remembered that I had used a stair tread with these types of brackets in the past. YES! Not what you might typically think of or go to, but it makes the perfect shelf option. Not only are they the correct thickness, they are also strong and sturdy and shouldn't bow easily.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>The obvious solution may have been to pair and IKEA EKBY shelf with these EKBY brackets, but they didn't offer a finish that we were trying to achieve.</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qx1jQkly7y4/WvALZJICqJI/AAAAAAABMOs/V3-V_gwrml8UHA6jMgs8vA8yH6zTlg5jwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"450\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qx1jQkly7y4/WvALZJICqJI/AAAAAAABMOs/V3-V_gwrml8UHA6jMgs8vA8yH6zTlg5jwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_1.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />My favorite projects are ones that I can do quickly and easily with little to no help or money, and this one checked all of those boxes!\n<br />\n<br />I began with the following supplies, many which I already had on hand from previous DIY projects.\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Circular or Table Saw</li>\n <li>Tape Measure</li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JWXcz0\" target=\"_blank\">Wood Conditioner</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2IeiLy3\" target=\"_blank\">Stain</a> &amp; Rags</li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JZlLeN\" target=\"_blank\">Stair Tread</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10136135/#/90136136\" target=\"_blank\">Shelf Brackets</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JWTK7y\" target=\"_blank\">Flat Black Spray Paint</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n The first step was to measure and cut the stair tread down to size.

This was the ideal solution for my sweet-as-pie niece. A rolling cart would help her to transport all of her belongings out to the kitchen each day. And I know that this situation is probably unique but if you have a pantry, or even just some extra room in your kitchen, this cart could be your best baking buddy. There were \n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2M00SnR\" target=\"_blank\">a few options for me to select from</a>, but I decided \n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/330aTrm\" target=\"_blank\">the Essex Rolling Cart</a> was the best due to the drawers and expandable work surface. After it was easily assembled, I was honestly shocked by just how much I was able to store in this small but mighty cart (definitely emptied an entire shelving unit in her room).\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t09T6wR9ZTI/XUBhXgkdhUI/AAAAAAABOes/bI5KcXX8d0k6BM6i2fW789PfMRkPuVmWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t09T6wR9ZTI/XUBhXgkdhUI/AAAAAAABOes/bI5KcXX8d0k6BM6i2fW789PfMRkPuVmWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_1.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n You might think I am exaggerating, so I will show you how I organized each drawer. But first, I added a wide basket to the open shelf so that she could easily load it up with any bulkier items like her cake decorating turntable, drying racks, baking sheets/muffin tins, etc... based on what she is working on for the day. The basket prevents the items from sliding off of the edges while she is carting things to the nearby kitchen.\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GxWY0sBIKXo/XUBha0k8R0I/AAAAAAABOfQ/S1MYlKkgSVM_0R7UrxpTJHiYjSkbVuVSgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_7.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GxWY0sBIKXo/XUBha0k8R0I/AAAAAAABOfQ/S1MYlKkgSVM_0R7UrxpTJHiYjSkbVuVSgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_7.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n OK, now, onto the drawers, which are always stocked, loaded, and ready when she is.\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yMGSBUKyMMc/XUBhX5XAhsI/AAAAAAABOe0/oBce0AcsldE1JpGx1MoMF_YuDj3kS9jugCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_11.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yMGSBUKyMMc/XUBhX5XAhsI/AAAAAAABOe0/oBce0AcsldE1JpGx1MoMF_YuDj3kS9jugCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_11.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n Drawer number one is full of colorful goodies: cupcake liners, food/icing coloring, food-safe dusting powders, and sprinkles!\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iUD60OnzrO8/XUBhXpqrQ-I/AAAAAAABOew/SGnMltQHSp0Klr5Di2eV3IHfARE5ZLkqwCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_10.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iUD60OnzrO8/XUBhXpqrQ-I/AAAAAAABOew/SGnMltQHSp0Klr5Di2eV3IHfARE5ZLkqwCEwYBhgL/s1600/Michaels_Essex_Baking_Cart_Organized_IHeart_Organizing_10.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n The next drawer is so intimidating to me because I have no idea what to do with all of those icing tips, but I have watched my niece decorate her creations and she definitely puts these to use and appreciates all of the options she has collected over the years.

His room isn't all that large or \"roomy\", so maximizing his closet to allow for both drawer and hanging storage was extremely important and has proven to be a great way to give him more space for reading, working on projects, having sleepovers, and doing his homework.\n<br />\n<br />We knew there were so many benefits to widening the doorway to his closet, but then the problem solving began in terms of how to cover it all back up.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AplXUNxxkCY/Xh-Al1bfoTI/AAAAAAABPw4/SDx1TayZiTQoDNy0O9He-aWMRWtkErjmgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_Header.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"767\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AplXUNxxkCY/Xh-Al1bfoTI/AAAAAAABPw4/SDx1TayZiTQoDNy0O9He-aWMRWtkErjmgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_Header.2.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />There was a bit of planning and troubleshooting and decision making that went on with this project. Here are a few of the things we had to work through:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />To keep the trim or not? That was the question. I decided that if we kept the trim around the door, that it ultimately should be completely covered by the door when it was pulled closed. But that would also increase the size of the door by about 4-5 inches in width, and the door was already measuring pretty large. The alternative was to remove the trim, but that would require more drywall work and some fussy refinishing.\n<br />\n<br />Before making a quick decision, we thought we would install the rail to get a good idea of how far away from the wall the door would hang, and if the trim would interfere with it at all. Bryan easily had the rail installed in less than an hour and didn't even call me in to help (using the included installation instructions). Yay Bryan! Except I was instantly confused by the placement of the rail. He used the large bolts that came with the rail kit and installed them directly into the wall studs. Which made complete sense. But, this meant that the rail didn't go all the way to the corner of the room (it was just an inch or two short). If you want to be extremely specific about the rail placement, then you actually need to install a ledger board into the studs first, and then the rail can be installed anywhere into the ledger. Bryan knew I didn't want to use a ledger board if I could help it, so he just assumed going into the studs was the answer. But then I wasn't sure if I loved that the hardware didn't land exactly into the corner. And that led to another decision to make.\n<br />\n<br />We now knew that the door would hang out enough to clear the trim, so the trim was going to stay. But before making any more decisions regarding the rail placement/ledger board, I wanted to construct the door and see it on the rail. The advantage of a ledger board is that it gives you the flexibility to install the rail hardware wherever you would like. It also allows the door to hang even further away from the wall/trim. The disadvantage is that it is another distracting element that adds to the entire setup (although painting the board the color of the wall would minimize that).\n<br />\n<br />When coming up with the design for the door, I had a couple of inspiration pictures saved that I continuously referenced. \n<a href=\"http://www.rachelhalvorson.com/franklin-farmhouse/bbfvitlwi0bo7ls5iuwz5y0ean9sq5\" target=\"_blank\">This one</a> and \n<a href=\"https://www.decorpad.com/photo.htm?photoId=154228\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> were my top two favorites. They both had a diagonal design that was trimmed out in a classic style. My son also really liked the design and gave me the thumbs up. With the hardware installed, we now knew how the rail system worked, where we wanted the wheel hardware to attach to the door, and the maximum thickness the door should be.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i><b>Quick Tip:</b> We taped a couple of pieces of paper together that were scaled to the exact width of the door that we had planned to build. Then we drew the top trim boards based on our measurements and \"installed\" the paper on the rail with the hardware. This was a GREAT way to visualize how the door would cover the closet door casing and also allowed us to confirm that the boards we were planning on using to trim the face of the door would line up nicely with the hanging hardware. I like to visualize things before completely committing whenever possible.</i>\n<br />\n<br />Finally, my last but largest concern that I had was that the large door would be too overwhelming due to the smaller size of his room. The door was going to be just over 4' x 7' and I just didn't know of any other options in terms of closing off that wonderful opening we created. I told myself that sometimes larger things work best in small rooms to create more visual interest and to help balance some of the smaller accessories and knick-knacks. I also figured I could paint the door a similar color to the walls so that the pattern could be the focus, and the color would more or less fade away.\n<br />\n<br />Now that we had worked through all of those points, it was finally time to start building that dang door!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uQXO0HeCXio/Xh4n2wpmHvI/AAAAAAABPuQ/VOw-m-mEdJAkESbI_tMTUYq6K-M-WdonACEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_7.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uQXO0HeCXio/Xh4n2wpmHvI/AAAAAAABPuQ/VOw-m-mEdJAkESbI_tMTUYq6K-M-WdonACEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_7.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9dI7fUcg4Zw/Xh4hh86IVJI/AAAAAAABPsU/nD9d7nB6HxQjtKkd0emH35mljr3tsG2-wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Material_List.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"62\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9dI7fUcg4Zw/Xh4hh86IVJI/AAAAAAABPsU/nD9d7nB6HxQjtKkd0emH35mljr3tsG2-wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Material_List.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/370cG1m\" target=\"_blank\">4' x 8' x 1/2\" mdf board</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FVkzZH\" target=\"_blank\">1\" x 2\" x 8' primed boards</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2thHjk3\" target=\"_blank\">1\" x 4\" x 8' primed boards</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3a60pKJ\" target=\"_blank\">5/16\" x 5 1/2\" pine lattice boards</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FOunor\" target=\"_blank\">large paint sticks</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2uGIlq3\" target=\"_blank\">miter saw</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3aa6S7q\" target=\"_blank\">circular saw</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RlFv1k\" target=\"_blank\">wood glue</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/35SGaN1\" target=\"_blank\">brad nailer</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/36VgctA\" target=\"_blank\">paintbrush</a> | \n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Rkc5k6\" target=\"_blank\">paint roller</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/35Mm7jq\" target=\"_blank\">barn door hardware</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Ru7AUz\" target=\"_blank\">door pull</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Q39XOI\" target=\"_blank\">cordless drill</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2tWZg7u\" target=\"_blank\">speed square</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RfPNjM\" target=\"_blank\">wood putty</a> | \n <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3adfgCT\" target=\"_blank\">sanding block</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<br />Because our opening plus trim was over four feet, we talked through a few ways to achieve that width with as little wood as possible (to keep the door from getting too heavy).

With that in mind, we thought we would construct something similar to our son's \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2015/10/diy-herringbone-pattern-headboard.html\" target=\"_blank\">DIY headboard project.</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nH7pguNEH_A/Xh4n4SiInSI/AAAAAAABPuA/exsPN6pCwOAPWh1AAVGX96Xj-Bym0I4lQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_Build_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"767\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nH7pguNEH_A/Xh4n4SiInSI/AAAAAAABPuA/exsPN6pCwOAPWh1AAVGX96Xj-Bym0I4lQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Sliding_Barn_Door_DIY_Teen_Closet_Build_1.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing DIY Sliding Barn Door Teen Closet\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The rail was already installed so we had the exact measurements we needed so we began by cutting the height of the door accordingly.\n<br />\n<br />Then I got to painting.

Bryan ended up ripping each one to be exactly flush with the depth of the mdf board plus the diagonal pieces. Again, we added those boards to get the door just wide enough to cover both the closet opening and the closet door casing. This also added a nicely finished edge on each side of the door.\n<br />\n<br />To finish off the design, I found some light-weight pine lattice moulding at Home Depot.

Printable!","link":"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2020/01/happy-new-year-free-goal-setting.html","description":"Happy New Year everyone! I sincerely hope that your holidays were full of warmth and love and happiness!\n<br />\n<br />A new year means different things to different people, and although all of the highs and lows of years prior don't just disappear when the clock strikes midnight, January 1st does seem to signify a fresh start. I am here to say \"cheers\" to that!\n<br />\n<br />Some years I set goals, and some I don't. There are times I worry about setting resolutions because of the fear of failure, or because I figure that they will all be forgotten by February. I also tend to over-analyze everything and can take goal setting too far. If goals become overly complicated, or out of touch, then I find I am less likely to feel motivated and encouraged. What I have found to work best for me is to:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Select 2-5 large scale goals for three areas of my life: Personal, Business, and Health. This is for the entire year!&nbsp;</li>\n <li>Use those goals to set smaller, bite-sized targets each week that ultimately correlate with my overall vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />All of that said, I really want to give goal setting a real shot this year! Without specific goals, it can be easy to end up on a hamster wheel or to feel lost at sea. Using the method I find works best, I set out to create some printables to help organize my ideas. I am heading into this process with a mindset of \n<i>why</i> these goals are important to ME! It can be easy to select goals to fit a specific mold, or generic resolutions that have been set by society, but doing so doesn't ultimately aid in personal growth. I am also keeping in mind that I am not trying to give myself a total makeover, or change who I am at my core. The entire point of goal setting is to look at opportunities for improvement and to drive myself to succeed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vqsRfOy0Rxc/XhTeM-7gFjI/AAAAAAABPpc/BgZnaV_lHq4VoHi-OiHkkvpr9e0YJTs0ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Goal_Setting_Free_Printable_2020_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"434\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vqsRfOy0Rxc/XhTeM-7gFjI/AAAAAAABPpc/BgZnaV_lHq4VoHi-OiHkkvpr9e0YJTs0ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Goal_Setting_Free_Printable_2020_2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />So while \"getting more organized\" and \"go to the gym\" and \"budget\" are all completely fine resolutions, I am going to challenge myself to think outside of the box, get specific about exactly what goals I am selecting (and why), and jotting down simple action plans to help me get there.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />The printables I designed are intended to get us thinking and to put a pen to paper. The best part is that I left these pages free of timelines and dates, so they can be printed and reused or updated at any time of the year. I plan to clip mine to the front of \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/35st88V\" target=\"_blank\">my new planner pages</a>&nbsp;so that I can check in on them as I do my weekly scheduling/planning/to-do lists.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>To download, click the link below the image to be directed to the PDF file.

Set up a box for donations that you can easily access and try to fill it by the end of the month. Less is always more when it comes to organization, and the small act letting things go is the best way to get started.\n<br />\n<br />I also encourage you to take on organization in bite-sized projects. Focus on one small space at a time, and select areas that you utilize and touch the most frequently first. Organizing is always a process and you can't organize your life overnight. I have a few areas around our home that could use some zhushing, and I hope to share those this month as I tackle them. My personal organizational goal for January is to organize one thing that I have been putting off, and I have a few of those projects to pick from!\n<br />\n<br />Last year I put together a super-sized series of posts with all of my favorite tips, tricks, and products.

The one that becomes a dumping ground with an endless pit of random items. It happens to the best of us!\n<br />\n<br />Most of the drawers around our home are set up in a way that they self maintain, but there are a couple that demand attention more often; our junk drawer in our kitchen, and apparently, my nightstand drawer both top that list.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2cxR6DAX9sI/XUsETU8TPlI/AAAAAAABOhA/Dd-B7CRNfcYz1NIahzuxi93cgHmHK2GJACLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Bedroom_Cleaning_Tips_Nightstand_3.2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2cxR6DAX9sI/XUsETU8TPlI/AAAAAAABOhA/Dd-B7CRNfcYz1NIahzuxi93cgHmHK2GJACLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Bedroom_Cleaning_Tips_Nightstand_3.2.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I clean out the junk drawer every month or so, because even with dividers, random items that don't have an instant home, end up in that very popular drawer. Being in such a high traffic area that we all utilize, I am pretty good about tackling it frequently to keep some semblance of order.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ruR0jGIlNM0/XUsE9yfTRRI/AAAAAAABOiw/VP04F-NHyqYJg-PfDtx7DZmH60Wc-mltACLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Junk_Drawer_Organizers_Kitchen.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"862\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ruR0jGIlNM0/XUsE9yfTRRI/AAAAAAABOiw/VP04F-NHyqYJg-PfDtx7DZmH60Wc-mltACLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Junk_Drawer_Organizers_Kitchen.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />But my nightstand... that's another story. I generally only see it late at night or during a quick surface cleaning session. It was time to finally do something about it.\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes these projects are brought on last minute when I just can't take it anymore. I generally just tackle them and never think to blog about the before and after. It's just a drawer after all. But dang. Anytime I see an organized drawer, or a before and after, I am 10000% more motivated to tackle one myself. So this time I grabbed my iPhone and took a quick picture of the before and decided that I would share the process. I am encouraging all of you to do the same! It doesn't have to be a nightstand drawer, it can be ANY drawer! Just one. Let's do it!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CANYyXMrrUk/XUsKppQvRFI/AAAAAAABOi8/FcidqY2Py5MVPB8NGl0tF9O1BWzoBQDUACLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Before_3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"767\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CANYyXMrrUk/XUsKppQvRFI/AAAAAAABOi8/FcidqY2Py5MVPB8NGl0tF9O1BWzoBQDUACLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Before_3.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<br />Wow, really Jen?\n<br />\n<br />Let's see, there were candles, linen sprays, essential oils, cold and sinus medications, drawer hardware, jewelry, prescriptions and supplements, hair accessories, lotions, cough drops... the kitchen sink is about the only thing missing from this drawer. Remember, this is a no judging zone.\n<br />\n<br />Clearly, I would use something and then just toss it inside.\n<br />\n<br />First step was to sort it all out. I found two random bins/baskets and used one for \"Keep\" and another for \"Relocate\". The keep items would stay in the drawer and the rest would go back where it truly belonged.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l1FyY4Jp8Eo/XUsEaq2VORI/AAAAAAABOio/Te7YYEfuHeIUhhmBUlSzcu44xSc8851mgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Sorting.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l1FyY4Jp8Eo/XUsEaq2VORI/AAAAAAABOio/Te7YYEfuHeIUhhmBUlSzcu44xSc8851mgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Sorting.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Ha! Look at the difference!\n<br />\n<br />I also gave my nightstand a good cleaning and thought to myself that the old, velvet-esque drawer liner was dark and dirty.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mcuAwEJfvZM/XUsEZE1xJEI/AAAAAAABOis/Pj_AvFCz8m48Jv1KKVB42U5Zey6afAGtQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Empty_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mcuAwEJfvZM/XUsEZE1xJEI/AAAAAAABOis/Pj_AvFCz8m48Jv1KKVB42U5Zey6afAGtQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Empty_1.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I had a couple of foam core boards so I cut them to the shape of the drawer and wrapped them in a scrap of light blue linen fabric.

And I really believe these small changes make a big difference in the end result.\n<br />\n<br />I dug through my stash of organizers and pulled some dividers and a random bowl that I thought would better fit the drawer and help me maintain things better going forward.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hH0-YG45Eo/XVGwd37eiRI/AAAAAAABOkM/aggYnl5tMWwFGQEql5-kP9tiP-jRklqIQCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Empty_3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hH0-YG45Eo/XVGwd37eiRI/AAAAAAABOkM/aggYnl5tMWwFGQEql5-kP9tiP-jRklqIQCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_Empty_3.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The bottom drawer just holds a massage pillow, oil diffuser, and my daily journal.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ib9CVB50ziQ/XUsETqv6qyI/AAAAAAABOio/tRp3QlQTz5kCAQKNnYXXNqN8Ta1pOqHeQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_After_10.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ib9CVB50ziQ/XUsETqv6qyI/AAAAAAABOio/tRp3QlQTz5kCAQKNnYXXNqN8Ta1pOqHeQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_After_10.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />And here is the after of the top drawer:\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gcTH04_YR_4/XUsETRueKMI/AAAAAAABOio/mR7SJyz60yUP1kcWr2_uqmHOXpZIlZK0QCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_After_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gcTH04_YR_4/XUsETRueKMI/AAAAAAABOio/mR7SJyz60yUP1kcWr2_uqmHOXpZIlZK0QCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Nightstand_Organization_After_1.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The back organizer corrals all of my morning/nightly meds and supplements.

Our middle P turned 14 last week, we celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary this past Sunday, and our oldest turns 17 next week! Toss in baseball tournaments, graduation parties, summer activities, birthdays for parents and friends...We are lovin' all of the summer fun! And to top it all off, Amazon had to go ahead and toss in their biggest sale of the year; \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zHY5Lu\" target=\"_blank\">PRIME DAY</a>! I am guessing many of you marked it on your calendar as a celebratory holiday too! \n<i>*wink wink</i>\n<br />\n<br />I originally considered sharing my favorite Prime Day deals like I did last year, but then when the sale is over, the post is only partially relevant. Instead, it inspired me to finally get a post out that I have had on my list for a very long time.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TCWWIZEKsiI/W02kU8tdHLI/AAAAAAABM50/6LkUhZWysRscsOQyKVZaoujoYvfgCxWFQCLcBGAs/s1600/amazon.favorites.header.550px.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"550\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TCWWIZEKsiI/W02kU8tdHLI/AAAAAAABM50/6LkUhZWysRscsOQyKVZaoujoYvfgCxWFQCLcBGAs/s1600/amazon.favorites.header.550px.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Jrg5JT\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.\n<br />\n<br />I am pretty sure they are taking over the world.\n<br />\n<br />I want to start out by saying that I prefer to shop on Etsy and with small businesses as often as I can, especially when looking for unique and special gifts, home goods, textiles and even clothing. But did you know that a lot of small businesses are also turning to Amazon to launch and sell their&nbsp;product? Love that! And because we are a busy crew, my Amazon app is always running so that we can use the benefits of our Prime membership to the fullest. Free shipping on everyday items&nbsp;saves me so much time on running errands, which I truly appreciate. Not only that, the product selection on Amazon is generally pretty extensive, and their prices are also generally pretty competitive.\n<br />\n<br />I dislike that this sounds salesy and like an #ad, even though it is not, but the matter of the fact is that I source 60-70% of my cleaning and organizing products from Amazon for both myself and the clients that I work with. And I have always thought that I should create a space on my blog specifically for my favorite Amazon products because of how universally&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;Amazon is compared to many alternative retailers. So hopefully this list is not only a great resource for myself and my clients, but for you all as well!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n

Storage","link":"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2020/03/before-after-from-tired-cabinet-to.html","description":"Our bathroom vanity is only 30\" wide so we have always had to get a little creative with our storage situation. Up until recently, we had been utilizing a tall bathroom cabinet to house many of our daily toiletries. Over the years, that cabinet began to slowly fall apart. First, the bottom drawer front fell off so I just put a tall basket in its place. More recently, all of the drawer fronts had completely fallen off, the sliding drawer hardware had snapped, and the cabinet wasn't even hanging on by a thread. It was time to snip that thread, cut our losses, and look for an alternative solution.\n<br />\n<br />(\n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2015/06/four-week-wait-no-more-organizing_26.html\" target=\"_blank\">You can see my previous post on our bathroom organization here.</a>)\n<br />\n<br />The bathroom itself hasn't been updated in about 15 years now and is something we would like to tackle within the next year or two. Once we were sans cabinet, I needed something ASAP to keep our limited counter space free of my clutter and to make up for the loss of three drawers and three shelves. You know where I am going with this right? I really didn't want to invest a lot of money into something knowing that we aren't too far away from making more permanent changes to the bathroom.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MuzOkHVJnQk/XmvVW-9N0MI/AAAAAAABP8g/reIOnMsVImkl87ukWwTtnMnOVHKr41zxgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_12.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MuzOkHVJnQk/XmvVW-9N0MI/AAAAAAABP8g/reIOnMsVImkl87ukWwTtnMnOVHKr41zxgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_12.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />With that in mind, I went straight to Facebook Marketplace to look for an inexpensive solution. I was looking for a piece of furniture that wasn't too deep (I didn't want it to be obtrusive in our modest-sized bathroom) and something with doors. With the germs that fly in the bathroom, I always prefer storage behind drawers and doors. Doors also cut down on the amount of surface that I have to clean and wipe down frequently. I initially thought a lawyer style bookcase would be a bit different, but with our bathroom being on the smaller side, I ultimately decided it would be nice to do something with more glass. So I started to search for curio style cabinets that were less than 14\" deep.\n<br />\n<br />I figured that it would be a quick find, but it took some weeks of checking in and trying a variety of search terms. I finally stumbled upon something within my low budget, but it would require some modifying to make it juuuuuuust right.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jUwL_s7axMc/XmX4lEo7KYI/AAAAAAABP4c/ov1RWqSF_AIxKQuYQgd74ONZDdSo4n6YgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1153\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jUwL_s7axMc/XmX4lEo7KYI/AAAAAAABP4c/ov1RWqSF_AIxKQuYQgd74ONZDdSo4n6YgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_1.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The picture above is from the original listing, and my husband raised his eyebrows when I told him I wanted to take a drive to pick up this piece of furniture for our bathroom. Although the wood wasn't in great shape, the price was low and I saw a diamond in the rough.\n<br />\n<br />What I was instantly drawn to was the top half of the cabinet. The glass portion was the perfect size and I also appreciated the decorative moulding for a more traditional look. The bottom of the cabinet wasn't at all my style and felt too bulky, but my hope was that we could construct something a bit more streamlined. As soon as we got the cabinet back into our home, we began to slowly deconstruct it to separate the top piece from the bottom.\n<br />\n<br />We built the new base from hardwood 1\" x 2\" poplar boards.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--CBd6hliHVo/XmX4poTfLmI/AAAAAAABP5A/ufHtL9bhD00y61T4GDCp-J0f-V82plemwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"767\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--CBd6hliHVo/XmX4poTfLmI/AAAAAAABP5A/ufHtL9bhD00y61T4GDCp-J0f-V82plemwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Our \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2v6IML5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kreg Jig</a> was our best friend for this project, as it allowed us to create a series of concealed pocket holes to assemble a clean looking finished product.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uS0PSiALrg0/XmX4p0Itb8I/AAAAAAABP5s/DR4pe-aMOE83qBTkEj4ox5kX-PAV3G0VACEwYBhgL/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"767\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uS0PSiALrg0/XmX4p0Itb8I/AAAAAAABP5s/DR4pe-aMOE83qBTkEj4ox5kX-PAV3G0VACEwYBhgL/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_3.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The base of the cabinet was going to be about 12\" deep by 24\" wide. We did two tiers of support so we would be able to add a shelf at the bottom as well.

I was worried the clean and simple bottom wasn't going to tie into the more traditional top. But before I made any final judgment, I decided to prime and paint the entire piece a solid color.\n<br />\n<br />Prior to painting, I did a few things to prep the cabinet. We used our brad nailer to affix the shelf to the base. Then I caulked all of the cracks around the legs. I used a sanding block to sand everything down. After that, I took \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2VWXFKI\" target=\"_blank\">a liquid deglosser</a> to the top half of the cabinet because the wood had a chipping top coat and I wanted to be sure I wasn't going to have any trouble with paint adhering. Not done yet, I used some wood filler to fix any cracks, dents, holes, scratches, etc... Finally, I taped all of the glass off with painter's tape and found my oil-based primer.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b_J5_z28-3A/XmX4sHFKrLI/AAAAAAABP6A/SS1z3QxGKS8FAWLKmSfCNwa9DWPPXkkgACEwYBhgL/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_8.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"839\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b_J5_z28-3A/XmX4sHFKrLI/AAAAAAABP6A/SS1z3QxGKS8FAWLKmSfCNwa9DWPPXkkgACEwYBhgL/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_8.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Once the primer was dry, I sanded everything again and did two coats of \n<a href=\"https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/1624/westcott-navy?color=1624\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Moore's Westcott Navy</a>.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnRJ6Z1YoyY/Xm2jtQbbEkI/AAAAAAABP-k/5PHL1WskI0sw8pb_sgK2I71W2LI9QwgLwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_10.3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"871\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnRJ6Z1YoyY/Xm2jtQbbEkI/AAAAAAABP-k/5PHL1WskI0sw8pb_sgK2I71W2LI9QwgLwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Bathroom_Cabinet_DIY_Hack_IHeart_Organizing_10.3.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Once painted, the cabinet turned out really lovely.

Or how you are getting creative with storage around your home! Share the details in the comments below or tag me on Instagram!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>P.S. I purchased this cabinet on Facebook Marketplace weeks prior to any news of COVID-19. I completely understand the sensitivity of the current situation and Facebook Marketplace may not be the best way to shop given current social distancing recommendations.

There were also some accessories waiting to be used, toiletries, cleaning supplies, a random towel which he uses as a floor mat, travel items... All thrown in there somewhere. Yikes.\n<br />\n<br />The problem I find with most of these stock bathroom cabinets is the lack of storage that is provided. There is plenty of space inside but not an easy way to make the most of it. And with the sink and plumbing, it can be challenging to find the right stacking drawers or bins to take advantage of all the vertical space.\n<br />\n<br />This cabinet is nearing 20 years old and on our list of items to update in the future, but I still wanted to find a quick, inexpensive fix to get the bathroom storage up to par.\n<br />\n<br />The process I take with every organizing project no matter what the size/scale is as follows:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Empty everything out</li>\n <li>Clean the empty space</li>\n <li>Sort through all of the belongings</li>\n <li>Decide what we need in the space vs. what we currently have</li>\n <li>Put everything back&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />So I emptied everything out and was left with some loud liner...\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ayh9Hq7y2mw/XZyz7Gb7HwI/AAAAAAABO4g/y7twNnoCF1Y16vFEBsWpYqRajiNRbKHuwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_8.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"450\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ayh9Hq7y2mw/XZyz7Gb7HwI/AAAAAAABO4g/y7twNnoCF1Y16vFEBsWpYqRajiNRbKHuwCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_8.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I replaced it with something more subtle.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8axBH-YbBaE/XZyzthWj-AI/AAAAAAABO4k/1ZHX3lpEd5AMI86ZPQh2Zi8uUNOyKYkCQCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_12.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8axBH-YbBaE/XZyzthWj-AI/AAAAAAABO4k/1ZHX3lpEd5AMI86ZPQh2Zi8uUNOyKYkCQCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_12.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />My ultimate goal was to add a second layer of surface area halfway up the cabinet. Our local Home Depot sells white laminate boards, so we purchased \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/35oA5Ji\" target=\"_blank\">a single 3/4\" thick, 2' x 4' board</a>.\n<br />\n<br />The one board would be enough for us to cut down to use as a shelf and to also add supports for the shelf below (the bathroom cabinet is a 3' wide cabinet).\n<br />\n<br />Because the cabinet has a trim piece that runs down the front center of the door opening, the new shelf couldn't be left as a single piece that runs the entire inside length, it wouldn't be possible to get it into the cabinet. We decided to cut two separate shelves, one for each side, also notching out the plumbing area.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rqs6y4BRxC0/XZyzu2JGJXI/AAAAAAABO4k/TTteDB-QJugblMqGaG9pZ04tLsVGJkQ8gCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_15.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rqs6y4BRxC0/XZyzu2JGJXI/AAAAAAABO4k/TTteDB-QJugblMqGaG9pZ04tLsVGJkQ8gCEwYBhgL/s1600/DIY_Under_Cabinet_Shelving_Bathroom_Sink_Organization_IHeart_Organizing_15.png\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Under Bathroom Sink Double Shelving Storage Solution Organization\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />For the notch, we measured the amount of space clearance needed for the plumbing and used the lid of a container to trace out the curved area.

Gone are the days where I purchase pretty bins and baskets to decorate with. Although I will always appreciate beautiful storage,&nbsp;it has to be versatile&nbsp;\n<i>and</i>&nbsp;it has to last! With that in mind, there are a few storage products that I have found that continuously work hard for me in a variety of situations, so they end up being the types of products I gravitate toward when working on any new projects. For the final post in the series, I am putting together the ultimate storage source list with tips and products that I have fallen in love with over the years.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />So let's dive in with part four of the four-part&nbsp;series:&nbsp;\n<i>Practical, Everyday Storage Solutions!</i>\n<br />\n<i><br /></i>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4-23tfNs40s/XTHYz7aLfRI/AAAAAAABOZ8/3YxGLdRzJGwHo1yU5ne3yB_XGAu8J7Q6gCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Practical%252C%2BEverday%2BStorage%2BSolutions_Header.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"863\" data-original-width=\"575\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4-23tfNs40s/XTHYz7aLfRI/AAAAAAABOZ8/3YxGLdRzJGwHo1yU5ne3yB_XGAu8J7Q6gCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Practical%252C%2BEverday%2BStorage%2BSolutions_Header.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<i><br /></i>\n<br />\n<br />As you go through the motions of organizing areas of your home, storage should be the last piece of the organizing puzzle. Storage baskets and organizers aren't always necessary, but they really can be a key component in keeping a simple and tidy space. Here are just a few of the consistent benefits I have seen by utilizing baskets, bins, containers and drawer dividers over the years:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Containers assign items a proper home to return to.</li>\n <li>Containers prevent items from becoming jumbled and messy.</li>\n <li>Containers keep items divided into specific categories.</li>\n <li>Containers allow for easier portability/accessibility.</li>\n <li>Containers offer a place for your eye to rest and ultimately aid in finding items quicker (by eliminating visual clutter).</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n A few more container-specific tips I have picked up over the years:\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Wait until the very end of any organizing project to determine best container types/overall storage needs (after you sort and eliminate you may find you need less storage than you initially thought).</li>\n  <li>Always keep receipts/tags in and on your storage until you have taken it for a test run. If it isn't making your day-to-day life easier after a week or two, head back to the drawing board.</li>\n  <li>Storage is meant to aid and simplify, so if it is complicating things, ditch it.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Think long term. Don't select items that are a specific color, are trendy, or only going to be relevant for a specific season of life. Look into products that will stay versatile as your needs evolve. I have learned over the past 15 years the types of storage that have longevity and versatility and what ends up in the donate pile. My general rule is to select products that are neutral in finish/texture; clear, white, linen, and natural/woven materials always win.</li>\n  <li>Storage can be really expensive, but it doesn't have to be! I will never be above sourcing pretty storage solutions and finding a way to DIY or hack things on a budget. Cardboard boxes can be covered in fabric, dividers can be cut from wood, cereal and shoeboxes can be wrapped in paper, modular pieces can be combined to create dream closets... A little creativity goes a long way and sometimes custom solutions are the best way to maximize and get exactly what you need.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<br />It would only be appropriate to start with my number one favorite storage item of all time:\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-reQ_oXJ7Oqw/XSjAvdP4fyI/AAAAAAABOP8/UYNOyv7NcQgHjgjJY1WUHQhO6hxmAsz2gCLcBGAs/s1600/Shop_Now_Product_Header.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"99\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-reQ_oXJ7Oqw/XSjAvdP4fyI/AAAAAAABOP8/UYNOyv7NcQgHjgjJY1WUHQhO6hxmAsz2gCLcBGAs/s1600/Shop_Now_Product_Header.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<center>\n <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3660987\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Since then, I have really reduced the number of items I actually decant on a weekly basis. I have also since discovered some \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2liQCMb\" target=\"_blank\">comparable containers from Target</a> that seem to do a much better job of locking in the freshness for longer periods in time. So good that I have made the switch to these for our baking ingredients as well as for beans and snacks in our coffee cabinet.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><b>Produce:</b></span>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.5.2_zps2y95qazj.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.5.2_zps2y95qazj.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Since my last fridge post, I also swapped out our produce containers after many, many years. A few months ago I spotted \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2lnxlct\" target=\"_blank\">these Prepworks Produce Prokeepers</a>&nbsp;at our local Costco (no longer available) and I instantly appreciated that they were flexible enough to store a large variety of produce types inside of the fridge. They include detailed instructions right on the lids with the best way to get the longest shelf life for everything from lettuce to berries to mushrooms and grapes. These containers have vents on the ends that can be opened or closed depending on the contents, as well as a drip tray that can be used to add or collect moisture. I also appreciate the more compact sizes and that the containers stack and wash nicely.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><b>Leftovers:</b></span>\n<br />\n<br />We began using glass food storage containers for produce, meal prep, snacks, and leftovers quite a few years ago, and I continue to heart them just as much today. I look for containers with snapping/locking lids, and they do such a great job maintaining freshness. The biggest perk is that the containers last forever (haven't had one break on us yet). They also wash beautifully each and every time, no more worrying about trapped food smells or red stains. Finally, many glass storage containers can quickly and easily go straight from the fridge to the oven or microwave without dirtying another container for cooking.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><b>Snacking:</b></span>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/01_iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.2_zpspvxbfts8.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/01_iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.2_zpspvxbfts8.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />We use two types of containers for snack prep each week. And although both are still plastics, they have cut down on our single-use plastic usage significantly.

They are a really great way to categorize and separate items, while ultimately preventing jumbled and tangled messes. Opening a divided drawer should allow you to quickly see and access exactly what you are looking for, and will also cause a pause-and-think-moment when putting things away. I have tried a few types of organizers over the years, but there are a select few that I continue to come back to time and time again due to their versatility, sizing, and cleanliness.\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><b>Office | Bathroom | Junk Drawers:</b></span>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Junk_Drawer_Organizers_Kitchen_zpsxfbph85t.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Junk_Drawer_Organizers_Kitchen_zpsxfbph85t.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Kitchen_School_Zone_Drawer_zpsyhuhpwbw.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/iHeart_Organizing_Kitchen_School_Zone_Drawer_zpsyhuhpwbw.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<br />I have two favorites for these types of drawers: acrylic and rubber-coated options.

I have grown to prefer natural baskets far more than any other finish for a few reasons, many that have already been discussed above. Traditional and timeless? Check. Versatile? Check. Textural and beautiful? Check. I still have woven baskets from when we built our home almost 18 years ago because I continuously move them around and find new uses for them. They are made to last from natural material. And did I mention they will always look good? OK then.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/IHeart_Organizing_Linen_Closet_Basket_Labels_zpsxveg08hf.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"746\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Favorite%20Storage/550%20px/IHeart_Organizing_Linen_Closet_Basket_Labels_zpsxveg08hf.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I find myself consistently heading to the same places to seek out the best deals and the nicest looking baskets. You can rarely go wrong by heading to \n<a href=\"https://www.homegoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HomeGoods</a>/\n<a href=\"https://www.marshalls.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marshalls</a>/\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/32tedej\" target=\"_blank\">TJMaxx</a> in terms of sizing, variety, and prices. \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NYe6UY\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a> always has really substantial, beautiful options, but can be a little more expensive. \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NYeC5m\" target=\"_blank\">Pottery Barn</a> and \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/32u0SlP\" target=\"_blank\">Container Store</a> also have really lovely solutions, so when they have good coupons or sales, I pounce. And of course, you can never go wrong with the \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00138432/\" target=\"_blank\">BRANÄS baskets from IKEA</a>. The smaller size fits on most cabinet and bookcase shelves, while the larger size is a wonderful match to many of the modular units sectioned by squared openings.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <span style=\"color: #999999;\">________________</span>\n</div>\n<br />I seemed to have taken a note from \n<i>The Lorax</i>&nbsp;because this post just kept biggering and biggering as I wrote it. I also love that the more images I sifted through, the more I saw many of these same products on repeat inside of drawers, closets, and cabinets. Each and every one of these storage solutions has been tested by me multiple times over the years, and receive my super-sized stamp of approval.\n<br />\n<br />I also hope that this post was able to give you new ideas for reusing storage you may already have on hand. Versatile should always be the name of the storage game!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 10:00:00

Organizing a house that no one actually lives in is slightly different than my typical duties; it has its own set of challenges but it is a bit of a dream at the same time. You have to work within the parameters of specific sponsors and design styles and be sure it is editorial, while also being able to use beautiful props. The ideas still have to be relatable and sensible, which of course is my favorite part!

I knew I would be tasked with organizing the master bedroom closet and bedroom, the studio armoire, and many of the kitchen cabinets/drawers. The key items I sourced were a mixture of wire and woven baskets, spring-loaded drawer dividers, clear bins, wooden hangers, and glass jars. I was able to mix and match these items in each area that I touched, which made my job \n <i>much</i> easier in the end. I do believe in measuring and purchasing storage that makes sense for each project, but by selecting items in basic and natural finishes, you are guaranteed that they will stand the test of time.\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <b>TIP #2:&nbsp; SPRING LOADED DRAWER ORGANIZERS ARE AMAZING</b>\n <br />\n <br />\n <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-36uuUgjF0t8/Xc2lHOni-eI/AAAAAAABPhY/Xsgu143-WWQhAXL7qRmMOqwxhyOaCdHsQCEwYBhgL/s1600/1564682968329.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"781\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-36uuUgjF0t8/Xc2lHOni-eI/AAAAAAABPhY/Xsgu143-WWQhAXL7qRmMOqwxhyOaCdHsQCEwYBhgL/s1600/1564682968329.jpeg\" /></a></td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.rusticwhiteinteriors.com/\" style=\"font-size: 12.8px;\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: Rustic White Interiors for HGTV</a></td>\n   </tr>\n  </tbody>\n </table>\n <br />I have mentioned before that sometimes I am the last to hop on any trend train, and for some reason I wasn't quick to take advantage of spring-loaded drawer dividers.

It is truly wonderful to have all of that extra space, but making sure items are not being lost in the back can be a major problem. It is my goal to find the deepest bins possible in this situation because they turn into instant drawers. These bins not only categorize everything, but they also take items from the back to the front in a single motion. Also, whenever possible I like to organize from shortest to tallest. If space permits I will also add lazy susans to the mix.\n <br />\n <br />\n <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xIjGS3egaXw/Xc2lJEdlwGI/AAAAAAABPhU/XbVKdetbdrwVZrtFxxfgXvHrYgDfsEhpACEwYBhgL/s1600/1564682984785.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"781\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xIjGS3egaXw/Xc2lJEdlwGI/AAAAAAABPhU/XbVKdetbdrwVZrtFxxfgXvHrYgDfsEhpACEwYBhgL/s1600/1564682984785.jpeg\" /></a></td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.rusticwhiteinteriors.com/\" style=\"font-size: 12.8px;\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: Rustic White Interiors for HGTV</a></td>\n   </tr>\n  </tbody>\n </table>\n <br />Another tip is to place your small appliances inside of the deep cabinets and relocate your more frequently used items and foods into your standard cabinets and drawers.

I love a good woven basket when I am actually trying to conceal and streamline visual clutter, so I find they are a great option for open shelves and in open areas. But when it comes to organizing behind cabinet and fridge doors, I say the clearer the better. Anytime you can quickly see what you have on hand, you are one step ahead of the game. It also allows you to identify items without the need for fussy labels. Heading to the grocery store?

Drawers always get my vote if there is an option between the two. I typically find that lower base cabinets are a recipe for that deep and dark area of doom (standard depth is around 24\"). Sure, you can add pull out drawers and mechanisms inside of the cabinets, but you have to open the cabinet doors all of the way, navigate around them, and then pull out the contents. A drawer is a quicker way to access everything while ensuring nothing is getting lost. Drawers are also much easier for kids to use and maintain while maximizing overall space (no need to install any extra components).\n <br />\n <br />\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <span style=\"color: #999999;\">__________</span>\n </div>\n <br />Last but not least, let's just celebrate this amazing backyard moment.

organizing projects, and how they have maintained or held up. I have been thinking a lot about how we tend to blog about our projects instantly as we do them, whether it be DIY or organization, and we may really love something right after it is complete, but find ourselves changing things down the road for various reasons. Knowing that, I would like to be better about either waiting to post about something until we have lived with it for a short while and worked out any kinks, or just be sure to be better about following up on things as they evolve or change over time.\n<br />\n<br />When I posted about \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/04/the-best-of-best-my-top-organizing-tips.html\" target=\"_blank\">my all-time favorite organizing tips</a>, I received a lot of emails about our docking/charging station. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to do another post for anyone newer around here, or for those wondering how it has worked for us over the years.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WRva_q5lcj0/XTt75_o8FnI/AAAAAAABObk/piIMO36D8-8lYfMp32sa1o5X5DANLMfcwCLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WRva_q5lcj0/XTt75_o8FnI/AAAAAAABObk/piIMO36D8-8lYfMp32sa1o5X5DANLMfcwCLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2016/02/family-charging-station-cabinet.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\">FIND THE ORIGINAL POST HERE</span></a>\n</div>\n<br />We have a cabinet located in a sideboard in our dining area that we dedicate to all things technology and school. I am a really big fan of creating zones in our home dedicated to specific tasks, and because we go through schedules and homework and do school-related projects at our dining table, this cabinet has been so very valuable and handy to us over the years.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />This is one of those projects where I can honestly say, that other than some supplies, not much has changed in what we keep here or how we utilize the original systems in place. That makes this a true thumbs up of a project that has remained extremely useful as our boys have gone through elementary, middle, and now high school.\n<br />\n<br />Before diving into the specifics of the cabinet, a key partner to the setup is the drawer located just above, which I stock with fresh supplies at the beginning of each school year.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-33JL7hjDrSo/XTt77VXIFlI/AAAAAAABOb8/uBXQ8aeU_sQSOos4vOb3WJ_AQeERXDxgQCLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Kitchen_School_Zone_Drawer.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-33JL7hjDrSo/XTt77VXIFlI/AAAAAAABOb8/uBXQ8aeU_sQSOos4vOb3WJ_AQeERXDxgQCLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Kitchen_School_Zone_Drawer.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />This drawer typically contains erasers, paperclips, Post-its, stapler, scissors, pens, rubber bands, color pencils, page flags, a ruler, hole punch, pencils, sharpener, glue, and tape.\n<br />\n<br />These are items that seem to be required to accomplish the majority of their homework and projects.\n<br />\n<br />Now, back to the cabinet...\n<br />\n<br />We built a paper sorting inbox for the kids to manage any necessary school paperwork: newsletters, calendars, details about extracurriculars and athletics, lunch menus, etc... (\n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2016/02/do-it-yourself-paper-sorting-organizer.html\" target=\"_blank\">find the paper sorter DIY tutorial here</a>.) Once a week I just go through each slot and recycle anything that is no longer relevant.

The tray is able to accommodate Chromebooks, Bluetooth accessories (keyboard/headphones/battery cells), tablets, and phones. We found that some of the universal cords also work to charge a variety of other small household electronics/devices out of sight as well, which is just a happy bonus.\n<br />\n<br />(I used my label maker to label each tier of the organizer, you can find all of those details in \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/05/labeling-101-quick-easy-labeling.html\" target=\"_blank\">this post here</a>.)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTEqCgU2zAc/XTt76-UdNcI/AAAAAAABOcM/-iVxiN-pkHwiC0rEQuwxSzHZ5BNfCuHngCEwYBhgL/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.5.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTEqCgU2zAc/XTt76-UdNcI/AAAAAAABOcM/-iVxiN-pkHwiC0rEQuwxSzHZ5BNfCuHngCEwYBhgL/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.5.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Because we quickly realized that there are times the kids still need a charge during the day or while they are traveling, we store some spare bricks and cords in the cabinet as well.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i><b>Quick Tip:</b> I have used a lot of ties and cord wranglers over the years, and have learned that rubber bands and/or hair ties easily and inexpensively do the trick just as well as anything.</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--4r8BinP6OM/XTt77ENu3LI/AAAAAAABOcQ/_5pSkxdYcT0Gh4sULdBKPUd4nGXz7SrDQCEwYBhgL/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.6.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"826\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--4r8BinP6OM/XTt77ENu3LI/AAAAAAABOcQ/_5pSkxdYcT0Gh4sULdBKPUd4nGXz7SrDQCEwYBhgL/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.6.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, we have accrued quite a few random colored pencils and markers over the years, so they all get tossed in some lidded bins that can easily be transported to desks or the table as needed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-45RrjzZLAlA/XTuFroyuojI/AAAAAAABOck/-JFn76Rcp_svwXx08SYQ77VR4PNpe4XEwCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Sources_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"45\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-45RrjzZLAlA/XTuFroyuojI/AAAAAAABOck/-JFn76Rcp_svwXx08SYQ77VR4PNpe4XEwCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Sources_2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<center>\n <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3671053\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

I think the tiered paper organizer works so well due to its overall size and narrow slots, which is something to keep in mind if you are looking for alternative trays/organizers to do a similar task.

Also, simplify your cleaners down to just what you \n<i>need</i> to reduce confusion for the entire family. Many all-purpose cleaners are just that and can tackle counters, windows, stovetops and even quick floor cleanups. Keep bathroom cleaners under a bathroom sink and kitchen cleaners under the kitchen sink.\n<br />\n<br />The basic cleaning supplies that I have found I can get away with using for 99% of our household chores are:\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Oze69g\" target=\"_blank\">Duster</a></li>\n <li>All-Purpose Cleaner (I just use a mixture of distilled water, 2-3 drops of dish soap, vinegar, and tea tree oil, and apply it to counters, appliances, glass, and floors)</li>\n <li>A couple cleaning cloths (one for glass, one for surface)</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KPz5SW\" target=\"_blank\">Vacuum</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2vK8zWk\" target=\"_blank\">Mop</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n In the bathroom:\n</div>\n<div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Toilet bowl cleaner</li>\n  <li>Toilet brush</li>\n  <li>Surface cleaner &amp; cloths</li>\n  <li>Shower cleaner inside of a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2P7ND3w\" target=\"_blank\">dispensing scrub brush&nbsp;</a></li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<br />I have loved and used \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oy9RuE\" target=\"_blank\">cleaning caddies</a> for years now, and they are great when I am doing a bigger room-to-room deep cleaning session, but for daily battles, I like that my go-to cleaners are right within an arm's reach of the mess. I also recommend keeping a vacuum and broom on each floor of the home and storing less-used specialty cleaners together and out of the way (I keep mine in our laundry room).\n<br />\n<br />By removing a lot of the extras and keeping it simple, my family asks me fewer questions and are quicker to just grab what they need to get the job done.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/02_zpslksthgwg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/02_zpslksthgwg.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_04_zpsskmoqrge.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_04_zpsskmoqrge.png\" data-original-height=\"495\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Color code the cleaning rags.\n<br />\n<br />We use microfiber cloths for just about everything, and to prevent cross-contaminating the bathroom germs with the kitchen germs, I assigned the two spaces their own cloth colors. Green is used in the kitchen and blue is used in the bathroom (or for other dirtier jobs). I also added a stack of pink for our pets near their feeding station. Easy enough for all of us to remember and the rags just get stored in their designated areas.\n<br />\n<br />At the end of each week, the bathroom rags are washed with my mop heads and bath mats, the pet rags are washed with dog bed covers and their bath towels, and the kitchen rags and dishtowels are washed together. I always wash these items on a sanitary cycle during my Sunday linen wash day.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/03_zpsjd5kc50f.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/03_zpsjd5kc50f.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_02.2_zpsymctbiof.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_02.2_zpsymctbiof.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Baking soda and dish soap can clean just about anything.\n<br />\n<br />Clear dish soap makes a really great stain remover and I use it all of the time on furniture, clothing, rugs, and spills. Because it is clear, I don't have to worry about it damaging colors or materials (I always start with a small drop or two and paired with some water it typically does the trick). Baking soda is a good deodorizing agent and also helps to absorb the spill/stain/wetness.\n<br />\n<br />For those tougher messes (think pots, pans, baking sheets, ovens, etc...), soaking items with baking soda, dish soap and water is a major sanity saver. After cooking I always soak our pots and pans with baking soda and dish soap and by the time I am ready to wash them, they come clean with little to no scrubbing.\n<br />\n<br />Baking soda and dish soap seem to be a powerhouse cleaner when combined, and I wouldn't hesitate to reach for the combo when tackling any major cleaning job around the house, inside or out!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/04_zpsjm2hzvnq.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/04_zpsjm2hzvnq.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_08_zpsokbealp1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_08_zpsokbealp1.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Clean from top to bottom.\n<br />\n<br />This general rule applies to just about any cleaning task; it is always easiest and quickest to work from the top down. Washing glass? Start at the top and make \"S\" motions down to the bottom. Cleaning the kitchen, wash counters and the table first, then vacuum/mop the floor. Bathroom? Clean the mirror and work down to the sink and counter and finish at the base of the toilet. Spraying down the siding outside, start at the top and... you got it!

Washing items against the grain will bring out imperfections and may cause the surface to appear less clean than it is. It is always best to clean floors, stainless steel, wood furniture, etc... \n<i>with</i> the natural grain of the item. When the cleaner dries, it should blend right in and enhance the beauty, not fight it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/06_zpsj2umo2jr.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/06_zpsj2umo2jr.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_03.2_zpsloatz2r4.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_03.2_zpsloatz2r4.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Dishwashers are not just for dishes!\n<br />\n<br />Did you know that so many other things can be cleaned in a dishwasher? A few examples of things we have washed in our dishwasher are light fixture shades, toothbrushes, sponges, scrub brushes, toys, soap dishes, shower caddies, combs, vases, canisters, baseball caps, drawer organizers, basic tools, vent covers, etc...\n<br />\n<br />Of course, I say this with my \n<i>use with caution</i>&nbsp;warning, the top rack is usually best for anything you worry about. Avoid putting anything too precious in the dishwasher, also avoid washing anything made of wood or with a delicate metal finish. Always rinse items first to prevent clogging up your dishwasher and when in doubt, leave it out.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/07_zpshutw2kfa.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/07_zpshutw2kfa.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_05.3_zpsxi1wmqj6.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_05.3_zpsxi1wmqj6.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Fold/hang clothes straight out of the dryer.\n<br />\n<br />In the past I would get in a habit of taking clothes out of the dryer, tossing them in a basket, and taking them to another room of the house to deal with. Then I would do my best to fold things during a nightly T.V. show, but too many times the contents wouldn't end up put away. And just as I did when I was a kid, my boys would mix dirty with clean or would leave piles on their beds which would then tumble to the floor...\n<br />\n<br />A while back we decided to try something new, so straight out of the dryer the clothes are either immediately folded or put directly on their respective hangers (I just grab the empty hangers out of the closet on my way to the laundry room), and stacked in a portable basket. Same for linens. It only takes a couple of minutes and makes it much easier to put everything away right away. I also have the boys doing this with their personal loads and it has completely cut down on the piles of questionables around the house and in each bedroom. The \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20401860/\" target=\"_blank\">wire baskets we use</a> are lightweight and portable making it easy to tote around the house and return back to the laundry room (as shown \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2016/05/laundry-room-update-built-in-wshiplap.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).\n<br />\n<br />Laundry can quickly become a monster if not managed regularly but really isn't all that hard if you just get into a good groove with it. I am not sure why it works so much better for us to just deal with everything right out of the dryer (vs. taking it to the couch or our bedroom to fold), but it has been a huge sanity saver so I call it a very basic win. And while we are on the subject, giving each member of the house their own designated day to do their laundry has also been amazing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/08_zpsunf4kwqg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/08_zpsunf4kwqg.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_06_zpsvklvogrm.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_06_zpsvklvogrm.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Multi-task whenever possible.\n<br />\n<br />I have gotten into the habit of building some of the basic household cleaning tasks into my routine each day, which makes it much easier to maintain the home in general. For example, I wash the bathroom sink/counter each time I brush my teeth. I scrub down the walls of the shower while actually taking a shower. I quickly wipe up the kitchen counters while making my coffee. I wipe down the inside of the fridge each week when I put away groceries. These very quick add-ins really add up each week.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/09_zpsrmfzwvvg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Blog%20Images/09_zpsrmfzwvvg.png\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_10_zpsg4ifxxuw.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Household%20Tasks/IHeart_Organizing_Cleaning_Basics_Tips_10_zpsg4ifxxuw.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Make your bed every day.\n<br />\n<br />Maybe I should move this one to the top because it might just be the most impactful. I will admit that I haven't always been a believer in making my bed every day, and never really encouraged the kids to do it either. But after it became such a positive habit, I can't imagine not doing it. It makes a huge difference in quickly pulling our bedroom together, but it also has been really uplifting to my mood. And I love leaving our bedroom door open and catching a glimpse of the tidy bed, which can be exactly what I need when I am having a messy day.\n<br />\n<br />Not buying it? I encourage you to try it for two weeks and check out \n<a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/reasons-to-make-your-bed-every-day-350511\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>&nbsp;(or listen to \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzLzbd-zT4\" target=\"_blank\">this awesome speech</a>).

And if that just isn't possible, to set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to do so. Too many times we have spent an entire afternoon on a weekend dealing with a week's worth of random piles and messes. I can think of 1,001 other ways I would rather spend a weekend day, and my family agrees.\n<br />\n<br />I know that some people are naturally more tidy than others. That some people can look right past a pile or mess and be completely unphased by it, while others can't focus or relax until that pile is gone. We have both personality types living under our roof and it has always been a give and take and compromise.\n<br />\n<br />There are definitely days when I say, \"the chores can wait\", and the clean freak in me has done a lot of letting go over the years. There is something to be said about soaking up the little moments in life and I know first hand that our time with our kids goes much too quickly. So cheers to playing a card game after dinner instead of stressing out about those puppy nose prints on the patio door.\n<br />\n<br />But the matter of the fact is that the mess will continue to be there until we deal with it, and it only snowballs if we don't.\n<br />\n<br />So we try to find that right balance and do our best to take care of a lot of the basics each day and to pick up after ourselves when we take things out.\n<br />\n<br />We also work together to do a quick pick-up at the end of each day. I leave a \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Oz7oQu\" target=\"_blank\">flexible basket</a> hung on a hook near the stairs to corral random items that need to be brought down, and it also works great for running through the house and collecting things like electronics, mail, crafts, toiletries, socks, etc... that have been left out throughout the day and need to be put away. We always tidy up the kitchen (run the dishwasher after dinner, quickly sweep or vacuum, wipe down the table/counters)&nbsp;and fluff the sofa pillows before bed. It makes all of the difference just taking 10-15 minutes each evening to start the following day off right.\n<br />\n<br />I wish there was a red \"easy\" button or magic cleaning fairy that would come in and get things done while we sleep, but general homekeeping just takes some work and discipline. We aren't always perfect or on top of every mess, and we still have times when we have to play catch-up and binge clean parts of the home, yard or garage. But we continuously instill in the boys that we are all responsible for \n<i>our</i> home, and always have them help with the basic homekeeping responsibilities.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wN9-Y90QUMA/W3IAMV37qmI/AAAAAAABM_U/02fEJNW-foEFHUMuRCudGOmrlBp7yHx_gCLcBGAs/s1600/Swash.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"20\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wN9-Y90QUMA/W3IAMV37qmI/AAAAAAABM_U/02fEJNW-foEFHUMuRCudGOmrlBp7yHx_gCLcBGAs/s1600/Swash.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I think this is one of those discussions that could really benefit from your added ideas and advice in the comments below.

Look familiar? In our area, there are so many homes built with similar style pantries; essentially a 2 ft x 2 ft closet with shelves. Is this a nationwide epidemic or just regional to the midwest?\n<br />\n<br />Although these closets seem to be fairly common, how they are used will be different for everyone. This particular closet is used by a husband and a wife, kids have all grown up and moved out, and they now have seven grandkids who love to stop by with their parents for a visit.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z1sAHRVHVlE/WrFtPmBeEuI/AAAAAAABL8g/V5tEEaGWb3oIZBGnb72Fy97htymH00rdACEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"733\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z1sAHRVHVlE/WrFtPmBeEuI/AAAAAAABL8g/V5tEEaGWb3oIZBGnb72Fy97htymH00rdACEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_2.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Their storage needs vary from week-to-week. They will buy in bulk if there are sales, they enjoy hosting during the holidays, and also like to have foods and snacks on hand for their visitors and grandbabies. It is also worth mentioning that they have alternative storage in their kitchen carved out for additional pantry&nbsp;items such as spices, oils, and baking supplies.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0b3977;\">T I P&nbsp; &nbsp;N U M B E R&nbsp; &nbsp;O N E</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />Begin with a \n<i>stocked</i> pantry. Do your&nbsp;grocery shopping for a typical week, and then take note of additional items you may purchase frequently and even some that may only be on rotation on occasion. Compile a list of everything you would like to be sure is accounted for in your pantry project.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0b3977;\">T I P&nbsp; &nbsp;N U M B E R&nbsp; &nbsp;T W O</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />Completely clear out the pantry and any other cabinets in your kitchen that contain food items that probably \n<i>should</i> be in your pantry. Discard any items that are expired, and categorize the remainder into groupings of \"like\" items.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0b3977;\">T I P&nbsp; &nbsp;N U M B E R&nbsp; &nbsp;T H R E E</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />Measure and create a plan! I tend to take this part pretty seriously, and I generally tackle these types of projects with the following goals:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Maximize the available space</li>\n <li>Store the categorized items based on their frequency of use</li>\n <li>Select products with longevity (this means that it will last many years either in the current space or is versatile enough to be reused in a variety of ways down the road)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n You have seen quite a few of my closet plans in the past; here is the one I had dreamed up for this specific pantry:\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xq89WPig6Ls/WrFtFjgRZ6I/AAAAAAABL8c/udeqLXubGLYG1tb8lYn8svL7dfMyGvNFQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Closet_Proposal.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"868\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xq89WPig6Ls/WrFtFjgRZ6I/AAAAAAABL8c/udeqLXubGLYG1tb8lYn8svL7dfMyGvNFQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Closet_Proposal.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n As with any project, the end result evolved a bit as I began ordering and installing and doing some final assessments. But as you can see above, the plans included drawers, door storage, bins to take up both the width and the height, as well as some room for change and growth.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n To come up with the closet plans I measured the width and depth of every shelf. They had already installed the shelving with ledger boards and wanted to work with what they had if possible. In these types of closets, adjustable shelving may add a bit more versatility, but it definitely is not necessary. From there, I sourced the products that I thought would make the best use of the shelves from top to bottom and front to back.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n While planning, I looked at all of the items that they currently had stored in their pantry, and also considered how they ultimately wanted the pantry to function. Could we maximize the floor to ceiling shelves \n <i>and</i> add a door unit, therefore freeing up additional cabinets in their kitchen for other things? You bet!&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <b><span style=\"color: #0b3977;\">T I P&nbsp; &nbsp;N U M B E R&nbsp; &nbsp;F O U R</span></b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n Let's talk about the beautification process. This is \n <i>NOT</i>&nbsp;a necessary step, but it is something that I like to do.

Buuuuut, they are not really a great option for everyday items and accessibility. Do you want to have to remove a basket just to open a lid and access another basket? No, you don't. Especially not on the daily as that would get old pretty quickly. Stacking baskets are really wonderful for maximizing height, I just recommend you think about how often you will need to get to the actual contents inside of the bins/baskets, and also consider using stacking options that have open fronts for the items used more frequently.</i>\n <br />\n <i><br /></i> \n <i><br /></i> \n <b><span style=\"color: #0b3977;\">T I P&nbsp; &nbsp;N U M B E R&nbsp; &nbsp;T E N</span></b>\n <br />\n <br />The last step I take in any organizing project is to label everything so everyone in the house can be on the same page and take part in keeping it somewhat tidy.

When there multiple small kids involved, everything is easily mixed and lost and confused. Also, getting the entire fam clan on board with putting things back where they belong, even in seemingly obvious situations, can be a bit of a challenge.\n <br />\n <br />\n <span style=\"background-color: white;\">So, while some people are strong Team Label people (I am right there with you),&nbsp;there are also times when it is necessary to pick your battles. For example, if you have clear containers and can see the contents, do you need to label them? Especially if it contains items that may change time and time again based on your meal planning and supply levels? Probably not. However, if you have clear containers and one has flour and one has powdered sugar and one has gluten-free&nbsp;flour and another has baking powder, labels are extremely helpful in identifying products that look the same but definitely are not. Labeling is also important in the pantry when allergies are involved.</span>\n <br />\n <br />In this closet, I labeled any bin or basket that was not clear or see-through, and nothing more (I used \n <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/~anfTv&amp;cid=SM:blogger:pd:link:IHeartOrganizing\" target=\"_blank\">these label holders with the elfa drawers</a> and \n <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/~anfT4&amp;cid=SM:blogger:pd:link:IHeartOrganizing\" target=\"_blank\">these label holders on the white stacking baskets</a>). The small clear drawer-like bins can be used for a variety of snacks and mini-packages, the larger multi-purpose bins can hold a mixture of pouches and boxes, the airtight food canisters can store cereals and pasta as needed (while offering the owners a quick visual inventory of the contents), and the door baskets can serve endless functions as groceries rotate through week after week.\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmxC_NJPkH4/WrG5p2mebCI/AAAAAAABMDA/fpEIDgoHlYACrlbYhYqFc8LNJRwhroapQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmxC_NJPkH4/WrG5p2mebCI/AAAAAAABMDA/fpEIDgoHlYACrlbYhYqFc8LNJRwhroapQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_1.jpg\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n <br />\n <span style=\"background-color: white;\">One of my bonus tips is something I always recommend when working on these types of projects, and that is to leave a little white space. Life changes, needs evolve, and it is almost always inevitable that something won't be taken into consideration during the initial planning phase. Having extra space allows for some flexibility down the road, and also allows your space, and yourself, to breath a little easier. It is always good to maximize your space, yes, but you may find that with the right products and systems, that you actually have more space than you initially imagined. I loved walking away from this project confident that the homeowners will continue to have room to grow and play with this closet, and that their overall usable space more than doubled with the help of these particular tips.</span>\n <br />\n <br />\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <span style=\"color: #999999;\">__________</span>\n </div>\n <br />How about a few before and after photos to see what a difference these changes made:\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U_6VIWMmVms/WrHqyr2JKFI/AAAAAAABMDc/xdc0nnewSc8HqyRzUZW6bqNRYyToS08YgCLcBGAs/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_After_1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"473\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U_6VIWMmVms/WrHqyr2JKFI/AAAAAAABMDc/xdc0nnewSc8HqyRzUZW6bqNRYyToS08YgCLcBGAs/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_After_1.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />\n <br />\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tj4PAZeLWFI/WrHqyk5Xj4I/AAAAAAABMDg/QX4_GvIFOKUmX4__o3SQNE-cVpPK0j9PwCLcBGAs/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_After_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"473\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tj4PAZeLWFI/WrHqyk5Xj4I/AAAAAAABMDg/QX4_GvIFOKUmX4__o3SQNE-cVpPK0j9PwCLcBGAs/s1600/Deep_Pantry_Organization_Tips_Maximize_IHeart_Organizing_Before_After_2.png\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />I love it so much that I sort of wish I could pick it up and transplant it into our own home!

I really appreciate how they can change the entire mood of a space just through scent. What I don't love is wasting my candles, whether it be the wax or the actual vessel that it comes in.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_Header_zpswxqidwyw.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_Header_zpswxqidwyw.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />Over the years I have learned to look for candles that are not only delightful in scent, but also come in a pretty jar. The jars they come in can always be upcycled and used as vases or storage around the home. More on that in a minute...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />And candles are not always cheap. I try to purchase the majority of my candles inexpensively (\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Ulgtzx\" target=\"_blank\">Marshalls/HomeGoods/TJ Maxx</a>, \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DzsFqB\" target=\"_blank\">Michaels</a>, \n<a href=\"https://www.tuesdaymorning.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tuesday Morning</a>, and \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2UjF1sK\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>), but some of my favorite scents are typically found at \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DyU9g2\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropologie</a> and local boutiques. I don't mind paying a little more for a really great quality candle, but it is ridiculously frustrating when the wick burns down before all of the wax is used. I might be doing something wrong, but so often the wick will be out and 1/3 of the candle wax is still in the jar!\n<br />\n<br />All of the wax has to come out from the jar before it can be reused. I have tried a few methods to remove the wax over the years and recently heard that freezing the candle was a really quick and easy way to do this. So I gave it a try...\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_15_zpscp5aouan.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"How to remove candle wax from vessel through freezing\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_15_zpscp5aouan.png\" data-original-height=\"702\" data-original-width=\"585\" title=\"Freeze Candle Wax\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />It actually worked pretty well! I left a candle in the freezer overnight and just chipped the wax out with a spoon. But look at all that wax! That seems like a lot of waste!\n<br />\n<br />So I went back to the method that I have typically used in the past, which is to heat the candle up on the stove in a pot of water. The water doesn't have to be boiling hot, just warm enough to melt all of the wax within the holder to a liquid (I remove the&nbsp;wick prior to warming up the wax on the stove, but it can be done after as well).\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_16_zpswdnqmyip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"How to remove candle wax from vessel through melting on the stove\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_16_zpswdnqmyip.png\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" title=\"Melt Candle Wax\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Now to save that wax! I recently had four candles leftover from Christmas and quickly realized that there was a lot of wax remaining in each of the containers once the wick burned down completely. I use to just pour the hot wax into the trash and reuse the container... but I decided to come up with a way to stretch that wax out going forward.\n<br />\n<br />Years ago I had a plug-in warmer that would heat wax as an alternative to lighting candles. They were all the rage back then, and I remember having packs of wax molds in different scents stocked in our junk drawer. So off to the craft store I went in search of some sort of mold. In the baking aisle I came across a plethora of silicone options which are typically used for candies and small treats. PERFECT!\n<br />\n<i><br /></i> \n<i>(Don't forget that most craft stores offer great coupons/discounts on a single item purchase!)</i>\n<br />\n<br />Now, when I melt the candle wax, I just pour it into \n<a href=\"https://www.joann.com/wilton-easy-flex-silicone-bite-size-daisy-molds/8633752.html\" target=\"_blank\">my special mold</a>! Below you can see how many wax melts I was able to create from four burned down candles. I can't get over how much wax I was able to save! \n<i>(<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TgcpQS\" target=\"_blank\">Similar mold can also be found on Amazon here.</a>)</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_17_zpsaepc1smf.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Candles/Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_17_zpsaepc1smf.png\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />It only takes a few minutes for the wax to naturally harden back up, and then they just pop right out of the silicone.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i><b>Quick Tip:</b> Pouring the wax out of the different candle holders can be a little messy, I recommend placing wax or parchment paper under the mold to catch any drips. Also, the candle holders can be really hot from the melting process, so use caution!!

I recently found&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2S6q7IN\" target=\"_blank\">these candle warmers</a>, but can't personally speak to how well they work. I imagine that they actually melt the wax of a candle more evenly and allow you to use the entire candle without lighting the wick at all (or needing to make molds). That would definitely be another great way to get the most of the candle before reusing the jar. Just wanted to try and offer up all of the options I can find.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>And it goes without saying but I will anyway, it is always important to be careful with candles in general.

By now, we have done the back-to-school organizing and routine changes quite a&nbsp;few times, and most things continue to get easier and easier. \n<i>LOVE</i> that! And over the years, I have shared quite a few of the things we do to prep, but this year I realized I haven't really posted about school lunches.

There have been times that I have felt bad that I wasn't making bear&nbsp;shaped sandwiches for my boys, and I definitely have my kids eat school-prepared lunches as well. That \n<i>shouldn't</i> make me feel bad and I know that now. We all do the best we can for our kids, period. I know that some people truly enjoy making art out of food, that some kids are vegetarian,&nbsp;have food allergies, only eat organic, or don't do sugar. This post isn't about that, it's just a few really quick and simple tips for how I handle the lunch prep/making process around here. So let's dive in.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oO5rPEFqPwk/XD-V-Ze2U5I/AAAAAAABNk0/H7AUFs6bmEEMB1NsO2fxaYqnVDJZj-F-QCLcBGAs/s1600/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_13.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"514\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oO5rPEFqPwk/XD-V-Ze2U5I/AAAAAAABNk0/H7AUFs6bmEEMB1NsO2fxaYqnVDJZj-F-QCLcBGAs/s1600/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_13.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #da602f;\">TIP #1</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />The first thing I did this year is sit down with my boys and figure out what each of them enjoys most. My biggest problems leading into this year have been over-purchasing foods, trying to over-cater to their specific taste buds, then ending up in a hamster wheel of packing the same things on repeat with very little variety.\n<br />\n<br />So, I sat with the boys and asked them what their favorite foods are, and wrote down all of the items that they could all agree on. We took some time to look for quick ideas online together to come up with 15-20 different lunch options as well as a variety of quick and tasty sides.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_04.6_zpsgxih2lwu.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_04.6_zpsgxih2lwu.png\" data-original-height=\"507\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />You know me, I couldn't miss an opportunity to whip up a free printable for you all, and I am SO glad I did. I made it editable so that we could type in all of our lunch ideas (which are broken down into categories: main course, fruits/veggies, sides/desserts), and then print it off and keep it inside of our pantry with our shopping/meal planning items.

And really, the best case scenario is that I give the boys the tools they need to be able to do everything themselves.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_12_zpsjfgcfwaj.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_12_zpsjfgcfwaj.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />So, that might mean giving into some pre-packaged items or creating my own quick snack packs that we can all just grab-n-go. Typically I portion off crackers, popcorn, fruits, veggies, protein bites, etc... Whenever I can, I select fruits and veggies that I know I will get the longest life from (I have found that grapes, carrots, celery, cucumbers, pea pods, oranges, peppers, melon, and apples will typically stay fresh throughout the course of the week without concern of spoiling, and are easy to portion out). \n<b>This is HUGELY important and probably my biggest tip.</b>\n<br />\n<br />I will also purchase individual meat snacks, cheeses, nuts, yogurts, granola, etc... if the price is right for the time I am willing to invest. If I have more time on a given week, I might opt to purchase in bulk and create those portions myself.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #da602f;\">TIP #3</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />OK, so basically the first step was to select the simple sides that can easily be tossed into a lunch, and next, I like&nbsp;to do a little prep. Again, I am putting groceries away anyway, why not just put them away in individual grab-n-go packages to make the entire week go smoother?\n<br />\n<br />Aside from the fast fruits and veggies mentioned above, we all really love berries as well. So, while putting groceries away and doing my weekly meal prep I will soak/rinse them in a bowl of water and vinegar for a couple of minutes. They seem to last longest if I do a quick soak and then let them air dry before refrigerating. This is one more step, but if I&nbsp;multitask&nbsp;during other meal prep, then it isn't too bad and I know I will prolong the freshness for a few extra days. I do this with all berries, not just strawberries.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_05_zpsvlokymgl.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_05_zpsvlokymgl.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Also fresh from the grocery store, I will cook up chicken to create grilled chicken strips that I will put in wraps, tacos, on salad, etc... And every couple of weeks I will freeze sandwiches in a few varieties in bulk.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_06_zpsthzrrovc.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_06_zpsthzrrovc.png\" data-original-height=\"436\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I recently switched to \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2p3n2ce\" target=\"_blank\">these wax paper bags</a> because they are compostable and keep the sandwiches fresh in the freezer. I will make a few loaves of bread worth of sandwiches at a time (I will also use rolls/croissants with meats/cheeses, etc...) and I find they work best if I don't use spreads other than peanut butter and jelly directly on the bread. I will put together a few sandwich varieties to select from, and just label the sandwich type on the wax paper bag.\n<br />\n<br />The bulk sandwiches go into freezer zipper bags (which I just keep reusing) and into the freezer until a school morning when they are transferred directly to the lunchbox and they are ready to eat by lunch.\n<br />\n<br />All of the pre-prepped snacks and sides are put together in a section of the fridge that the boy's love to grab from.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_02.5%20copy_zpswtylsi6s.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_02.5%20copy_zpswtylsi6s.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_02.4%20copy_zpsfafpoqoc.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/School%20Lunches/Organized_Fridge_School_Lunches_Snacks_IHeart_Organizing_02.4%20copy_zpsfafpoqoc.png\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #da602f;\">TIP #4</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />If you have the space for it, I recommend storing all lunch related containers together.

I have a few more small scale organizing projects up my sleeves that I can't wait to tackle and share.\n<br />\n<br />Today, I wanted to give you an update on our laundry room!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0xZas8EoEyo/XYporZy5KPI/AAAAAAABOxI/_UuksD6BJwsJw4ZXfAdqFyc5CRvJuZsQACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_8.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0xZas8EoEyo/XYporZy5KPI/AAAAAAABOxI/_UuksD6BJwsJw4ZXfAdqFyc5CRvJuZsQACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_8.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2017/02/laundry-room-check-in-tile-and.html\" target=\"_blank\">In my last laundry room update</a> a few years ago, I excitedly shared a peel-and-stick wallpaper that I had just installed. Shortly after that, a funny thing happened. I was so in love with it when I found it, but then I became stuck. I attempted to source finishing touches for the room and it all seemed to compete with the paper. Just because I loved the colors and design of the wallpaper, doesn't mean it was right.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-54N0RxkL0O8/XX-_ezjc0XI/AAAAAAABOsM/y3XgsFpF5WYzVX6b3RJZ7DfXdopiaIYOgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Save_Peel_Stick_Wallpaper.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"How to Save Peel and Stick Wallpaper \" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"780\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-54N0RxkL0O8/XX-_ezjc0XI/AAAAAAABOsM/y3XgsFpF5WYzVX6b3RJZ7DfXdopiaIYOgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Save_Peel_Stick_Wallpaper.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />But I waited on it. I lived with it for awhile and really tried to make it work and be sure I wasn't acting impulsively. I felt that guilt we all do when we invest in something and don't want to be wasteful. I refused to remove the paper until I could find a way to save it to reuse or pass on. Peel-and-stick paper usually comes packaged on a glossy paper backing, and after some digging, I found \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/31kUaxL\" target=\"_blank\">a wide freezer paper that is plastic coated</a>. Turns out the freezer paper is the perfect way to take down the adhesive paper from the wall, roll it up, and save it to be reused in another way. In fact, our laundry room paper has already been repurposed in my niece's bedroom lining a bookcase and we all couldn't be happier about that.\n<br />\n<br />So with that, let's look at where our laundry room is today. It has truly become a room that I look forward to going to and gives me this warm and fuzzy happy feeling.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cpPOHS_-6Us/XX-_VxJPqYI/AAAAAAABOr8/vtTW-SUHCu042b5o3BgxCQgGI-eRqj9qwCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cpPOHS_-6Us/XX-_VxJPqYI/AAAAAAABOr8/vtTW-SUHCu042b5o3BgxCQgGI-eRqj9qwCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_2.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>After some searching, I came across a Farrow and Ball Lotus wallpaper on \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ZYApyv\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a> for a \n<i>really</i> great price. Two full rolls for $100 less than the typical cost of one single roll. And being that I was only doing one wall, two rolls would be plenty. I pulled the trigger because it just felt so much more in line with my ultimate vision for the room. The last paper was colorful with an extremely busy pattern. I still wanted pattern and color but now knew that a tonal option would probably give me a similar effect without overwhelming me this time. It would still offer visual interest, but wouldn't compete with all of the other elements in the room.\n<br />\n<br />We installed the new wallpaper about five months ago now and I still get butterflies every time I walk into the room. It feels so much more refined and timeless while still offering something interesting and beautiful. \n<i>(We followed this wallpaper installation tutorial <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aU-SIDFlFGc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</i>\n<br />\n<br />After that, things very slowly started to fall into place. And although the rest of the changes we made were not big ones, they were still impactful.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ez8CPe0KqAg/XYAAzlBbbvI/AAAAAAABOvE/cfoZuiWNNFo0KK6q-BkAh5oayggZuFBrgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_9.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ez8CPe0KqAg/XYAAzlBbbvI/AAAAAAABOvE/cfoZuiWNNFo0KK6q-BkAh5oayggZuFBrgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_9.2.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />For example, I realized that the open glass doors of the paint cabinet were visually competing with the open glass cabinet doors over the sink. Having multiple door styles in the room really created a weird imbalance, especially because the space is small and windowless. I initially tried to add a frosting to the inside of the glass, which helped, but eventually just primed and painted them so that the cabinet could just sort of fade away and hide the clutter behind the doors (I wouldn't normally do something like that on a nice piece of furniture, but \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2014/10/diy-storage-cabinet.html\" target=\"_blank\">this cabinet was DIY'd by us years ago</a> and serves the purpose of storing all of our paint supplies, so it was a nice fast fix in this instance). There is a lot of white in this space which is good being that there are no windows, but I have been keeping my eyes open at thrift stores and on FB Marketplace for an interesting old cabinet to bring in another layer of character.\n<br />\n<br />When we first \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2014/02/built-in-laundry-sortingfolding-station.html\" target=\"_blank\">DIY'd our built-in wall</a>, we partnered with Home Depot to come up with some custom storage for our laundry room. We have never stopped loving the storage that the entire wall offers; we use it for cleaning supplies, beach gear, seasonal items, sewing supplies, laundry hanging, and now even for feeding our pups. We modified it a while back to \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2016/05/laundry-room-update-built-in-wshiplap.html\" target=\"_blank\">add some decorative shiplap backing</a>&nbsp;and laundry baskets, which gave it a fresher look. Five plus years in it had become clear that we could have initially used a better method for making the cabinet doors. The doors we originally constructed were quite heavy, built from MDF, hung with external hinges, and weren't perfectly square. So this summer we built all new doors!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--4kg3yARvHw/XX-_Teb4BTI/AAAAAAABOr0/d_CFF5jXyF4YQMLYgVi1YYjYjjAFUs2fQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_11.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--4kg3yARvHw/XX-_Teb4BTI/AAAAAAABOr0/d_CFF5jXyF4YQMLYgVi1YYjYjjAFUs2fQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_11.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<br />The new doors are infinitely better. They cleaned up the look of our built-in and the panels are now truly inset (I plan to share how we built&nbsp;them soon). We also installed concealed hinges which makes such a wonderful difference. At that same time, the entire unit received a fresh coat of paint, trim, caulk, a new acrylic hanging rod, and a built-in feeding station. Yes, yes, and yes!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmXyQoQPu5M/XX-_UDqinUI/AAAAAAABOr0/H3gM0GXeS-kSbH54eBVeuFBrEJ2TjqLtQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_15.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmXyQoQPu5M/XX-_UDqinUI/AAAAAAABOr0/H3gM0GXeS-kSbH54eBVeuFBrEJ2TjqLtQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Laundry_Room_Wallpaper_Update_15.png\" style=\"height: auto; max-height: 80%; max-width: 80%; width: auto;\" title=\"IHeart Organizing Laundry Room Storage Organization Wallpaper \" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Isn't that hanging rod lovely?

I found \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/301unhy\" target=\"_blank\">an inexpensive piece of acrylic on Amazon</a>, as well as \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZZLdxf\" target=\"_blank\">the mounting hardware</a>.

Kit!","link":"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/04/gearing-up-for-your-next-organizing.html","description":"Hello, hello! I am excited to be dropping in with a small series I have been putting together for you all, which includes my all-time favorite organizing tips, tricks, advice, and products! It's been a long time coming to take everything I have learned over the years, whether it is working in my own home or working with others, and compiling it all in a single place here on the web.\n<br />\n<br />The four-part&nbsp;series will include:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Gearing Up for Your Next Organizing Project with a FREE Printable Kit!</b>\n<br />\n<br />Need helping getting started or prioritizing where to begin? What is the plan of attack? What is currently working well and what isn't? What storage do you need? Trying to get rid of things, but finding it hard to decide what to keep and what to pass on?\n<br />\n<br />I have put together a great printable kit to help you prioritize, sort, and navigate your way through your next organizing project(s), which includes a total of TEN free printables!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>My Top Organizing Tips!</b>\n<br />\n<br />Instead of digging through years of my archives to find individual tips, I am going to compile the best of the best in a single, very informational post! It's going to be a whopper and a really great resource for projects of any size.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Labeling 101: Quick &amp; Easy Labeling Techniques</b>\n<br />\n<br />I have tried almost every type of label on the market, from vinyl to label makers to stickers and chalk markers, and they all have their place. But what are my tried and true favorites? What do I reach for with almost any project due to time, cost, practicality, and ease? I will be sharing three labeling techniques that haven't failed me yet, and that you won't need any fancy tools to utilize.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Practical, Everyday Storage Solutions!</b>\n<br />\n<br />If I have learned anything from raising three boys and organizing along the way, it is that storage can be expensive and that our needs are constantly evolving. Gone are the days where I purchase pretty bins and baskets to decorate with. Although I will always appreciate beautiful storage,&nbsp;it has to be versatile \n<i>and</i> it has to last! With that in mind, there are a few storage products that I have found that continuously work hard for me in a variety of situations, so they end up being the types of products I gravitate toward when working on any new projects. For the final post in the series, I am putting together the ultimate storage source list with tips and products that I have fallen in love with over the years.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />So let's dive in with the first of the four-part&nbsp;series: \n<i>Gearing Up for Your Next Organizing Project with a Free Printable Kit!</i>\n<br />\n<i><br /></i> \n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mXNTaFXZmFQ/XKOcgpuH_TI/AAAAAAABN44/QLkPfQX9hqkG_4euoEfhrxxwvRbvakCHACLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Sorting_Boxes_Printable_Signs.Header.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mXNTaFXZmFQ/XKOcgpuH_TI/AAAAAAABN44/QLkPfQX9hqkG_4euoEfhrxxwvRbvakCHACLcBGAs/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Sorting_Boxes_Printable_Signs.Header.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />Today I have for&nbsp;you all \n<b>TEN</b> free printables!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Now, you don't have to use all of these printables for a single organizing project.

It is extremely important to factor in what those specific tasks are costing you in terms of time, money, and sanity.</i>\n<br />\n<i><br /></i> \n<i>For example, if you are finding that you are unhappy with the process of lunch making for yourself or your kids each day, you can probably equate it to costing you money in wasted food or eating&nbsp;lunches out, and costing you time in the act of preparing the lunches each day. The solution may be creating a list of favorite lunch items, setting up a lunch making station in the pantry and fridge, and spending time making lunches in bulk on a Sunday afternoon.</i>\n<br />\n<i><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />Prioritize your projects by the highest cost to the least (cost equating to time, money, and sanity).

I sincerely appreciate all of your encouraging comments on \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/01/catching-up-and-hello-to-2019.html\" target=\"_blank\">my last post</a>, as well as the abundance of emails and messages I received. This community really amazes me, and I adore that we all bond over a passion for our homes and organization! It sounds like many of you are on a quest to simplify and reduce home clutter with me this year, which keeps me awake at night with excitement! Let's do this 2019!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_HEADER_zpsumzvw5k9.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"484\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_HEADER_zpsumzvw5k9.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I have always been a bit of a sentimentalist, and I really love giving gifts to friends and family throughout the year. Just as much as I find joy in the process of looking for something thoughtful to give, I also really enjoy the process of wrapping it all up! I have absolutely nothing against a gift box or bag, but sometimes it just feels a little more special to add a ribbon, embellishment, a handwritten note, an ornament, monogrammed&nbsp;tag, etc... And those extra touches don't have to take much time, but they really go along way.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Five years ago I put together \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2013/12/diy-gift-wrap-organization-station.html\" target=\"_blank\">the ultimate gift wrapping station</a>. It had extra of everything from twine, bows, bags, boxes, tissue and quite a few rolls of gift wrap. It was epic and went viral and I don't regret the project for a second. It served me quite well over the years, and it has taken me a long time to work my way through a lot of the supplies and cards. But it was a bit much. And over the years as the nearby counter became cluttered with toys and Lego builds, I would gather my supplies and take them to my office or the kitchen table to do my wrapping. In my quest to reduce and simplify this year, I decided that it was time to downsize this part of my life in a way that takes up less space and offers some portability.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_04.2_zpspbcxk4jn.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"444\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_04.2_zpspbcxk4jn.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I actually put all of this together last month before Christmas, and it couldn't have worked out better. And because I can still use it year-round for anniversaries, birthdays, and \n<i>just-because</i> days, I decided I would share the&nbsp;tote-tastic&nbsp;idea with you!\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/IKEA_KUGGIS_zps5sdvtvrg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/IKEA_KUGGIS_zps5sdvtvrg.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I began with \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10280203/\" target=\"_blank\">the large KUGGIS&nbsp;bin</a> found at IKEA. I have used smaller versions of these bins and I absolutely LOVE them. They really have become one of my \"go-to\" storage items as of late. However, this is my first time using this particular size, and I was ridiculously eager to try out the addition of \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00280208/\" target=\"_blank\">the divided organizing tray</a> that tucks away nicely inside.\n<br />\n<br />The top tray is really great for smaller embellishments and cards. It can also fit a smaller address book (if you are old-school like me and still use one of those during the holidays).\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_16.2_zps9rnu9ymk.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"533\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_16.2_zps9rnu9ymk.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />If I am at a stationery store and spot a nice greeting card, I pick them up so I can be prepared ahead of time for special dates or for those celebrations that come up last minute. The larger areas of the tray are a really wonderful size to fit all of those greeting cards, thank you notes and envelopes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_16.3_zpsk5d6n8zq.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_16.3_zpsk5d6n8zq.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I also like to add tags, ornaments, bows, etc... and the smaller divided areas are a nice way to divide out the tapes, twine, and gift toppers. I also keep a few gift cards on hand to hand out randomly when the mood strikes (I just put a small amount on each and will give them to strangers or kind employees&nbsp;as a random act of kindness).\n<br />\n<br />There is more magic happening below the tray, which is completely removable.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_20_zps2u8bb06i.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_20_zps2u8bb06i.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />The nice thing about this bin is the amount of space/storage to keep everything all together. The base of the bin is a nice size for gift bags, boxes and larger sheets of tissue. I found some food storage containers at the dollar store to add a little extra division for the bows, tissue and smaller ribbon spools. They are light-weight and inexpensive and couldn't have worked out better.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_08_zpszbve5vvl.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_08_zpszbve5vvl.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I used&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2TTJSR8\" target=\"_blank\">a small tension rod</a>&nbsp;for my larger spools of ribbon, placed at the outer edge of the bin. It is easy to be removed if I need to swap out a roll but stays in place for grabbing a quick bit to add to a package.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_21.2_zpsgt4rqzuu.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"533\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Gifting%20Caddy/Organized_Gift_Wrap_Storage_Bin_Kit_IHeart_Organizing_21.2_zpsgt4rqzuu.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<i>I use a small piece of masking/painters tape on each spool to keep the ribbon from loosening inside of the bin in-between uses.</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8cGqaoamVow/XD4N67fN2VI/AAAAAAABNkA/_RSXfrTm3fkQcqwxE0prUW1lf8qdPzQfACEwYBhgL/s1600/Webp.net-gifmaker%2B%25283%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"393\" data-original-width=\"590\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8cGqaoamVow/XD4N67fN2VI/AAAAAAABNkA/_RSXfrTm3fkQcqwxE0prUW1lf8qdPzQfACEwYBhgL/s1600/Webp.net-gifmaker%2B%25283%2529.gif\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Above you can see the entire bin in action and how everything stacks in a compact and portable tote.\n<br />\n<br />I have also really condensed my gift wrap rolls down; I find it best to actually only purchase solid craft, black or a simple stripe/dot gift wrap that can be versatile year round. That allows the ribbon and toppers to shine and also keeps the number of rolls that I have to store to a minimum. I currently just keep them in a corner of my office closet until I can finish up with a little refresh of that space in the near future.\n<br />\n<br />I also looked into an under-bed bin that would allow me to store the rolls and cards/embellishments together, however, our bed frame doesn't allow for most of those bin sizes. But they are another great option for doing something similar. Here are a couple of those options:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>\n <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3442477\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

For someone who is generally an energetic go-getter, learning to navigate the past few years has been a true personal challenge and journey. And having to do it online has been flat out tough, especially when I am trying to walk the line of personal and professional in front of an audience. If I have learned anything, it's that no matter how much you plan, life can change those plans in an instant. And as a self-proclaimed planning obsessed girl, that has been a hard pill to swallow.\n<br />\n<br />I am not 100% ready to dive into my absence, although I hope to someday down the road. Just know that your support is deeply cherished and I appreciate those of you who continue to check-in. The outpouring&nbsp;of love, comments, emails, DM's, etc, has been so overwhelming over the past couple of months, and for that, I am eternally grateful. They continue to uplift and encourage and I truly hope that THIS IS THE YEAR that I can give that back to you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <span style=\"color: #999999;\">____________________</span>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I have a few things to cover since I have been away, so let's begin with Christmas decor storage.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_10.2_zpsedrtm1d0.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_10.2_zpsedrtm1d0.png\" data-original-height=\"428\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I have never been a minimalist by any means and I truly enjoy layering our home with our character and personality. At the same time, I am making 2019 the year to reduce and&nbsp;streamline. This last Christmas I only put up a fraction of our decor, and I noticed that our time entertaining and enjoying the holidays wasn't at all negatively impacted. I also appreciated that it took much less time to pack everything up this past weekend! Keeping it understated was refreshing and allowed me to focus on what really mattered most to me, and it was also the most relaxed I have been during the holiday season in years. I definitely need to continue to remember this and apply that understanding to more areas of my life this coming year!\n<br />\n<br />I know some of you probably had your decor packed up December 26th, but for those of you who extend the season and enjoy the layers a little longer, I thought I would share my top Christmas decor storage tips (\n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2016/01/holiday-decor-storage-organization-tips.html\" target=\"_blank\">a refresh of this post here</a>). And if you already have everything packed away, tuck these tips in your pocket for next year (or give your bins a quick remix when the mood strikes).\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <span style=\"color: #999999;\"><b>CLEAR STORAGE BINS</b></span>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <br />\n</div>For so many years I selected solid bins because I didn't like the visual clutter that generally comes with the clear versions. A few years ago I decided to give clear bins a whirl (I love \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2TBClGn\" target=\"_blank\">these</a>) and it really has been so helpful! I appreciate that I can get a quick idea of the contents without having to do any rummaging or digging.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <span style=\"color: #999999;\"><b>LABEL</b></span>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Free_Label_Printable_zps4ye5guqg.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Free_Label_Printable_zps4ye5guqg.png\" data-original-height=\"549\" data-original-width=\"590\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Even though the bins are clear, and some of the contents are simple and obvious, other bins still have a mixture of items such as ornaments, embellishments for different trees, stockings, garland varieties, books, wreaths, ribbon, tree skirts, lights, etc... Therefore, labels can help to differentiate categories and assign items/bins to specific areas of the house. This year I updated my labels to an editable version, that way I can just type the contents, print them out and slide them into the label sleeve attached to the front of the bins. I saved my labels to my&nbsp;computer to easily edit and reprint down the road if needed. \n<i>You can download the editable label printable for free <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/duxxowl1c6ucmdo0uvf1gnibw642ryso\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</i>\n<br />\n<i><br /></i>\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <b><span style=\"color: #999999;\">CATEGORIZE</span></b>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_12_zpsxefivmym.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_12_zpsxefivmym.png\" data-original-height=\"885\" data-original-width=\"590\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Make the most of your bins and divide them out in a way that makes the most sense for how you decorate. Zippered storage bags work really well to corral and categorize smaller items like ornament hooks, ribbon, beads, special ornaments, replacement bulbs, light clips, stocking and wreath hooks, etc...\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <b><span style=\"color: #999999;\">THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX</span></b>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n <br />\n</div>Are there other items that you only use during the holidays? Specific items for entertaining or baking or cooking? Maybe you use certain pillows, candles, appliances and serving platters for a month or two out of the entire year. If your&nbsp;storage is limited around the house, don't give those seasonal items prime real estate with your day-to-day belongings. Instead, pack those pieces away with the remainder of your Christmas decor.\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #999999;\">TIS' THE SEASON TO CLEANSE</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />This is the best time of the year to streamline your Christmas inventory. While packing everything up, take the time to recategorize your bins and eliminate the items that didn't make the cut this past year. Handle each object and ask yourself if it is worth your time, space and energy moving forward. Also discard any items that are broken, torn or worn.\n<br />\n<br />Donation Ideas:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Drop off your gently used holiday decor at your local donation center (Salvation Army, Locally Owned Thrift Stores, Goodwill, etc...)</li>\n <li>Check with your local Habitat Restore, some do holiday-specific sales throughout the year.</li>\n <li>Inquire with local shelters to see if and when they typically accept holiday decor, and what specific items are most beneficial.</li>\n <li>Does your city decorate for the holidays? Think of areas around town that put up Christmas trees or string lights that may benefit from the items you no longer have a use for. Libraries, hospitals, community centers, etc...</li>\n <li>Have you heard of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.givebackbox.com/index\" target=\"_blank\">Give&nbsp;Back Box</a>? I recently read about this donation program and I love it! It really emphasizes the one-in-one-out rule, but can be used beyond that method! When you receive merchandise in the mail from select retailers, you can reuse that box along with a free shipping label to donate your household goods and clothing items. Give Back Box selects a charity based on your location, however, there are ways to select your own if you wish. Christmas decor is accepted, so pack up a box and ship it on out!</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <span style=\"color: #999999;\">____________________</span>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_02_zpsszkyzwkx.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_02_zpsszkyzwkx.png\" data-original-height=\"885\" data-original-width=\"590\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n Remember last year \n <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/01/how-to-flock-tree-or-anything-really.html\" target=\"_blank\">I flocked our artificial tree</a>? I promised to give you an update on how it held up through storage and I am happy to share it did really well. I have noticed that flocked trees will shed no matter if you DIY or purchase them that way, and ours did drop some flocking during setup and decorating. However, not enough to notice on the tree itself, and minimally throughout the time that it was up. I am excited to try the flocking process again down the road on some garland and outdoor topiaries, and I love that I can always easily add more to the tree over the years as necessary with the remaining flocking powder.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <span style=\"color: #999999;\">____________________</span>\n </div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />If you are looking for a couple of idea-inducing reads for the New Year, I contributed to two publications on newsstands now:\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Parents_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpshq645hpm.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Parents_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpshq645hpm.png\" data-original-height=\"574\" data-original-width=\"590\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Inside this month's issue of Parent's Magazine, we focussed on \n<i>Little Ways to Love Your Home</i>.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Family_Circle_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpsqpoji5ao.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Family_Circle_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpsqpoji5ao.png\" data-original-height=\"574\" data-original-width=\"590\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />While inside the Family Circle issue you will find a great section dedicated to making the most of your home's hot spot: The Kitchen!

The pages are fresh and beautiful and seeing them being used by you all throughout the year is a true treat, so thank you for Instagramming and sharing those images with me.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <span style=\"color: #999999;\">____________________</span>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />This time of the year is generally known for starting fresh and setting goals and organizing every nook and cranny of your home. I have had a few conversations with friends and they have mentioned that the new year gets so built up that they feel like once the clock hits midnight, they should have this automatic boost of energy, and that when they wake up they should feel some sort of magical feeling and clear vision for what is to come to finally get their lives together. So. Much. Pressure.\n<br />\n<br />While I personally do love that the new year is a great benchmark for setting goals and reflecting and evoking change, I want to remind you all (and myself), that lifestyle changes are gradual and don't happen overnight, and \n<b>all big things come from a culmination of smaller steps</b>. It's great to set goals and be fired up, but also be realistic and break those goals up throughout the year. Think of little changes that you can make each day that will help you reach a larger goal by next month, next quarter, or even by the end of 2019. That is how I am personally approaching this year; day by day, bit by bit. It doesn't all have to be done by the end of January.\n<br />\n<br />I am still wearing a lot of hats, and aside from trying to be an involved and loving wife and mom, I have a lot of business-centric goals that include updating and organizing my website (and a new home tour!), moving my online shop and adding fresh new items, working with clients (best feeling), and writing a book (big goal). Pair that with the administrative responsibilities of running a business, freelance writing, creating content and sharing it actively on social media, I get a little overwhelmed managing it all and managing it well. When I work on a project, I get so hyperfocused on that one specific thing, that it can take away from all the rest. Sometimes the blog takes a hit, sometimes my personal goals take a hit, sometimes my family takes a hit, sometimes my shop takes a hit. I can organize a closet no problem, but maybe I need to find someone to organize my life (ha!). Time management, prioritization, and balance are all my personal top priorities for 2019. Some things will have to move to the bottom of the list so I can actually do the more important things. And this is that moment where it all rounds right back to my small steps towards the big goal mantra.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_04.2_zpsvhl0rlg0.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_04.2_zpsvhl0rlg0.png\" data-original-height=\"500\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I don't want to drag this post out any longer, but a few final notes about our year to come:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>Last year we didn't focus a lot of attention on our own home or projects. I am approaching my 10th year of blogging and that is a LOT of organizing, crafting and remodeling. We simply needed a break, even if we still have a lot of wish list updates to make, going at it around the clock is exhausting, expensive and disruptive. It was time to let things rest, and we did. Buuuut, our oldest is graduating high school this year!!!!!! He is receiving college acceptance letters and about to spread his wings and I am holding back tears of joy (and let's be real, tears of selfish sadness) on the daily. With graduation comes a graduation party and a big party is a great motivator to check lingering home tasks off of the list, as well as a lot of deep cleaning. Time to relight that fire!</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<ul>\n <li>How do you all feel about doing a home cleanse with me this year? I really wanted to do this last year, so the past few months I began researching and building a really great resource of ways to clear clutter from your homes. It always pains me a bit to see how piles of trash bags can so quickly be associated with organizing, so I am diving deep into options for feeling less guilty about getting rid of our belongings. And I would really love for it to become a library that can be referenced and built-upon over time. You in?</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<ul>\n <li>I don't have a lot of closets or drawers left to organize around here, this year my biggest pain points are PAPER (I have a plan!) and photographs (I don't have a plan!). <b>What are your biggest organizational pain points?</b> Knowing your problem areas could really help me come up with new content, so if you could take a quick second to leave a comment on this post with your organizing goals and struggles, I would appreciate it to the moon and back!</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />Let's raise a glass of wine, a coffee filled mug, or a bottle of water, and cheers to 2019!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>P.S. I just went back a re-read <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/01/a-warm-welcome-to-2018.html\" target=\"_blank\">my intro to 2018 post</a>. Wow. Sounds like I am rewriting history and even mimicking a few of the same sentences word for word, nodding and still feeling a lot of the things that I felt last year. Believe me when I say that as frustrating as that is for me, I know it is also frustrating for you. Please know that I never take you all for granted and I really hope to break the cycle. There are definitely some things I need to change, and I appreciate your continuous grace as I work on bettering things around here.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">♥</span></i>\n<br />\n<br />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 01:20:00 +0000","feedId":5474,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KYIEATX3tUY/XD-VewsZHJI/AAAAAAABNks/MfhG_DoU4D01BuanU_B0onV-s6yn1HvlACLcBGAs/s1600/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_03.png","linkMd5":"34a051bf804696ef0cc66a46968251cd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-30-28-909_049a6b1c29b6557e.webp","destWidth":590,"destHeight":885,"sourceBytes":691066,"destBytes":48750,"author":"IHeart Organizing","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KYIEATX3tUY/XD-VewsZHJI/AAAAAAABNks/MfhG_DoU4D01BuanU_B0onV-s6yn1HvlACLcBGAs/s1600/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_03.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-30-28-909_049a6b1c29b6557e.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_10.2_zpsedrtm1d0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-30-41-405_d233672482d18f7c.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Free_Label_Printable_zps4ye5guqg.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn2@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-30-50-747_4b73fa61ca03fed9.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/IHeart_Organizing_Holiday_Decor_Storage_2019_12_zpsxefivmym.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn49@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-30-49-165_acdbc48d1cee1f18.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_02_zpsszkyzwkx.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn86@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-30-31-883_d6c4d254a1f95633.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Parents_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpshq645hpm.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-30-32-157_3472f22957d15f65.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Family_Circle_Magazine_IHeart_Organizing_Feature_Jan_2019_zpsqpoji5ao.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-30-31-558_c3ad6b11f7ee40ec.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Sidebar_iHeart_Organizing_2019_Planner.600px_zps69xlgxhy.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-30-41-489_00edd96ae43723c7.webp","http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Welcome%202019/Christmas_LivingRoom_2018_04.2_zpsvhl0rlg0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn74@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-30-42-789_f86ffd96dc83ac26.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598308228321},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:30:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:30:28","title":"Quick & Easy Tips to Organize Your Refrigerator!","link":"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/06/quick-easy-tips-to-organize-your.html","description":"The refrigerator is meant to keep things cold, but it is one of the \"hottest\" spots in the home!

Knowing that, I always recommend that folks invest a small amount of time creating a few easy systems that aid in streamlining the meal planning and food preparing process.

Just like us, this family has three growing boys in a variety of activities, and needed a larger fridge and some organizational tips to simplify their food storage just in time for the hectic summer months.\n<br />\n<br />Now, we have all seen those organized fridges that go viral because they are perfectly&nbsp;styled with rows of bins filled with flowers, colorful fruits and pretty cans of fizzy water. I could look at pictures of fridges like that all day long, and I \n<i>always</i> appreciate a good bin, but I do have to wonder, where is all of the \n<i>food</i>? The meals for a large family, the leftovers, the snacks, the breakfasts and lunches that last for the entire week? I really wanted to offer up some of my favorite usable and practical tips to help this family, and you, take control of the fridge.\n<br />\n<br />When I arrived at the family's home, I was welcomed with a new, large capacity fridge and a week's worth of groceries straight from the grocery store.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_22_zpsg3ztax1u.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_22_zpsg3ztax1u.jpg\" data-original-height=\"833\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I showed up with a few of my tried and true organizers and got right to work assessing what a typical week's worth of groceries looks like for this family, and how I can best set up their fridge to accommodate&nbsp;both the food and their lifestyle. My number one goal was to put a fridge together that is easy to maintain, offers future versatility, and remains functional week after week.\n<br />\n<br />The fantastic team at GE Appliances was there to see how it all went down, and they put together a quick video of my ten go-to, no fail refrigerator organizing tips. Check it out below!\n<br />\n<br />\n<center> \n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"335\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/275954626\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"595\"></iframe>\n <br />\n</center>\n<br />\n<br />Here is a quick recap of the video's talking points:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BHpk59wJDx0/WynWASXUPHI/AAAAAAABMyI/fK5GBVF_DBMUnrm3SvPmtbHBd8eUXBZyQCLcBGAs/s1600/01_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BHpk59wJDx0/WynWASXUPHI/AAAAAAABMyI/fK5GBVF_DBMUnrm3SvPmtbHBd8eUXBZyQCLcBGAs/s1600/01_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Although I generally encourage folks to empty a space first, when it comes to the fridge, I actually recommend the opposite. Fill your fridge just as you would on a typical week, or maybe even shop and plan for those times when you have more food than usual (think extra kids visiting or a party or eating home every night of the week, etc...). This is really helpful in setting up your fridge to work for you week after week and to consistently accommodate&nbsp;your routine and lifestyle. This is also the best way to plan for any organizational bins and storage you may wish to add.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YSKytVAm6I8/WynWAUSHmQI/AAAAAAABMyE/i0F2pTOR1R0VcQcSMiqcE3it3u9R8SuDgCLcBGAs/s1600/02_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YSKytVAm6I8/WynWAUSHmQI/AAAAAAABMyE/i0F2pTOR1R0VcQcSMiqcE3it3u9R8SuDgCLcBGAs/s1600/02_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Whether you are organizing an entire room, a cabinet, or the fridge, I \n<i>always</i> recommend keeping like items with like, and sorting things into general categories. By placing items back in specific locations, you create a bit of muscle memory and can quickly find things time after time. Keeping the fridge categorized is also quite helpful before heading to the grocery store. Just open the fridge and do a quick visual scan to see what foods and condiments need replenishing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_01_zpstzbhnhcm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_01_zpstzbhnhcm.jpg\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />In this specific fridge, I did condiments in the door (even divided out spreads, juices/beverages, toppings &amp; dressings, and garnishes), salsas and sauces on the top shelf, kits on the next couple of shelves, main dishes and leftovers alongside milk &amp; eggs in the large middle area, followed by veggies, fruits and deli items in the drawers below.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YlvGO5SczDE/WynWAQQmUGI/AAAAAAABMyM/__v-6Tt6o68aBbO3aeLJXmsLUVOrLRq9wCLcBGAs/s1600/03_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YlvGO5SczDE/WynWAQQmUGI/AAAAAAABMyM/__v-6Tt6o68aBbO3aeLJXmsLUVOrLRq9wCLcBGAs/s1600/03_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />These days refrigerators help you easily store the majority of your items in specific temperature controlled areas. That said, it is good to know the ideals temps and locations for storing your food, to be sure to get the most out of that food. Take advantage of the specific drawers for keeping your veggies crispier, your fruits fresher and your deli meats and cheeses ready for lunch making.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_07_zpsnzxvmqx3.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_07_zpsnzxvmqx3.jpg\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Beyond that, I have read a few different articles that also recommend keeping your milk, dairy, and meats at the center of the fridge where it is coldest. The door is not recommended for eggs or milk because that is generally the warmest location and can cause early spoiling, but this location works great for juices and dressings. Also, there are a lot of fruits and veggies that actually do better stored outside of the fridge, and knowing which ones with help to free up even more space for the items intended to stay nice and cold inside.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Qo3NMC0FB0/WynWA0E47VI/AAAAAAABMyQ/7nXP_eE8Neok6n9N9sTvrZPKmwLLMFHwgCLcBGAs/s1600/04_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Qo3NMC0FB0/WynWA0E47VI/AAAAAAABMyQ/7nXP_eE8Neok6n9N9sTvrZPKmwLLMFHwgCLcBGAs/s1600/04_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I have been a long time kit maker and kit cheerleader!

It can also be a place to store some berries, spreads, toppings, etc... whatever you relate to breakfast specific meals. Kits 2 - 4 were snack kits; one filled with finger veggies portioned into snack bags (snap peas, carrots, sliced peppers, celery, etc...), one filled with finger fruits portioned into snack bags (berries, melon, orange slices, etc...), and the last with some grab-no-go snack cups. Finally, a tray to hold deli meats and cheeses that can quickly transfer to the counter for sandwich making (I also like to add some other sandwich toppings to the tray such as sliced tomato, onion, and avocado).\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_18_zps8vlkdeb6.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_18_zps8vlkdeb6.jpg\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Investing a few minutes after grocery shopping to put together these really quick solutions saves so much time for the entire crew over the course of a week.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IfJLd8z6gGE/WynWBFEF6MI/AAAAAAABMyU/YsKHgjG-w-IVJRBQlWVNLS-VIaNdDwDlgCLcBGAs/s1600/05_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IfJLd8z6gGE/WynWBFEF6MI/AAAAAAABMyU/YsKHgjG-w-IVJRBQlWVNLS-VIaNdDwDlgCLcBGAs/s1600/05_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />You may have noticed, but the majority of the bins used throughout the fridge are clear! That's because clear storage gives you that quick visual and reduces time spent looking through and for things.

Extra long bins help to bring those foods to the front in one quick motion. I also recommend selecting bins that have handles or are lightweight for portability.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qrApVAt4c40/WynWCex_w0I/AAAAAAABMyc/EjOFNPrFnBw_vnQV-KvsyHxLmPOc2GInwCLcBGAs/s1600/07_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"35\" data-original-width=\"550\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qrApVAt4c40/WynWCex_w0I/AAAAAAABMyc/EjOFNPrFnBw_vnQV-KvsyHxLmPOc2GInwCLcBGAs/s1600/07_Fridge_Organizing_Tip.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Why label? Because it keeps everyone on the same page and allows the entire family to quickly identify and locate where things are. Even if you put a variety of breakfast items into a clear bin, your little one may not know what everything in that particular bin has in common without the help of a simple label. Labeling also helps everyone put things back in the right \"zones\" and to keep general order.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_14_zpsumrwaoq2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/GE%20Fridge%20Organization/Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_14_zpsumrwaoq2.jpg\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />As much as I love a good label, try not to over-label.

I was so thrilled that GE Appliances asked me to help this family setup&nbsp;and organize their new fridge. As you may have noticed, \n<a href=\"http://products.geappliances.com/appliance/gea-specs/GFE26JSMSS\" target=\"_blank\">this specific fridge</a> had more space than I was even able to fill, which was a first for me with the many different refrigerators I have organized over the years (this particular model has almost an entire cubic foot more space than most refrigerators in this class). I am obsessed with how many main dishes, leftovers, and sides were stored throughout, and the flexibility there is for adding additional items for cookouts, birthday parties, entertaining, etc... But what tickled me most about this whole experience was watching the homeowner open her fridge and point out all of the details, and getting excited about the solutions I whipped up for their clan. There was a bit of relief, and she also expressed how easy it was to find things and transfer items to the nearby counters. That is the best feeling ever.\n<br />\n<br />There are a few products that continue to be superstar workhorses for me each and every time I organize a fridge, and I have sourced them for you below.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mlDBVcSXk3s/WyqSq_SXvGI/AAAAAAABM1g/titwzQEk7XwvJ9Yskkgd4Z2irwz0U-QSgCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"28\" data-original-width=\"500\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mlDBVcSXk3s/WyqSq_SXvGI/AAAAAAABM1g/titwzQEk7XwvJ9Yskkgd4Z2irwz0U-QSgCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<center> \n <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3177980\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Get a Grip on your Drawer Dividers","link":"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/05/quick-tip-get-grip-on-your-drawer.html","description":"Drawer dividers are generally intended to provide some order and calmness. They prevent our belongings from becoming jumbled messes&nbsp;and are also ideal for creating organized categories. I have always been a huge proponent of dividers because they have made our lives easier and better in every room in our home.\n<br />\n<br />However, finding dividers that fit inside of drawers just right is a rarity. No matter how much you search and create grids and measure and plan, there will always be that last sliver of space. Or what about those times when you only want to divide a portion of the drawer? And because those drawer dividers are not always perfectly fit, they end up sliding from side to side and front to back. #thehorror\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gF5WQYupmW8/WvxvGr95V1I/AAAAAAABMWk/JfxZXM2MbLgMYc9mybZA1kXoiOYHZUrGgCLcBGAs/s1600/Quick_Tip_Sticky_Drawer_Dividers_IHeart_Organizing_Header.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"615\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gF5WQYupmW8/WvxvGr95V1I/AAAAAAABMWk/JfxZXM2MbLgMYc9mybZA1kXoiOYHZUrGgCLcBGAs/s1600/Quick_Tip_Sticky_Drawer_Dividers_IHeart_Organizing_Header.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />I have worked with a few folks lately that have had that very problem and asked how to prevent the obnoxious shifting of everything each time a drawer is opened and closed.

The grippy shelf liner not only holds the dividers in place but also the objects sitting on top. And the interlocking lined dividers will be good for the more heavy duty items, while everyday dividers will work for smaller pieces and still stay in place with the help of the liner.\n<br />\n<br />Again, this option allows for the dividers to be split and only be used in certain areas of the drawer, which also means that I am able to better maximize how each drawer is divided and categorized. Hooray for added flexibility!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #999999;\">BONUS TIP:</span></b> \n<i>Grip liner can be found just about everywhere in a variety of colors and price points, and can easily be cut down to size. If you only want to add some smaller pieces of the liner below the drawer dividers to stretch your investment, that works too! Also, get creative with what you use, rug pads and silicone caulk can serve the same purpose!</i>\n<br />\n<i><br /></i> \n<br />I always try out my tips before sharing them and recommending them, but you can't 100% tell from the photos just how well these methods work, so I compiled a couple of quick boomerangs I took with my phone to drive the point home.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"329\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/270152306\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"585\"></iframe>\n <br />\n <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/270152306\">No-Slip Drawer Dividers</a> from \n <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user3387775\">Jen Jones</a> on \n <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.\n <br />\n</center>\n<br />\n<br />And because I am often asked about where to purchase the items found in this post, or my favorite dividers in general, I have rounded up everything for you below.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZNbujvd--6c/Wv2l0_a1vtI/AAAAAAABMY0/FPu7njayDtgAXbZ7wt2wcywgG-Ju12IEACLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"28\" data-original-width=\"500\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZNbujvd--6c/Wv2l0_a1vtI/AAAAAAABMY0/FPu7njayDtgAXbZ7wt2wcywgG-Ju12IEACLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<center>\n <div class=\"boutique-widget\" data-widget-id=\"715347\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

With that in mind, there are a few storage products that I have found that continuously work hard for me in a variety of situations, so they end up being the types of products I gravitate toward when working on any new projects.

Labels can really add to the overall aesthetic of a project while being extremely useful at the same time!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />There are times that I may decide to invest more time and energy into the creative process of an organizing project, but for the majority of my projects I have \n<b>THREE</b> tried and true labeling techniques.\n<br />\n<br />However, before I dive in and talk about those methods, let's quickly go over the reasons behind WHY we label in the first place.\n<br />\n<i><br /></i> \n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/02_Organized_Kitchen_Cabinet_Baking_Canisters_Labeled_zpsy2l49p2l.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/02_Organized_Kitchen_Cabinet_Baking_Canisters_Labeled_zpsy2l49p2l.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<i><br /></i>\n<br />\n<br />Labeling is definitely a personal preference that doesn't have a one-size-fits-all rule.\n<br />\n<div>\n <br />The overall purpose of labeling is to \n <b>create easy identification</b>. \n <i>Generally speaking, it is best to label for safety purposes or to keep your household on the same page:</i>\n <br />\n <br />\n <ul>\n  <li>Label food containers to indicate a specific ingredient (or lack of ingredient) due to allergies and sensitivities.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label food containers/leftovers with dates to prevent serving expired and spoiled consumables.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to indicate if an item is fragile or hazardous.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to identify the contents of a solid container or bin.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to differentiate multiple items that appear similar.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to help children identify where to find things/put things away (toys, snacks, clothing, etc...).&nbsp;</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to identify the possession of items between household members.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Label to create consistency or understanding between household members.</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br />\n </div>\n <div>\n  Again, it really comes down to how your household functions and the dynamic of everyone who resides there. Labels can be extremely helpful but are not always necessary.\n  <br />\n  <br />I use to label clear pantry containers and fridge containers with the contents, only to change the contents each week with my grocery shopping. Changing the labels became too much maintenance and we really weren't gaining much by labeling the obvious clear bin of crackers, as \"crackers\". So I stopped. Now, I quickly add the purchase date on the bottom of the container with a dry erase marker and call it good (unless it is allergy specific of course). If a label is causing extra work, then is it really adding value?\n  <br />\n  <br />That said, we have benefitted greatly by labeling over the years. Having a household of five, labels have really made it easy for all of us to collectively pick-up and get things back to their proper homes, and also identify our personal belongings to avoid mix-ups. And by labeling cleaners, drawers, bin contents, etc..., I avoid a lot of questions from my crew.\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <br />OK, so now you are ready to start labeling, but what are the best methods? Here are three that haven't failed me yet!\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">LABEL MAKER</span></b>\n  <br />\n  <br />This one is obvious but also the most important. I used \n  <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2013/07/labeling-101-label-maker.html\" target=\"_blank\">this label maker</a> for many, many years, but after a few drops, it broke and I was left scrambling to replace it. It doesn't seem to be available any longer (because the prices on it have since skyrocketed), so I shed some tears and set out to find something similar. I am not too picky, I just wanted something that was inexpensive, had a couple font options, offered clear labeling tape, and also offered inexpensive replacement cartridges. I also appreciate something battery operated/portable so that I can use it quickly and easily without any additional accessories.\n  <br />\n  <br />I decided on \n  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GGXtHM\" target=\"_blank\">this Brother P-Touch option</a>, I found it for under $20 and the value is definitely there! I have been liking it so far, it checked all of my boxes and I really appreciate that it is an extremely flexible and affordable option. I was also able to find some off-brand tape options on Amazon, and they have also worked out really great! (I purchased \n  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DAOsOl\" target=\"_blank\">these white on clear</a> and \n  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Dza4um\" target=\"_blank\">these black on clear</a> cartridges). I find this label maker to be really user-friendly, the font options are OK, it prints quick, and the labels stick well yet are also removable. All around a good, go-to option.\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/03_IHeart_Organizing_Label_Maker_Review_Brother_PTouch.3_zpsocrw3qdl.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/03_IHeart_Organizing_Label_Maker_Review_Brother_PTouch.3_zpsocrw3qdl.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  <br />Label makers are the clear choice for almost any organizing project because they are quick to use, easy to create, and can adhere to just about anything.

I typically use them on bins and boxes that either have a rougher surface or in situations that label tape would get lost due to the shape and size of the container (because you can print your own labels, you can design the color/font to be sure they really stand out). These work well on the infamous Target Y-Weave baskets, common rattan baskets, as well as on canvas style bins. If you ever find the stick is fading, a little hot glue can give the holder new life.

They are a really great size which makes them a perfect solution for labeling larger bins and baskets. They couldn't be easier to use, straight from the package they literally just clip right to the container. For bins receiving a lot of use (think toys, linen closet, tool storage, etc...), these are big winners because they are really substantial and won't fall off easily. Yet, they are completely reusable/not at all permanent.\n   <br />\n   <br />I find these great clip-on holders at \n   <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Vlz0Aw\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a> and \n   <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2H3onbB\" target=\"_blank\">The Container Store</a>.\n   <br />\n   <br />\n   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n    <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/20_IHeart_Organizing_Linen_Closet_Basket_Labels_zpsbpz7odqe.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"794\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/20_IHeart_Organizing_Linen_Closet_Basket_Labels_zpsbpz7odqe.png\" /></a>\n   </div>\n   <br />\n   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n    <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/21_IHeart_Organizing_Basket_Label_Clips_Storage_Room.2_zpsp4yygfjl.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/21_IHeart_Organizing_Basket_Label_Clips_Storage_Room.2_zpsp4yygfjl.png\" /></a>\n   </div>\n   <br />\n   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n    <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/22_IHeart_Organizing_Toy_Storage_Bin_Basket_Label_Holder.2_zpstlxywryj.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/22_IHeart_Organizing_Toy_Storage_Bin_Basket_Label_Holder.2_zpstlxywryj.png\" /></a>\n   </div>\n   <br />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br />These holders are especially great for large baskets of children's toys, as the surface offers enough space to print an entire image of the product inside for easy identification.

I will always love the look that making these labels offer, but I find myself reaching for the machine less and less due to the mess it makes and time constraints. There will always be a place in my heart for vinyl lettering, I especially appreciate that it is extremely durable, waterproof, and can look really, really sharp.&nbsp; Below are a few examples of how I have used vinyl labels around our home:\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/23_IHeart_Organizing_IKEA_Pantry_Organization_Drawer_5_zpspwrk3bbu.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/23_IHeart_Organizing_IKEA_Pantry_Organization_Drawer_5_zpspwrk3bbu.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/24_IHeart_Organizing_Organized_Garden_Shed_Pegboard_25_zpspc9jvjar.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/24_IHeart_Organizing_Organized_Garden_Shed_Pegboard_25_zpspc9jvjar.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/25_IHeart_Organizing_Organized_Garage_Outdoor_Toys_11_zpsobmbcmhz.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/25_IHeart_Organizing_Organized_Garage_Outdoor_Toys_11_zpsobmbcmhz.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/26_IHeart_Organizing_Under_Kitchen_Sink_Organization_15_zpsci6nrizl.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/26_IHeart_Organizing_Under_Kitchen_Sink_Organization_15_zpsci6nrizl.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />I wanted to share one last time-saving labeling technique in the kitchen. Dry erase/chalk markers! I can use them to write on our clear plastic and glass containers, and then erase the writing if the contents change. I usually use markers to add dates to leftovers or dry goods to show when the product was purchased, and also call out items that may have specific food sensitivity information. It gets the job done and just wipes away each time we change out the foods inside.\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/27_Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_16_zpsjaqjfg3b.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Labeling%20Tips/27_Organized_Fridge_Tips_IHeart_Organizing_GE_16_zpsjaqjfg3b.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ziGaANiEvZM/XM-xYZwaM9I/AAAAAAABOHc/ubcQkuEwufg7lB8PVrBFwKDbmjB46P76QCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Sources_2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"45\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ziGaANiEvZM/XM-xYZwaM9I/AAAAAAABOHc/ubcQkuEwufg7lB8PVrBFwKDbmjB46P76QCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Sources_2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n  <center>\n   <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3571711\">\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

the IHeart Organizing best. It's been a long time coming to take everything I have learned over the years, whether it is working in my own home or working with others, and compiling it all in a single place here on the web.\n<br />\n<br />The four-part&nbsp;series will include:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Gearing Up for Your Next Organizing Project with a FREE Printable Kit!</b>\n<br />\n<br />Need helping getting started or prioritizing where to begin? What is the plan of attack? What is currently working well and what isn't? What storage do you need? Trying to get rid of things, but finding it hard to decide what to keep and what to pass on?\n<br />\n<br />I have put together a great printable kit to help you prioritize, sort, and navigate your way through your next organizing project(s), which includes a total of TEN free printables!\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/04/gearing-up-for-your-next-organizing.html\" target=\"_blank\">FIND THAT POST HERE!</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>My Top Organizing Tips!</b>\n<br />\n<br />Instead of digging through years of my archives to find individual tips, I am going to compile the best of the best in a single, very informational post! It's going to be a whopper and a really great resource for projects of any size.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Labeling 101: Quick &amp; Easy Labeling Techniques</b>\n<br />\n<br />I have tried almost every type of label on the market, from vinyl to label makers to stickers and chalk markers, and they all have their place. But what are my tried and true favorites? What do I reach for with almost any project due to time, cost, practicality, and ease? I will be sharing three labeling techniques that haven't failed me yet, and that you won't need any fancy tools to utilize.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Practical, Everyday Storage Solutions!</b>\n<br />\n<br />If I have learned anything from raising three boys and organizing along the way, it is that storage can be expensive and that our needs are constantly evolving. Gone are the days where I purchase pretty bins and baskets to decorate with. Although I will always appreciate beautiful storage,&nbsp;it has to be versatile&nbsp;\n<i>and</i>&nbsp;it has to last! With that in mind, there are a few storage products that I have found that continuously work hard for me in a variety of situations, so they end up being the types of products I gravitate toward when working on any new projects. For the final post in the series, I am putting together the ultimate storage source list with tips and products that I have fallen in love with over the years.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />So let's dive in with part two of the four-part&nbsp;series: \n<i>My Top Organizing Tips!</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EP9dgNMtTf4/XLf5cHeMEwI/AAAAAAABN9s/NgLNgtDeSMQzIiCJhXAAtib8wDC0hBLngCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Best_Top_Tips_Header.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"776\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EP9dgNMtTf4/XLf5cHeMEwI/AAAAAAABN9s/NgLNgtDeSMQzIiCJhXAAtib8wDC0hBLngCLcBGAs/s1600/IHeart_Organizing_Best_Top_Tips_Header.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />Below you will find \n<b>20 Tips and Tricks</b> that I have learned over the year and have been crucial in setting up our home, creating more family time (what it's really all about), saving money and sanity, and even encouraging better habits by all of us.\n<br />\n<br />\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n<br />(I touched on a few of these tips in \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/04/gearing-up-for-your-next-organizing.html\" target=\"_blank\">the printable post</a>, however, they are important enough that they are worthy of the repetition).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">UNDERSTAND YOUR \"WHY\"&nbsp;</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ENVXfhAACQ/XZJZQnoCoFI/AAAAAAABOyY/tQE4-tKmOsM28HdDrNfwp662M3DxG5_8ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.1.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ENVXfhAACQ/XZJZQnoCoFI/AAAAAAABOyY/tQE4-tKmOsM28HdDrNfwp662M3DxG5_8ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Fridge_Organization_Storage.1.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Before you start an organizing project, it is a really good idea to reiterate \n<i>why</i> the project is so important to you. Everyone has their own \"why\", but I encourage you to do it because it will make your life easier, it will save you time, it will bring you joy, it will reduce your stress, save you money, and because you truly understand the positivity that results from organizing. Avoid striving for perfection, comparison traps, or thinking that organizing will ultimately solve all of life's messy problems. Stay intentional and do what is best for you to get the biggest reward for the time that you invest.\n<br />\n<br />\n<i>In the image above you can see that we have invested in organizing our fridge, and do our best to maintain it on a weekly basis. Our \"why\" is that we are able to promote healthier and easier snacking, eat more meals at home, waste less food (and money), etc....</i>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">GET MOTIVATED</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9LPMmx7HrRY/XZJbcs2Wy0I/AAAAAAABOyk/7ztfzyF1qoECrzbrvFehVkYATXWktGV8wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/02_Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_01.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9LPMmx7HrRY/XZJbcs2Wy0I/AAAAAAABOyk/7ztfzyF1qoECrzbrvFehVkYATXWktGV8wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/02_Candle_Jar_Upcycle_Storage_IHeart_Organizing_01.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Sometimes I think getting yourself motivated can be the hardest part! Just getting started can be \n<i>really</i> overwhelming. And knowing where to begin can be even more daunting. You may feel like you have plenty of areas you want to streamline, but my first tip is just to take it one small project at a time. \n<a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2019/04/gearing-up-for-your-next-organizing.html\" target=\"_blank\">My recent printable post</a> offers tools to help prioritize where to begin, and to summarize I typically recommend ranking your projects in terms of what is costing you the most time, money, and sanity. But also start small just to get the momentum going. Once you finish one project, you should feel some natural endorphins and also reap some immediate benefits.\n<br />\n<br />It is also important to know what motivates YOU! There are definitely times that I look at a mess and feel overwhelmed, so I personally find a way to put a creative twist on it. Getting to the creative side of the project feels like a fun reward to me (making labels, lining drawers, wallpapering, painting, etc...). The excitement I feel for the fun part of the project is what keeps me going during the messier moments.\n<br />\n<br />Are you wanting to get into a good book? Allow yourself to listen to a recording while you are sorting. Behind on your favorite television season? Sorting and organizing is a great time to binge watch something. Try researching some inspiration and #goals to get yourself visually stimulated. We know \n<i>why</i> organizing is so important, but sometimes that isn't enough, so look for your own ways to get jazzed up and excited about it!\n<br />\n<br />Most importantly, sometimes you just have to force yourself to start. When I am feeling sluggish or really dreading a project, I try to just push myself to take the first step to get it started. I am often surprised how quickly I can get invested, and that it is never as bad as it seems. You just need to get the blood flowing and adrenaline running. Do a little cardio, turn on some good music, and move your body... it is all SO helpful and really important.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">CREATE A SMALL ORGANIZING TOOL KIT&nbsp;</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I6izM_cy-Kk/XZJbrhn7uPI/AAAAAAABOyo/jIKGhRcLnEQ5t8XOzszu2lYVUgwpG9N0wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/03_IHeart_Organizing_Essential_Project_Tool_Kit.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"449\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I6izM_cy-Kk/XZJbrhn7uPI/AAAAAAABOyo/jIKGhRcLnEQ5t8XOzszu2lYVUgwpG9N0wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/03_IHeart_Organizing_Essential_Project_Tool_Kit.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I find myself reaching for a few common items on a frequent basis, so I toss a few of these things into a small, portable bin to keep handy while working on an organizing project:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li><b>Phone:</b>&nbsp; I use my phone for time management and listening to music/podcasts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li><b>Headphones:</b>&nbsp; I prefer to utilize headphones while sorting to keep me focussed and drown out distractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li><b>Sorting Signs:</b>&nbsp; These are great for identifying specific sorting piles (<a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/iqhn6oumj52acnp41tr2ih4qipg6n3bw\" target=\"_blank\">download free here</a>).

This can be a little challenging to wrap your mind around, but if you are sorting items in a bathroom, then bring all of the items from \n<i>ALL</i> of your bathrooms together and sort/pare it all down accordingly. This gives you a bigger picture of what you already have, what should live where, what can be condensed, what you need to add, etc... This concept applies to linens, clothing and outerwear, kitchen items, office supplies, medications/first aid, tools, etc...\n<br />\n<br />The same idea should be used while you are loading up your cupboards, drawers, and closets. You will want to create categories of similar item types and group them together in the space. This will help you (and others) to recognize and locate the items quickly and easily.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">ZONING LAWS&nbsp;</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eJOi-6a06vc/XZJlLjlaIfI/AAAAAAABO1A/B91D5KAmM-YNydTJSCUwtHlWK7Lh5VdogCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eJOi-6a06vc/XZJlLjlaIfI/AAAAAAABO1A/B91D5KAmM-YNydTJSCUwtHlWK7Lh5VdogCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/iHeart_Organizing_Charging_Cabinet_Kitchen_School_Zone.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<br />Whenever possible, it is always better to keep specific item types in as few places as possible around your home, which will ultimately cut down on the time it takes to hunt something down. For example, you may keep charging cables in your living room, entryway, automobiles, bedrooms, etc... When the time comes for needing a charger, suddenly you are looking in multiple places. In that situation, I would recommend creating a zone in your home where \n<i>all</i> of your tech lives, which would not only include charging cords, but may also include batteries, tech cleaners, keyboards/mice, media, remotes, etc... With everything within that category stored in one specific place, everyone should naturally fall into the habit of checking that one place when they need something tech related. We are generally groomed to practice this concept in the kitchen (dry items go in a pantry, silverware goes in a utensil drawer, etc...), but the same idea should be implemented all throughout the entire house.\n<br />\n<br />Zones can be created in bookcases, cabinets, drawers, closets, nooks, etc... It is just used as a general term for an area in your home where everything with a similar responsibility is stored.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">GIVE EVERYTHING A PROPER HOME&nbsp;</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NUyZjtcbtHQ/XZJcko0NyKI/AAAAAAABOzA/9kelG0J9zrcOglkujSixZjwt6PB23083ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/07_iHeart_Organizing_Organized_File_Cabinet_Desk_Office_Drawer.2.2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"747\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NUyZjtcbtHQ/XZJcko0NyKI/AAAAAAABOzA/9kelG0J9zrcOglkujSixZjwt6PB23083ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/07_iHeart_Organizing_Organized_File_Cabinet_Desk_Office_Drawer.2.2.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Bottom line, clutter happens when things don't have a home, or when we aren't disciplined enough to put things away. While organizing, everything you sort/touch needs to be assigned a proper home. When you run out of space, that is when it is time to purge. And when something new comes in, it is a really good rule of thumb to let something go right away. It is a good idea to know how and where you are going to store your belongings prior to adding them to your shopping cart.\n<br />\n<br />If you notice piles/items consistently out of place, first assign it to one of your home zones. Go from there to find a way to make it fit. Paper piles? Give yourself an inbox to corral mail until bill paying day. Returns need to be done? Put a basket in your coat closet or car to hold those returns until you are out running errands. At the end of the day, if an item doesn't have a proper home, it will cause a trickle effect of frustrations.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">MORE ITEMS, MORE PROBLEMS</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YxIOXBHeBdA/XZJc2KxA2SI/AAAAAAABOzI/1gKp-cqWzJo5SekCZBWhRjzsAGy1zFW3ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/08_iHeart_Organizing_Sorting_Boxes_Printable_Signs.1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"479\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YxIOXBHeBdA/XZJc2KxA2SI/AAAAAAABOzI/1gKp-cqWzJo5SekCZBWhRjzsAGy1zFW3ACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/08_iHeart_Organizing_Sorting_Boxes_Printable_Signs.1.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />I have never been a minimalist, but I have seen first hand the problems that come from owning too many things. Not only do you run the risk of creating piles and clutter (which can ultimately lead to emotional distress), you also carry the responsibility of having to maintain every last item you own. That means keeping it clean and fixing it if it becomes worn out. When it comes to linens and clothing, if you have multiple options, you may be less likely to keep up on washing duties. You may also spend more time contemplating what to wear each day. More items require more space to store those items, and space usually equates to dollars. Dollars in home size, containers, closet systems, etc...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">SHOULD IT STAY OR SHOULD IT GO?</span></b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T_LVq_17a7w/XZJdFPuQJ7I/AAAAAAABOzM/UDhEzdtanfkjm60BSSJG0wvvh5Tc0xXfwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/09_iHeart_Organizing_Clutter_Clearing_Printable_Kit_03.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"467\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T_LVq_17a7w/XZJdFPuQJ7I/AAAAAAABOzM/UDhEzdtanfkjm60BSSJG0wvvh5Tc0xXfwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/09_iHeart_Organizing_Clutter_Clearing_Printable_Kit_03.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />The sorting process can really be daunting and be the one act that slows us down while organizing. We become emotionally and financially invested in our belongings. Eliminating our items can overwhelm us and even deter us from finishing our projects.\n<br />\n<br />Last week I shared a list of sorting questions that can be really helpful in aiding you through the process of letting things go (\n<a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/myqsgutdtx3x5v2m60j5grxywyb0fs3j\" target=\"_blank\">download free here</a>). I like to keep it laminated and use it as a tool to help myself and others stay on track during the paring down process.\n<br />\n<br />The biggest roadblock is typically those sentimental items; belongings we received from a special someone or tied to specific memories. A few tips for handling those situations:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>I am typically pretty good about understanding the benefits of paring down and letting things go. But I am also a sentimentalist. I frequently tell myself that items do not equal memories, that memories live in my mind and heart. However, items can draw emotion and connection to moments in our lives. These days we are really lucky that we have the technology to help us retain those items without having to necessarily hold on to every last birthday card. Sometimes I think tech is taking over the world, and I miss the days of paper book pages and magazines, face to face conversations, and tangible items that are real and nostalgic. But tech can also be a blessing. We now have the ability to photograph our belongings, so when they are passed on we still have some sort of visual record of them. We can also scan our children's artwork, letters from our pen pals, and old photographs of our grandparents. Take advantage of technology and use it to store your memories digitally vs. in boxes around your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li>Assign each member of the household a special box for memorabilia. These boxes could be considered a bit of a time capsule or treasure chest of sorts. It allows us to hold on to the most special of items but also encourages us to keep things pared down to a single container.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li>Collections are best displayed in a grouping vs. spread out around the home. If you (or someone you love) collects specific items, group the best of the best on shelves or in a display cabinet. This creates more of a statement and also pays tribute to the passion while reducing the amount of clutter spread throughout.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li>Which brings me to my next point, what good are your memories and belongings doing living in boxes in your basement or attic? Why not get them out and enjoy them, or pass them along to someone that will. Put old photos into an album or frame them on the walls. Display grandma's china or grandpa's camera collection on your shelves. Create shadow boxes of children's clothing, artwork, or clay creations. Make a blanket out of old textiles. Pay tribute to your family history in tasteful and creative ways.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li>Finally, if you just can't decide, I recommend using a bin or box as a holding cell. Pack up the items you just aren't sure about, put the box away on a shelf or in storage, and set a reminder on your phone or calendar for three months down the road. In that time, if you have not reached for or thought about those items, then you will probably be OK letting them go for good. Don't use this as a crutch for everything, but it is a useful way to really decide before doing something you might regret. This works especially well when sorting down your child's toys that they are insistent they can't live without.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">A TEAM EFFORT</span></b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cb5VFpzpMR4/XZJdj_pXuUI/AAAAAAABOzY/h5m2re1H6aclR7BwRfliEPavcpgzNEGaQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_8.2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cb5VFpzpMR4/XZJdj_pXuUI/AAAAAAABOzY/h5m2re1H6aclR7BwRfliEPavcpgzNEGaQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/DIY_Wall_Shelf_EKBY_Hack_8.2.jpg\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />If you are organizing for more than just yourself, then make the process about \n <i>everyone</i> involved. It might be as simple as brainstorming and asking for suggestions, but I also recommend getting the individual(s) active with the sorting, moving, cleaning, and organizing. This will get them invested in the process and increase the success rate of maintaining things going forward.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n Also, be sure to consider everyone's existing habits when setting up your systems. If your spouse has a habit of dropping their change, keys, and wallet in the same place each day, then maybe consider adding a decorative tray in that exact spot to corral it and make it look more intentional. \n <b>Sometimes it is easier to create a solution based on the habit than it is to change the habit itself.</b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <i>In the image above I worked with my son to organize <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/05/teen-boy-bedroom-workspace-diy-shelf.html\" target=\"_blank\">his work area</a> in a way that caters to his study style. He needs a larger, empty surface to spread out on, so giving him wall organization allows him to keep his desk clear.

One of my most basic tips is to use open-top bins and baskets as often as possible. If you have to remove a lid or move an item to put something back, then you may be less inclined to keep up on it. Only stack lidded bins that are not utilized frequently. If stacking is ultimately the best solution to make the most of a space, consider using pull-out drawers instead of lidded containers, which will allow you to quickly access (and put away) the contents inside.\n <br />\n <br />\n <i>You can see more of how I encouraged this concept throughout this entire <a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2017/09/client-kitchen-cabinet-drawer-overhaul_6.html\" target=\"_blank\">client kitchen here</a>.</i>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">FILING ISN'T JUST FOR PAPERS&nbsp;</span></b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2iDwf7OScr8/XZJeSSUKGjI/AAAAAAABOzo/PdFwTqT7bw8l13ujQ7BQzRaZJz6v5-DPwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/12_Girl_Closet_Organization_Closetmaid_IHeart_Organizing_39.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2iDwf7OScr8/XZJeSSUKGjI/AAAAAAABOzo/PdFwTqT7bw8l13ujQ7BQzRaZJz6v5-DPwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/12_Girl_Closet_Organization_Closetmaid_IHeart_Organizing_39.jpg\" /></a>\n </div>\n <br />I file anything and everything I can.

Filing items will allow you to better see everything at a glance, and quickly grab from the front, middle or back. Not only can you file clothing such as sweaters, jeans, t-shirts, etc...

There are a few different benefits for doing this, but the two primary reasons are:\n</div>\n<div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Dividers hold your items in place and prevent tipping or shifting when the drawers are opened and closed, and that means less rummaging and searching.</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Dividers encourage you to stop and think before stuffing random things away.

There is so much creativity in the world, who is to say what is normal and what isn't? Organize based on your routine, your lifestyle, your home, your schedule, and your style. What works for me might not work for you, and that is OK! Some of the best ideas and trends are formed when people go down their own path.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n An example of this is the family closet concept. Typically speaking, folks have a dresser/closet in their own bedroom. However, I have seen families create a community closet used to store the clothing for the entire family in a single place. This cuts down on the time needed to do and put the laundry away, streamlines the process of getting multiple kids ready for school in the morning, and offers quick packing and planning for vacations. It may not be the way most families do it, but it doesn't make it wrong. In fact, \n <b>if it makes your life easier, then it is absolutely RIGHT!</b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <i>In the image above you can see how we set up a small document retention area in our storage room.

Although I always appreciate a solid floor to ceiling closet system, I know they aren't always in the budget. Great closets can still be maximized by adding in a dresser or shoe rack below the hanging items, multiplying shelving with the help of a bookcase, adding a second rod halfway down the closet to double hanging space, etc... There are a lot of wonderful mix-and-match closet organizers for great prices at most department and home stores, and they can easily be paired with existing storage pieces to really maximize your overall closet functionality.\n <br />\n <br />\n <i><a href=\"http://www.iheartorganizing.com/2018/06/an-organized-teen-boy-closet.html\" target=\"_blank\">Our teen boy closet organization post can be found here</a>.</i>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <b><span style=\"color: #0a5a8f;\">TO LABEL OR NOT TO LABEL, THAT IS THE QUESTION</span></b>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-czYRIEr3Qzc/XZJgRKUXerI/AAAAAAABO0U/2KMLhaKAAMcMGgOE5X-s7VeXUA3p36UrQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/17_Organized_Kitchen_Cabinet_Baking_Canisters_Labeled.2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"878\" data-original-width=\"585\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-czYRIEr3Qzc/XZJgRKUXerI/AAAAAAABO0U/2KMLhaKAAMcMGgOE5X-s7VeXUA3p36UrQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/17_Organized_Kitchen_Cabinet_Baking_Canisters_Labeled.2.jpg\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Labeling is another personal preference that doesn't have a one size fits all rule.\n<br />\n<div>\n <br />The overall purpose of labeling is to create identification.

Once you have gone through the sorting, purging, and categorizing process, I encourage you to live with it for a bit before investing in containers.

So if you find something isn't working out, I encourage you to be forgiving, stay positive, and try again. Also, remember that your needs are constantly evolving and changing. That means that your systems and home need to change with you. Organizing is a process and a journey and never a one-and-done. And if you feel like you have exhausted all options, don't be scared to ask for help and advice from friends, family members, and experts.

He needed some actual drawers and to keep his bedroom floor area nice and open, we wanted to add those drawers inside of the closet. I also wanted to be sure he had a place for his shoes off of the floor and that we made the most of the 8 feet of vertical space, so after looking at a variety of options, I decided on the \n<a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70214564/\" target=\"_blank\">IKEA PAX wardrobe frame</a> (measuring in at 29 1/2\" wide x 22 7/8\" deep x 79 1/4\" tall). This unit offers more than enough space and I appreciate that there is plenty of room for him as he continues to grow.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_8.2_zpskt8jemgi.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_8.2_zpskt8jemgi.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />This kiddo is the beneficiary of a lot of hand-me-down items. Not only does he have an older brother that has always taken pretty good care of his belongings, but we have a few friends with older boys that like to pass on their clothes as well. We try to limit the number of clothing items we keep in general, but it is also nice to have some options. The updated closet not only provides adequate storage for his current wardrobe, but also for the plethora of hand-me-downs waiting for when he goes through another growth spurt.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_2.2_zpskh1curxf.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_2.2_zpskh1curxf.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />So let's talk about the hand-me-downs for a minute. We have three boys so we do our best to preserve and reuse clothes as much as possible. They grow at different rates and are always different sizes, so there are times we need to store those extra clothes that they just haven't grown into yet. Twice a year we do a quick closet purge and inventory and rotate out their closets (spring and fall). I prefer to keep their hand-me-downs stored on the top shelf of their closets, and in this room, \n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2LpAXT0\" target=\"_blank\">these medium Elfa drawers</a> were the perfect solution. Did you know that although they are meant to be used with the Elfa drawer system, they can also be used as stackable bins? Mind. Blown. I love that they are frosted and sturdy and come with slim lids that clip in. They are a really great size and by using two, we were able to easily fit them on top of the IKEA tower in our son's closet.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_7_zps1qapdjpt.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_7_zps1qapdjpt.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />These two bins hold 10+ pairs of jeans in a variety of sizes, as well as dress shirts/pants, shorts, sweats, t-shirts, etc... I found that I had plenty of room to roll and stack the items inside.\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_4_zpsv9vunut8.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_4_zpsv9vunut8.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />To keep track of the contents, I created and printed out a quick inventory tracker that I filled out and tucked under the lid.

So nice!</li>\n <li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2BqbSFX\" target=\"_blank\">This is the paper</a> I used to line the back of the tower (I just adhered it to the back panel with double-sided carpet tape before tacking it to the back of the frame).</li>\n <li>Although we designed this closet for a teen boy, it is versatile enough to work for anyone of any age! Always a bonus.</li>\n <li>We plan to add a sliding door next to conceal everything, which almost makes me sad because I love how it turned out so much! But also, teenage boy.</li>\n <li>I considered adding a small step stool under his pants, but the boy is officially as tall as me and has no problem reaching his everyday items. Sigh....</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n This install has also sold us on updating our own closet with the PAX system down the road. It was so easy and versatile and the quality is really great. Not to mention, I love that there are so many ways to customize it to make it look unique, even though it is off-the-shelf at IKEA (they are not sponsoring me by the way, just my honest thoughts).\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_23_zpsj5nvcgvq.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Kid_Closet_Organization_Teen_Boy_IHeart_Organizing_23_zpsj5nvcgvq.png\" data-original-height=\"825\" data-original-width=\"550\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n Let's end the post with a fun before and after to see how much was gained by removing the wing wall and installing a fully functional closet system.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Bedroom_Closet_Organization_Before_After_IHeart_Organizing_zpstwz1kquo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://i917.photobucket.com/albums/ad14/iheartorganizing/Post%20Images/Bedroom_Closet_Organization_Before_After_IHeart_Organizing_zpstwz1kquo.png\" data-original-height=\"432\" data-original-width=\"600\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n For reference, I rounded up all of the closet sources below.\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-igD3nUEg_7g/Wxbj92mtndI/AAAAAAABMkY/hmj8LwplSxwFZ6Bkb7aDyJnoI-KXiPnfQCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"28\" data-original-width=\"500\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-igD3nUEg_7g/Wxbj92mtndI/AAAAAAABMkY/hmj8LwplSxwFZ6Bkb7aDyJnoI-KXiPnfQCLcBGAs/s1600/Post_Product_Sources.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n</div>\n<div>\n <br />\n <center> \n  <div class=\"shopthepost-widget\" data-widget-id=\"3160981\">\n   <script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?
