To know that your customers will receive personalized emails without you having to manually write each and every one … whew, that’s powerful stuff.</p>  \n<p>Did you know that segmented (a.k.a. personalized) email campaigns can drive a <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/\">700+% increase in revenue</a>? And that’s just email.</p> \n<p>From text reminders to cart abandonment emails to multi-channel campaigns that span social media and in-app messaging, B2C marketing automation marries the power of personalized messaging and hands-off marketing. It simultaneously saves time (and money) while <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-delight\">delighting your customers</a> wherever they are.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What is marketing automation?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation\">Marketing automation</a> refers to any marketing efforts, campaigns, and tasks that are managed, executed, and measured with software versus manually. These efforts and campaigns are typically triggered by actions taken by leads or customers.</p> \n<p>Marketing automation has many benefits. It can help save your resources, nurture your leads, and increase your revenue — all at once and with minimal manual effort. Amazing, right?</p> \n<p>It’s important to note, however, that marketing automation shouldn’t replace human touch. This is especially true for B2C — unlike B2B, the B2C sales cycle is much shorter and the customer journey much more personalized.</p> \n<h2>What is B2C marketing automation?</h2> \n<p>B2C marketing automation encompasses any automated marketing messages and campaigns targeted to individual consumers versus business audiences. This type of marketing automation must be much more personalized and data-driven to best appeal to the individual in his or her specific customer journey.</p> \n<p>Both B2C and B2C marketing automation work to send relevant messages, increase efficiency, and drive revenue, but let’s further unpack their differences.</p> \n<h3>B2B vs. B2C Marketing Automation</h3> \n<p><strong>B2B marketing automation</strong> delivers more mass-oriented content that’s focused on educating and nurturing leads through a pre-established sales funnel. Since there are typically more stakeholders involved in B2B purchases, B2B marketing automation also works to provide action-triggered information that can help <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/identify-sales-prospects-influencers-decision-makers-ht\">influencers educate their decision-makers</a>.</p> \n<p>Let’s say a junior social media strategist is searching for a new social media management software for their entire team. They download an ebook on social media strategy from a prominent SaaS company, thus prompting the company’s B2B marketing automation software to send them nurturing emails about building a social media strategy and how to use its tool to do so.</p> \n<p>The junior strategist is now equipped to bring this information to his or her director, who will make the final decision about which social media SaaS tool to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Copy%20of%20LinkedIn%20-%20Graph%20-%201104%20x%20736.png?width=600&amp;name=Copy%20of%20LinkedIn%20-%20Graph%20-%201104%20x%20736.png\" alt=\"b2c marketing automation\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>On the other hand, <strong>B2C marketing automation</strong> typically focuses on highly relevant and personalized marketing messages. B2C marketing automation also targets individuals wherever they are in their individual customer journeys and attempts to deliver customized product or service recommendations based on action triggers and captured data.</p> \n<p>For example, one type of B2C marketing automation is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/ecommerce/shopping-cart-abandonment-reasons-solutions\">cart abandonment email</a>. By tracking shopper behavior and capturing personal information like email addresses, B2C companies set up a marketing automation “rule” to send an email to consumers who leave un-purchased products in their shopping carts.</p> \n<p>Typically, abandoned cart emails include the specific products left behind — a dose of personalization that may motivate shoppers to return to the website and complete their individual purchase.</p> \n<h3>Benefits of B2C Marketing Automation</h3> \n<p>Marketing automation sure has its perks — for both marketers and their audiences. These <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-benefits\">marketing automation benefits</a> include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Keeping your brand top-of-mind with potential customers</li> \n <li>Allowing your team to send personalized, targeted messages without having to manually track users and repeatedly write content</li> \n <li>Increasing efficiency amongst your marketing team</li> \n <li>Closing the gaps in your marketing analysis by removing human error</li> \n <li>Tracking user data that can be used to better serve up personalized product or service suggestions</li> \n <li>Delighting site visitors, leads, and customers with customized content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let’s discuss some B2C marketing automation tools software tools that can help you reach, engage, and convert your shoppers and customers.</p> \n<p>There are countless marketing automation tools on the market. According to our research, the following five are a great fit for B2C marketing automation.</p> \n<p>However, when comparing what tool may meet your B2C marketing automation needs, consider 1) how complex each tool is and what onboarding resources are offered, 2) what integrations each tool offers and how they may fit into your current tech stack, and 3) how each tool is priced and how much your marketing automation needs may cost.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a></h3> \n<p><em><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-Oct-07-2020-03-09-17-25-AM.png?width=600&amp;name=image2-Oct-07-2020-03-09-17-25-AM.png\" alt=\"b2c marketing automation software hubspot\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></em></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/professional\">Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Built on the foundation of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">free HubSpot CRM</a>, HubSpot Marketing Hub holds a wealth of B2C marketing automation tools that allow you to use your lead’s behavior to personalize emails, content, and outreach at scale.

If you want your video to resonate, it should be about <em>more than</em> just the product. It should be about the problem, the solution, the experience, and the larger vision of what you're trying to build.</p> \n<p>Considering the right video can put a product on the map for the first time or reinvigorate a company that has long been stale, it's important that marketers have a strong grasp on this. So to inspire your own efforts, we've collected a list of impressive product videos for marketing a product or new release.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>What is a product video?</h2> \n<h3>Product Videos Defined</h3> \n<p>A product video is one that explains and visually exhibits a product's tangible benefits. A lot of product videos tend to emphasize a product's unique features, but one chief thing that truly differentiates a good product video is its ability to exhibit how it solves problems.</p> \n<p>What Makes a Good Product Video?</p> \n<p>As a rule, remarkable product videos encompass the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Engaging dialogue and narration</li> \n <li>Long enough to fully explain the product and its benefits, but short enough to keep the viewer's attention</li> \n <li>Professionalism, without being \"stuffy\"</li> \n <li>Empathy and relatability</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Want to see how these elements are put into action? Check out the examples below.</p> \n<h2>7 Promotional Product Videos That Make You Want to Buy</h2> \n<h3>1) Blendtec: Will it Blend?</h3> \n<p>I'm digging into the archives for this one, but in the world of videos that add life to a product, few have done it better than Blendtec. The company's CEO, Tom Dickson, became a YouTube icon back in 2006 with the introduction of his <em>Will it Blend?</em> series.</p> \n<p>Since then, Blendtec has expanded the tremendous success of these videos to other channels, enabling viewers to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/Blendtec\">suggest things to blend on Facebook</a>. The company even has its own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_It_Blend%3F\">Wikipedia page</a> dedicated to the series.</p> \n<p>The success of this video comes down to two things: a clear, unwavering message and a company with a personality. In seven years, the series has never changed. The point of each video and the underpinning of the product positioning is essentially, \"Why yes, it will blend.\"</p> \n<p>For years, we've been watching this product blend everything from <a href=\"http://www.willitblend.com/videos/view/41\">glow sticks</a> to an <a href=\"http://www.willitblend.com/videos/view/129\">iPhone</a>. The videos are minimally expensive, product-focused, and garner millions of views. In a <a href=\"http://features.slashdot.org/story/13/03/13/161200/interviews-blendtec-founder-tom-dickson-answers-your-questions\">recent interview</a>, Dickson explained the history and success of the video series:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"'Will it Blend?' was developed accidentally by a new marketing director hired in 2006. I have always been one to try to break my blenders to find their fail points and determine how I can improve them. George, the new marketing director, discovered some of the wacky things I was doing to my blenders ... With a $50 budget, George bought a Happy Meal, a rotisserie chicken, Coke cans, golf balls, and a few other items, and they made five videos. Six days later, we had six million views on YouTube. Six years, 120-plus videos, almost 200 million views later, 'Will it Blend?' has been named as <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/the-viral-video-chart/digital-marketing-top-10-viral-ads-time/145673/\">the number one viral marketing campaign of all time</a> [by Ad Age].\"</em></p> \n<p>Here's Tom blending a Facebook request: Justin Bieber. The video earned 2.8 million views (and counting) on YouTube.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-undefined\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/I7TK_8RiVj8?rel=0\" width=\"667\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>2) Dollar Shave Club: Our Blades are Great</h3> \n<p>Dollar Shave Club also made waves with their first product video. I'll warn you now: they're not shy with the F-bombs or referring to \"your handsome-ass grandfather,\" so you may want to throw in the headphones before pressing play. Having said that, what's singular about this product launch video is how well the company knows its audience and the problem it's trying to solve.</p> \n<p>Dollar Shave Club was trying to crack into a demographic of young, professional men who habitually purchase big-brand razors at local stores. The problem they attempt to highlight is the absurdly high cost of store-bought razor cartridges. Thus, the company needed an absurdist, well-targeted product launch video to match.</p> \n<p>CEO Michael Dubin, who studied improv with the Upright Citizens Brigade, wrote the spot himself and hired a comedian friend, Lucia Aniello, to produce the video. According to <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Dollar-Shave-Club/Who-created-the-video-script-etc-for-Dollar-Shave-Clubs-video\">reports on Quora</a>, the video cost approximately $4,500 -- and yet, it got more than 11 million views and coverage on countless media outlets.</p> \n<div> \n <div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-undefined\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUG9qYTJMsI?rel=0\" width=\"667\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n <h3>3) Purple Feather: The Power of Words</h3> \n <p>In tight marketing budgets, professional copywriting services are often the first to be cut. Instead of hiring professional copywriters, companies opt to take on the writing themselves, figuring it's not all that different from other writing they do. They assume the words they choose won't make much of a difference one way or the other. Based in Glasgow, Purple Feather is a copywriting agency that set out to prove that assumption wrong.</p> \n <p>Words matter. In fact, they can change everything. Purple Feather made that point exceptionally clear in this powerful video:</p> \n <div> \n  <div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.22%; margin: 0;\">\n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hzgzim5m7oU\" width=\"667\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div> \n   <h3>4) Google Chrome: Jess Time</h3> \n   <p>The best product videos focus not on the product itself, but on the stories of the people who use it.</p> \n   <p>Technology writer and NYU Professor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky\">Clay Shirky</a> has a great chapter in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Everybody\">his first book</a> about the pervasiveness of communications tools in our lives. In it, he explains that technology doesn't truly get interesting until it becomes so ingrained in our lives that it turns invisible.</p> \n   <p>No product video shows this \"invisibility\" of really good products better than Google's \"Loretta\" Super Bowl commercial, which tells the story of a man reminiscing about the love of his life with help from Google.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p>The video below demonstrates how seamlessly Google and all of its products have melded into our lives and become a part of how we interact. It's a video about an&nbsp;experience, not software, and that is arguably what the company truly creates.</p> \n   <div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n    <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n     <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xSxXiHwMrg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <h3>5) Apple: The Only Thing That's Changed</h3> \n   <p class=\"p1\">Launch videos like the Dollar Shave Club video above have a bit of an advantage when it comes to resonating with an audience. They represent a brand new company, product, or idea. But what if your company has been around for a long time? What if the announcement you're making is really more of a set of enhancements to an existing product than a brand new launch?</p> \n   <p class=\"p1\">This year, Apple tackled that challenge head-on with the following video. This video takes a collection of seemingly small enhancements and strings them together in a way that underscores just how advanced the total new functionality is. Take a look:</p>  \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nUrkQxyOTKg\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div> \n   </div>  \n   <h3>6) Google: Google, Evolved</h3> \n   <p>This year Google introduced a new logo for the company and a new parent company, Alphabet. It was the perfect moment for retrospection. So the company took to video to show not only how much Google's products have evolved, but how much progress those products have enabled in the world around them.</p> \n   <p>The brilliance of this video is that it uses others to tell the story. Whereas some companies may have pointed the camera at their own designers and developers (looking at you, Apple), Google put the focus on the users, media, and cultural leaders that have adopted and promoted the products along the way. The resulting video plays more like a historical chapter than a commercial.</p> \n   <p>&nbsp;</p> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 667px; max-height: 375px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.22%; margin: 0;\">\n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/olFEpeMwgHk\" width=\"667\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <p>&nbsp;</p> \n   <h3>7) InVision: Design Disruptors</h3> \n   <p>I want to end this list with a bit of an anomaly, because it pushes at the boundaries of what can be considered a product video and, as such, opens up all sorts of opportunities.</p> \n   <p>InVision, a prototyping, collaboration, and workflow platform wants to empower designers -- their primary users. Much of their content strategy is bent on this mission. This year, InVision will launch a documentary on the role of design in the modern business.</p> \n   <p><em>Design Disruptors</em> looks at how 15 top businesses prioritize design in their products and overall user experience. Unlike traditional product videos, <em>Design Disruptors</em> will run in theaters and on Netflix. And unlike traditional product videos, <em>Design Disruptors</em> never actually promotes the product. The goal is bigger than the product.</p> \n   <p>\"We're trying to bring attention to the increased importance of design in a company's success,\" <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-disruptors\">explains David Malpass</a>, InVision's vice president of marketing. \"A lot of our work is based on doing things that'll create a positive effect on the design community and that will elevate the role of the designer within their organization.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4AViRgrgkU\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <p>Want more tips on creating visual content?

To evoke a sense of style, professionalism, and uniqueness, it's critical you put effort and consideration into your font choice.</p> \n<p>But, besides Times New Roman, which fonts pass the six-second resume scan? Additionally, which fonts should you avoid to ensure your typeface isn't distracting the recruiter from the content itself?</p> \n<p>Here, we've asked HubSpot recruiters to reveal the seven best fonts for your resume in 2019, as well as what they consider in terms of design in general, so your resume can stand out in the pile.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Best Fonts for Resume</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Times New Roman</li> \n  <li>Arial</li> \n  <li>Calibri</li> \n  <li>Helvetica</li> \n  <li>Cambria</li> \n  <li>Georgia</li> \n  <li>Garamond</li> \n  <li>Avenir Next</li> \n  <li><span>Muna</span></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>When speaking with recruiters, it quickly became clear that classic fonts are still the best options -- when in doubt, you want to make your resume as clear and easy-to-read as possible, even if it means forsaking your favorite script font.</p> \n<p>For instance, Johanna Fleming, a Services Recruiter at HubSpot, told me, \"I’m a big fan of the 'classics' for resumes -- Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, and Cambria. I’m a little old school, but I think they are the cleanest and exude professionalism.\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, when asked which font <em>size </em>is best, Johanna said, \"12 is ideal -- nothing less than 10.5.\"</p> \n<p>Riley Kundtz, MBA Campus Recruiter at HubSpot, further noted, \"I find the classic formatting and Times font to be helpful when reading a dense resume from an experienced MBA candidate.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Another HubSpot recruiter, Rich Lapham, concurred, saying, \"I</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;would stick with the classics like Times New Roman or Arial. My personal recommendation would be Garamond -- I think it makes it look that much more professional. Recruiters have an idea of the skills they are looking for on a resume, so if you try a new style or format it can be tougher for recruiters to find the information they are looking for. Keep it clean and simple.\"&nbsp;<br></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Holly Peterson, a Senior Recruiter at HubSpot, also supports more traditional fonts -- \"I really like Arial, Tahoma, and you can't go wrong with Times New Roman! Anything that is cursive (or too bubbly) is too hard to read. For instance, I'd stay clear of Comic Sans.\"<br></span></p> \n<p>Despite the preference of Times New Roman by some of the recruiters I spoke to, not all recruiters prefer it. For instance, Glory Montes, Associate Campus Recruiter at HubSpot, told me, \"For me it’s all about legibility and cleanliness. This means I prefer sans-serif fonts like Helvetica, over serif fonts like Times New Roman. Overall, I would just stay away from a font like Times New Roman. It’s overused and reminds me of long nights writing course papers in college.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, you'll want to consider the position for which you're applying when you're choosing a font. To Glory's point, certain more creative roles might benefit from a more unique font than Times New Roman.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Paulina Valdez Franco, a Senior Recruiter at HubSpot, also supports fonts other than Times New Roman. She mentioned, \"<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">My two favorite fonts for 2019 are Helvetica, if you're looking for a clean and classic look, and Georgia, if you're going after a more modern and fun look. The latter is also designed to read well on screens.\"</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Additionally, Paulina added, \"Arial and Calibri are great choices if you want to play it safe.\"</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Bridget LeMon, a Technical Campus Recruiter at HubSpot, agrees that \"it's totally acceptable (and becoming more common) for candidates to stray away from the resume-norms of Times New Roman and Calibri. Avenir Next and Muna are two great options if you are looking to break the status quo.\" </span></p> \n<p>However, it's important to note most recruiters I spoke with were hesitant to even offer a font at all.</p> \n<p>For instance, Heta Patel, a HubSpot recruiter, said, \"I typically don't pay too much attention to font. I'm more concerned about whether the resume is formatted in a clean way -- submitting a PDF is helpful with this, so your formatting doesn't shift.\"</p> \n<p>Kelsey Freedman, a Sales Recruiter at HubSpot, concurred -- \"Honestly, I don't care much about the font of a resume, as long as it's clear and in PDF format. I typically only review a resume for 20-30 seconds, so a traditional font is good. I would advise avoiding script font or bubble font, or something distracting like that.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, and as expected, your content still matters most -- however, a clean, clear font will help avoid any irritability you might cause a recruiter with a distracting, messy design.</p> \n<p>Ashley Hodder, a Technical Recruiter at HubSpot, seconds this notion -- \"I think a resume shouldn't have distracting font, and it should be easy to read. [But] what I get most excited about is the content. Depending on the role, I look to see that candidates are sharing direct and compelling snapshots of their work. I look for indicators that show data orientation, autonomy, and thoughtfulness about business impact.\"</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Resume Font Size</h2> \n <p>Regular font size for resumes is 12 points, typically in Times New Roman or another classic, easy-to-read font. Larger fonts are acceptable for headings, your name, or titles of sections. If you're having trouble fitting your content on one page, you might try making your font 10.5 points, but don't go lower than that.<span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: transparent;\"></span></p> \n</div> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-font-resume&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"56a38d0aefc3dbb0c47132fa53b7059c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-font-resume&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-52-353_0353129567627031.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624908},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"The 9 Best Free Email Accounts and Service Providers of 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-email-accounts","description":"<p>You need it for networking, job recruitment, downloading resources, transferring files, setting reminders, meeting with colleagues, and so much more.</p>  \n<p>Even with the rise of office chat platforms, you still depend on email for a surprising number of things. But unfortunately, not every email service is completely free. And even the free ones might not be the easiest to use or have all the features you need.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It can be a challenge to find an email service provider at no cost that balances the right features with usability. To help make your search easier, we put together a list of the different types of email accounts you can set up, followed by the nine best email service providers you can host your account on right now for free.</p> \n<h2>Types of Email Accounts</h2> \n<p>There are two main types of email service providers to choose from: email clients and webmail. When you use your provider to access your email from a different device or location online, you can use one of three major email protocols to do so: POP3, IMAP, and Exchange.</p> \n<p>Let's briefly go over these different types of providers and protocols.</p> \n<h3>Email Clients</h3> \n<p>Email clients are software applications that you install onto the computer itself to manage the email you send and receive. To access this email, the client interacts with a remote email server.</p> \n<p>Email clients you've likely heard of include Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail.</p> \n<p>If you want to access this type of email from the web, rather than the client's computer application, the email client uses one of the email protocols described below. For example, although you might have Outlook installed on your computer, you can also log in to your email account via outlook.com using a specific email protocol.</p> \n<h3>Webmail</h3> \n<p>Webmail is a form of email you access exclusively from the internet, and therefore exists primarily on the cloud rather than your computer. Instead of an installed application fetching your email, you manage your inbox right from your internet browser.</p> \n<p>Webmail providers you've likely heard of include Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL (all of which have made our list of best free email accounts, below).</p> \n<p>If you want to access your webmail from a mail app on your mobile device, rather than your desktop web browser, your webmail provider can use one of the email protocols described below.</p> \n<p>Now, before we get into the best free email accounts, let's talk about those email protocols.</p> \n<h3>Email Protocols</h3> \n<p>Email protocols are the systems that actually retrieve your email for you. They can be used to fetch <em>email client</em> accounts on the internet, and fetch <em>webmail</em> accounts on a mobile app. Here are the three main types of email protocol your account can use.</p> \n<h4>POP3</h4> \n<p>POP stands for \"post office protocol,\" and is best suited for people who have just one email account and email client. <a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/POP3-Post-Office-Protocol-3\">POP3</a> is the latest version of this email protocol, and allows you to access email while offline. It therefore requires less internet bandwidth.</p> \n<h4>IMAP</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.business.org/it/operating-systems/exchange-vs-imap-email-protocols-compare/\">IMAP</a> stands for \"internet mail access protocol,\" and is one of the older email protocol available today. IMAP4 is considered the latest version, and unlike the POP protocol, you do not download your email to your offline email client. Instead, all your email stays online while you're accessing and managing it.</p> \n<p>IMAP is particularly useful for people who have more than one email account and access them from multiple devices or locations.</p> \n<h4>Exchange</h4> \n<p>Exchange is a Microsoft email protocol, and is pretty similar to the IMAP protocol explained above. This protocol allows you to not only access your email over the internet from multiple devices, but also tasks, calendars, and contact information tethered to that email address. For this reason, it's particularly helpful to organizations whose employees share many types of information and collaborate remotely.</p> \n<p>Now, take a look at seven of the best free email service providers you can get your hands on today -- both webmail and email clients included. For each email service provider, we highlighted a unique feature to help you find the best fit.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Best Free Email Accounts</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Gmail</li> \n  <li>AOL</li> \n  <li>Outlook</li> \n  <li>Zoho</li> \n  <li>Mail.com</li> \n  <li>Yahoo! Mail</li> \n  <li>ProtonMail</li> \n  <li>iCloud Mail</li> \n  <li>GMX Mail</li> \n  <li>Mozilla Thunderbird</li> \n  <li>Yandex Mail</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Gmail</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Native File Collaboration</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en-GB\">Sign up here</a>.</h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> anyone who already uses and loves the rest of Google's products.</p> \n<p>It might seem like an obvious top pick, but Gmail is just too versatile to not award the first slot. Gmail has the second-highest email provider market share (behind Apple iPhone's native email app), according to <a href=\"https://emailclientmarketshare.com/\">Litmus Labs</a>. And ironically, one of the reasons Gmail has become so popular is because of all the communication options in your inbox that don't involve email.</p> \n<p>Gmail is an everyday email inbox you can sign up for by registering for a Google account. But it's built into Google Suite, a group of free apps that allow you to chat, video-conference, and share files with the people in your contact list.</p> \n<p>Google Hangouts, available from your inbox's left sidebar (or the right -- you can customize how you inbox is displayed), lets you text and video chat with other Gmail users for the things that might not warrant an email message. Like most other email accounts today, Gmail also has an intuitive calendar where you can set meetings and reminders.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can also use a free product like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/schedule-meeting\">HubSpot Meetings</a> to easily schedule meetings without back-and-forth emails.</p> \n<p>Unlike other email accounts, you can use your Gmail address to log into and manage your YouTube account, as well as collaborate on shared documents and spreadsheets right from a cloud-based Google Drive.</p> \n<p>Offering a generous 15 GB of free email storage, Gmail does everything it can to make your inbox less chaotic, including advanced filters that automatically push emails into separate folders as they arrive. And none of these functions costs a dime.</p> \n<h3>2. AOL</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Unlimited Storage</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://login.aol.com/\">Sign up here</a>.</h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> people who use email for most of their communication.</p> \n<p>America Online (I feel nostalgic just typing those words) has quietly kept up with today's standards for a good user experience. The classic AOL is now once again one of the best free email accounts available to you.</p> \n<p>Purchased by Verizon in 2015, AOL delivers you email from its classic news-driven homepage, and comes with the contemporary spam filters and virus protection you'd expect from your email provider. You can also<a href=\"https://help.aol.com/articles/one-click-messaging-in-your-aol-mail-inbox-video\"> </a><a href=\"https://help.aol.com/articles/one-click-messaging-in-your-aol-mail-inbox-video\">send text and instant messages</a> from specific windows in your email inbox.</p> \n<p>AOL does have something over Gmail, though: unlimited storage. Additionally, you can import email contacts from a CSV, TXT, or LDIF file so you're not creating your \"buddy list\" (get it?) from scratch.</p> \n<h3>3. Outlook</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Multiple App Integrations</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://outlook.live.com/owa/\">Sign up here</a>.</h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Email client</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> people who use many different platforms to connect with others.</p> \n<p>If you ever cringed at the sight of a \"Hotmail.com\" email address, you can thank Outlook for this outdated domain name. But there's good news: Microsoft has reinvented its longstanding email service, and your free Outlook.com email address has many progressive features waiting for you.</p> \n<p>While it touts a calendar and message filter that is similar to Gmail, Outlook also integrates with a number of other popular communication apps. You can connect Skype, Facebook, PowerPoint, PayPal, and even task-management software such as Trello -- making it very easy to reach and work with non-Outlook users without leaving your inbox.</p> \n<p>Outlook offers 15 GB of free storage for each user, along with a super-clean interface.</p> \n<h3>4. Zoho</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: 25 Business Addresses</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/mail/\">Sign up here</a>.</h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> startups and small businesses.</p> \n<p>This is the first of the lesser-known free email accounts to make our list, but it holds a lot of potential for businesses.</p> \n<p>The first thing you'll notice about Zoho is its user-friendliness. From integrating with Google Drive, Box, and other cloud-based file managers, to its built-in task manager, this email service offers a simple way to accomplish all of your daily tasks.</p> \n<p>The real difference-maker, though, is the ability to<a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/complete-guide-to-setup-zohomail.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/complete-guide-to-setup-zohomail.html\">customize the domain name</a> for up to 25 connected email addresses. Want to replace \"@zoho.com\" with the name of your business's website? You can do so under Zoho Lite, which gives you 5 GB for free -- all under username@yourdomainname.com.</p> \n<h3>5. Mail.com</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: 200 Custom Domain Names</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://www.mail.com/\">Sign up here</a>.</h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> small businesses, freelancers, and the self-employed.</p> \n<p>It doesn't get more self-explanatory than \"Mail.com,\" does it? This email provider knows its audience -- or should I say, audiences.</p> \n<p>Right off the bat, you'll probably notice Mail.com doesn't have stellar storage space compared to the options above: only 2 GB. But what this webmail service lacks in gigabytes it makes up for with … drumroll …<a href=\"https://www.mail.com/email/#.509574-stage-link1-2\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.mail.com/email/#.509574-stage-link1-2\">200 free custom domain names</a>. You can replace \"@mail.com\" at the end of your username with just about anything that describes you. Here are some options Mail.com has precreated for you to choose from:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Bartender.net</li> \n <li>Musician.org</li> \n <li>Columnist.com</li> \n <li>Engineer.com</li> \n <li>Accountant.com</li> \n <li>Toothfairy.com (who knew she was online?)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Mail.com doesn't rest on its 200 laurels, though, as the email provider also comes with a calendar for creating and tracking your events each week.</p> \n<h3>6. Yahoo! Mail</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Media and attachment history</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://login.yahoo.com/account/create?specId=yidReg\">Sign up here.</a></h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> creatives and those who send and receive attachments frequently via email.</p> \n<p>Yahoo! Mail, another well-known platform, sits just behind AOL in storage space with a whopping 1 TB (that's a <em>terabyte</em>) for free, along with a few key social media integrations.</p> \n<p>In addition to custom background themes and being able to search key information from your inbox, Yahoo! Mail also makes it easy to find every photo, video, and document you've ever attached or received via email in their own tabs on your inbox's sidebar. This makes the platform especially appealing to those who share documents on a regular basis or simply want an album made of every photo they've ever had shared.</p> \n<h3>7. ProtonMail</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Encrypted email</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/signup\">Sign up here.</a></h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> people who send and receive sensitive information.</p> \n<p>ProtonMail offers just 500 MB of free space, but for the worthy trade of <em>encrypted</em> email, allowing you to send messages that nobody else can see, and disappear after a month.</p> \n<p>What's the catch? Is the service hard to use? As with most webmail platforms, ProtonMail is easy to use on any device without any software needed to encrypt your emails. Its inbox interface is as easy to understand at a glance as the other email services on this list, and offers quick color-coded labels to help you further organize which emails deserve the most care and protection.</p> \n<h3>8. iCloud Mail</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Label senders as VIPs</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/\">Sign up here.</a></h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> people who use Mac and want everything on one system.</p> \n<p>If you’re a Mac user, you may want to consider using iCloud Mail as your email provider. Their free email account comes with 5GB of storage that you can use to sync your photos, files, or email. It’s important to note that storage is shared between all of your apps and devices — so if you take a lot of photos on your iPhone, you may eat into your email storage allowance for the month. Upgraded plans start at $0.99/month and go up to $9.99/month.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using iCloud over other email providers on this list is the ease of integration. Apple builds its desktop and iPhone mail apps with all email clients in mind, but it pays special attention to making the experience delightful for iCloud users.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some of the pros of iCloud Mail include an easy to use search functionality, easy-to-use rules, and an ability to label senders as VIP. When a contact is marked as VIP, new messages will automatically filter to a separate tab on the left, saving you both time and energy.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>9. GMX Mail</h3> \n<h4>Unique Feature: Alias email addresses</h4> \n<h5><a href=\"https://www.gmx.com/mail/create-email-address/\">Sign up here.</a></h5> \n<p><strong>Type of email:</strong> Webmail</p> \n<p><strong>Who should use it:</strong> people who need multiple emails with one central inbox.<br><br>While you may not have heard of GMX Mail, it’s been around for quite a while (since 1997) — and it has a bunch of features that make it worth considering. First off, GMX offers 65GB of storage. That’s a lot of storage for a free email service. In fact, they claim that allows you to keep nearly half a million messages in your Inbox!<br><br>Another feature worth noting is the ability to send large attachments. While many services have caps for your email attachments, GMX Mail allows you to send files up to 50GB. That’s great if you share a ton of photos, presentations, or other large files from your account. <br><br>But the feature of GMX Mail that really sets it apart is the ability to set up to 10 alias email addresses all from within one account. This can be useful in many situations — both personally and professionally. On a personal note, you could use one alias for all of your online purchases and logins — to keep marketing emails separate from your personal messages. From a business perspective, multiple email addresses can be useful for managing role based emails such as support@yourdomain.com or sales@yourdomain.com.</p> \n<h3>10.

Perhaps you had to plug data from one system into another or rewrite the same content over and over again to ensure it was in multiple locations.</p> \n<p>Although few people have the time or patience for this type of tedious work, it’s common and often critical to your business’s success — these mundane tasks need to get done.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>What if there was a way to connect your software to the applications you use in a way that successfully brings them together? This would mean all of your information and data would live in a central location with no manual entry required, even if those applications don’t actually come with the software itself … sound nice?</p> \n<p>Well, good news! This type of solution exists … it’s called an <strong>integration</strong>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<p>Integrations are a complex topic to understand. So, let’s simplify the concept with the help of an analogy we can reference throughout this guide.</p> \n<p>Let’s pretend you want to plug your MacBook laptop into your TV using a connector cable so you can watch reruns of Friends on Netflix on the big screen. And integration kind of works like this — I’ll explain more as we go.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/hubspot.com/drawings/d/svOKAAijuEee1UcTkqY-knQ/image?parent=1xU9AVbjLRDDV78t5W6AdknVJodSYBCEmypuNSfrElCk&amp;rev=68&amp;h=110&amp;w=616&amp;ac=1\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"applications integration example\">\n</div> \n<a></a> \n<p>Back to our analogy: If your <strong>software</strong> is your laptop, you’ll use a connector cable, or <strong>integration</strong>, to then watch Friends on the TV, or <strong>application</strong>.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/hubspot.com/drawings/d/srHPCIh1I_ca6aV951yxUfQ/image?parent=1xU9AVbjLRDDV78t5W6AdknVJodSYBCEmypuNSfrElCk&amp;rev=132&amp;h=125&amp;w=624&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"example of an integration\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Now, let’s run through some commonly asked questions about integrations to help you get a better grasp on what they are, how they work, and why your company needs them.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Why use integrations?</h3> \n<p>Integrations solve and simplify your need for new software as your business grows and evolves. They allow you to keep the system you’re currently using by simply adding connections to third-party applications to enhance system functionality and provide additional features you may need but aren’t able to build within your software. You can keep your current laptop and TV, and simply use the connector cable to watch Friends on the big screen.</p> \n<p>By leveraging integration connections across your systems, you can <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/business-analytics?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=business_analytics_course\">power your business</a> to achieve a much wider range of tasks on your software as you enhance its functionality. This is especially helpful as your business expands since your needs are bound to change.</p> \n<p>Although your software may have the functionality you need when you start your business, you’re likely going to want additional applications to provide the features you end up needing later on, as you grow.</p> \n<p>There are many types of integrations, each of which has specific functions to help meet different needs. The easiest way to think about the various types of integrations is by category. Some integrations have several functions, meaning they could technically fit into many categories because they serve more than one main purpose. Other integrations have one specific function.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Who needs integrations?</h3> \n<p>Integrations are helpful tools for virtually every business, no matter the size or industry. There are integrations suited for every type of company (startups, SMBs, and enterprise companies) with any purpose (advertising, analytics, or content).</p> \n<p>If you sell software, as <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">we do at HubSpot</a>, you’ll find yourself not only using connections for your internal software but also for your customers to use along with your software. This is because your software may not have every feature and function your customers need to run their business. So, by adding an integration, they’ll get that added feature or function while continuing to use your software.</p> \n<p>Referring back to our analogy, without the integration, or connector cable, your laptop wouldn’t be able to communicate with your TV to allow you to watch Friends on the big screen. You need that integration, or cable, to allow for added functionality and watch the show on TV — without it, this wouldn’t be possible.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>How do you get integrations?</h3> \n<p>Integrations are almost always located in some type of marketplace, where customers can review and browse all of their options. The <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations\">Hu</a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">bSpot App Marketplace</a> is an example of this. Our marketplace allows visitors to search and learn more about the various integrations and their functions, and then connect HubSpot to their integration of choice.</p> \n<p>(No, you can’t go to Best Buy to pick up your integration as you would with your connector cable to watch Friends on your TV… you’re right, the example doesn’t quite work here.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>How do integrations work with APIs?</h3> \n<p>API stands for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/8341/a-marketer-s-guide-to-apis.aspx?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">application programming interface</a>. An API is an interface that software uses to receive information (whether that’s data, servers, applications, etc.).</p> \n<p>All of the integrations we’re going to discuss below are built on APIs. By building integrations on APIs, you can connect your integrations to your software and use them in tandem with one another. The integration allows for the flow of information to and from apps and devices in real-time — APIs allow them to talk to one another.</p> \n<p>Think about this in terms of our analogy from above: The application is the TV, the programming allows your laptop to communicate with the TV, and the interface is how you (the user) are able to interact with the application (by watching Friends on your TV). In this example, the API is the port on the side of your laptop in which you actually insert your integration (the cable) to then connect your laptop to your TV.</p> \n<h3>Integration vs. iPaaS Solution</h3> \n<p>If you’ve heard of integrations before, chances are you’ve also heard about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ipaas-guide?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">iPaaS, or Integration Platform as a Service</a>. The difference between the two is an important distinction to make when determining which one you need for your business. While an integration is a one-to-one, direct connection solution, an iPaaS solution is <em>not</em>.</p> \n<p>Instead, iPaaS is a cloud-based platform that connects your applications and systems — whether that’s in the cloud or on-premise — between an organization and third-party software <em>without</em> the use of middleware.</p> \n<p>So, if you look for an integration solution on your software’s marketplace and don’t find the connection you’re looking for, then you’d turn to an iPaaS solution to solve your need for that connection. There are a few integrations available today (called “connector integrations”, which we’ll look at an example of below) that can help you build custom integrations..</p> \n<p>So, which integrations should you actually use? Let’s look at a list of some of the most popular integrations available.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Popular Integrations</h2> \n<p>The following integrations are categorized by business need to help you browse through your options. (Almost all of these integrations fit into multiple categories, as they have functions that allow them to do multiple things. Below, we placed them in the category they’re best suited for.)</p> \n<p>It’s important to note these are just <em>some</em> of today’s popular integrations — there are hundreds of more integrations to learn about and choose from as your business grows.</p> \n<p>The list we’ve compiled below is of integrations that connect with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">HubSpot</a>. This isn’t to say these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-platform-update-q1-2019\">HubSpot integrations</a> don’t also work with other software. In fact, most of these integrations <em>are</em> compatible with dozens of programs in addition to HubSpot.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look.</p> \n<h3>Advertising Integrations</h3> \n<p>Advertising integrations help you market to and reach your target audience.

The AdRoll integration gives you the opportunity to create personalized retargeting ads for different lead segments in your HubSpot contacts. You can personalize several parts of the ads, such as content and formatting, that will best relate to your prospect.</p> \n<p>This allows you to focus on your audience’s attributes so you can effectively reach your prospects — you can gather intricate details about your prospects from your CRM via the integration so you’re able to successfully retarget them.</p> \n<h4>3. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instapage?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">Instapag</a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instapage\">e</a></h4> \n<p>If you’re not a developer, creating your website’s landing page might sound like an overwhelming task. The Instapage integration provides a straightforward option for anyone who wants to create and personalize their landing page and then send lead information straight to HubSpot.

ABM integrations help you leverage your account and audience data so you can tailor your messaging, CTAs, and marketing strategies to close deals and attract customers.</p> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/orgcharthub?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">OrgChartHub</a></h4> \n<p>The OrgChartHub integration allows you to efficiently build customer organization charts without ever leaving HubSpot. You can create customer organization charts while in HubSpot so you’re able to easily identify unknown contacts, visualize key stakeholders, and customize your sales personas without manually sending any of this information back and forth.</p> \n<h4>2. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/calibermind?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">CaliberMind</a></h4> \n<p>With the CaliberMind integration, you’ll be able to look at your cross-channel account engagement and create alerts for your reps about which deals they should focus on closing to meet quota. The integration takes your contacts directly from HubSpot and automatically matches them to their associated accounts so you don’t have to.</p> \n<h4>3. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/metadata?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">Metadata</a></h4> \n<p>The Metadata integration provides account-based advertising services.

Your contact’s information and details about the call will be recorded in HubSpot for easy access. This also provides sales reps and support team members with the necessary background information to assist the prospect or customer appropriately.</p> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/uberconference?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609\">UberConference</a></h4> \n<p>With UberConference, it takes just seconds to schedule your meetings with colleagues and prospective customers so you can focus on tasks that require more attention.

For example, <a href=\"https://webmasterradio.fm/episode/seo-101-ep-350-seo-for-image-search-domain-authority-javascript-and-seo\">episode 350</a> goes over image search, the validity of Moz's Domain Authority score, and JavaScript and SEO.</p> \n<p>It's a good pick if you're just getting your feet wet.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://www.evolvingseo.com/category/podcast/\">Experts on the Wire</a></h3> \n<p>On this podcast, SEO expert and consultant Dan Shure interviews big names and fresh faces in search. Former guests include AJ Kohn, Dawn Anderson, Marie Haynes, Barry Schwartz, Kevin Indig, and more. And as that lineup suggests, Experts on the Wire covers a diverse range of topics — from mobile-first indexing and structured data to unique link-building strategies and even SEO for the music industry.</p> \n<p>The episodes typically run an hour to an hour and a half. There are currently more than 110 in the archive, so if you enjoy this show, you've got a lot to listen to.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-authority-hacker-podcast/id1073349789\">Authority Hacker</a></h3> \n<p>Is SEO just one piece of the puzzle for you? Authority Hacker might be the podcast for you. The hosts, Gael Breton and Mark Webster, draw heavily on their own experiences running effective online businesses.</p> \n<p>You'll learn how to drive traffic to your store or website, nurture those visitors, and convert them into customers. Breton and Webster drop tons of SEO nuggets, but there's also lots of general advice, like how to hire a solid team, pick an expanding niche, or set your own salary.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>SEO Newsletters</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.kevin-indig.com/tech-bound/\">Tech Bound</a></h3> \n<p>I'm always excited to see a fresh edition of Kevin Indig's Tech Bound newsletter in my inbox.</p> \n<p>Each week, Indig dissects a trend, idea, or piece of marketing news. To give you an idea, past newsletters have covered Google's push into the online travel agency (OTA) market, how to hire a great digital marketing team, and takeaways from Google's near-constant algorithm tweaks.</p> \n<p>He also shares several links from around the web worth reading.</p> \n<p>Indig has also started doing a lot of interviews (which he shares with the Tech Bound audience weeks before publishing them elsewhere). Previous interviewees include the former Director of SEO for eBay and Nick Eubanks, co-founder of Traffic Think Tank and FromTheFuture (there's some list overlap here!).</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/trending\">SparkToro Trending</a></h3> \n<p>Here's how it goes most weeks:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>10 a.m.: I see a cool link on SparkToro Trending</li> \n <li>11 a.m.: Someone shares the same link in HubSpot's SEO Slack channel</li> \n <li>12 p.m.: I log onto Twitter and see several people I follow have tweeted the same link</li> \n <li>4 p.m.: Someone shares the same link in one of the SEO Slack channels I'm in</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In other words, if something appears on SparkToro's list of buzzy articles or tools, it's usually something I should be reading — which makes sense, as links are algorithmically chosen based on their popularity with the SEO and marketing Twitter community.</p> \n<p>If you don't want to get addicted to refreshing Trending, subscribe to the email newsletter. You'll get the top links in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://nickleroy.com/newsletter/\">#SEOForLunch</a></h3> \n<p>#SEOForLunch, a weekly newsletter from Nick LeRoy, has a great format. LeRoy shares a timely link, tells you what's important about said article, then gives you his take.</p> \n<p>Following that, he recommends four to five posts from around the web worth your time.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://tldrmarketing.com/\">tl;dr Marketing</a></h3> \n<p>In newsletter years, tl;dr Marketing has definitely been around a while — this one's been going strong since 2015. It's a curated collection of articles and resources that's perfect if you're short on time: each link has a straightforward explanation tagged by topic, so if you're not interested in, say, social media, you can skip over anything with that tag.</p> \n<p>Absorb information best when you've got some visuals? Good news, there's plenty of screenshots in tl;dr.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>SEO Courses</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/build-search-insights-report\">How to Build a Search Insights Report to Grow Organic Traffic to Your Blog</a></h3> \n<p>Want to learn how to recreate the process that helped HubSpot grow organic traffic to its blog by several million users per month in just a year? In this Academy course, I'll walk you through the exact workflow we use, sharing examples and actionable tips along the way.</p> \n<p>It's broken up into two sections: the fundamentals of an effective content strategy, and building your own Search Insights Report.</p> \n<p>Each lesson includes a few interactive exercises, making the process of putting together a Search Insights Report for your own property much simpler and more straightforward.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/seo-training\">SEO Training</a></h3> \n<p>For a higher-level intro to SEO, try HubSpot's free SEO course.</p> \n<p>It takes a little over an hour and a half to complete. In that time, you'll discover how to determine your site's SEO potential and develop a strategy, create content that'll rank, and build links to that content.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://academy.serpstat.com/\">Serpstat Academy</a></h3> \n<p>You don't need to use Serpstat's SEO platform to take any of its short courses, which include Advanced Competitor Research, Backlink Analysis, How to Cold Pitch SEO courses, and more. While most of the lessons incorporate Serpstat, you can easily recreate the processes in the tool of your own choice.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/\">Google Analytics Academy</a></h3> \n<p>If you're in SEO, you're almost certainly using Google Analytics. Google provides several different courses for getting yourself up to speed or taking your skills to the next level:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6\">Google Analytics for Beginners</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/7\">Advanced Google Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/9\">Google Analytics for Power Users</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/8\">Getting Started With Google Analytics 360</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Successfully completing these courses will earn you certifications, which will boost your application during the job search.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://academy.moz.com/\">Moz Academy</a></h3> \n<p>Each of Moz's 16 paid courses cover a different fundamental aspect of SEO: local SEO, reporting, on-page optimization, backlinks, keyword research, etc. The price of each course ranges from $49 (SEO fundamentals) to $595 (also SEO fundamentals, but with a certificate for completion).</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/newacademy/\">SEMrush Academy</a></h3> \n<p>Like the other options on our list, SEMrush offers both courses and certifications. The cool thing about the latter? If you don't want to take the course before getting certified, you can take the exam immediately. This is a fun way of testing your knowledge in different areas of SEO — especially if you're preparing for an upcoming interview.</p> \n<p>But back to the courses. Along with the usual suspects of topics (keyword research, link building, rank tracking, and so on), SEMrush also has courses on social media fundamentals, reporting and project management, and PPC.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/u/\">DistilledU</a></h3> \n<p>Distilled's online \"SEO university\" encompasses two courses: an intro to SEO course that covers topics like information architecture, competitive research, and on-page SEO, and an intermediate one that goes over Excel skills, HTML, international SEO, and more.</p> \n<p>Examples and exercises are weaved in throughout the videos, which makes the content more engaging and sticky.</p> \n<p>Access costs $33 to $44 per month, depending on your plan. That might sound steep (especially considering many of the other courses on this list are free), but you also get to see every presentation given at SearchLove events — a well-regarded series Distilled runs. It's like a conference ticket that never expires.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>SEO Blogs</strong></h2> \n<p>Starting my career in blogging may have biased me, but blogs are by far my favorite way to keep up on SEO trends, new strategies, and interesting case studies.</p> \n<p>For better or for worse, there's far more <em>great </em>content out there than you could possibly read — even if you did nothing else. Below are my favorite blogs (but please keep in mind, just because one isn't on this list doesn't mean it's unworthy of your time):</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/\">Search Engine Land</a></h3> \n<p>Whenever I'm looking for \"breaking news\" in the SEO world, I head to Search Engine Land. This website always has the latest information on all things search, from algorithm updates (both confirmed and unconfirmed) to Google My Business updates and DuckDuckGo changes.</p> \n<p>There's also a good mix of evergreen content and opinion pieces.</p> \n<p>One last note: You know a site is great when its founder decides to move on — and <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/video-danny-sullivan-google-public-liaison-of-search-on-his-transition-from-search-engine-land-to-google-324855\">take a job as Google's Public Search Liaison</a>.

Several posts are published each day — typically one more timely article, such as <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-chrome-speed-badges/335261/\">\"Chrome May Warn Users of Slow Pages Before They Click,\"</a> and two or three evergreen pieces, like <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/website-bounce-rate/332439/\">\"11 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate.\"</a></p> \n<p>Recommended articles:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-choose-domain-name/252285/\">How to Choose a Domain Name That Will Stand the Test of Time</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-guide/search-authority/\">The Three Pillars of SEO: Authority, Relevance, and Trust</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/seo-experts/\">140 Top SEO Experts You Should Be Following in 2019</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/\">Search Engine Roundtable</a></h3> \n<p>Barry Schwartz — who also contributes frequently to SEJ — runs this forum coverage site. What does \"forum coverage\" mean? Schwartz reports on the most relevant, interesting SEO discussions happening around the web.</p> \n<p>And it's not just a recap. He connects the conversation to a larger trend or idea, so you always understand how it fits into the big picture.</p> \n<p>There are also lots of fun pictures from the Google offices (it's nice to remember there are people behind the algorithm!).</p> \n<p>Recommended articles:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/vlog-025-28514.html\">Vlog #25: Danny Sullivan On Working At Google &amp; What He Sees Differently Now</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/vlog-022-28447.html\">Vlog #22: Eric Enge On SEO Testing, Structuring Content &amp; Managing Client Expectations</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/google-bert-no-optimization-28435.html\">Google: There Is Nothing To Optimize For With BERT</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/resources/\">Distilled.net</a></h3> \n<p>Distilled, an online marketing agency, has a reputation for running a fantastic advanced SEO conference where every session is valuable and fresh — and its blog is no different.</p> \n<p>From in-depth posts on technical SEO best practices and tool tutorials to thoughtful opinion pieces, Distilled's blog is a gold mine.</p> \n<p>Recommended articles:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/technical-seo-audit-checklist/\">Comprehensive Technical SEO Audit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/difference-between-url-structure-and-information-architecture/\">Search basics: the difference between URL structure and Information Architecture</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/how-to-present-recommendations/\">How to Present a Recommendation</a> (these tips completely changed how I deliver recommendations both at HubSpot and with freelance clients!)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/\">Blind Five Year Old</a></h3> \n<p>I try to read everything written by AJ Kohn, owner of SEO agency Blind Five Year Old. It's just that good. His posts are thought-provoking, insightful, and meaty. As if that weren't enough, he's funny!</p> \n<p>Kohn doesn't publish too often — probably because each post is typically a mini-thesis — so I recommend going through the archives and then making sure you keep up with his new stuff.</p> \n<p>Recommended articles:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/algorithm-analysis-in-the-age-of-embeddings\">Algorithm Analysis in the Age of Embeddings</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/the-invisible-attribution-model-of-link-acquisition\">The Invisible Attribution Model of Link Acquisition</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/analyzing-position-in-google-search-console\">Analyzing Position in Google Search Console</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog\">Moz</a></h3> \n<p>Who <em>hasn't </em>cut their teeth on the Moz blog? It's a classic for a reason. Imagine you're in a meeting with your developers, and they hit you with a question about hreflang tags. You have no idea what an hreflang tag is — sounds like an unsuccessful sneeze — but you also know this is a tough crowd, and if you're clueless, you'll lose valuable internal capital.</p> \n<p>So you quickly search \"what are hreflang tags\", find a Moz post, skim it, and glean enough in 15 seconds to look up and announce confidently, \"Yes, we should use hreflang tags to help users searching in different languages find the localized pages on our site.\"</p> \n<p>That's what Moz content does: it saves the day when you need to know something, ASAP. In addition to clear, comprehensive, trustworthy content, you should also check out Whiteboard Fridays.

If you're a member of several active groups, you might be overwhelmed by all the information and discussion. I'd recommend being an active participant in one or two groups versus a somewhat silent member of three or four.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techseowomen\">Women in Tech SEO</a></h3> \n<p>I'm a member — and ardent supporter — of the Women in Tech SEO Slack group. Areej Abuali, the founder and leader, does a great job leading virtual meetups, moderating conversations, and keeping the group active.</p> \n<p>Channels include Coding, Events, Analytics, Jobs, and Motivation.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://trafficthinktank.com/\">Traffic Think Tank</a></h3> \n<p>Traffic Think Tank is a private community of SEOs that's available for a monthly or yearly fee. The content is designed to more than pay for itself — in addition to a network of marketers, consultants, and business leaders, you also get access to Q&amp;As and webinars with the founders, as well as 300+ hours of tutorials, templates, and other resources.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://onlinegeniuses.com/\">Online Geniuses</a></h3> \n<p>This free SEO and marketing-focused community has more than 20,000 members. That scale can be both overwhelming and invaluable — while you may need to log off every now and again, the size means you can join local events, learn from hundreds of other people with your job title or facing similar challenges, and participate in AMAs with the likes of Nir Eyal and Guy Kawasaki.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>SEO Subreddits</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/\">/BigSEO</a></h3> \n<p>More than 43,000 people belong to this subreddit, which, despite the name, encourages discussion and debate about all things inbound marketing. However, I've noticed most people tend to stick to SEO.</p> \n<p>The most popular posts get anywhere between 20 and 300 comments; not bad for a more niche subreddit. While the quality of the advice can vary (as you'd expect from any open community), <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/wiki/amas\">the AMAs</a> are consistently excellent. Previous guests include Rand Fishkin, Aleyda Solis, and Bill Slawski.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/\">/TechSEO</a></h3> \n<p>TechSEO is far smaller than /BigSEO, hovering around 6,500 members. Its focus is \"the tech nerd side of SEO.\"</p> \n<p>This subreddit also hosts a lot of AMAs. There's some overlap with the guests on /BigSEO; however, /TechSEO has also gotten <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TechSEO/collection/07fc4c2c-c580-4cc0-86cf-5cdec9c45508\">Alexis Sanders, Gary Illyes, and John Meuller</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're looking for a good place to find and share technical resources, ask advanced questions, and learn from the tech SEO greats, join this subreddit.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO\">/SEO</a></h3> \n<p>At 113,000 subscribers, /SEO is the largest subreddit of the group. That's both a blessing and a curse: the typical posts gets more engagement, but there's more misinformation.</p> \n<p>/SEO does not host official AMAs, although occasionally someone will do an impromptu one (like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/ahuzme/ama_seod_a_site_from_0mo_to_30000mo_in_earnings/\">AMA: SEO'd a site from $0/mo to $30,000/mo in earnings within 3 years</a>).</p> \n<p>Newer SEOs will get the most out of this subreddit.</p> \n<p>I hope this helps you as you continue to learn more about SEO.

I'm still allowing myself to check out friends' posts, or post my own content, via my desktop. I just don't want it within easy reach on my phone.</p> \n<p>If you'd prefer to post your Instagram content from a computer, you're in luck. Here, we'll explore how you can post images and videos from your desktop computer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>Can I post to Instagram from my computer?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, you can post to Instagram from your PC or Mac desktop, as well as a browser on your phone instead of in-app.</p> \n<p>Instagram doesn't offer an official desktop desktop version, however. The social platform is primarily meant to be consumed in-app, which means some features can be a little trickier from your computer.</p> \n<p>Having said that, it's absolutely possible to post to Instagram from your computer. There are a few different reasons you might want to do this — for one, if you work as your company's social media manager, it might be easier to upload company posts and videos via your desktop, rather than having your smartphone open at work.</p> \n<p>Plus, your company's files might be more easily accessible via desktop than mobile. For instance, if you use Photoshop to edit company photos, it's likely easier to click \"Upload\" from your desktop when you're done editing, rather than sending that same photo or video to your personal phone.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you simply prefer the larger screen of desktop. Or, maybe you don't have access to a smartphone so you can't download the app on your phone.</p> \n<p>Whatever the reason, don't worry — there's a solution for you. Let's dive into that, next.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do I post to Instagram from my computer? [PC and Mac]</strong></h2> \n<h3>How to Post a Photo on Chrome Browser</h3> \n<p><strong>1.

Use \"The Basic Shared Content Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[ARTICLE TITLE]: http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag by @TwitterHandle</em></h4> \n<p>This go-to tweet style is the easiest to execute, but many times, people forget to include a relevant hashtag and the author's Twitter handle. The hashtag could get your tweet more exposure to people following that hashtag. And always credit your information source (the author or the site you got the post from) on social media. It'll show appreciation to the original content creator -- and they might return the favor by sharing some of your content with their followers.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;12 Tweet Formulas to Get You Started on Twitter: <a href=\"http://hub.am/Sgsvt5\">http://hub.am/Sgsvt5</a> #twittertips by @HubSpot</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Try \"The Shared Content Tweet With Commentary\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[YOUR OPINION]&nbsp;&gt; [ARTICLE TITLE]: http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag by @TwitterHandle</em></h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[ARTICLE TITLE]: http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag by @TwitterHandle &gt; [YOUR OPINION]</em></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like the basic shared content tweet, this tweet includes the article title (or a shortened version), a relevant hashtag, and the author's Twitter handle. But in addition, you'll add your opinion -- whether it's a quick \"+1\" or something a little more in-depth. Something personal like that might&nbsp;increase engagement rate with your tweet.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>Bookmarking this. &gt; 12 Tweet Formulas to Get You Started on Twitter: <a href=\"http://hub.am/Sgsvt5\" class=\"twitter-timeline-link\">http://hub.am/Sgsvt5</a> #twittertips by&nbsp;<span>@HubSpot</span></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Retweet With Commentary</h3> \n<p>Typically, when you want to retweet someone's tweet, you'll simply click the retweet button and share the content with your followers. But if you want to&nbsp;know <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27675/How-to-Retweet-the-Right-Way-in-4-Easy-Steps.aspx\">how to retweet</a> with a little flavor, we're going to show you. There are two ways to add commentary to a retweet: using the \"retweet with comment\" feature or composing&nbsp;a new tweet and publishing it manually.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">a) Using the \"retweet with comment\" feature.</h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[YOUR OPINION]</em> #hashtag</h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">[EMBEDDED ORIGINAL TWEET]</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The \"retweet with comment\" feature allows you to embed an original tweet within your own message, and then comment on it in up to 116 characters. To do this,&nbsp;click the retweet icon at the bottom of the tweet.&nbsp;In the window that appears, add your comment to the \"Add a Comment\" section (and include a hashtag, if you so desire).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Example:</strong></p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/retweet-with-comment.png?width=568&amp;name=retweet-with-comment.png\" alt=\"retweet-with-comment.png\" title=\"retweet-with-comment.png\" width=\"568\">\n<br>   \n<p>(For more details on how this feature works, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27675/How-to-Retweet-the-Right-Way-in-4-Easy-Steps.aspx\">read this blog post</a>.)</p> \n<h4>b) Manually retweeting with commentary.</h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[YOUR OPINION]</em> #hashtag<em> - RT @TwitterHandle [ARTICLE TITLE] - http://url.com&nbsp;</em></h4> \n<p>To retweet with commentary in this way, simply copy and paste the person's tweet into a brand new tweet, preface the tweet with RT @TwitterHandle, and add commentary to the beginning. If you modify their tweet at all (e.g. to make the tweet a bit shorter, allowing more room for your comment), use MT -- which stands for \"modified tweet\" -- instead of RT.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;#7 is important but often forgotten. - RT @mvolpe&nbsp;\"10 Things Great Marketers Do Every Day\"&nbsp;<a class=\"twitter-timeline-link\" title=\"http://hub.am/1m6RPK4\" href=\"http://t.co/GMlxKnnrU5\">http://hub.am/1m6RPK4</a>&nbsp;by @kellykranz</p> \n<h3>4. Use \"The .@TwitterHandle&nbsp;Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>.@TwitterHandle&nbsp;[REST OF TWEET]</em></h4> \n<p>If you put someone's Twitter handle&nbsp;at the very beginning&nbsp;of your tweet, Twitter assumes you're @replying to that person -- so they omit that tweet from&nbsp;showing up on your Twitter followers' feeds. While this is usually a good thing (otherwise, your feed might get taken over by&nbsp;@reply tweets), there may be times when you want your followers to see that tweet on their feeds.&nbsp;To do that, simply add a period right before their Twitter handle.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;.@HubSpot&nbsp;redesigned their blog! Check it out here: <a href=\"http://t.co/xP44vA6vnj\" class=\"link customisable\" title=\"http://blog.hubspot.com\"><span class=\"u-hiddenVisually\">http://blog.hubspot.com</span></a>&nbsp;#webredesign</p> \n<h3>5. Try \"The Problem/Solution Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Don't let your [ASSET] [NEGATIVE RESULT]. Find out how to [GOAL] here: http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag</em></h4> \n<p>Fear is a powerful motivator. Nobody wants to suck, or fail, or flounder, or fall short, or whatever [negative result] you use. And if they do, they want to learn how to remedy the situation, fast -- that's where you can help them. Also, if there's a relevant hashtag you can use here, don't forget to include it!</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Don't let your blog fall into a rut. Find out how to churn out new blog posts quickly:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hub.am/1nD3y5M\">http://hub.am/1nD3y5M</a>&nbsp;#blogging</p> \n<h3>6. Utilize \"The Stat or Fact Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Did you know that [STAT]?&nbsp;http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag</em></h4> \n<p>Don't just find any old data point here -- find something that will really intrigue your target audience. Once they get this little preview, they could want to read the full story to understand (1) why this data point is true, and (2) what they should do about it. Just be sure your statistic is recent and from a reputable source.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>Did you know 6.5% of blog posts are published on the weekends &amp; they get 18% of all social shares? <a href=\"http://hub.am/1otH7QF\">http://hub.am/1otH7QF</a> #blogging</p> \n<h3>7. Tweet \"The Endorsement Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>I loved this article by @TwitterHandle about [TOPIC] - <a href=\"http://url.com\">http://url.com</a>&nbsp;#hashtag</em></h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lots of valuable info on [TOPIC] in this article by @TwitterHandle - http://url.com #hashtag</em></h4> \n<p>This tweet can take many forms, but instead of tweeting a basic shared content tweet, you're adding your endorsement to the tweet and possibly including info on why you enjoyed the piece.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong> I loved this article by @lkolo25 about how to not screw up your landing pages -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hub.am/1p2LQwy\">http://hub.am/1p2LQwy</a>&nbsp;#leadgen</p> \n<h3>8. Embed a SlideShare in a Tweet</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[PRESENTATION&nbsp;TITLE]: http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag by @TwitterHandle</em></h4> \n<p>Did you know you can embed a SlideShare presentation directly into a tweet? That way,&nbsp;your followers can flip through the presentation without ever having to leave Twitter (or the page a tweet is embedded on).</p> \n<p>To embed a SlideShare presentation into a tweet, all you have to do is link to the presentation and it will embed automatically. This is also true for documents and videos from SlideShare as well.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>20 Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn &amp; Pinterest Features You Didn't Know Existed: <a href=\"http://t.co/yLFzTr392P\">http://t.co/yLFzTr392P</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HubSpot\">@HubSpot</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/socialmediatips?src=hash\">#socialmediatips</a></p> — Lindsay Kolowich (@lkolo25) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lkolo25/status/592791212060454912\">April 27, 2015</a>\n</blockquote>   \n<h3>9.&nbsp;Ask a Question in a Tweet</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[QUESTION] #hashtag</em></h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[QUESTION] - http://url.com&nbsp;#hashtag</em></h4> \n<p>Twitter, like all social networks, is a two-way conversion. You should regularly ask your followers questions. These can be tied to an article you've read or could be something a little more random (though still tied to your brand). <strong>Not every tweet needs to drive traffic to a website page.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>What tool do you use to schedule your social media posts? #socialmedia</p> \n<h3>10. Use \"The Tip or Advice Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[YOUR OWN WORDS OF WISDOM] #hashtag&nbsp;</em></h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[QUESTION] #hashtag 1) [ANSWER #1] 2) [ANSWER #2] 3) [ANSWER #3]</em></h4> \n<p>Again, not every tweet needs to drive traffic to a website page -- in fact, tweeting bits of advice that obviously aren't traffic drivers is a great way to build credibility. Tweets like this are retweeted frequently and can get you more engagement and followers, so don't look as a \"sacrifice.\"</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Do you pass reshare test? Be valuable on #socialmedia: 1) Provide information 2) Provide analysis 3) Provide assistance 4) Be entertaining.</p> \n<h3>11. Try \"The Inspiring Quote\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"[QUOTE]\" - @TwitterHandle #quote</em>&nbsp;</h4> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"[QUOTE]\" - [NAME OF PERSON NOT ON TWITTER] #quote</em></h4> \n<p>Everyone loves a daily dose of inspiration! It's difficult to research quotes and find the perfect one, so inspirational quotes are best shared when you randomly come across them and get inspired yourself. So keep your eyes peeled for great quotes, takeaways, data, etc. Just make sure to give credit where it's due!</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong> \"Our time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.\" - Steve Jobs #quote</p> \n<h3>12. Post \"The Photo&nbsp;Tweet\"</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[PHOTO CAPTION] #hashtag [ATTACH PHOTO]</em></h4> \n<p>There are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-variety-social-media\">lots&nbsp;of ways to spice up your tweets with&nbsp;visual content</a>.&nbsp;The simplest of them all is&nbsp;adding a&nbsp;photo to your tweet, using the text part of the tweet as a caption, and sharing that with your followers. This is great for sharing pictures of your office space and employees, or promoting events and webinars.&nbsp;Remember to include any relevant Twitter handles or hashtags.</p> \n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Fantastic shot taken by yours truly from the 2014 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HubSpot\">@HubSpot</a> Inbound Marketing Conference in Boston. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/INBOUND14?src=hash\">#INBOUND14</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/cRufJyTH7n\">pic.twitter.com/cRufJyTH7n</a></p> — David Roberts (@DavidatJDR) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidatJDR/status/534297502342995968\">November 17, 2014</a>\n</blockquote>  \n<h2><strong>Want to share this post?

When many startups in similar industries are founded in one geographic area, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brands need to come up with a name</a> that grasps attention, lightly hints at their mission, differentiates them from competitors, or encourages prospects to learn more about them.</p> \n<p>This is especially true in Australia, which <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/australia-startups\">hosts startups from Sydney to Melbourne</a>. These cities are the founding place of uniquely named startups and major brands like Sukin, Canva, and Billabong.</p> \n<p>While the successful companies listed above have made their names noteworthy and easy to recognize, their company titles only hint at what their brands offer. This is why successful brands like these also lean on taglines to give prospects a quick, clear view of a brand's overall mission or purpose.</p> \n<p>With a great name and an effective tagline, prospects will remember your brand's uniqueness, mission, or what types of products you offer. Then, when they're looking for a product in your industry or space, they might think of your brand's name and catchy tagline.</p> \n<p>If you're working in a busy startup hub like Australia, or are starting a business in an already crowded business landscape, take note of these seven Australian companies with taglines that stand out and set them apart from the competition.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>7 Australian Companies With Great Taglines</h2> \n<h3>\"More than Money\" - National Australian Bank (NAB)</h3> \n<p>During a rebrand in 2016, National Australian Bank changed its tagline from <a href=\"https://www.cmo.com.au/article/603094/nab-ushers-new-brand-promise-widespread-national-campaign/#:~:text=The%20initiative%20is%20the%20first,the%20'break%20up'%20campaign.\">\"More give, less take\" to \"More than money.\"</a></p> \n<p>The new tagline came with a series of commercials led by NAB's agency -- <a href=\"https://www.clemengerbbdo.com.au/\">Clemenger BBDO</a>. Each ad highlighted the bank's history, credibility, and how their financial institution still plays a positive role in impacting countless Australian lives.</p> \n<p>In the ad below -- which was part of the \"More than money\" campaign -- NAB invokes nostalgia by showing home video-like clips that follow a new-born baby as she grows into an adult, as well as the milestones her parents will need to budget for, such as violin lessons, schooling, and travel:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 411px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 73.39%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNAB%2Fvideos%2F1138997696138736%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"411\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.cmo.com.au/article/603094/nab-ushers-new-brand-promise-widespread-national-campaign/#:~:text=The%20initiative%20is%20the%20first,the%20'break%20up'%20campaign.\">interview with CMO</a>, Andrew Knott, NAB's Chief Marketing Officer, said the pivot aimed to be more customer-centric.</p> \n<p>“We felt it was time to move on from what has been a very effective brand expression around fair value, and ‘more give, less take’, to something that’s far more reflective of what we stand for today, but that’s also consistent with our heritage,” Knott explained. “When we are at our best is when we take time to understand customers and understand where they are at in their lives and to help them with the financial aspects of doing so.”</p> \n<p>By linking money to major life milestones, NAB's tagline and campaign effectively place emotion behind logistical offerings. To prospects unsure of where to place their money, the tagline makes the financial institution seem more relatable and potentially more trustworthy than other banks with basic emotionless marketing.</p> \n<h3>\"Life's better in boardshorts.\" - Billabong</h3> \n<p>When it comes to taglines, Billabong keeps there's short and sweet. Knowing that most of its customers are looking for swimwear for surfing, beach vacations, or summer sports, Billabong created a tagline just to remind people how much fun they can have in bathing suits.</p> \n<p>Throughout Billabong's history, it has embraced this tagline in a number of its online and print campaigns. Beginning in 2017, the brand began producing a YouTube surf series with the same phrase as its title. Here's one of its chapters:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcMUQl8OdKA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Billabong's tagline is a great example of how a bold statement in a tagline can persuade a prospect to buy a product to make their lives more enjoyable. But, depending on the prospect who hears it, the tagline could also either play up a sense of vacation-related <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-fomo-work-for-your-ecommerce-company\">FOMO</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/nostalgia-marketing\">seasonal nostalgia</a>.</p> \n<p>For example, if someone lives in a cold climate and hears that life could be better in boardshorts, they might yearn to go surfing somewhere warm. Or, if someone has been working long hours, they might remember a time they spent on the beach as a child. The emotions or memories invoked by this tagline might not convince someone to buy a ticket to a beachy destination. But, if they do go on vacation, Billabong might be the first brand they remember when making beachwear purchases.</p> \n<h3>\"Skincare that doesn't cost the Earth\" - Sukin</h3> \n<p>As a budget-minded, environmentally conscious shopper, I can attest to the fact that it's hard to find environmentally-friendly products that meet your skin's health needs and don't cost a fortune.</p> \n<p>Sukin, a Melbourne-founded skincare brand, aims to solve for the dilemma above, by selling <a href=\"https://sukinnaturals.com/pages/brand-values\">affordable, sustainably produced skin products</a>. It's tagline cleverly reflects this mission with a play on words: \"Skincare that doesn't cost the Earth.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D-1.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D-1.png\" alt=\"sukin skincare that doesn't cost the earth tagline\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Aside from cleverly explaining the brand in just one sentence, Sukin's tagline also lines up well with <a href=\"https://sukinnaturals.com/pages/brand-values\">its overall mission</a>.</p> \n<p>\"Here at Sukin, we're committed to providing skincare that doesn’t cost the earth. This isn’t merely a commitment to creating affordable products, but also with minimal cost to our precious environment. We achieve this by thinking and acting sustainably wherever possible.​ Keep reading for our environmental initiatives,\" <a href=\"https://sukinnaturals.com/pages/brand-values\">Sukin's Brand Values page notes</a>.</p> \n<h3>\"Design anything. Publish anywhere.\" - Canva</h3> \n<p>While Canva seems like a giant global company now, it was once a startup founded in Sydney, Australia.</p> \n<p>For those who haven't used Canva, the website allows individual users or teams to easily create and publish aesthetically-pleasing graphic designs for websites, social media, and other platforms.</p> \n<p>Because Canva is artsy by nature, the brand could've gotten away with an overly creative tagline. But, instead, the company keeps things simple -- but still incredibly effective -- with, <a href=\"https://about.canva.com/\">\"Design anything. Publish anywhere.\"</a></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D.png\" alt=\"canva design anything publish anywhere tagline\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>In just four simple words, Canva describes its <a href=\"https://product.hubspot.com/blog/the-evolution-of-the-hubspot-knowledge-base\">minimum viable product</a> and entices both designers and artistic novices to try its tools.</p> \n<h3>\"Australians Wouldn't Give an XXXX for Anything Else.\" - XXXX</h3> \n<p>Today, XXXX beer's tagline simply reads <a href=\"https://www.xxxx.com.au/\">\"Pride of Queensland.\"</a> But, before the brand became globally known, they had another great tagline that caught attention from Australian masses due to the light curse-related controversy around it.</p> \n<p>For decades, XXXX -- formerly known as Castlemaine XXXX -- embraced Australia's edgy sense of humor and slang with the memorable tagline, \"Australians Wouldn't Give an XXXX for Anything Else.\"</p> \n<p>The tagline, which cleverly uses XXXX to insinuate a four-letter curse word, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2891632/Ad-of-the-week.html#:~:text=Background%20%22Australians%20wouldn't%20give,campaign%20was%20ditched%20in%201996.\">dates back to 1985</a>. At that time, commercials would present a longer, TV-friendly tagline of \"Australians Wouldn't Give a Castlemaine XXXX for Anything Else.\"</p> \n<p>These early commercials often showed rural Australian residents, farmers, and construction workers getting into humorous, but dangerous, situations just to get XXXX beer. After a wild scene, a narrator would read the tagline, insinuating that Australians wouldn't care so much about any other beer. Here's one classic example:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 459px; max-height: 344px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 74.95%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcgkSSQvVQg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Moving into the 1990s, the brand began using the shortened headline to express a more eye-popping message.</p> \n<p>Although the tagline was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2891632/Ad-of-the-week.html#:~:text=Background%20%22Australians%20wouldn't%20give,campaign%20was%20ditched%20in%201996.\">scrapped in a 1996 rebrand</a>, it's still a historically great example of how a company can be cheeky, attention-grabbing, and memorable while still tastefully marketing a product.</p> \n<h3>\"Tastes like Australia.\" - Vegemite</h3> \n<p>For generations, many Australians and Australian visitors have spread on Vegemite on to bread and sandwiches for extra flavor.</p> \n<p>Not only is Vegemite a common snack in Australia, but it's also been featured in global content such as <a href=\"https://media.fandom.com/wiki/Vegemite\">films or TV shows</a> that discuss the continent. And, when people who aren't from Australia see or taste Vegemite, they might ask, \"What is this made of?\"</p> \n<p>Knowing that people link Australian to Vegemite, while also wondering what's in the iconic snack, the brand launched, <a href=\"https://campaignbrief.com/vegemite-launches-first-new-ca/\">\"Tastes like Australia.\"</a> -- a new tagline and commercial in 2018.</p> \n<p>The commercial, which explains the tagline, opens with a confused person wondering how Vegemite is made. A narrator with an Australian accent then presents videos of Australian scenes -- such as sporting events, crocodiles, and destinations -- along with photos of fruit-based ingredients. Ultimately, the ad insinuates that Vegemite is metaphorically made of fruits, vegetables, cheese, and iconic scenes of Australian pride.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/11uyT7tVssE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>\"Find your thing.\" - Redbubble</h3> \n<p>Redbubble is a store chain and online store where people, organizations, or small businesses can sell clothing, art, or other items that might be considered zany, humorous, or unique. When scrolling through the site, you might find T-Shirts with pizza cat memes on them, strangely decorated pottery or pants with sparkles or brightly colored patterns.</p> \n<p>Because you can buy all sorts of unique or funny independently-made treasures on the site, Redbubble keeps its tagline broad -- but still motivating.</p> \n<p>With, \"Find your thing,\" Redbubble insinuates that there's something for everyone on the site. It also embraces that everyone has an independent style and can look to this site for the clothing or items that will allow them to embrace their inner uniqueness.</p> \n<p>Aside from including \"Find Your Thing\" in videos like the one below, Redbubble also includes a <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/shop/find+your+thing\">section with the same name</a> on its website.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHk7SX3E3O4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>\"Find your thing.\" is a great example of how a company with many offerings can create a broad tagline that hints what their company is about without being too vague.</p> \n<h2>Crafting a Great Tagline</h2> \n<p>If you've been inspired to change or create your own tagline, here are a few themes you can take from the Australian examples above:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> You don't need to be vague or overly clever to persuade someone to check out your brand. Sometimes, simply reiterating your MVP -- as Canva does -- is effective enough to win over an audience.</li> \n <li><strong>Be Bold:</strong> Is your company or product known by locals, award-winning, or potentially iconic. If so, you can try incorporating your company or product achievements into a bold phrase, like Vegemite's \"Tastes like Australia.\"</li> \n <li><strong>Get clever: </strong>If you can't cram your entire mission into a short concise phrase, consider using an easily recognized metaphor or play on words, like Sukin's \"Skincare that doesn't cost the Earth.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Want to learn more about brainstorming and crafting catchy taglines or slogans, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-brand-slogan-video\">this helpful guide</a> or download the free resource below.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faustralian-taglines&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 12:23:35 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8251a9af44ea5979d5b14afcf633e3b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D-1.png?width=600&name=7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-49-233_c979156d20b5414e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D.png?width=600&name=7%20Australian%20Companies%20with%20Great%20Taglines%20%5B+What%20Marketers%20Can%20Learn%20From%20Them%5D.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-08-284_bbf42e6d54519408.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faustralian-taglines&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn54@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-09-972_391d3d384769fa4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624891},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"The 8 Types of Social Media Community Managers (+ Job Descriptions)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-social-media-manager-job-description","description":"<p>In the last decade, the need for social media managers has boomed. According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, this trend is not slowing down any time soon.</p> \n<p>The role of a social media manager or specialist is categorized within the \"Advertising, Promotions, and Marketing Manager\" sector of the labor force, which is projected to <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/advertising-promotions-and-marketing-managers.htm\">grow by 10% before 2026</a>.</p> \n<p>Although more companies are hiring social media community managers, the role hasn't evolved much towards goal-oriented, metrics-driven marketing. This could be because many companies haven't figured out the right way to measure the ROI of their efforts. Because of this, they don't know how to hire someone who can help them drive real business results.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ready-to-use-marketing-job-descriptions\">Download a ready-made job description for the social media manager role here.</a></h3> \n<p>With little focus on bottom-line social media efforts, companies relegate the social media role to people with little experience. Once hired, those social media specialists aren't ready to lead successful goal-oriented efforts.</p> \n<p>While a social media job might center around posting strategies, companies should broaden their search and look for experts who are also creative or strategic. Here's an example of what a strong job description for a social media role might look like:</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>A strong social media manager should have versatile skills that span from copywriting to design, but each type of social role usually requires a primary focus or expertise.</p> \n<p>If you're a manager trying to hire your next social media maven, it's important to identify how your company needs to grow first. For example, if you want to expand your brand on visual platforms, you will want to hire a social media expert with knowledge and experience related to multimedia production.</p> \n<p>If you're an aspiring social media manager, it's also important to know which skills you should hone in on to become in expert in your field.</p> \n<p>To help businesses managers and young social media specialists, we've crafted a list of eight social media job roles that could help a company grow.</p> \n<h2>Social Community Manager Jobs</h2> \n<h3>1. Copywriter</h3> \n<p>Content is a key component in any marketing strategy, especially when social media is involved. Even if you have dedicated bloggers or ebook writers, text-based content still needs to be adapted to each social network. For example, a strong social media manager might write Instagram captions with a relaxed and relatable voice, but might write in a more business-oriented voice for LinkedIn</p> \n<p>This role is typically responsible for the creation and adaptation of written content for specific social media networks. This person should be comfortable writing social posts that are as short as 140 characters or blogs over 200 words.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Copywriting</li> \n <li>Understanding of Brand Voice</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Positioning</li> \n <li>Creativity</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Writing generic posts for all platforms might make your brand seem out of touch, so it's important to have a social media manager who can maintain a brand voice while still adapting it to different platforms. A great caption or piece of written content that speaks directly to your audience could lead to more engagement.</p> \n<h3>2. Digital or Multimedia Producer</h3> \n<p>In 2018,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy?_ga=2.204426264.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\"> 80% of marketers</a> used visual assets as part of their social media strategy, and 63% were regularly using video.</p> \n<p>With the growth of visual platforms like Snapchat and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gain-instagram-followers\">Instagram</a>, and the launch of Story and Live Video features on most major social media sites, there is now a greater need for social media managers with multimedia skills.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content%20creator%20small.jpg?width=598&amp;name=content%20creator%20small.jpg\" alt=\"Social media community manager works as a content creator by preparing a photo for a social media post\" width=\"598\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 598px;\"></p> \n<p>This type of social media manager might focus on <span><span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic?_ga=2.230255892.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">creating images or graphics</a></span></span><span> to accompany Facebook posts, taking and curating photos </span><span>or</span><span><span> </span>videos for Instagram, producing mobile-optimized stories for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-a-snapchat-story\">Snapchat</a>, and creating other content from scratch that helps to</span><span><span> </span></span><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/building-a-social-media-following?_ga=2.207635610.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">grow your following</a><span>.</span></p> \n<h4><span>Skills Needed</span></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><span>Experience with Design Software</span></li> \n <li><span>Basic Photography and Videography</span></li> \n <li><span>Adaptability</span></li> \n <li><span>Creativity</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h4><span>How This Drives Results</span></h4> \n<p>Adapting visual content specifically for each social network yields more clicks and leads. For example, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tweet-images-improve-lead-gen-ht?_ga=2.236930953.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">in an A/B test</a>, we found that tweets including both a link and an image optimized for the platform yielded <strong>55% more leads than tweets with just a link</strong>. Adapting and creating content for each specific network is critical to driving results.</p> \n<h3>3. Social Media Metrics Analyst</h3> \n<p><span>As all marketing roles become more and more data-driven, a</span> social media community manager needs to be able to dig into the data, analyze that data, and draw actionable insights.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/analyst.jpg?width=598&amp;name=analyst.jpg\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Social media community manager showing his team marketing analytics.\"><span>That includes macro data, such as overall reach and leads generated, and micro data </span><span>like individual experiments around content positioning. This person<span> should also be able to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples?_ga=2.203909400.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">set goals that are just out of reach</a> -- and find a way to hit them.</span></span></p> \n<p>A successful social media community manager enjoys looking at data and knows how to use it to make informed decisions. At the same time, this person shouldn't be so stuck in the data that it prevents experimentation and risk-taking.</p> \n<p>It's important for a social media community manager to constantly test new strategies, new content, and new campaigns. This person will be skilled at running experiments, such as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-posting-frequency?_ga=2.203909400.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">post frequency tests</a>, and refining their social strategy based on the results.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Data Analysis</li> \n <li>Curiosity</li> \n <li>Experience with Running Scientific Experiments</li> \n <li>Strong Presentation Skills</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Constantly testing and analyzing results helps social media community managers build more effective standards in their routines. For example, that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tweet-images-improve-lead-gen-ht?_ga=2.232678551.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">Twitter image test</a> discussed above was designed, implemented, and measured by one social media manager. That experiment's results have had a serious impact on our social media efforts.</p> \n<h3>4. News Commentator and Curator</h3> \n<p>A successful social media community manager will be able to find new opportunities for the company by keeping track of their industry, news, and social media trends. They need to know where to look for the news and what people are saying about it. They also need to know what's changing on social networks and in the industry. When shifts or new trends occur, they must be able to react and respond accordingly.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/news%20small.jpeg?width=603&amp;name=news%20small.jpeg\" alt=\"A social media community manager reviews news and trends regularly.\" width=\"603\" style=\"width: 603px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">They should be skilled at \"tactful newsjacking,\" meaning the ability to (tactfully) capitalize on a news story, trend, or hashtag. And if something goes awry, they need to be able to mitigate the issue calmly and diplomatically.</p> \n<p>Recently, Netflix capitalized on the news that IHOP was changing its name to IHOB. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1006225471812468736?lang=en\">Netflix US Twitter account</a> simply tweeted, \"brb changing my name to Netflib.\" See <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34141/10-Innovative-Social-Media-Newsjacks-of-the-Super-Bowl-Power-Outage.aspx?_ga=2.161906740.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">this list</a> for a few other great examples.</p> \n<p>The social media community manager can act as an extension of the PR team, connecting your team directly with journalists and reporters, which can result in increased coverage for the company. For<span> global brands, it will also be important for the social media community manager to be able to think outside their own region.</span></p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Content Curation</li> \n <li>Hungry for Information</li> \n <li>Effective Monitoring</li> \n <li><span>Quick Decision-making</span></li> \n <li><span>Good Judgment</span></li> \n <li>Can Think Globally</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Staying on top of trends as they rise allows your social media community manager to newsjack. Posts relating to news or trends can boost social media traffic, encourage more engagement from followers who might re-share or retweet your content, and could even gain attention from journalists looking for story fodder.</p> \n<h3>5. Customer Service Representative</h3> \n<p>When someone runs social media, they are perceived as the voice of the company. They'll constantly get questions and comments about their company's products, services, and content which might not always be positive.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/small%20customer%20service.jpeg?width=598&amp;name=small%20customer%20service.jpeg\" alt=\"A social media community manager opens his platform's messenger app to answer follower messages.\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">The social media community manager needs to be able to communicate with people in different buying stages and mood dispositions. They're the \"traffic director.\" They must be able to understand where a follower's question or comment is coming from, address it appropriately, and provide a course of action or solution.</p> \n<p>To successfully communicate with followers, they should be intimately familiar with their company's brand, products, and services.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Strong Communication</li> \n <li>Adaptability</li> \n <li>Calmness</li> \n <li>Desire to Solve Others' Problems</li> \n <li>Ability to Troubleshoot</li> \n <li>Knows @here to Pass Complex Questions,</li> \n <li>Knowledge of the Company, Products, and Services</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Having a link to customer service on social media allows you to respond to customer issues on your audience's preferred platform. Responding to someone's concerns on social media, rather than over a phone call, can also save your company time, money, and other resources.</p> \n<p>Because social media is a public forum, your community manager can use these opportunities to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-tweets?_ga=2.171534248.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">showcase your company's quality of customer service</a>. For example, if a company is happy with your product or tweets about a positive experience, you can retweet or share the post.</p> \n<h3>6. Community Manager and Facilitator</h3> \n<p>Part of building a following on social media is helping that following connect with each other and become a community.</p> \n<p>True communities don't simply engage with the company or moderator; they engage with <em>each other --</em> which actually scales the social media community much better, too. But <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/community-management-expert-advice?_ga=2.226002066.966289747.1558623644-1894039831.1558108101\">community management</a> takes work, including asking questions to seed discussions and kicking out people who spam or otherwise detract from the community.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/small%20community.jpg?width=598&amp;name=small%20community.jpg\" alt=\"A social media community manager responds to posts in an online discussion. \" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">A good facilitator asks relevant and thought-provoking questions in an engaging way. Another part is setting the tone for the community, being present, enforcing community guidelines, and sometimes even removing members or deleting posts when appropriate.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Resourcefulness,</li> \n <li>Ability to Connect People</li> \n <li>Can Stimulate Discussion</li> \n <li>Firm but Empathetic</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p><span>If your followers like your community, they'll recommend it to others -- either on purpose or inadvertently by commenting and having it show up on their timeline. This leads to more exposure, which leads to more reach.</span></p> \n<p>To grow a social following, the social media community manager needs to help the company's community get value from each other.</p> \n<h3>7. Funnel Marketing Manager</h3> \n<p>Social media is a powerful tool that can help the whole funnel, not just the top. It expands the reach of your content, attracts visitors to your website, generates leads, and nurtures those prospects into becoming customers. That means a social media manager needs to be able to pick and share content in a way that will accomplish each of those goals.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/funnel-3.jpg?width=598&amp;name=funnel-3.jpg\" alt=\"A funnel marketing social community manager plans a strategy around the company's funnel.\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>At the top of the funnel, they need to share social content that generates leads. As they get further down the funnel, the social media expert needs to engage one-on-one with potential customers who are considering a product or service.</p> \n<p>Social media is also particularly effective as a lead nurturing tool because prospects use multiple media to consume information. Because social channels are more fast-paced than traditional media, like email, you can engage with leads in a more timely manner.</p> \n<p>Social media community managers need to have a strong understanding of the sales and marketing funnel. Then, they must understand which content is appropriate for each level of the funnel.</p> \n<p>To be effective, this manager will need to keep in touch with multiple teams in their company. For example, they'll need to pass appropriate leads to the sales team or product feedback to customer service.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Funnel Understanding</li> \n <li>Knowledge of Content for Each Funnel Stage</li> \n <li>Basic Sales Skills</li> \n <li>Strong Communication</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Sharing conversion-oriented content on social media can attract more visitors to your site and convert them into leads for your sales team. According to a <a href=\"https://www.globalwebindex.com/hubfs/Downloads/Social-H2-2018-report.pdf\">2018 GlobalWebIndex Study</a>, 40% of digital consumers use social media as a tool when researching products. With the right person at the helm of your company's social media accounts, your posts could catch the eye of these users.</p> \n<h3>8. Project Manager and Campaign Coordinator</h3> \n<p>Many people across a company may want certain things posted, responded to, favorited or \"liked.\" It's up to the social media manager to decide which requests to honor and when to honor them. This means they need to be highly organized and able to manage multiple requests.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/project%20manager.jpg?width=598&amp;name=project%20manager.jpg\" alt=\"A project manager meets with colleagues to plan social projects or campaigns.\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">They need to be able to quickly assess whether a request would resonate with the company's followers, or whether it's too niche or too narrow. For example, a location-specific post might be too narrow to send to a company's entire Twitter following.</p> \n<p>Social media community managers also need to effectively coordinate with different departments to organize campaign launches, while still pushing launches and growth initiatives of their own.</p> \n<h4>Skills Necessary</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Strong Organization</li> \n <li>Strong Communication</li> \n <li>Ability to Negotiate</li> \n <li>Data-Based Decision-Making</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How This Drives Results</h4> \n<p>Social media plays a big role in promoting initiatives from different departments and teams across a company.

The end result? A blockbuster brand or product video.</p>  \n<p>With all that time invested, you can't stop at just embedding the video on a homepage or sharing it on social media and hoping someone watches.</p> \n<p>While great content is bound to be found, it's also important to be proactive about gaining the attention of and educating prospects and those unfamiliar with your brand. Running a series of YouTube ads is one way to make sure more of your target audience finds the video content you've produced.</p> \n<p>And with new formats and tracking capabilities, you can also use this information to report on its ROI.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The thing is, advertising on YouTube is very different from running a PPC or paid social campaign. There are specific creative constraints and a ton of options for this platform, and you need a base knowledge before you even scope out your next video project to make the most of the paid possibilities.</p> \n<div> \n <p class=\"p1\"></p> \n</div> \n<h2>What’s New With YouTube Advertising</h2> \n<p>In January 2017, <a href=\"https://adwords.googleblog.com/2017/01/making-youtube-better-in-mobile-cross.html\">Google announced</a>&nbsp;it would make&nbsp;<a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/advertisers-target-youtube-ads-based-search-histories/307614/\">changes to AdWords</a> to allow advertisers to reach more viewers on YouTube -- especially across mobile devices, where 50% of YouTube views take place. Among the changes it&nbsp;rolled out, possibly the biggest announcement was that advertisers will soon be able to target viewers based on their Google search history, in addition to their viewing behaviors YouTube was already targeting.</p> \n<p>Marketers can now target ads at people who recently searched for a certain product or service to target the video ads they’ll be served on the platform. If the content of a video ad is closely related to a search the viewer has been researching, they might be more likely to watch the entire ad or click through the ad to the website.</p> \n<p>Keywords are relatively less expensive to target on YouTube than in traditional Google Search: Views cost an average of <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/google-adwords-video-ads/\">$0.06 per click</a> on YouTube, compared to the average Google Search cost per click, which is <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">estimated</a> to be between $1-2. When YouTube targeting includes search history, it may be a more cost-effective way to target your audience with a more engaging form of content -- video.</p> \n<h2>The 3 Types of YouTube Video Ads</h2> \n<p>There are three key types of video ads in which you can invest on YouTube: TrueView, Preroll, and Bumpers.</p> \n<h3>1. TrueView Ads</h3> \n<p>TrueView ads are the standard video ad type on YouTube.&nbsp;Advertisers only pay for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2375464?hl=en\">TrueView ads</a> when viewers watch or interact with their ad (for example, by clicking on a call-to-action), and videos can be easily customized&nbsp;to share a variety of content.</p> \n<p>Advertisers only pay when a user watches the ad for at least 30 seconds or until the end of the video or if the viewer takes an action, such as clicking on a call-to-action.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/displayspecs/answer/6244563\">YouTube requires</a> that skippable TrueView ads&nbsp;be between 12 seconds and 6 minutes in length, and that non-skippable TrueView ads be 15-20 seconds in length.</p> \n<p>There are two types of TrueView ads with which you can optimize your YouTube channel:</p> \n<h4>Video Discovery Ads (Previously Named In-Display Ads)</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/displayspecs/answer/6227733?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4588474&amp;vid=1-635792359058243079-3239843357\">Video discovery YouTube ads</a> show up on the YouTube homepage, search results pages, and as related videos on YouTube video watch pages.</p> \n<p>These ads appeared after performing a YouTube search:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_search_results.png?width=669&amp;name=youtube_search_results.png\" alt=\"Two TrueView Video Discovery Ads in a YouTube search result\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"youtube_search_results.png\"></p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">display ad</a>&nbsp;appears as a related video on the right-hand video sidebar:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/in-display-ad.png?width=900&amp;name=in-display-ad.png\" width=\"900\" style=\"width: 900px;\" alt=\"YouTube display ad -- or Video Discovery Ad -- on righthand video sidebar\"></p> \n<p>Once a user clicks on the ad, the destination video page features a spot on the right-hand column where a companion banner <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">display ad</a>&nbsp;will appear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/video-ad-companion-banner.png?width=900&amp;name=video-ad-companion-banner.png\" alt=\"YouTube video ad companion banner\" width=\"900\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p> \n<h4>In-Stream Ads</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/displayspecs/answer/6055025?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4588474&amp;vid=1-635792359058243079-3239843357\">TrueView in-stream ads</a> play before someone watches the video they’ve selected on YouTube. Viewers sometimes have the option to skip the ad after watching it for five seconds. You can also make them play anywhere in the Google Display Network (GDN) -- or sites that purchased&nbsp;Google video ad space.</p> \n<p>In-stream ads let marketers customize video ads with different CTAs and overlay text, as highlighted in the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">skippable in-stream ad</a> example below from Grammarly.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_in_stream_ad_example.png?width=669&amp;name=youtube_in_stream_ad_example.png\" alt=\"TrueView In-Stream video ad by Grammarly\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"youtube_in_stream_ad_example.png\"></p> \n<p>Here’s what another <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">skippable</a>&nbsp;in-stream ad from Wix looks like. In this example, there’s another CTA from Wix on top of the right-hand video menu display:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/in-stream%20ad%20youtube.png?width=669&amp;name=in-stream%20ad%20youtube.png\" alt=\"in-stream ad youtube.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"in-stream ad youtube.png\"></p> \n<h4>What TrueView Videos Can Include</h4> \n<p>TrueView video campaigns can include people, dialogue, and music that was retrieved with permission -- or is considered royalty-free. However, it's best not to run a standard promotional commercial. Because these videos can be skipped, you need to give your audience a reason to keep watching, and product plugs historically don't get the views you might expect.</p> \n<p>Instead, tell a story with the time you have in this video. People love seeing case studies of those who faced a struggle that they can empathize with. It's a source of entertainment that makes your brand memorable and less tempting to skip.</p> \n<p>With TrueView ads, advertisers can gain a ton of information about the performance of their ads for optimization and testing purposes.</p> \n<p>Using AdWords, YouTube account managers can collect data on an ad's completed views, partial views, if the video drives channel subscriptions, clickthrough rates on CTAs, views sourced from a user sharing the content, and views on the brand's other content that can be attributed to a person initially viewing a video ad.</p> \n<p>These actions help advertisers better understand the full value of their video ad spend and where to allocate budget to increase results.</p> \n<h3>2. Preroll Ads</h3> \n<p>Some in-stream ads are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">non-skippable</a> and can play before, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6175006?hl=en\">mid-roll</a>, or after the main video. These are called Preroll ads, and they can be 15 to 20 seconds in duration.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a non-skippable video ad before the main content on YouTube:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/videoad_nonskippable.png?width=669&amp;name=videoad_nonskippable.png\" alt=\"Preroll ad on YouTube with &quot;non-skippable&quot; features highlighted in the video\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"videoad_nonskippable.png\"></p> \n<p>There are also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en\">non-skippable</a>, mid-roll video ads, which appear midway through a YouTube video that's <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6175006?hl=en\">10 minutes or longer</a> in length.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Midroll%20Ad%20YouTube.png?width=644&amp;height=344&amp;name=Midroll%20Ad%20YouTube.png\" alt=\"Midroll preroll ad on YouTube\" width=\"644\" height=\"344\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPe1-ZZerH8\">PC Daily Tips</a></em></span></p> \n<h4>What Preroll Videos Can Include</h4> \n<p>Preroll ads give you just as much freedom as TrueView ads in their allotted content. You can include people, dialogue, audio, and more elements that you find best represent your brand in 15 to 20 seconds.</p> \n<p>Because preroll ads can't be skipped, these videos are best created with a call-to-action (CTA) so you can optimize the attention you do have from the viewer. In other words, encourage viewers to click on your ad and receive something in return. Perhaps you've released a new product or promoting a major event this season and are looking for signups -- use this preroll ad to get those clicks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Keep in mind YouTube sells Preroll video space on a pay-per-click (PPC) basis. Make the click worth it.</p> \n<h3>3. Bumpers</h3> \n<p>Bumpers are the third and shortest type of YouTube video ad available to you. At just six seconds per bumper, these ad spots play before a viewer's chosen video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bumper video ads obviously can't tell a good-enough story in just six seconds, but they make terrific complements to larger video campaigns on a new product launch or event. Just be sure to use this six seconds wisely, and include only the components of your brand you want your audience to remember.</p> \n<h2>How to Set Up &amp; Launch a YouTube Video Advertising Campaign</h2> \n<p>Once you’ve created a marketing video you want to advertise on YouTube, it’s time to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2375497?hl=en\">create your video ad campaign</a>. (If you haven’t made a video yet, here’s how to get started with <a href=\"https://animoto.com/blog/guides/getting-started-animoto/\">Animoto</a> or <a href=\"https://wistia.com/blog/your-first-video\">Wistia</a>, along with a few <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/blog/examples-of-b2b-video-marketing/\">great examples</a>.) Then, upload your video to YouTube.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/select_video_to_upload.png?width=669&amp;name=select_video_to_upload.png\" alt=\"YouTube creator's page prompt to select files to upload\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"select_video_to_upload.png\"></p> \n<p>Now, you're ready to set up your advertising campaign. First, go to your <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/\">Google AdWords</a> account to set up your campaign.</p> \n<h3>Campaign Type</h3> \n<p>Tap the drop-down menu on the right-hand side of the red \"+ Campaign\" button on your Google AdWords homepage and select \"video.\"</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/launch_new_video_ad.png?width=329&amp;height=322&amp;name=launch_new_video_ad.png\" alt=\"launch_new_video_ad.png\" width=\"329\" height=\"322\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Campaign Name</h3> \n<p>Enter a name for your campaign, and make sure Video has been chosen from the Type drop-down menu.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/YouTube_AdWords_Step1.png?width=669&amp;name=YouTube_AdWords_Step1.png\" alt=\"YouTube_AdWords_Step1.png\" title=\"YouTube_AdWords_Step1.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\"></p> \n<h3>Video Ad Format</h3> \n<p>Select \"In-stream or video discovery ads\" to ensure your video ad will be in TrueView format (in the style of the examples outlined above).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/video_ad_formats_adwords.png?width=462&amp;height=83&amp;name=video_ad_formats_adwords.png\" alt=\"video_ad_formats_adwords.png\" width=\"462\" height=\"83\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>Set your budget per day. You can also select a delivery method -- either the standard delivery, which shows ads evenly during the day, or accelerated delivery, which drives&nbsp;views as quickly as possible. The latter would be useful if you want&nbsp;to capitalize on a trend or news item relevant to your brand's video.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/video-ad-budget-delivery.png?width=672&amp;height=194&amp;name=video-ad-budget-delivery.png\" alt=\"video-ad-budget-delivery.png\" title=\"video-ad-budget-delivery.png\" width=\"672\" height=\"194\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Networks</h3> \n<p>Decide where you want your ad to appear.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>YouTube Search: Your video ad will appear in results for searches and will appear on the YouTube home page, channel pages, and video pages.</li> \n <li>YouTube Videos: This runs TrueView ads that can appear in-display ads or in-stream ads. With this option, you can choose for your video ad to appear before or around videos shown across the Google Display Network.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You should create separate campaigns for YouTube Search and YouTube Video as this will help you to better track performance metrics. These ads are served to people performing very different activities and require a different amount of commitment from the viewer, so it's best to monitor performance separately.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/youtube-networks.png?width=526&amp;height=103&amp;name=youtube-networks.png\" alt=\"youtube-networks.png\" title=\"youtube-networks.png\" width=\"526\" height=\"103\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Locations</h3> \n<p>Define the location of users whom you want the ad to be shown to. You can also exclude certain locations.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/video-location.png?width=636&amp;height=311&amp;name=video-location.png\" alt=\"video-location.png\" title=\"video-location.png\" width=\"636\" height=\"311\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Language, Device &amp; Mobile Bidding</h3> \n<p>AdWords will let you specify the operating system, device, and carrier for more advanced targeting. This is especially useful for mobile app ads, and there's an option to increase or decrease your bid based on if the video ad is shown to someone on a mobile device.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_language_ad_adjustment.png?width=703&amp;name=youtube_language_ad_adjustment.png\" alt=\"youtube_language_ad_adjustment.png\" title=\"youtube_language_ad_adjustment.png\" style=\"width: 703px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"703\"></p> \n<h3>Advanced Settings</h3> \n<p>With the advanced settings section, you can set begin and end dates for your campaign, create a custom schedule for when your video ad should be shown, and limit the daily impressions and views for users. This all helps you to get the most return for your ad spend.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/advanced%20settings%20youtube%20ads.png?width=546&amp;name=advanced%20settings%20youtube%20ads.png\" alt=\"Advanced settings on YouTube ads.png\" title=\"advanced settings youtube ads.png\" style=\"width: 546px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"546\"></p> \n<h3>Creating the Video Ad Creative</h3> \n<p>Name your ad group, and then insert the YouTube link for the video you would like to run the ad for. You will then choose whether you want this to run as an in-stream ad or an in-display ad.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/video_ad_creative_youtube.png?width=772&amp;name=video_ad_creative_youtube.png\" alt=\"video_ad_creative_youtube.png\" title=\"video_ad_creative_youtube.png\" width=\"772\" style=\"width: 772px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>For in-display, you'll need to include a title and short description, which is entered on two separate lines. Note: Titles are limited to 25 characters, and the description lines are limited to 35 characters each.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Agency_Post/Blog_Images/youtube-in-display.png?width=669&amp;height=302&amp;name=youtube-in-display.png\" alt=\"youtube-in-display.png\" title=\"youtube-in-display.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"302\"></p> \n<p>In-stream ads provide you with the option to overlap a display URL on top of the video. You should use a vanity URL that directs to another final URL to make it more memorable. You can include advanced URL tracking options. In addition, a companion banner made from images from your video will appear on the right side of the video ad.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/youtube-instream.png?width=669&amp;height=394&amp;name=youtube-instream.png\" alt=\"youtube-in-stream.png\" title=\"youtube-instream.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"394\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Bidding</h3> \n<p>You'll then determine the max price you will pay for each view, which you can adjust to increase the number of projected views your video may receive.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bidding_video_ad_adwords.png?width=669&amp;name=bidding_video_ad_adwords.png\" alt=\"bidding_video_ad_adwords.png\" title=\"bidding_video_ad_adwords.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\"></p> \n<h3>Targeting</h3> \n<p>Finally, you can further define the audience you would like the video to be shown -- options include gender, age, and parental status. You can also target individuals by their interests, such as beauty mavens, cooking enthusiasts, horror movie fans, etc. Try running multiple campaigns to target different groups of users to discover who is most engaged, rather than including everyone you want to target in one campaign.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/video-adwords-interests.png?width=669&amp;height=449&amp;name=video-adwords-interests.png\" alt=\"video-adwords-interests.png\" title=\"video-adwords-interests.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"449\"></p> \n<h3>Advanced Targeting</h3> \n<p>You can also target individuals by keywords, topics, or websites where you would like your video ad to appear. Keyword targeting with in-display ads can be a powerful tool for finding individuals who are looking for a visual answer to a question. Be sure to do your research, and try testing out different groups of keywords to see which leads to more views, clicks, or conversions.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can use AdWords video ads to remarket to people who have been in contact with your brand already. This can help you to re-engage those who are already familiar with your brand.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/narrow-targeting.png?width=292&amp;height=201&amp;name=narrow-targeting.png\" alt=\"narrow-targeting.png\" title=\"narrow-targeting.png\" width=\"292\" height=\"201\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>Linking Your Account</h3> \n<p>You should link your AdWords account to the YouTube channel where the video is hosted if you haven't already. You can also click \"finish\" to begin running your video ad campaign.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/adwords-linking-account.png?width=669&amp;height=416&amp;name=adwords-linking-account.png\" alt=\"adwords-linking-account.png\" title=\"adwords-linking-account.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"416\"></p> \n<h2>10 Tips for Optimizing Your AdWords for Video Ads</h2> \n<p>Launching a video ad campaign is a great step, but there are some things you should set up prior to starting to pay for views to make the most of your budget and to see the highest return for your client.</p> \n<h3>1. Define your metrics and goals.</h3> \n<p>When analyzing the results, there are four main categories of metrics you can track for each video. These are located under the \"column\" drop-down in your campaigns interface.</p> \n<h4>Views</h4> \n<p>Under the \"views\" category, you can better understand what percentage of the ad people viewed and understand how the ad drove earned views or views on your brand's other videos.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/views-metrics.png?width=669&amp;height=133&amp;name=views-metrics.png\" alt=\"views-metrics.png\" title=\"views-metrics.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"133\"></p> \n<h4>Audience</h4> \n<p>This category can be used to track likes and shares for each video ad.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/audience-metrics.png?width=669&amp;height=115&amp;name=audience-metrics.png\" alt=\"audience-metrics.png\" title=\"audience-metrics.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"115\"></p> \n<h4>Branding</h4> \n<p>The view rate should signal if the creative and message are&nbsp;interesting or entertaining enough for people to watch the ad. By increasing your view-through rate (VTR), you will lower your cost per view.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/video-branding-metrics.png?width=669&amp;height=115&amp;name=video-branding-metrics.png\" alt=\"video-branding-metrics.png\" title=\"video-branding-metrics.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"115\"></p> \n<h4>Conversions</h4> \n<p>Conversions will help you better understand if your ad is driving leads and returning a high ROI for your brand.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/conversions-metrics.png?width=669&amp;height=128&amp;name=conversions-metrics.png\" alt=\"conversions-metrics.png\" title=\"conversions-metrics.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"128\"></p> \n<p>Depending on the goals for the brand, you should determine a few goals based on these metrics and formalize a plan for optimizing creative and trying different targeting criteria to improve results. Your goals should also determine the type of content you will feature in the ad -- some metrics are better for branding goals and others will drive leads and conversions.</p> \n<h3>2. Track low performing placements.</h3> \n<p>If you're running in-display ads that will appear&nbsp;across the Google Display Network, you can review where the ad has appeared in by navigating to Video Targeting &gt; Placements &gt; Where ads were shown &gt; Display network from your Google AdWords Campaigns dashboard. Review this list to see if any particular sites are contributing to poor performance for your desired metrics. Exclude these sites from your ad campaign moving forward to increase your average CPV.</p> \n<h3>3. Use a custom thumbnail image.</h3> \n<p>Design or use a high-quality still image from the video to entice&nbsp;a viewer to click on your video. Remember, this image needs to be legible by users on different devices, including mobile. If your image contains a person, make sure he or she is looking into the camera. If you are featuring a product, make sure the background isn't distracting.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Drive people to buy with cards.</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6140541?vid=1-635792409460577185-3239843357\">YouTube card</a> is teased with a small \"i\" symbol, which the viewer can click to expand. You can time this appearance so only users engaged with the video and content will see the notification.</p> \n<p>With cards, you can feature a product related to or featured in the video to drive product purchases. You can also use cards to drive fundraising donations, traffic to a URL, or traffic to other videos as shown in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewU7e11y6y8\">example below from <em>Refinery29</em></a>. Each format will allow you to customize the card with text, images, and other options.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/refinery29example.png?width=693&amp;name=refinery29example.png\" alt=\"refinery29example.png\" title=\"refinery29example.png\" width=\"693\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 693px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Create calls-to-actions.</h3> \n<p>When promoting a video on YouTube, you can include call-to-action overlays that link to a URL. You could link to a landing page, product page, information page, career page ... whatever you'd like. You could also send people to a favorable report or interview featuring the brand.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgYhTlNtmLE\">Adobe highlights one of its live&nbsp;videos</a> using a call-to-action overlay:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adobe_youtube_ad_CTA.png?width=695&amp;name=adobe_youtube_ad_CTA.png\" alt=\"adobe_youtube_ad_CTA.png\" title=\"adobe_youtube_ad_CTA.png\" style=\"width: 695px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"695\"></p> \n<h3>6. Create a YouTube end slate.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.reelseo.com/outro-end-slate-youtube/\">Create an end screen</a> to drive subscribers to your channel, promote your social networks, or increase interest in your brand. If someone has watched a video until the end, it's a good sign they enjoy your content and might be interested in subscribing to your channel for future updates. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG5ceUvmqS4\"><em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>'s end slate </a>uses this screen to drive subscribers and social media fans while also highlighting other interesting topics its host has featured. Once you build the image, you will be able to annotate the end screen in YouTube's video editor.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/yeahboy_endslate.png?width=689&amp;name=yeahboy_endslate.png\" alt=\"yeahboy_endslate.png\" title=\"yeahboy_endslate.png\" style=\"width: 689px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"689\"></p> \n<h3>7. Use negative remarketing.</h3> \n<p>If you are running a campaign for a longer period of time and want to only attract new users to a brand, consider creating a list of people who your ad will not be shown to. When viewing your AdWords Campaign screen, select \"Shared library\" on the lower left sidebar. Then select \"Video remarketing\" and \"+ Remarketing List\". You can stretch your campaign budget and target only unique users by selecting to not show your video ad to someone who has previously viewed the specific video, who has visited your YouTube channel, or shared, liked, or commented on any of your videos on your channel.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/remarketing-adwords.png?width=669&amp;height=230&amp;name=remarketing-adwords.png\" alt=\"remarketing-adwords.png\" title=\"remarketing-adwords.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"230\"></p> \n<h3>8. Use close captioning to cater to viewer's needs and wants.</h3> \n<p>This tip applies to all YouTube videos -- but it's a general best practice that's not followed by many brands. Include a quality video transcription you've generated and approved. Only user-uploaded transcriptions are indexed by Google because YouTube's automatic captioning can be <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/29/funny-youtube-caption-fai_n_516866.html\">less than reliable</a>. Depending on your target audience, you may also want to include transcriptions in various other languages. You can also offer users the option to download or visit a site page with the full transcription in your video description.</p> \n<h3>9. Qualify viewers.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, your ad will be seen by people who have no interest in your product. Encourage them to skip the ad if the content isn't relevant so you don't have to pay for the view and they don't waste their time watching irrelevant advertising.</p> \n<h3>10. Consider making your ad longer.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2375464?hl=en\">TrueView ads</a>, if the ad is under 30 seconds, you pay only if a viewer watches until the end. If the ad is longer than 30 seconds, you pay if the viewer watches it for at least 30 seconds. In both cases, you pay if the viewer interacts with your ad before it's over. Consider this when you are coming up with ideas for content for the ad. You may want to put messaging at a certain point so uninterested viewers can skip the ad, or you might provide special offers towards the end of the video.</p> \n<h2>The Future of Video is Bright</h2> \n<p>We’ve told you before: Video content is a must-have part of your content strategy. This is even truer&nbsp;now that YouTube lets marketers target users based on their search histories. YouTube advertising is more targeted than ever, and it’s less competitive real estate than the world of Google Search because video content is newer to the content scene and less popular than blog posts.</p> \n<p>Stay tuned for more from us about how to make great video ads for YouTube and social media, and where we think <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing\">YouTube marketing</a> is headed next.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img

Video)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-pivot-table-tutorial-ht","description":"<p>The pivot table is one of Microsoft Excel's most powerful -- and intimidating -- functions. Powerful because it can help you summarize and make sense of large data sets. Intimidating because you're not exactly an Excel expert, and pivot tables have always had a reputation for being complicated.</p> \n<p>The good news: Learning how to create a pivot table in Excel is much easier than you might've been led to believe.</p> \n<p>But before we walk you through process of creating one, let's take a step back and make sure you understand exactly what a pivot table is, and why you might need to use one.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is a Pivot Table?</h2> \n <p>A pivot table is a summary of your data, packaged in a chart that lets you report on and explore trends based on your information. Pivot tables are particularly useful if you have long rows or columns that hold values you need to track the sums of and easily compare to one another.</p> \n</div> \n<p>In other words, pivot tables extract meaning from that seemingly endless jumble of numbers on your screen. And more specifically, it lets you group your data together in different ways so you can draw helpful conclusions more easily.</p> \n<p>The \"pivot\" part of a pivot table stems from the fact that you can rotate (or pivot) the data in the table in order to view it from a different perspective. To be clear, you're not adding to, subtracting from, or otherwise changing your data when you make a pivot. Instead, you're simply reorganizing the data so you can reveal useful information from it.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pivot_table-1.gif?width=600&amp;name=pivot_table-1.gif\" title=\"An Excel spreadsheet creating pivot tables in action\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" alt=\"An Excel spreadsheet creating pivot tables in action\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<h2>How to Use Pivot Tables</h2> \n<p>If you're still feeling a bit confused about what pivot tables actually do, don't worry. This is one of those technologies that's much easier to understand once you've seen it in action. Here are seven hypothetical scenarios where you'd want to use a pivot table.</p> \n<h3>1. Compare sales totals of different products.</h3> \n<p>Say you have a worksheet that contains monthly sales data for three different products -- product 1, product 2, and product 3 -- and you want to figure out which of the three has been bringing in the most bucks. You could, of course, look through the worksheet and manually add the corresponding sales figure to a running total every time product 1 appears. You could then do the same for product 2, and product 3, until you have totals for all of them. Piece of cake, right?</p> \n<p>Now, imagine that monthly sales worksheet of yours has thousands and thousands of rows. Manually sorting through them all could take a lifetime. Using a pivot table, you can automatically aggregate all of the sales figures for product 1, product 2, and product 3 -- and calculate their respective sums -- in less than a minute.</p> \n<h3>2. Show product sales as percentages of total sales.</h3> \n<p>Pivot tables naturally show the totals of each row or column when you create it. But that's not the only figure you can automatically produce.</p> \n<p>Let's say you entered quarterly sales numbers for three separate products into an Excel sheet and turned this data into a pivot table. The table would automatically give you three totals at the bottom of each column -- having added up each product's quarterly sales. But what if you wanted to find the <em>percentage</em> these product sales contributed of all company sales, rather than just those products' sales totals?</p> \n<p>With a pivot table, you can configure each column to give you the column's percentage of all three column totals, instead of just the column total. If three product sales totaled $200,000 in sales, for example, and the first product made $45,000, you can edit a pivot table to instead say this product contributed 22.5% of all company sales.</p> \n<p>To show product sales as percentages of total sales in a pivot table, simply right-click the cell carrying a sales total and select <strong>\"Show Values As\"</strong> &gt; <strong>\"% of Grand Total.\"</strong></p> \n<h3>3. Combine duplicate data.</h3> \n<p>In this scenario, you've just completed a blog redesign and had to update a bunch of URLs. Unfortunately, your blog reporting software didn't handle it very well, and ended up splitting the \"view\" metrics for single posts between two different URLs. So in your spreadsheet, you have two separate instances of each individual blog post. In order to get accurate data, you need to combine the view totals for each of these duplicates.</p> \n<p>That's where the pivot table comes into play. Instead of having to manually search for and combine all the metrics from the duplicates, you can summarize your data (via pivot table) by blog post title, and voilà: the view metrics from those duplicate posts will be aggregated automatically.</p> \n<h3>4. Get an employee head count for separate departments.</h3> \n<p>Pivot tables are helpful for automatically calculating things that you can't easily find in a basic Excel table. One of those things is counting rows that all have something in common.</p> \n<p>If you have a list of employees in an Excel sheet, for instance, and next to the employees' names are the respective departments they belong to, you can create a pivot table from this data that shows you each department name and the number of employees that belong to those departments. The pivot table effectively eliminates your task of sorting the Excel sheet by department name and counting each row manually.</p> \n<h3>5. Add default values to empty cells.</h3> \n<p>Not every dataset you enter into Excel will populate every cell. If you're waiting for new data to come in before entering it into Excel, you might have lots of empty cells that look confusing or need further explaining when showing this data to your manager. That's where pivot tables come in.</p> \n<p>You can easily customize a pivot table to fill empty cells with a default value, such as $0, or TBD (for \"to be determined\"). For large tables of data, being able to tag these cells quickly is a useful feature when many people are reviewing the same sheet.</p> \n<p>To automatically format the empty cells of your pivot table, right-click your table and click <strong>\"PivotTable Options.\"</strong> In the window that appears, check the box labeled <strong>\"Empty Cells As\"</strong> and enter what you'd like displayed when a cell has no other value.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Create a Pivot Table</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Enter your data into a range of rows and columns.</li> \n  <li>Sort your data by a specific attribute.</li> \n  <li>Highlight your cells to create your pivot table.</li> \n  <li>Drag and drop a field into the \"Row Labels\" area.</li> \n  <li>Drag and drop a field into the \"Values\" area.</li> \n  <li>Fine-tune your calculations.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>Now that you have a better sense of what pivot tables can be used for, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how to actually create one.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div style=\"display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"> \n   <div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 475px; max-height: 268px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n     <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.42%; margin: 0;\">\n      <iframe class=\"wistia_embed hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/cufjkvmw35?videoFoam=true\" name=\"wistia_embed\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div>  \n</div> \n<h3>&nbsp;</h3> \n<h3>1. Enter your data into a range of rows and columns.</h3> \n<p>Every pivot table in Excel starts with a basic Excel table, where all your data is housed. To create this table, simply enter your values into a specific set of rows and columns. Use the topmost row or the topmost column to categorize your values by what they represent.</p> \n<p>For example, to create an Excel table of blog post performance data, you might have a column listing each \"URL,\" a column listing each URL's \"Post Title,\" a column listing each post's \"Views to Date,\" and so on. (We'll be using that example in the steps that follow.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-data-in-table.jpg?width=793&amp;name=excel-data-in-table.jpg\" alt=\"Excel data entered in three columns in preparation for creating a pivot table\" width=\"793\" style=\"width: 793px;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Sort your data by a specific attribute.</h3> \n<p>When you have all the data you want entered into your Excel sheet, you'll want to sort this data in some way so it's easier to manage once you turn it into a pivot table.</p> \n<p>To sort your data, click the <strong>\"Data\"</strong> tab in the top navigation bar and select the <strong>\"Sort\"</strong> icon underneath it. In the window that appears, you can opt to sort your data by any column you want and in any order. To sort your Excel sheet by \"Views to Date,\" for example, select this column title under <strong>\"Column\"</strong> and then select whether you want to order your posts from smallest to largest, or from largest to smallest.</p> \n<p>Select <strong>\"OK\"</strong> on the bottom-right of the Sort window, and you'll successfully reorder each row of your Excel sheet by the number of views each blog post has received.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sort-data-excel.jpg?width=690&amp;name=sort-data-excel.jpg\" alt=\"Sort window of Excel sheet\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Highlight your cells to create your pivot table.</h3> \n<p>Once you've entered data into your Excel worksheet, and sorted it to your liking, highlight the cells you'd like to summarize in a pivot table. Click <strong>\"Insert\"</strong> along the top navigation, and select the <strong>\"PivotTable\"</strong> icon. You can also click anywhere in your worksheet, select \"PivotTable,\" and manually enter the range of cells you'd like included in the PivotTable.</p> \n<p>This will open an option box where, in addition to setting your cell range, you can select whether or not to launch this pivot table in a new worksheet or keep it in the existing worksheet. If you open a new sheet, you can navigate to and away from it on the bottom of your Excel workbook. Once you've chosen, click <strong>\"OK.\"</strong></p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can highlight your cells, select \"Recommended PivotTables\" to the right of the PivotTable icon, and open a pivot table with pre-set suggestions for how to organize each row and column.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/inserting%20a%20pivot%20table%20in%20excel.png?width=600&amp;name=inserting%20a%20pivot%20table%20in%20excel.png\" alt=\"Creating a pivot table under the &quot;Insert&quot; option in Excel\" width=\"600\" title=\"Creating a pivot table under the &quot;Insert&quot; option in Excel\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you're using a version of Excel earlier than Excel 2016, \"PivotTables\" may be under <strong>\"Tables\"</strong> or <strong>\"Data\"</strong> along the top navigation, rather than \"Insert.\" In Google Sheets, you can create pivot tables from the <strong>\"Data\"</strong> dropdown along the top navigation.</em></p> \n<h3>4. Drag and drop a field into the \"Row Labels\" area.</h3> \n<p>After you've completed Step 1, Excel will create a blank pivot table for you. Your next step is to drag and drop a field -- labeled according to the names of the columns in your spreadsheet -- into the <strong>\"Row Labels\"</strong> area. This will determine what unique identifier -- blog post title, product name, and so on -- the pivot table will organize your data by.</p> \n<p>For example, let's say you want to organize a bunch of blogging data by post title. To do that, you'd simply click and drag the “Title” field to the \"Row Labels\" area.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pivot-table-step-2.png?width=600&amp;name=pivot-table-step-2.png\" alt=\"Adding row labels to a pivot table in Excel\" title=\"Adding row labels to a pivot table in Excel\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Your pivot table may look different depending on which version of Excel you're working with. However, the general principles remain the same.</em></p> \n<h3>5. Drag and drop a field into the \"Values\" area.<strong><br></strong></h3> \n<p>Once you've established what you're going to organize your data by, your next step is to add in some values by dragging a field into the <strong>\"Values\"</strong> area.</p> \n<p>Sticking with the blogging data example, let's say you want to summarize blog post views by title. To do this, you'd simply drag the \"Views\" field into the Values area.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pivot-table-step-3.png?width=600&amp;name=pivot-table-step-3.png\" alt=\"Adding values to a pivot table in Excel\" title=\"Adding values to a pivot table in Excel\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<h3>6. Fine-tune your calculations.<strong><br></strong></h3> \n<p>The sum of a particular value will be calculated by default, but you can easily change this to something like average, maximum, or minimum depending on what you want to calculate.</p> \n<p>On a Mac, you can do this by clicking on the small <strong>\"<em>i\"</em></strong> next to a value in the \"Values\" area, selecting the option you want, and clicking \"OK.\" Once you’ve made your selection, your pivot table will be updated accordingly.</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\">If you're using a PC, you'll need to click on the small upside-down triangle next to your value and select <strong>\"Value Field Settings\"</strong> in order to access the menu.</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pivot-table-step-4.png?width=600&amp;name=pivot-table-step-4.png\" alt=\"Changing the field options of a pivot table in Excel\" title=\"Changing the field options of a pivot table in Excel\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<h2><span><span>Digging Deeper With Pivot Tables</span></span></h2> \n<p>You've now learned the basics of pivot table creation in Excel. But depending on what you need your pivot table for, you might not be done.</p> \n<p>For example, you may notice that the data in your pivot table isn't sorted the way you'd like. If were the case, Excel's Sort function can help you out. Alternatively, you may need to incorporate data from another source into your reporting, in which case the VLOOKUP function could come in handy.</p> \n<p>To take a deeper dive into the world of Excel and learn about its various functions, download our comprehensive guide, <em><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-excel\">How to Use Excel</a></strong>.</em></p> \n<p>Want more Excel tips?

They can plug in their entire content calendar at the start of the month and remove the heavy lifting for the next few weeks.</p> \n<p>Post-enhancing dashboards such as these three can take care of your social strategy without losing any of quality.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://tweetdeck.com\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">TweetDeck</a></h3> \n<h4>Price: <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Free</span><br>Why it's great: <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Twitter dash management</span></h4> \n<p>TweetDeck is amazing if you're tired of flipping back and forth through the different tabs on Twitter.

All of their photos have the same filter on them to ensure they match — this makes their Instagram profile look professional, artistic, and organized when visitors, like myself, browse their page.</p> \n<p>Frye’s Instagram account also encourages interaction between the company and their followers by providing them with a specific <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/inmyfrye/?hl=en\">hashtag</a> to use so they can be featured on the account when they post a photo with a Frye product.</p> \n<p>Frye’s Instagram account is a great example of successful social media marketing — it’s attractive, distinctly Frye, engages their 197K followers, and promotes their products.</p> \n<p><strong>But why is social media marketing so important?</strong> Why should you spend time creating social media accounts for your business?

We’ve created a list of the four most beneficial reasons to consider.</p> \n<p>Let's dive in.</p> \n<h3>1. Increase Brand Awareness</h3> \n<p>In 2018, there were over <a href=\"https://awario.com/blog/36-surprising-social-media-statistics-you-should-know-in-2019/\">3.2 billion people on social media globally</a>. Due to the sheer amount of people on social media, you can see why ensuring your business is sharing content related to your products as well as details about your company via a platform or two has the potential to help you improve <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness#establish\">brand awareness</a>.</p> \n<p>In fact, social media has been proven to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/powerful-techniques-boost-brand-social-media-list\">boost brand awareness</a> by driving up engagement. Social engagement includes things like comments, likes, shares, and re-posts. Social media also helps you increase brand awareness by directing traffic straight to your site. You can do this by including direct links to your website in your profile, bio, and posts.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-build-a-brand?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Build a Brand for Your Company</a></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. Generate Leads and Boost Conversions</h3> \n<p>Promoting and sharing your products on social media is a simple way to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht\">improve lead generation</a>, boost conversions, and increase sales because you’re advertising to people who have opted to engage with you by following your account.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of ways you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/generate-more-leads-on-social-media\">use social media to generate more leads.</a></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Create contests</strong> for your visitors and followers to participate in on your social media profiles.</li> \n <li><strong> Include links to your website and offers</strong> in the bio sections of your profiles.</li> \n <li><strong>Host live videos </strong>to make announcements about products and provide updates or details about exciting news at your company.</li> \n <li><strong>Implement a </strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-campaigns\">social media marketing campaign</a> on one of your channels.</li> \n <li><strong>Sell your products through your social profiles</strong>. For example, you can enable <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/912190892201033\">Facebook’s Shop Section</a> or <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/a/shopping-on-instagram\">Instagram's Shopping feature</a> on your profiles. These features allow your visitors and followers to click on products you’ve shared in posts to view information such as price, material, and size. Then, visitors can easily proceed to checkout through the platform and buy the product directly from you.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Foster Relationships With Customers</h3> \n<p>By connecting and engaging with your social media followers, you’ll be able to build lasting relationships between them and your business. You can do this by interacting with them on your posts, responding to their questions and comments, and providing them with any help they may need.</p> \n<p>You can also ask your followers questions about your products, their pain points, or create giveaways to help you build trust and show them how much you value their input and support.</p> \n<h3>4. Learn From Competitors</h3> \n<p>Social media is a great way to keep tabs on your competitors — whether that’s in reference to their social media tactics, the products they’re promoting, the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-campaigns\">campaigns</a> they’re implementing, or their level of interaction with followers.</p> \n<p>Social media allows you to get a look at what is and isn’t working for your competition, and therefore helps you decide what should or shouldn’t change in terms of <em>your</em> company’s approach. Lastly, reviewing the social accounts of your competitors can help you make sure your marketing stands out and is unique to your brand.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/competitive-analysis-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Learn how to conduct a competitive analysis to discover how you can beat the competition.</em></a></p> \n<p>Now, let’s talk strategy — there are five steps to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/sustainable-social-media-strategy\">ensure your social media marketing plan is sustainable</a> and positively impacts your business.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<p>Let’s cover these steps in more detail so you can begin applying them to your business.</p> \n<h3>1. Research your buyer personas and audience.</h3> \n<p>The first step to creating a social media marketing strategy is to determine who your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a> and audience are so you can target their needs and interests appropriately. To do this, think about the people you’re trying to reach and why, and how you would classify them as a group. For example, if your company sells trendy leggings and joggers, you might classify your target audience as millennials who like to wear stylish athletic apparel regularly — a style known as <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/athleisure.asp\">athleisure</a>.</p> \n<p>By considering your buyer personas and audience, you’ll then be able to determine what content will attract the type followers and customers you hope to gain and how you can create engaging content to keep your followers interested.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Buyer Persona Templates</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Make My Persona Tool</a></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. Determine which social platforms you’ll market on.</h3> \n<p>As a social media marketer, it’s crucial you determine which platforms you’re going to share your content on. There’s not necessarily a right or wrong answer when it comes to which social channels your business should use — it’s more about the needs of your target audience and where they tend to spend their time.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“It's important to be where your audience of potential customers is today, and where they might be tomorrow. It's better to be ahead of the curve than behind.” — Andrew Delaney, Social Media Marketing Manager at HubSpot</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For example, if you are going for that target audience of athleisure-loving millennials, you may want to focus the majority of your social media efforts on <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instagram\">Instagram</a> — this is because <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-demographics/\">millennials</a> cover the largest portion of users on the platform.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resources</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/snapchat-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">A Marketer's Guide to Snapchat for Business</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-ad-examples?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;_ga=2.166263099.465005662.1556543642-1307414301.1541080541\">50 Facebook Ad Examples We Actually Clicked</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">YouTube for Business: A 30-Day Roadmap for Growth</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-twitter-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Use Twitter for Business (+ Follower Tracking Template)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-pinterest-for-business?hubs_post-cta=author\">12 Pinterest Templates for Business</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Create unique and engaging content.</h3> \n<p>With the billions of social media users around the globe, there’s no question that at least <em>some</em> of your followers — or the people browsing your profile — have also seen your competitor’s content or that of other businesses in your industry. That’s why you must have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/proven-social-media-engagement-strategies\">engaging social media content</a> that stands out and provides viewers with a reason to click that “Follow” button and interact with your brand.</p> \n<p>To help you get creative, consider the content your competitors are sharing and how you can uniquely promote your products. Also, take advantage of the features offered by the platform you’re using. For example, you can create live videos on Facebook to share the latest details about a product launch or conduct a giveaway.</p> \n<p>Lastly, use your current customers and promoters to help you generate content. You can do this by re-posting their content or encouraging them to use a hashtag to share their own experiences and pictures with your products (similar to Frye’s Instagram hashtag that I mentioned earlier).</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>4. Organize a schedule for your posts.</h3> \n<p>One of the easiest ways to ensure your content is shared as planned is to use a social media management solution. These tools allow you to write captions, prepare pictures and videos, and schedule posts in advance. They also automatically share your content on schedule and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29437/20-free-social-media-and-brand-monitoring-tools-that-rock.aspx?_ga=2.150639797.2053315133.1572189466-237440449.1568656505\">monitor</a> all post interactions and engagement for you. Social media management solutions save you time and allow you to focus on your other tasks.</p> \n<p>There are a number of solution options available — here are a few examples.</p> \n<h5>1) HubSpot</h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot</a> offers a social media tool — as part of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">marketing software</a> — to help you publish and monitor your content and create real connections with your followers. You can schedule and publish your content in advance and compare in-depth reports on your posts’ engagement to understand the performance of various platforms, types of content, and posting times.</p> \n<h5>2) Sprout Social</h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/social-media/sprout-social\">Sprout Social</a> is a social media marketing and management solution designed to help your team organize and plan content creation, manage campaigns, understand engagement, and review content reports and analysis.</p> \n<h5>3) Hootsuite</h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\">Hootsuite</a> is a social media management platform for finding, scheduling, managing, and reporting on your content. You can schedule posts in advance on <em>all</em> of your channels at once and measure your ROI with comprehensive content analysis.</p> \n<h4>How often should you post on social media?</h4> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering how often you should post content on your social media channels.</p> \n<p>As a rule of thumb, you should only post on social when you have <em>quality</em> content to share. Meaning, there’s a reason you’re posting the content. This is how you’ll strike the right balance when it comes to your posting frequency. If you post too <em>infrequently</em>, you’re bound to be forgotten by your followers. If you post too <em>frequently</em>, you’ll likely become annoying to your followers. Both situations could potentially lead to a loss in followers and a decrease in engagement.</p> \n<p>To avoid this, there are plenty of studies and resources available explaining <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-frequency-industry-benchmarks\">social media post frequency standards by industry</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-frequently-should-i-publish-on-social-media\">platform</a> for you to follow. Every business is different, so find what works for your audience. Then, you can begin experimenting with more or fewer posts, as well as other factors such as the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic\">time of day you’re posting on social</a>, to determine what provides the highest level of engagement.</p> \n<h3>5. Analyze your impact and results.</h3> \n<p>One of the most important aspects of social media marketing is ensuring your efforts are successful in helping you meet your goals. To determine this, you’ll need to keep track of all of your posts, on every channel. You can do this by reviewing and managing your social media metrics.</p> \n<h4>Social Media Metrics</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-metrics-that-matter/\">Social media metrics</a> are data related to the success of your posts and your impact on your audience and customers on various platforms. These metrics may include data about your level of engagement, likes, follows, shares, and all other interactions on each platform.</p> \n<p>Here are 10 of the most important metrics for you to track:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> This includes clicks, comments, likes, and replies on your social media posts. There are also platform-specific types of engagement such as “<a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/1744643532522513\">Saved</a>” posts on Instagram and “<a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/create-a-pin-from-your-photos\">Pinned</a>” posts on Pinterest.</li> \n <li><strong>Reach: </strong>The number of people who have seen any content associated with your page or profile is your reach.</li> \n <li><strong>Followers: </strong>This is the number of people you have on your profile who have clicked your “Follow” button and see your content in their feeds regularly.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions: </strong>This is the number of times a post from your profile or page is seen, whether or not your audience members click on it. This is often what happens when someone is scrolling through their newsfeed, but not clicking on anything.</li> \n <li><strong>Video views: </strong>On Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or any other social channel with video capabilities, this is the number of views each gets.</li> \n <li><strong>Profile visits: </strong>The number of people who have opened your social media page is your number of profile visits.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentions: </strong>This is the number of times your profile has been mentioned by audience members in their posts.</li> \n <li><strong>Tags: </strong>This is when your audience adds the name of your company’s profile or your hashtag to another post.</li> \n <li><strong>Reposts: </strong>This is when a member of your audience posts a piece of your content on their profile.</li> \n <li><strong>Shares: </strong>These are the posts your followers and audience take from your profile and share with their network.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>You can influence all of these metrics, increase your social following, and improve overall engagement on your profile by using the same tactics you would to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing#Generate-leads-and-boost-conversions\">generate leads and boost conversions</a>. You can also interact with your followers more frequently by talking to them, tagging them in content, responding to their questions, liking their posts, encouraging them to use your hashtags, and share your content (and you can also repost user-generated content).</p> \n<h5><strong>How to Measure Social Media Metrics</strong></h5> \n<p>You can review social media metrics in a variety of ways, For example, you can use the analytics tools built into the various platforms you use. Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/analytics.html\">Twitter Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.facebook.com/\">Facebook Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/1533933820244654\">Instagram Insights</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>You might also choose to use an analytics and tracking tool such as <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#/provision\">Google Analytics</a>. This is a great option if you want to track your social media <em>and</em> website metrics. Lastly, many <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing#social-media-scheduling-solutions\">social media scheduling solutions</a> — as we reviewed earlier — have monitoring and tracking features automatically built in. All of these metrics tracking tools will give you a better understanding of what your followers and audience respond well to and what you should consider modifying to improve engagement.</p> \n<p>Now that we’ve reviewed the benefits of social media marketing and how to build your strategy, let’s talk about the various resources available to help you along the way.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Social Media Marketing Resources</strong></h2> \n<p>There are a plethora of social media marketing resources you can use to build a social strategy for your company.

This can be even more problematic for brands in physically isolated areas.</p>  \n<p>Take Australia for example. Its distance from other English-speaking regions like America and Europe can make it challenging for marketers to spread brand awareness globally. Ultimately, to gain even regional awareness, Australian brands must build competitive and innovative marketing strategies to stand out and grab attention from audiences.</p> \n<p>So, what do you do when you work for a brand in a place like Australia, and just can't come up with a marketing idea that takes your company to the next level?</p> \n<p>Look to award-winning brands for inspiration.</p> \n<p>One great place to start could be country-specific award ceremonies.

But, the young brand found it difficult to compete with beer brands that already had decades of Australian credibility and brand loyalty behind them.</p> \n<p>But, after the new beer brand teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.clemengerbbdo.com.au/en\">Clemenger BBDO</a> to launch ads targeting young adult adventurers and older Australian beer lovers -- Great Northern became <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/press_room/316/detail\">the top-selling beer in Australia</a>.</p> \n<p>Great Northern's effective advertising strategy involved video content and commercials that embraced young and old beer drinkers, as well as Australia's great outdoors. One of the most memorable pieces of content within the Great Northern strategy was a video called, \"The Great ReCamp.\"</p> \n<p>The mini-documentary, which launched ahead of Father's Day in 2019, tells the story of a real father and adult son who go camping after a life-threatening cancer diagnosis.</p> \n<p>The video begins with the words, \"For most of us, our first memories of the great outdoors begin with our fathers.\"</p> \n<p>After presenting footage of a young boy camping with his dad, the documentary flashes forward into the future where that boy, now an adult, talks about how he loved going camping but eventually lost touch with his family when he moved away to focus on his career.</p> \n<p>After years away, the son explains that he rushed home when his father was battling life-threatening cancer. When his father recovered, the son says he decided to take him on the same camping trip they used to go on.</p> \n<p>The documentary shows visuals of the father and son bonding by the fire, fishing together, swimming in rivers, and subtly drinking Great Northern Beer at multiple points.</p> \n<p>As the camping montage comes to a close, the son narrates, \"We don't need everything we've got these days. Sometimes we need to remind ourselves of that. Camping does that. -- You can't bring everything with you.\"</p> \n<p>The video ends with the two men sitting at their campsite. The father passes his son a Great Northern and asks, \"You know that happy place?\" He looks out at the grassy Australian landscape before clinking beers with his son.</p> \n<p>Text appears that says, \"Sometimes you need to go far and wide to stay close. -- Go camping with Dad this Father's Day.\"</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3Tw9RU6H5M?feature=oembed\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>With content like that above, Great Northern positions itself as a beer for Australian adventurers of all ages. By telling the story of a nostalgic father-son journey, Great Northern ties emotion, relatability, and Australian pride to its beer. This enables the beer to compete against major breweries that have decades of brand loyalty.</p> \n<p>When the Grand Effie was announced, <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/press_room/316/detail\">the Judges' statement</a> said, \"This is a classic case of how good marketing and advertising can still build a minor brand into a market leader.\"</p> \n<p>\"In 2015, XXXX Gold outsold Great Northern by a factor of six to one. Four years later, Great Northern became Australia’s top-selling beer. This was achieved through well-considered insight, strategy, and execution,\" <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/press_room/316/detail\">the statement</a> added. “The Great Northern case study is a model for all students of advertising.”</p> \n<h3>\"Help is Who We Are\" - NRMA Insurance</h3> \n<h4><strong>Award: </strong>2019 Gold Effie</h4> \n<p>After seeing <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2019_009\">customer decline since 2014</a>, NRMA insurance, a home insurance policy company, teamed up with <a href=\"https://themonkeys.com.au/about/\">The Monkeys</a> to create a campaign that brought a <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2019_009\">\"new purpose\"</a> to its brand and product.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disaster/2019-australian-wildfires/#:~:text=At%20least%203%2C500%20homes%20and,3%20of%20the%20burned%20area.\">Australian forest fires</a> rendered koala's nearly extinct, NRMA's campaign aimed to market an initiative where the insurance company would plant a tree for every home insurance policy sold.

After stopping, wondering if he should do something, and ultimately riding away from the bear, the boy lies awake at night with guilt as he stares at a picture of a koala in his bedroom.</p> \n<p>When he returns to the powerline the next day with a wagon, he sees no koala and gets angry -- assuming that it was hurt or killed.</p> \n<p>Luckily, he turns around to find the koala peacefully sitting in his wagon.</p> \n<p>The boy brings the koala to the wilderness, where multiple new trees are planted.

This is an important reminder that sometimes it’s best to go back to your roots, and that exceptional value can be unlocked by reinterpreting what made your brand great to begin with,\" NRMA wrote in <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2019_009\">its Effie submission.</a></p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2019_009\">submission</a>, \"NRMA Insurance reversed 8-years of declining customer numbers and reached customers for the first time since April 2014, despite a growing price premium.\"</p> \n<p>“For an insurance brand synonymous with helping Australians, it made so much sense when we landed on the idea of home insurance for koalas.

Bale</h3> \n<h4><strong>Award:</strong> 2018 Gold Effie</h4> \n<p>Through market research, M.J. Bale, an Australian men's fashion brand, discovered that <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2018_01\">82% of male shoppers think of wool as a winter fabric</a>. Because of this association, M.J. Bale feared that prospects might <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2018_01\">sacrifice a wool suit's classic and professional look</a> for more comfortable attire -- especially in hot climates like Australia.</p> \n<p>To prove that people can comfortably wear suits in any hot climate, M.J. Bale created a line of wool suits -- called \"Cool Wool\" and teamed up with TBWA\\Sydney to launch a partially immersive campaign called, \"Coolest Suit on the Planet.\"</p> \n<p>Half of the campaign featured a video series that was aired in M.J. Bale stores and on its social media channels. This content followed <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3644198/\">Good Morning Britain</a> weatherman <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4316553/\">Alex Beresford</a> as he tracked and traveled to the hottest places on Earth wearing M.J. Bale's Cool Wool suit.</p> \n<p>As the weatherman traveled to areas like China, Africa, and India, which were often over 43 degrees Celsius, M.J. Bale shoppers in Australia could go into the brand's shops, put on a Cool Wool suit, and stand in a heating chamber that enabled them to experience wearing the suit in hot locations around the world.</p> \n<p>You can check out a reel that highlights the overall <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/234929086\">campaign by clicking here</a>.</p> \n<p>According to its <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/AU_2018_01\">Effie submission</a>, ‘The Coolest Suit on the Planet’ campaign increased M.J. Bale suit sales by 78%, rose foot-traffic by 54%, and delivered a 344% ROI</p> \n<p>This was a great example of how videos, influencers, and immersive marketing tactics can be used to address prospects' concerns about a product and persuade them to buy it anyway. By combining in-store experiences and video content, M.J. Bale increased store visits that led to purchases.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, If audiences aren't persuaded to buy an M.J. Bale Cool Wool suit after seeing a weather expert comfortably travel through hot terrain in it, they might be convinced once they actually get to stress-test the outfit for themselves.</p> \n<h3>Dare Iced Coffee's Nonsensical Ads - Lion Dairy and Drinks</h3> \n<h4><strong>Awards:</strong> 2017 Gold and Grand Effies</h4> \n<p>Have you ever felt confused and in a fog before drinking your coffee in the morning? This is a feeling that <a href=\"http://www.dareicedcoffee.com.au/\">Dare Iced Coffee</a> played up to extremes in a series of funny ads that led to Gold and Grand Effies.</p> \n<p>Beginning in 2016, Dare Iced Coffee, and its owner <a href=\"https://www.lionco.com/about-us/our-business/lion-dairy-drinks\">Lion Dairy and Drinks</a>, partnered with <a href=\"https://www.ajfpartnership.com.au/about/\">AJF</a> to create commercials where everyday people do something completely nonsensical because they haven't had their daily dose of iced coffee yet. Once the protagonists in each ad take a sip of the product, they instantly start thinking clearly again.</p> \n<p>In one of the campaign's funniest ads, a father named Dave carries his dog in a baby carrier instead of his infant.</p> \n<p>When Dave's friend sees him, waves, and looks confused, an Australian narrator says, \"Uh oh. Dave's got his fur child mixed up with his real child?\" Dave looks down startled to realize the predicament he's placed himself in. Meanwhile, the dog looks up at the camera and barks, \"Dave-o!\"</p> \n<p>From there, the ad cuts to product shots of iced coffee being poured as the narrator explains the taste-related benefits of Dare's product.</p> \n<p>The narration ends with, \"A Dare fix'll fix it!\", as viewers see the father confidently drinking his coffee with his child back in the carrier.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WNQzNFCMCY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Dare's ads were short, sweet, and memorable for their humor. They also impressively manage to fill short 30-second slots with full comedic storylines and valuable facts about Dare coffee. Not only are the ads entertaining, but they also differentiate Dare from its many competitors.</p> \n<p>\"Dare successfully took on Australian iced coffee brands and international pick-me-ups by creating a new consumption occasion: becoming the habitual choice for whenever people are not thinking straight,\" <a href=\"https://www.effie.org/press_room/236/detail\">notes an article on the Effies' official website</a>. \"Effie judges noted that the strategic challenge was significant given the breadth and strength of competition in the category. The objective was both clear and ambitious, and delivered outstanding growth and ROI.\"</p> \n<h3>Narellan Pools' Data-Driven Ad Campaign - Narellan Pools</h3> \n<h4><strong>Awards:</strong> 2016 Gold Effie</h4> \n<p>Because most of its customers only consider installing pools in the summer months, <a href=\"https://narellanpools.com.au/\">Narellan Pools</a> wanted to create a marketing strategy that would increase conversion earlier in the year.</p> \n<p>Narellan worked with <a href=\"https://affinity.ad/\">Affinity</a>, an Australian agency, to build a database of market research, their company's conversion history, and weather data to determine the times of the year when interested pool prospects were getting serious about home installations.</p> \n<p>Through the data-backed strategy, Narellan and Affinity discovered that the most optimal time for pool-related conversions was during the <a href=\"https://affinity.ad/work/diving-into-data-for-narellan-pools/\">first two consecutively warm days of each calendar year</a>. From there, Narellan increased ad spend and targeting of prospective pool buyers just before the weather started to get warm, with some of the heaviest spend being used during the first two consecutive hot days.</p> \n<p>The content within the targeted ads emphasized the \"bliss\" one feels when diving into a pool. Here's one of the ads, titled, \"A Splash of Bliss.\"</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/135936603?app_id=122963\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>The short video shows a woman diving into a pool as a narrator describes how magical an early morning swim can feel -- especially in a Narellan Pool.</p> \n<p>Through Narellan and Affinity's data-driven strategy, Narellan reduced its <a href=\"https://affinity.ad/work/diving-into-data-for-narellan-pools/\">annual media spend by 30% while increasing sales by 23%</a>.</p> \n<p>Below is a video case study that describes how the paid ad strategy worked:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/204136316?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Narellan's strategy is a great example of how brands can leverage data to learn more about prospective buyers and make their advertising tactics even more effective.</p> \n<p>\"Our data-driven targeting allowed maximized exposure of our insightful campaign to exactly the right audience – and only at their tipping point of purchase consideration – delivering game-changing results,\" <a href=\"https://affinity.ad/work/diving-into-data-for-narellan-pools/\">Affinity notes on its website</a>.</p> \n<h2>Australian Effie Nominees</h2> \n<h3>\"You don't need Australia's Best Network -- Until You Do.\" - Telstra</h3> \n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.telstra.com.au/\">Telstra</a> -- a telecommunications brand used by millions of Australians -- partnered with <a href=\"https://themonkeys.com.au/\">The Monkeys</a> for a series of advertisements showing how people benefit from a strong network.</p> \n<p>One of the campaign's most emotional and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inclusive-marketing-campaigns\">inclusive</a> ads follows a man coming out about his sexuality to his parents by telling them he's engaged to his partner.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the ad, the couple sits in their car following a proposal. The man who was proposed to nervously wonders how he's going to tell his parents as his supportive partner says, \"You'll have to tell them sometime.\"</p> \n<p>When the nervous man whispers, \"I'm gonna do it,\" and pulls out his phone, he sees he has no reception. His partner says, \"It's okay. Use mine.\"</p> \n<p>Using his partner's smartphone powered by Telstra's network, the man successfully reaches his parents and nervously reveals he's engaged to a male partner. The parents happily congratulate and accept the son for who he is.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqZm-_ESz1E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Telstra's campaign and the commercial above is effective because it highlights the major milestones or moments when we all want or need our phone service to work properly. Not only does the ad show us how well the service works, but it also allows us to relate to the brand and its mission on a more human level.</p> \n<p>“Whether it’s sharing big news, changing plans in a hurry, or quickly looking up something important, it’s nice to know that Australia’s best network is there for you when you need it,\" said The Monkeys' Creative Director Stuart Alexander <a href=\"https://www.adnews.com.au/campaigns/telstra-demonstrates-moments-where-only-the-best-network-will-do\">in an interview</a>.</p> \n<h3>\"The Bedroom Report\" - Bedshed</h3> \n<p>Working with the Australian agency <a href=\"https://rare.com.au/\">Rare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bedshed.com.au/\">Bedshed</a> -- an Australian bedding chain -- launched a campaign that merged great video content with market research data.</p> \n<p>The first portion of Bedshed's initiative involved a two-year study where the brand surveyed consumers all over Australia about sleeping habits.</p> \n<p>Once the survey was complete, Bedshed launched a web page -- which looks like a large interactive infographic -- to highlight interesting findings. Many of the facts revealed in this study explain how important sleep is to overall health, what gets in the way of it, and how purchasing a great bed and mattress can help prevent insomnia.</p> \n<p>For example, Bedshed's study found that \"23% of men talk in their sleep,\" while 66% of their partners lie awake listening to what they say. It also revealed that 1.7 million people wake up in the middle of the night due to bad pillows or mattresses.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the%20bedroom%20report.gif?width=600&amp;name=the%20bedroom%20report.gif\" alt=\"the bedroom report bedshed campaign\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Along with creating a data-fueled web experience, Bedshed launched a series of ads that present key study findings and direct prospects to its store to learn more or try a new mattress:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDCC_doA6GA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Bedshed's campaign is a great example of how a brand can draw audiences with data-driven content. Its detailed research also positions the brand as an expert in the crowded bed industry.</p> \n<p>When a prospect is shopping for an expensive product -- like a bed -- they might want to get recommendations from a person who knows a lot about the product. After seeing Bedshed's content, these prospects might think that a company that knows so much about its industry will sell good quality products.</p> \n<h2>What We Can Learn From Effie Winners</h2> \n<p>Even if you don't have a huge budget or an agency to help you market your brand, here are a few strategies that any brand can use to spread brand awareness and engage new audiences -- just like the companies above:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Be human:</strong> While Great Northern Brewing embraced fatherhood and Australian Pride to market its product, Dare Iced Coffee made ads that were comedically relatable to coffee drinkers. When your brand's content is relatable, it can also be memorable. Not to mention, people who find brands more relatable and authentic trust them more.</li> \n <li><strong>Embrace a bigger purpose: </strong>Although NRMA sells home insurance, they realized helping the environment would allow them to fulfill an even greater purpose. And, through their marketing, people might trust their brand more because they care about something more beyond policy purchases.</li> \n <li><strong>Leverage data: </strong>While M.J. Bale's campaign was inspired by market research, Narellan Pools' advertising strategy was fueled by analytics. While creativity is key to drawing attention from audiences, data can help you optimize your content and share it at just the right time.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more about the latest Australian marketing tactics, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/australian-websites\">check out this list of the country's most innovative website designs</a>, or these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/stats-about-australian-instagram-users\">fascinating Australian Instagram stats</a>.

One way local businesses can get found by online searchers is through inclusion in business directories.</p> \n</div>  \n<p>Today, Google is inserting itself between consumer and local business websites much more often.</p> \n<p>You need look no further than Google My Business conversion points, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/am-guide-accelerated-mobile-pages\">AMP</a>, and featured snippets for proof.</p> \n<p>So it makes sense to get your local business information into the places people are already going to find businesses like yours, rather than simply hoping they'll find you in search results.</p> \n<p>Getting your local business' NAP (Name, Address, Phone number) information listed on directories, online business listing sites, and citation sites helps to improve visibility, but backlinks from these sites can also have a benefit to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-seo\">SEO</a>. Here are a few things to make sure your company listing has in it once you add it to a directory:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Consistent NAP</strong>. If you add or update your business on multiple business listing sites, make sure you're providing the same company information across each directory.</li> \n <li><strong>A link to your website</strong>. Backlinks -- also known as inbound links -- are crucial to your company website's domain authority. Consider adding a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/sources-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-and-implement-tracking-urls\">tracking link</a> at the end of this URL as well, so you can see how much traffic your website specifically gets from the business directories that are linking to it.</li> \n <li><strong>A company description</strong>. Make sure you have a detailed description of your business that reflects your organization's mission, culture, and values.</li> \n <li><strong>Multimedia</strong>.

In spite of research warning customers of the dangers of cigarettes, Draper delivered the iconic slogan -- \"It's toasted\" -- to differentiate the brand from its competitors.</p> \n<iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GALMX2BO5ps\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>Now, we definitely aren't advocating for smoking cigarettes (or many of Draper's <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/culture/how-long-would-don-draper-live-don-draper-mad-men-life-expectancy\">health choices</a>).

Want to know them? Read on below to find out.</p> \n<h2>What is copywriting?</h2> \n<p>Copywriting is one of the most critical elements of any and all forms of marketing and advertising. Copywriting consists of the words, either written or spoken, marketers use to try to get people to take an action after reading or hearing them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Copywriting is like a call-to-action, but on a bigger scale: Copywriters are trying to get people to feel, think, or respond -- or, ideally, to Google the slogan or brand to learn more about the campaign. And where a blog post like this one has the luxury of hundreds of words with which to make a case, copywriters only have a few words to make their case.</p> \n<p>But short and sweet isn't the only characteristic of good copywriting. Keep reading to learn more characteristics of truly memorable copy.</p> \n<h2>6 Traits of Good Copywriting</h2> \n<h3>1) It tilts your perspective.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, all a message needs to break through is a slight shift in angle. We've grown so accustomed to blocking out marketing messages, we don't even see them anymore. One of the most powerful things a copywriter can do is break down a reader's guard with an unexpected approach. Every story has a myriad of angles -- your job as a copywriter is to find the one that resonates.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/594ab5f61700002000102212.png?width=600&amp;name=594ab5f61700002000102212.png\" alt=\"594ab5f61700002000102212.png\" title=\"594ab5f61700002000102212.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://ppdsilencesucks.com/\"><em>Silence Sucks</em></a></span>\n</div> \n<p>This ad from Sage Therapeutics pressing the importance of talking about postpartum depression works because instead of asking readers to care about something they don't know, it puts them in the position of experiencing the struggle that mothers suffering do. Did they miss some readers who quickly passed by the ad thinking it was for adult pacifiers? Most definitely. But the ad resonated that much more thoroughly with those who read it.</p> \n<p>The next time you sit down to write, try out this approach. Don't take the topic head on. Instead, ask yourself why it matters. Each time you write down an answer, challenge yourself to push it further. Find the larger story happening behind your message.</p> \n<h3>2) It finds connections.</h3> \n<p>In 1996, Steve Jobs let the cat out of the bag. He was <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive//4.02/jobs.html?person=steve_jobs&amp;topic_set=wiredpeople\">speaking with a journalist from <em>Wired</em> on the topic of creativity</a> and explained:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after awhile.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Let's say you have to write an ad for a new pair of sneakers. You could take the assignment head on. You could write about the elasticity of the shoe's sole or the lightweight design. Indeed, many have. Or you could put all of that aside and instead draw the connection between the product and the experience it evokes.</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 503px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-398023691-png/Run_ad.png?width=503&amp;name=Run_ad.png\" alt=\"Run_ad\" width=\"503\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <em><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/401242648028519555/\">Pinterest</a></em></span></p> \n<p>Two things are happening in this ad. First, the copy recognizes that for many, running isn't about running at all -- it's about solitude, peace, and restoring sanity to an otherwise hectic life. Second, not only does Nike connect the ad to the experience of running, it actually connects to the sound that those shoes make as they hit the pavement.</p> \n<p>This ad is about the complexity of one's life fading away and being replaced by simplicity and clarity. As the copy progresses, the sentences simplify and the copy's complexity is slowly replaced by the simple and rhythmic pounding of words: run, run, run, run. The same rhythm one hears when all but their footsteps have faded away. <em>That's</em>&nbsp;connection.</p> \n<h3>3) It has a stunning lead.</h3> \n<p>The following are all headlines or leading sentences from <a href=\"http://www.urbandaddy.com/home/bos\">Urban Daddy</a>, an email-based magazine drawing attention to new products, experiences, and eateries.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"Six days. That’s how long you have until 65% of your body is turkey.\"</li> \n <li>\"There are 8,760 hours in a year. And just one hour in which a stand will be dispensing gratis latkes with homemade applesauce and sour cream in Harvard Square. Yeah, it’s not fair. But 60 minutes is 60 minutes.\"</li> \n <li>\"Ewoks. Talk about living.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>What's common among each of these leads? They make us want to read the next line. I mean, seriously, how much do you want to know <a href=\"http://www.urbandaddy.com/bos/leisure/13450/Tree_Spa_at_Hidden_Pond_Getting_Massaged_in_a_Maine_Treehouse_Boston_BOS_Service\">where that Ewok thing is headed</a>?</p> \n<p>There's an adage in copywriting that's loosely credited to copywriter and business owner Joe Sugarman, which roughly states that the purpose of the headline is to get you to read the first line. The purpose of the first line is to get you to read the second line, and so on. In short, if your first line doesn't enthrall your readers, all is lost.</p> \n<h3>4) It is born out of listening.</h3> \n<p>Seeing its plans to launch yet another gym in the greater Boston region, an outsider might have called the Harrington family a wee bit crazy. The market was already flush with gyms, including a new breed of luxury ones that seemed to be in an arms war for the flashiest perks. Gyms across the region were offering massage services, smoothie bars, and fleets of personal trainers. And GymIt wouldn't have any of that.</p> \n<p>What did <a href=\"http://www.gymit.com/about/\">GymIt</a> have? An understanding of its core audience. Before launching its new gym, the brand did a ton of listening to its primary market of gym-goers. For many in GymIt's target market, the added benefits associated with luxury gyms were nice to have, but came with a lot of baggage -- namely expensive rates and overly complex contracts.</p> \n<p>GymIt decided to simplify the gym-going experience for people who predominately cared about getting in and working out. The copy in its launch campaign and across its marketing materials reflects that understanding.</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-397765571-png/GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png?width=600&amp;name=GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png\" alt=\"GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs\" width=\"600\" title=\"GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs\"></p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/listen-carefully/\">an older blog post</a>, <em>Copyblogger</em>'s Robert Bruce put this nicely. \"Humble yourself and truly serve your audience, listen to their needs and desires, listen to the language they use,\" he said. \"If you listen carefully, your audience can eventually give you everything you need, including much of your copy. Get out of their way.\"</p> \n<h3>5) It avoids jargon and hyperbole.</h3> \n<p>Groundbreaking. Revolutionary. Business Solutions. Targetable Scale. Ideation. Evidence-based approaches. Industry-wide best practices.</p> \n<p>Have I lost you yet?</p> \n<p>When writers struggle to convey what is truly special about their company, product, or service, they sometimes fall back on jargon or hyperbole to underscore their point. The truth is, good copywriting doesn't need dressing up. Good copywriting should speak to the reader in human terms.</p> \n<p>This isn't to say you should never celebrate awards or achievements. Just be direct in the way you <em>explain</em> that achievement. This homepage from <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a> does a nice job of highlighting its popularity in concrete terms.</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/basecamp-copywriting-example.png?width=600&amp;name=basecamp-copywriting-example.png\" alt=\"basecamp-copywriting-example.png\" title=\"basecamp-copywriting-example.png\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<h3>6) It cuts out excess.</h3> \n<p>Good writing gets to the point -- and that means cutting out excessive phrases, and rewording your sentences to be more direct. In an ad celebrating its \"academic\" readership, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/\"><em>The Economist</em></a> playfully demonstrates this below.</p> \n<p><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-400349025-jpg/economist-1.jpg?width=600&amp;name=economist-1.jpg\" alt=\"economist-1\" width=\"600\" title=\"economist-1\"></p> \n<p>How do you rid excess words from your writing? It's half practice, half knowing where to cut. This <a href=\"http://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-techniques-for-more-precise-writing/\">article from <em>Daily Writing Tips</em></a> is one of the most effective summaries I've found on precise writing. Included in its tips:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reduce verb phrases:</strong> For instance, turn \"The results are suggestive of the fact that\" to \"The results suggest.\"</li> \n <li><strong>Reduce wordy phrases to single words:</strong> You can change \"in order to\" into \"to.\" Another example: Turn \"Due to the fact that\" into \"because.\"</li> \n <li><strong>Avoid vague nouns:</strong> Phrases formed around general nouns like \"in the area of\" or \"on the topic of\" clutter sentences.</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-techniques-for-more-precise-writing/\">Read the full list of brevity tips here</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In general, if you can afford to cut without losing the meaning of a sentence, do so. Push yourself to strip down your word count. Turn 50-word homepage copy into 25, then push yourself again to make that 25-word sentence into 15 words. It's not about brevity so much as it is about making sure every word counts in your writing.</p> \n<p>Since my last point was about getting to the point, I'll keep this brief: <em>Words matter</em>. Every time you sit down to write an ad, web page, video script, or other content for your company, you have the opportunity to break through to people. Find those opportunities in your marketing and make sure that you've made the most of them.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n <span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-544ec352-b131-458a-944d-20a70edea831\"><a href=\"https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/544ec352-b131-458a-944d-20a70edea831\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/544ec352-b131-458a-944d-20a70edea831.png\" alt=\"free guide to writing well\"></a></span>   </span>E\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgood-copywriting-practices-list&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"916662064ded2c7b71e5e0095f6eedae","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/594ab5f61700002000102212.png?width=600&name=594ab5f61700002000102212.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-01-489_d12ed0e0ed84be30.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-398023691-png/Run_ad.png?width=503&name=Run_ad.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-55-059_8095887b877b29ca.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-397765571-png/GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png?width=600&name=GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/basecamp-copywriting-example.png?width=600&name=basecamp-copywriting-example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn35@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-51-792_c1b0e5aadf16cbfb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-400349025-jpg/economist-1.jpg?width=600&name=economist-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn76@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-48-954_867a8bec1d37c27b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/544ec352-b131-458a-944d-20a70edea831.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-10-955_7b6bc1a365300aad.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgood-copywriting-practices-list&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-07-469_7ee22c63aa88ffd0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624915},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"50 Lucrative Blog Niches & Finding One That Works for You","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-niche-ideas","description":"<p>There's an obscure album by an equally obscure guitarist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Baker\">Duck Baker</a>&nbsp;called<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_Something_for_Everyone_in_America\">There's Something for Everyone in America</a></em>.

Everyone has something that's meaningful and interesting to them in its own right, and in a lot of cases, those kinds of passions and pursuits can be channeled into a well-crafted, consistently maintained blog property.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll go over what you need to consider when choosing a niche blog topic and look into 50 potential blog niche ideas you can choose from.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How to Choose Your Niche Blog Topic</h2> \n<p>So what should you blog about? How do you land on the topic that will resonate most with readers and keep you fulfilled in the long run? Well, first and foremost, you need to consider your areas of expertise.</p> \n<p>Where are you an authority? What can you talk about comfortably and compellingly? If you write a blog in some niche you only halfway understand, readers won't be receptive to it. They want to hear from an expert — someone who can demonstrate that they're qualified to offer tips or trustworthy opinions. But it doesn't end there.</p> \n<p>Writing a blog is a <em>personal</em> pursuit, so you need to write about something that bears <em>personal</em> significance. What do you <em>like</em> to write about? There has to be some degree of joy and enthusiasm behind your blog.</p> \n<p>It takes a lot of work to maintain a blog. It's tough to keep that effort up if you don't actually enjoy what you're writing about. You have to start your blog under the assumption that it will take a while to get off the ground.</p> \n<p>You're probably not going to be able to monetize your site or sell ad space immediately, so you need to be in it — in large part — for the love of the sport.</p> \n<p>Your niche has to reflect your passion because you'll probably be writing for the sake of writing for a while. Attracting an audience neither easy nor a given. If you don't care about your preferred topic, you'll be less inclined to stick it out.</p> \n<h3>Careers and Education</h3> \n<h4>1.

Dating</h4> \n<p>Dating can be a minefield, and if you know how to help people navigate it, you can build a sizable, dedicated following.</p> \n<h4>29.

Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there’s a eye-catching percentage by its name. But, deep down, we all know that some metrics are more revealing than others.</p> \n<p>There are a ton of KPIs that provide minimal insights. Fortunately, though, we created this guide to help you navigate YouTube Analytics and measure the metrics that actually matter. It’ll save you from drowning in the sea of analytics that most marketers only have a lifebuoy in, helping you not only stay afloat, but swim safely to land.</p> \n<p>Read on to learn about the YouTube metrics that actually matter, and how they’ll enhance your video strategy.</p> \n<h2>YouTube Analytics: The 15 Metrics That Actually Matter</h2> \n<h3>1. Watch Time</h3> \n<p>Watch time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your videos. It’s a key metric because YouTube elevates videos and channels with higher watch times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more watch time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm presumes it is.</p> \n<p>In the watch time report, you can see the amount of watch time your videos have accumulated. You can also rank each of your videos by watch time and group your videos by themes, styles, and lengths to determine your most engaging types of videos.</p> \n<h3>2. Average Percentage Viewed</h3> \n<p>Average percentage viewed is the percent of each video the average viewer watched. It measures your video’s ability to hold viewers’ attention for its entirety. And when YouTube realizes your videos can hold people’s attention, they’ll reward it with higher search and recommendation rankings. You can find this metric in your watch time report.</p> \n<h3>3. Average View Duration</h3> \n<p>Average view duration is the total watch time of your video divided by the total number of video plays, including replays. This metric measures your video’s ability to engage viewers. If your video can’t engage viewers, they’ll bounce from your video quickly, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. But if your video can engage viewers, your average view duration and total watch time will increase at the same time, boosting your search and recommendations rankings. You can also find this metric in your watch time report.</p> \n<h3>4. Audience Retention</h3> \n<p>Audience retention shows you the percentage of viewers who watch and leave your video at every single moment of the video. YouTube elevates videos with high audience retention in their search rankings and suggestions because these videos can effectively capture viewers' attention.</p> \n<p>Audience retention can also inform your future video strategy. The most engaging parts of your video could be your next best video topics. And watching your video during steep dips of engagement will tell you what might be boring your viewers, allowing you to scrap those elements from current and future videos.</p> \n<p>In YouTube’s audience retention report, there will be two graphs: the absolute retention curve and relative retention curve. The absolute retention curve shows you how well your videos retain viewers. And the relative retention shows you how well one of your videos retains viewers compared to all other YouTube videos of similar length.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200-15.png\" title=\"YouTube Audience Retention Graph\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>5. Re-watches</h3> \n<p>Re-watches are the amount of times viewers re-watch certain parts of your video. If a lot of people are re-watching a specific part of your video, then they’re probably interested in the topic your video is covering during that moment. These topics can be fodder for your future video strategy. You can find this data in the absolute audience retention graph. Re-watches are usually indicated by rising curves in the graph.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(1)-2.png\" title=\"YouTube Re-Watch Graph\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>6. Engagement</h3> \n<p>Comments, shares, likes, and dislikes provides marketers with a lot of valuable qualitative data.</p> \n<p>Comments can paint a clear picture of your video’s emotional effect on viewers. Shares can gauge how much viewers value your content and brand -- since <a href=\"https://contently.com/strategist/2018/02/02/brand-needs-conscience/\">people share content that confirms their ideal self-persona</a>, people who share your video are publicly displaying that they trust and support your brand. Likes and dislikes can help you determine what video topics work best with your particular audience. You can find your videos’ engagement metrics in YouTube’s Interactions Report.</p> \n<h3>7. Impressions Click-Through Rate</h3> \n<p>Impressions click-through rate measures your video’s ability to prompt people to watch your video after seeing it on their homepage, recommendation section, or trending section. A high click-through rate means your title was compelling and your video’s topic resonates with a lot of relevant audiences on YouTube.</p> \n<p>A common trend for impression click-through rates is that they usually spike immediately after you release your video -- your subscribers will see the video at the top of their home page and probably click on it. But once your video spreads beyond your core audience, your click-through rate will decline and then stay at a stable rate.</p> \n<p>You can also couple this metric with average percentage viewed and average view duration to see if people actually watch your video after they click on it. A high click-through rate is great, but if people are leaving right at the beginning of your video, your title or thumbnail could be misleading. Preparing viewers for what’s to come is crucial because if your title or thumbnail is inaccurate, they’ll feel deceived and lose trust in your brand.</p> \n<p>A low click-through rate but high engagement could mean that the video has a small yet specific audience that is enamored by the content. Go to the Analytics tab in YouTube Studio to examine this metric.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(2).png\" title=\"YouTube Impressions Click-Through-Rate Table\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>8. Card Click-Through-Rate</h3> \n<p>Cards are slide-in panels that encourage people to take a desired action during a video like watch another video, subscribe to a channel, or click through to a different website. Each of your cards’ click-through rate tells you which action your viewers prefer to take while watching your videos. This can help you place the most engaging card in each of your videos, potentially boosting your watch time, subscriber growth, or website traffic.</p> \n<p>Analyzing card click-through rates can also help you uncover the optimal timing, placement, and duration of your cards in future videos. You can find your cards’ click-through rates in the Cards Report.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(3).png\" title=\"YouTube Card Click-Through-Rate Chart\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>9. Playlist Engagement</h3> \n<p>Playlists are a great way to organize your videos in a digestible way. It helps your viewers easily consume videos about their favorite topics and prompts them to keep watching, which racks up watch time for your channel.</p> \n<p>You can uncover your playlist engagement by analyzing two metrics in YouTube’s Playlist Report: views per playlist start and average time in playlist. Views per playlist start is the average number of video views your playlists gather, and average time in playlist is the average amount of time that viewers viewed the videos in your playlist. If these two metrics are underperforming, try starting your playlist with videos that have the highest retention rate.</p> \n<h3>10. Unique Viewers</h3> \n<p>Unique viewers is the estimated number of individuals who watch your videos over a certain period of time. This metric really helps you understand the actual size of your audience.</p> \n<p>You can also use this metric to gauge your subscriber’s engagement with your videos. If your unique viewers are lower than your subscriber count, then your subscribers aren’t watching as much of your video as they could be. To get them to be more active, ask them to set up notifications for your new videos. You can find this metric under the Reach Views and Audience tab in YouTube Studio.</p> \n<h3>11. Views Per Unique Viewers</h3> \n<p>Views per unique viewers is the amount of times the average viewer watches your video. This metric tells you if people can’t get enough of your video and keep rewatching it. Video topics with a lot of views per unique viewers could also be your most popular content topics, and if you cover them more, you could generate more views, watch time, and subscribers.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(4).png\" title=\"YouTube Views Per Unique Viewers Graph\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>12. Who’s Watching Your Videos</h3> \n<p>In YouTube’s demographics report, you can see the different types of people who watch your videos, segmented by age, gender, and geography. This data tells you who your most engaged audience is and who your target audience should actually be. You can take the opposite approach with this data too. If you’re not reaching the audience you want, try pivoting your video strategy and cover topics that would attract them.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(5).png\" title=\"YouTube Views Per Unique Viewers Graph\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>13. Subscriber Growth</h3> \n<p>Subscribers are your most loyal fans. They’ve made a public commitment to your brand, content, and values. And they’re most likely to be your evangelists too. Subscribers are also important to your channel because YouTube will send them notifications about your new videos and feature them on their homepage. This means they’ll see your videos more frequently, which’ll help generate more views. <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/discoverability-analytics?cid=analytics-series&amp;hl=en#strategies-zippy-link-3\">Subscribers also watch twice as much video than non-subscribers</a>, so the more subscribers you have, the more watch time your videos will collect.</p> \n<p>YouTube’s Subscribers Report will show you which videos, locations, and time periods gain and lose subscribers. This data will tell you what video topics resonate with your subscribers and where to target new subscribers. And by prioritizing your subscribers’ needs, you’ll create videos that they crave, increase your watch time, and boost your search rankings.</p> \n<h3>14. Traffic Sources</h3> \n<p>External referrals like social media or sites that embed your videos and YouTube referrals like search, the recommended section, and the homepage are all traffic sources. The Traffic Sources report shows you how viewers found your videos and what sources rack up the most views and watch time. You can use this data to better optimize your video promotion strategy.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(6).png\" title=\"YouTube Views Per Unique Viewers Graph\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/course/analytics-series?hl=en\">YouTube</a></p> \n<h3>15. Keywords</h3> \n<p>In YouTube’s Search Report, which is under the Traffic Sources Report, you can see the most popular queries guiding viewers to your videos. If these queries are slightly different than your video’s topic, consider updating your video to fill these content gaps and add the keywords to your metadata. If there’s a stark difference, consider making a new video about these popular queries.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-analytics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3da70d5395d3fdd0c4eae1927842b0ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200-15.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-49-721_dcbc6dd8b3184230.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(1)-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn35@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-47-885_b69e69664dfe2dbd.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(2).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-51-434_bebc3b138f3c65df.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(3).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-13-391_a64f5b3da6f304fc.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(4).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-52-212_cab7bf787842e643.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(5).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn98@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-04-702_5a62107cb65fa8f0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(6).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-03-762_d51b014eef3f2f0e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-analytics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624923},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"11 of the Best Free Google Sheets Templates for 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-sheets-templates","description":"<p>Whether your marketing position requires you to send invoices to clients, track website analytics, or create budget and expense reports, you’ve undoubtedly found yourself working with spreadsheets in some form.</p> \n<p>And if you’re anything like me, those spreadsheets can feel frustratingly tedious when you’re under a time crunch.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Google Sheets offers 26 pre-built templates, allowing you to create reports and analyze data in spreadsheets faster and more effectively.</p> \n<p>Best of all, Google Sheets templates cater to specific categories -- if you click the Paid Traffic Report template, for instance, your spreadsheet is already organized into Overview, 12-month Trends, and Medium Breakdown categories.

There are tabs at the bottom -- setup, income, expenses, summary -- and each one includes a number of subcategories. “Expenses”, for instance, covers everything from taxes and insurance, to travel and customer acquisition. The final tab, \"summary\", takes your income, subtracts your expenses, and automatically updates to display your ending balance each month. This template is a good option if your budget requires a lot of customization and has a lot of moving parts.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/11%20of%20the%20Best%20Free%20Google%20Sheets%20Templates%20for%202019-9.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>3.

Website Paid Traffic Report</h3> \n<p>This template makes the process of analyzing and reporting on paid traffic relatively seamless. It automatically collects data on your paid sources from Google Analytics, and provides a clean chart with important information, including PPC’s percentage of goal conversions, total traffic, and bounce rate. You can also adjust it to compare different time periods, or different channels or segments. If you’re looking for a way to demonstrate paid’s influence on your business, this is the tool to do it.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/11%20of%20the%20Best%20Free%20Google%20Sheets%20Templates%20for%202019-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h2><strong>Google Sheet Templates for Customers</strong></h2> \n<h3>6.

Gantt Chart Template</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/gantt-chart\">Gantt chart template</a> helps you alleviate any concern you might have over timing -- and, when you’ve got a complex project with overlapping components, I’m willing to bet timing is one of your major concerns.

Each sheet can be modified individually without affecting the project as a whole, which can save you tons of time when making edits to individual elements of your graphic.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-layers.png?width=400&amp;height=250&amp;name=photoshop-layers.png\" alt=\"photoshop-layers.png\" title=\"photoshop-layers.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/27507/how-can-i-create-and-batch-this-3d-planes-effect\">StackExchange</a></em></span></p> \n<p>Layers are by far the most important element of Photoshop -- and, in my opinion, they're one of the reasons many people throw their arms up in frustration. But once you understand how they work, I promise they'll make your life much easier.</p> \n<p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> It has its own module on the bottom right-hand corner of your Photoshop screen, by default. You can also access it by clicking \"Layer\" in the top menu bar.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-layers-1.png?width=563&amp;height=435&amp;name=photoshop-layers-1.png\" alt=\"photoshop-layers-1.png\" title=\"photoshop-layers-1.png\" width=\"563\" height=\"435\"></p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><span> <em>Always</em> name your layers. Keeping them organized will help keep you sane, especially if you find yourself working on a project with a large number of layers. </span></span></p> \n<h4>To add or delete a layer:</h4> \n<p>From the top menu bar, choose Layer &gt; New &gt; Layer...</p> \n<h4>To select a layer:</h4> \n<p>The selected layer is highlighted in blue. To edit a specific part of your image, you'll need to select that specific layer.</p> \n<p>You'll also notice there's an \"eye\" symbol next to each layer: Click that symbol to turn the eye on and off, thereby toggling the visibility of that layer as you work.</p> \n<h4>To duplicate a layer:</h4> \n<p>First, select a layer or group in the Layers panel. Next, either drag the layer or group to the Create a New Layer button, or right-click the layer to choose \"Duplicate Layer\" or \"Duplicate Group.\" Enter a name for the layer or group, and click OK.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can do all sorts of cool things with layers -- and believe it or not, making animated GIFs is one of them. </span><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-animated-gif-quick-tip-ht\">Check out our step-by-step tutorial here</a>.</p> \n <p>To learn more about adding, deleting, and duplicating layers in Photoshop, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhxj4goGtj0\">check out this video tutorial</a>.</p> \n <h3>2. The Color &amp; Swatches Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> The Color and Swatches tool lets you use, modify, copy, and save custom colors for your content. While this may seem like a pretty self-explanatory element, it actually has powerful features that will keep your visual content vibrant and unify your color schemes.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> It has its own module on the top right-hand corner of your Photoshop screen, by default.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-color-tool.png?width=532&amp;height=318&amp;name=photoshop-color-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-color-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-color-tool.png\" width=\"532\" height=\"318\"></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another place to find the Color tool is at the bottom of the toolbar on the left, indicated by two overlapping boxes:</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-color-boxes.png?width=235&amp;height=236&amp;name=photoshop-color-boxes.png\" alt=\"photoshop-color-boxes.png\" title=\"photoshop-color-boxes.png\" width=\"235\" height=\"236\"></span></p> \n <h4>To create your own custom color:</h4> \n <p>Open the Color Picker by double-clicking on the top box either in the Color module, or in that menu on the left.</p> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__\">From there, you'll see a vertical spectrum of color with a slider on it, which you can adjust to create your own custom color. Alternatively, if you already have a specific color of which you know the <span>hex value</span> (i.e. #1fb1ee), then enter it in the appropriate box to find that color automatically. <span>You can also select your color swatch based on RGB or CMYK values.</span></span></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-color-picker.png?width=546&amp;height=394&amp;name=photoshop-color-picker.png\" alt=\"photoshop-color-picker.png\" title=\"photoshop-color-picker.png\" width=\"546\" height=\"394\"></span></p> \n <p>Any colors you create can be added to your \"Swatches\" if you click \"Add To Swatches.\"</p> \n <p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Take your company colors and save them as “Swatches” so that you can reference and reuse them whenever you’re designing your visual content.</p> \n <h3>3. Custom Fonts &amp; The Text Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> The Text tool lets you add custom fonts to your database, and it gives you access to advanced font settings that give your text some serious style.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located: </strong>The toolbar on your left, near the bottom.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-text-tool.png?width=431&amp;height=284&amp;name=photoshop-text-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-text-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-text-tool.png\" width=\"431\" height=\"284\"></p> \n <p>Once you click the Text tool icon, all of the settings and font options will pop up at the top of your screen. These settings let you change the font, font size, and spacing between characters, height, width, color, and style. Be sure to select the layer of your desired text to edit it.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-text-tool-options.png?width=669&amp;height=267&amp;name=photoshop-text-tool-options.png\" alt=\"photoshop-text-tool-options.png\" title=\"photoshop-text-tool-options.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"267\"></p> \n <h4>To add text to your graphic:</h4> \n <p>The text tool works like any other text tool you’ve used. Click the \"T\" icon on the left side bar, drag the text box over any particular area you want text to appear, and you’re set to go.</p> \n <p><strong>Whenever you create a text box, Photoshop will generate a layer for it.</strong> You can choose the color, size, stroke, font style, and a variety of other options to switch things up.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-editing-text.png?width=669&amp;height=427&amp;name=photoshop-editing-text.png\" alt=\"photoshop-editing-text.png\" title=\"photoshop-editing-text.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"427\"></p> \n <p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>While Photoshop offers a wide variety of fonts, you can also install your own fonts. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/28-free-fonts-beautify-content\">Read this blog post for a list of 35 beautiful fonts</a> you can download for free, and then <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/type/install-instructions.html\">read this post</a> to learn how to install your new fonts in Photoshop so you can get to using 'em.</p> \n <p>To learn more about fonts and the Text tool, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=018lVE-Afm0\">check out this video tutorial</a>.</p> \n <h3>4. Custom Brushes &amp; The Brush Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> Just as with fonts, you can add your own, royalty-free, custom brush tips. With the brush settings, you can change the size, shape, and transparency of your brush strokes to achieve a number of different visual effects.</p> \n <p>Brushes are a great way to add some visual accents to your content. Photoshop starts you off with a nice selection of brush tips that you can use to clean up your graphics and create some basic visual effects.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> The toolbar on the left.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-brush-tool.png?width=458&amp;height=322&amp;name=photoshop-brush-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-brush-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-brush-tool.png\" width=\"458\" height=\"322\"></p> \n <p>Once you click the Brush tool icon, all of the settings and brush options will pop up at the top of your screen. These settings let you change the brush size, opacity, flow, and so on. You'll find a variety of pre-installed brush tips, as well as any custom brush tips you install to Photoshop. (You can find royalty-free brushes at <a href=\"http://www.brusheezy.com\">www.brusheezy.com</a> if you want to get really creative.)</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-brush-settings.png?width=669&amp;height=298&amp;name=photoshop-brush-settings.png\" alt=\"photoshop-brush-settings.png\" title=\"photoshop-brush-settings.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"298\"></p> \n <h4>To use the brush tool:</h4> \n <p>The brush tool is perfect for adding design accents to your content content. When using the brush tool, I always suggest adding a new layer to work with so you don’t paint over any of your other elements. You can choose colors from your library of swatches, or use a custom color.</p> \n <p>Changing the brush settings can give your brush a drastically different look and style. Don’t be afraid to play around a bit with all of your custom brushes.</p> \n <h3>5. The Select Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Is: </strong>When used correctly, this tool will let you select individual elements, entire graphics, and determines what is copied, cut, and pasted into your graphics.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> The toolbar on the left.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/select-tool.png?width=320&amp;height=302&amp;name=select-tool.png\" alt=\"select-tool.png\" title=\"select-tool.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"302\"></p> \n <p>The Select tool is known as one of the most basic, yet frustrating tools to use in Photoshop. The first thing you should know is that it'll only work if a layer is highlighted. So, if I want to cut or copy a piece of Layer 4, Layer 4 must be highlighted in my Layer's tool bar. Highlighted areas are indicated by a flashing dotted line.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-select-dotted-line.png?width=547&amp;height=419&amp;name=photoshop-select-dotted-line.png\" alt=\"photoshop-select-dotted-line.png\" title=\"photoshop-select-dotted-line.png\" width=\"547\" height=\"419\"></p> \n <p>Once you remember to pay attention to which layer you are working with, the Select tool becomes <em>much</em> easier to use.</p> \n <p>First, highlight your area of choice. Then, simply right-click and decide what you'd like to do from the pull-out menu. For example, you can cut out objects from a current layer and create a layer of your own.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-select-menu.png?width=669&amp;height=444&amp;name=photoshop-select-menu.png\" alt=\"photoshop-select-menu.png\" title=\"photoshop-select-menu.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"444\"></p> \n <h4>How to select an image to insert into your graphic:</h4> \n <p>Open the image you'd like to use in Photoshop, and use the Select Tool to determine how much of the image you want to copy. Once you’ve selected the area of the image, simply copy the area.</p> \n <p>Next, open the tab for your current project and paste it in as a new layer. Highlight the layer of the object(s) you'd like to select. You can move multiple objects at once by highlighting multiple layers.</p> \n <p>Then, right-click your selection, and then you have a few options, including:</p> \n <p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>A)</strong> Choosing \"Layer via Copy\" to copy the object(s) from this layer and create a layer of its own.</p> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Pro Tip: </strong><span>To select your entire graphic and include all layers, highlight all layers and then use the Select tool. Once you've determined the area to copy, use the menu bar at the top and click \"Edit\" &gt; \"Copy Merged.\" This will copy the entire graphic so you can paste it as its own layer.</span></span></span></p> \n <p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\">B) </span></span></span></strong>Choosing \"Free Transform\" to scale, rotate, move, and flip your selections. (Refer to the Move tool in the next section of this post if you need more help on this.)</p> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> One really nifty trick you can do with \"Free Transform\" is to overlay </span>screenshots of a PDF to make a 3D-looking image, like the one below for our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-pinterest-for-business\">introductory Pinterest ebook</a>. You can find a visual overview of the steps below, but <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/get-started-with-photoshop-ht\">read this blog post for the step-by-step tutorial</a>.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/customize-photoshop-image.png?width=621&amp;height=345&amp;name=customize-photoshop-image.png\" alt=\"customize-photoshop-image.png\" title=\"customize-photoshop-image.png\" width=\"621\" height=\"345\"></p> \n <p>To learn more about all the Selection tools available in Photoshop, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Jj-nGubf0\">check out this video tutorial</a>.</p> \n <h3>6. The Move Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> This is a fairly basic tool that allows you to move individual elements of your graphic.</p> \n <p>The Move tool works on individual layers, and on the graphic as a whole -- if (remember how to do this?) you highlight all of your layers. It comes in handy when you’re trying to reposition images, text, and other design elements.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> The toolbar on the left, at the top.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-move-tool.png?width=359&amp;height=292&amp;name=photoshop-move-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-move-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-move-tool.png\" width=\"359\" height=\"292\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Move tool:</h4> \n <p>Click the Move Icon from the left hand menu bar and simply drag the object(s) you would like to move. To move all objects in one layer, simply highlight the layer and use the Move tool. You can also right click the object for additional options.</p> \n <h4>To scale, rotate, move, and flip things:</h4> \n <p>The Free Transform tool lets you scale, rotate, move, and flip any element in your select layer or layers. Use the shortcut <strong>CTRL + T</strong> or <strong>Command + T</strong> (for Macs) to initiate Free Transform, and check out the options that pop up at the top of your screen. Hold the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key while transforming to maintain the proportions of your elements.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-free-transform.png?width=669&amp;height=401&amp;name=photoshop-free-transform.png\" alt=\"photoshop-free-transform.png\" title=\"photoshop-free-transform.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"401\"></p> \n <h3>7. The Zoom Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> The Zoom tool lets you zoom in close to certain areas of an image, and zoom out to get more of a bird's eye view of what's happening.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> In the top menu bar, choose <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom In</strong> or <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Zoom Out.</strong></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-zoom-tool.png?width=669&amp;height=316&amp;name=photoshop-zoom-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-zoom-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-zoom-tool.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"316\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Zoom tool:</h4> \n <p>Either select the zoom options from the \"View\" menu (as shown above). To use the keyboard shortcut, hold <strong>ALT</strong> (PC) or <strong>Command </strong>(Mac) and press + to zoom in, and <strong>ALT</strong> (PC) or<strong> Command </strong>(Mac) and press - to zoom out.</p> \n <h3>8. The Eraser<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does: </strong>The Basic Eraser functions a lot like the brush tool. You can change the size and hardness of the eraser tip to achieve a variety of effects, like blending and fades. The Background Eraser uses differences in color to help you erase unwanted background areas from your images.</p> \n <p>The eraser is one of the most useful tools in Photoshop. Yes, I understand it’s technically just an eraser, but you’ve never used an eraser like this.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> The toolbar on the left.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/photoshop-eraser.png\" alt=\"photoshop-eraser.png\" title=\"photoshop-eraser.png\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Basic Eraser:</h4> \n <p>Once you click the Eraser icon, all of the settings will pop up at the top of your screen. These settings let you change the eraser size, hardness, and other aspects of the tool.</p> \n <p>Like most tools in Photoshop, the eraser works only on a specifically selected layer. Make sure you've got the layer you want selected before you start erasing.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-eraser-options.png?width=621&amp;height=374&amp;name=photoshop-eraser-options.png\" alt=\"photoshop-eraser-options.png\" title=\"photoshop-eraser-options.png\" width=\"621\" height=\"374\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Background Eraser:</h4> \n <p>This tool is a time-saving wonder. You can see how easily it eliminates background colors from images. This is especially helpful if you need an object with a transparent background.</p> \n <p>To use the Background Eraser, click and hold the eraser icon until the slide out menu appears. Choose \"Background Eraser.\"</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-background-eraser.png?width=224&amp;height=107&amp;name=photoshop-background-eraser.png\" alt=\"photoshop-background-eraser.png\" title=\"photoshop-background-eraser.png\" width=\"224\" height=\"107\"></p> \n <p>Now you're ready to do some serious erasing. Adjust the size of the Background Eraser, and simply click the color you would like deleted from the selected layer. Remember to select the layer you want to erase on.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-background-eraser-example.png?width=669&amp;height=428&amp;name=photoshop-background-eraser-example.png\" alt=\"photoshop-background-eraser-example.png\" title=\"photoshop-background-eraser-example.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"428\"></p> \n <p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Don’t be afraid to use an oversized eraser tip for the Background Eraser. Since it works by removing particular colors from the image, it won’t erase colors that aren’t selected.</p> \n <p>To learn more about how to remove the background of a photo in Photoshop or PowerPoint, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-remove-background-image-in-powerpoint-design-ht\">check out this step-by-step tutorial</a>.</p> \n <h3>9. The Crop Tool<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does: </strong>The Crop tool lets you crop an image. It works like any crop tool you’ve ever encountered: Simply choose your area and crop it out.</p> \n <p>I know this is a basic tool, but you’ll find yourself using this just as often as any other tool in Photoshop, especially when you’ve completed your graphic and need to clean up some of the free space around the edges.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> The toolbar on the left.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-crop-tool.png?width=240&amp;height=319&amp;name=photoshop-crop-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-crop-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-crop-tool.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"319\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Crop tool:</h4> \n <p>Select the icon indicated in the screenshot from the side menu bar, and drag the box over the area you would like to crop. To adjust the crop box, simply click and drag the small anchor boxes on the sides and corners of the crop box.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-crop-tool-example.png?width=669&amp;height=357&amp;name=photoshop-crop-tool-example.png\" alt=\"photoshop-crop-tool-example.png\" title=\"photoshop-crop-tool-example.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"357\"></p> \n <p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>You can make your canvas size larger than it needs to be so that you can give yourself more room to move your design elements, and crop it down to the proper size afterwards.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/crop-images-in-photoshop-to-specific-ratios-ht\">Read this blog post</a> to learn how to crop images in Photoshop to a specific ratio.

The Fill Tool</h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does: </strong>The Fill tool, formerly the Paint Bucket tool, fills any solid area with the color of your choice. It's great for solid backgrounds or coloring large areas. It can also be used to apply patterns to your images. The Gradient tool within the Fill tool lets you create a nice, faded background effect of the color of your choice.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> On the top menu bar, choose <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>New Fill Layer.</strong> From there, you have the option to choose \"Solid Color,\" \"Gradient,\" or \"Pattern.\"</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-fill-tool.png?width=620&amp;height=291&amp;name=photoshop-fill-tool.png\" alt=\"photoshop-fill-tool.png\" title=\"photoshop-fill-tool.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"291\"></p> \n <h4>To fill a solid area with a color:</h4> \n <p>First, select the layer you'd like to fill with a solid color. Then, from the top menu bar, choose <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>New Fill Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>Solid Color... </strong>From there, a \"New Layer\" window will pop up and prompt you to name the new color fill layer. Don't worry about choosing the color you want right then and there -- simply name the layer and press \"OK.\"</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-solid-color-fill.png?width=438&amp;height=150&amp;name=photoshop-solid-color-fill.png\" alt=\"photoshop-solid-color-fill.png\" title=\"photoshop-solid-color-fill.png\" width=\"438\" height=\"150\"></p> \n <p>Next, the Color Picker window will pop up. Here, you can choose which solid color you'd like to fill. Since I'd selected my background layer to fill in (i.e. the color of the sky in my graphic), the color I select in the Color Picker dictates the color of the sky:</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-color-picker-fill.png?width=669&amp;height=516&amp;name=photoshop-color-picker-fill.png\" alt=\"photoshop-color-picker-fill.png\" title=\"photoshop-color-picker-fill.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"516\"></p> \n <h4>To apply patterns to your images:</h4> \n <p>These patterns can be manually created if you have the time and patience, or you can find a variety of royalty-free patterns available for download through a basic Google search.</p> \n <p>To apply a pattern, first select the layer you'd like to fill with a pattern. Then, from the top menu bar, choose <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>New Fill Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>Pattern.</strong><strong>.. </strong>From there, a \"New Layer\" window will pop up and prompt you to name the new color fill layer. Don't worry about choosing the color you want right then and there -- simply name the layer and press \"OK.\"</p> \n <p>Next, you'll see the \"Pattern Fill\" window pop up. From there, you can choose the pattern and its scale. Since I'd selected my background layer to fill in (i.e. the color of the sky in my graphic), the pattern I select in the Pattern Fill changes the sky:</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-patterns.png?width=669&amp;height=379&amp;name=photoshop-patterns.png\" alt=\"photoshop-patterns.png\" title=\"photoshop-patterns.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"379\"></p> \n <h4>To use the Gradient tool:</h4> \n <p>To apply a gradient, first select the layer you'd like to fill with a pattern. Then, from the top menu bar, choose <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>New Fill Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>Gradient.</strong><strong>.. </strong>From there, a \"New Layer\" window will pop up and prompt you to name the new color fill layer. Don't worry about choosing the color you want right then and there -- simply name the layer and press \"OK.\"</p> \n <p>Next, a \"Gradient Fill\" window will pop up. Play around with these options, including the style, angle, and scale. To choose a different gradient than the one offered by default, click the arrow on the right-hand side of the default gradient to open the Gradient Editor, shown below:</p> \n <p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/photoshop-gradients.png\" alt=\"photoshop-gradients.png\" title=\"photoshop-gradients.png\"></p> \n <h3>11. The Eyedropper<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does:</strong> This handy little tool lets you extract and use any color from any image in Photoshop.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located: </strong>The toolbar on the left.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-eyedropper.png?width=323&amp;height=318&amp;name=photoshop-eyedropper.png\" alt=\"photoshop-eyedropper.png\" title=\"photoshop-eyedropper.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"318\"></span></p> \n <h4>To use the Eyedropper tool:</h4> \n <p>Select the icon from the sidebar. Next, locate that color you would like to extract, and simply click that area to clone the color.</p> \n <p>Once you've extracted the color, you'll see it indicated both in the Color module at the top right of your screen, as well as the bottom of the left sidebar. You can double-click that color box to bring up the advanced color picker, where you can then adjust and save the color to a swatch for future use.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-color-picker-eyedrop.png?width=669&amp;height=520&amp;name=photoshop-color-picker-eyedrop.png\" alt=\"photoshop-color-picker-eyedrop.png\" title=\"photoshop-color-picker-eyedrop.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"520\"></span></p> \n <h3>12. Blending Options<strong><br></strong></h3> \n <p><strong>What It Does: </strong>Blending options include quite a number of features to enhance the look or your graphic. For example, you can use the \"Outer Glow\" effect to make letters appear like they're glowing. Or you can use the \"Drop Shadow\" effect to add a shadow to your letters. Take some time to play around with all the layer effects and find out which ones tickle your fancy.</p> \n <p><strong>Where It's Located:</strong> From the top menu bar, choose <strong>Layer</strong> &gt; <strong>Layer Style</strong> &gt; <strong>Blending Options... </strong>You can also double-click any layer to bring up the options for that particular layer.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-blending-options.png?width=669&amp;height=405&amp;name=photoshop-blending-options.png\" alt=\"photoshop-blending-options.png\" title=\"photoshop-blending-options.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"405\"></p> \n <h4><span class=\"content-post__\"><span class=\"content-post__\">To use Blending Options:</span></span></h4> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__\">First, select the layer you want to apply your blending options and effects to. Then, open up your blending options and choose the one you'd like to apply. With the variety of options available, you can achieve a number of great effects to finalize your graphics. Have fun with these and experiment on different layers, images, and texts. Here's a look at what's offered:</span></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blending-options-menu.png?width=669&amp;height=418&amp;name=blending-options-menu.png\" alt=\"blending-options-menu.png\" title=\"blending-options-menu.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"418\"></span></span></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, in the image below, I selected my text layer and chose \"Bevel &amp; Emboss.\" Looks pretty cool, eh?</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"content-post__\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/photoshop-bevel-example.png?width=472&amp;height=247&amp;name=photoshop-bevel-example.png\" alt=\"photoshop-bevel-example.png\" title=\"photoshop-bevel-example.png\" width=\"472\" height=\"247\"></span></p> \n <p>Before we send you on your way, <span>it's worth noting that if you're working with a limited budget and a tight schedule, you can save yourself tons of time and money by using </span><strong>free, royalty-free stock photos.</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-stock-photos\">Here's a list of 17 of the best free stock photo sites you can look through</a><span>.</span></p> \n <p>Also, Photoshop offers a number of <strong>really helpful keyboard shortcuts</strong> for things like zooming in and out, changing canvas size, creating a new layer, and so on. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photoshop-keyboard-shortcuts-list\">Check out this blog post for a full list</a>, including shortcuts for some of the tools mentioned above.</p> \n <p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span>Now, it wouldn't be realistic to guarantee that you'd be a Photoshop wiz at this point -- but that isn’t what this guide designed to do.

Geeks","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/halloween-costume-ideas-marketers-list","description":"<p>Halloween is a fun holiday, and it doesn't get the attention it deserves. It doesn't have recognizable songs or vacation days associated with it, and it falls on a busy time of year for most people in the workforce.</p> \n<p>But that doesn't mean you should skip the festivities at your office Halloween celebration.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>How many days of the year are you encouraged to dress up and goof around at work? Probably just one -- Halloween -- and even then, it can be hard to know what's office-appropriate.</p> \n<p>We want you to have fun this Halloween, so we're taking the work out if it for you. We've compiled a list of DIY Halloween costume ideas that are easy to put together, inexpensive, and perfect for the digital marketer or tech professional.</p> \n<p>If your family and friends don't get your costume, your colleagues definitely will.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>35 Office Costume Ideas for Marketing Nerds &amp; Tech Geeks</h2> \n<h3>Computer or App-Related Costumes</h3> \n<h4>1. Alt Text</h4> \n<p>Alt text isn't just the metadata of an image published on the web -- you could also say it's an \"alternative\" fashion statement with the text to describe the era. This was HubSpot Director of Content Corey Wainwright's office Halloween costume a few years ago. It's great because you don't even look dressed up if you have a casual office dress code, so you can just blend in.</p> \n<p>To dress as alt text this halloween, break out your best 90s alternative garb -- our coworker Corey went with black jeans, combat boots, and a flannel. Then, tape hyphenated text that best describes what you're wearing, much like an <em>image</em> of your outfit would do online to help search engines read the file.</p> \n<p>We edited a sash of alt text on to the alternatively dressed girl below, just to help you picture your awesome costume.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/computer-costume-alt-text.jpg?width=400&amp;name=computer-costume-alt-text.jpg\" alt=\"Computer costume of girl in 90s alternative outfit with alt text written across her shirt\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source: </span><a href=\"http://thats2263.rssing.com/chan-42292448/all_p2.html\" style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">That's Life</a></em></p> \n<h4>2. SEO Ninja</h4> \n<p>Speaking of dorking out on SEO, you could be everyone's favorite LinkedIn title -- the SEO ninja. Dress in all black, buy a black ski mask, and tape keywords all over yourself. Voila ... you're an actual ninja -- just one much more concerned with search engine optimization than lurking in the darkness.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/seo-ninja-costume.jpg?width=400&amp;name=seo-ninja-costume.jpg\" alt=\"seo-ninja-costume\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/386957792957848886\" style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Pinterest</a></em></p> \n<h4>3. Mobile App</h4> \n<p>Wander around holding an appetizer -- candy, cheese and crackers, chips and dip ... whatever you have on hand. Boom. You're a mobile \"app.\"</p> \n<p>This costume also doubles as a great way to introduce yourself and make friends at a party.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mobile-app-costume.png?width=669&amp;name=mobile-app-costume.png\" alt=\"mobile-app-costume.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" title=\"mobile-app-costume.png\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 11px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://oppmax.com/blog/7-savvy-halloween-costume-ideas-for-digital-marketers/\">Opportunity Max</a></em></span></p> \n<h4>4. Instagrammer</h4> \n<p>Want another way to turn handing out food into a costume? Dress up like a hipster and hand out graham crackers. You're an \"instant\" \"gram\" cracker server -- or, for short, an Instagrammer. Pun absolutely intended.</p> \n<h4>5. Ghostwriter</h4> \n<p>Have you ever written something for somebody else's byline? Such is the life of a \"ghostwriter.\" Turn your author-less accomplishment into this year's office Halloween costume.</p> \n<p>To dress up as a ghostwriter, grab a white sheet and cut a hole for your head and arms. Dob some black ink spots on the sheet, get a book and one of those feather quills (or just get a feather, I suppose), and <em>boo</em> -- you're a ghostwriter.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ghostwriter-costume.jpg?width=474&amp;name=ghostwriter-costume.jpg\" alt=\"ghostwriter-costume\" width=\"474\" style=\"width: 474px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h4>6. Whitespace</h4> \n<p>Whitespace on the internet might just denote all the blank space you use to help your design stand out, but on Halloween, \"whitespace\" isn't just the absence of space.</p> \n<p>Dress in all white -- add white face paint and a white wig if you're ultra-committed. Then add a hint of color somewhere on the outfit, like a colored tie or scarf, or even a paint splotch. That color splotch will make the white space more prominent, transforming you into \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whitespace-web-design?_ga=2.207328723.195528841.1539902488-814765080.1538488659\">whitespace</a>.\"</p> \n<h4>7. Error 404 Code</h4> \n<p>You've most likely encountered a funny error 404 page before, and you can make it a funny costume, too. Grab a sheet of paper, write \"Error 404: Costume Not Found,\" and tape it to your outfit.</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n <div style=\"padding: 8px;\"> \n  <div style=\"background: #f8f8f8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0px; width: 100%;\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </div> \n  <p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/7QsQ9Vhj9_/\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\">A photo posted by RachAel Klopfenstein (@theklopf)</a> on Sep 5, 2015 at 12:33pm PDT</p> \n </div> \n</blockquote>  \n<p>  </p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">8. (Monty) Python</h4> \n<p>If you're into programming code, British comedy, and low-effort costumes, being (Monty) Python is perfect. Dress up in anything remotely snakelike in your closet: olive green clothing, snakeskin accessories, and fake vampire teeth that can serve as your fangs.</p> \n<p>Then, to amp up the dork factor on this costume, add two coconuts or a gold chalice to embody <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/\">Monty Python</a> on his quest for the Holy Grail.</p> \n<h4>9. Facebook</h4> \n<p>Grab face paint or eyeliner and write \"book\" across your cheeks. Just like that, you're the world's biggest social network for Halloween.</p> \n<p>And for your sake, we hope your colleagues actually get it:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Halloween-Jim_Bookface-Jim.jpg\" alt=\"Halloween-Jim_Bookface-Jim.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><em>Source:</em> </span><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.andpop.com/2013/10/11/laziest-halloween-costume-according-offices-jim-halpert/\">AndPop</a></em></p> \n<h4>10.

Phishing Emails</h4> \n<p>Phishing emails are nothing to joke about -- they can seriously threaten your technology and data security. But on Halloween, you can dress up as a play on phishing emails for an easy DIY costume. All you need are a stick, a piece of string, and an envelope. Bonus points if you own a bucket hat and vest to complete the ensemble. Check out an amusing version of this costume below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/phishing-email-costume.jpg?width=248&amp;name=phishing-email-costume.jpg\" alt=\"Email phishing Halloween costume with fishing rod with Passwords label as bait\" width=\"248\" style=\"width: 248px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/the-team-costumes-of-the-2011-24-hours-of-lemons-season\">Car and Driver</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>12. Copycat</h4> \n<p>\"CNTRL + C\" is the popular keyboard macro allowing you to copy items from one place to another on your computer. Well, here's a technology spin on a classic Halloween costume. All you'll need are cat ears, eyeliner-drawn whiskers, and a sheet of paper.

The Blue Screen of Death</h4> \n<p>You know the screen, even if you don't know the morbid nickname the tech world has given it. This classic error screen is known for signaling the end of a computer's useful life, and you know it when you see it. It causes so much stress on site, in fact, that the color alone is scary enough for October 31.</p> \n<p>Believe it or not, there are <a href=\"http://errorwear.com/\">official T-shirts</a> you can get with the blue screen of death copy printed on them. Want to make your own? All you need is a royal blue t-shirt and a printed version of this horrifying error message to pin to it.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blue-screen-of-death-costume.jpg?width=378&amp;name=blue-screen-of-death-costume.jpg\" width=\"378\" style=\"width: 378px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"T-shirt with Blue Screen of Death error message printed on it\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source:<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.spreadshirt.com/blue+screen+of+death+t-shirts\">Spreadshirt</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>14. GPS Costume</h4> \n<p>This will work best with two people. You can cut a Point A and Point B pin shape out of cardboard, paint both red, and simply write A and B on it. From there, you can personalize the costume whichever way you'd like. You can even get more intricate by finding a T-Shirt with a map on it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-15%20at%203.39.39%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-15%20at%203.39.39%20PM.png\" alt=\"GPS office costume\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/137359857365658289/?nic=1\">Pinterest</a></em></p> \n<h4>15. Dead Battery and Low Wi-Fi&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Nothing is more terrifying than a dead battery or no Wi-Fi. This costume brings all of techy's fears to life. It's also pretty simple to create. Just tape or glue images of dead Wi-Fi and low battery signals on to a black shirt. To emphasize the low-connectivity fears, put on some zombie or skeleton makeup.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although this can work as a couples costume, this could also be a fun option for office colleagues. Since both costumes within the set don't rely on each other to be understandable, an individual could also wear either the Dead Battery outfir or the No-Wi-Fi suit and still be easily recognized.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/57/91/ad5791e2e93e090fbb432574e53ce4f5.jpg\" width=\"528\" style=\"width: 528px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Dead Battery and Low Wi-Fi Halloween Costume\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/474496510732540902/?lp=true\">Pinterest</a></em></p> \n<h3>Emoji Costumes</h3> \n<h4>16.

Fully Vested</h4> \n<p>At work, \"fully vested\" usually refers to one's ability to earn all matching funds of a 401(k) retirement plan. But for some, you just can't help but picture someone wearing lots of sleeveless jackets at the same time. Now's the time to personify that image.</p> \n<p>If you work in a company where people would get the joke, put on a bunch of vests (at least three, but even more is encouraged), and that's about it. You're fully vested.</p> \n<h4>20. Nerd</h4> \n<p>What I love about the nerd costume is that it's effortless and always unique -- there are many ways to be a nerd in this day and age. Are you a tech nerd, a video game nerd, or a book nerd? The sky is the limit with this costume. Show up wearing glasses with your favorite accessories, such as a magic wand, book, or lightsaber, to complete the effect.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/92/7c/a5/927ca538726e49296fcc9724ac1e03f9.jpg\" alt=\"Worlds cutest nerd costumes.

A Solar Eclipse</h4> \n<p>Last year, the solar eclipse took over the internet -- and the country. As millions of people flocked to the path of totality to (hopefully) catch a glimpse of this rare event without burning their corneas, millions more made <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/funniest-social-media-tweets\">jokes about it on social media</a>.</p> \n<p>To dress up as a solar eclipse for Halloween, you'll need a work pal to dress up as the sun and the moon with you. One of you wears black, the other wears yellow, and you both wear dark sunglasses. Then, at the Halloween party, the one dressed in black spends the whole time standing in front of the one in yellow.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/solar-eclipse-costume.jpg?width=690&amp;name=solar-eclipse-costume.jpg\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\" alt=\"Two girls dressed in solar eclipse costume at an office\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/267823509074335221\">Pinterest</a></em></p> \n<h4>22. The 'Evil Kermit' Meme</h4> \n<p>If you haven't heard of this mega-popular meme this year, you've probably seen it somewhere: It features Kermit the Frog, face-to-face with his evil twin, Evil Kermit. Evil Kermit looks identical, except for the black cloak.</p> \n<p>For this costume, you and a coworker can keep it simple: You both wear green shirts, and one of you wears a black hoodie or jacket on top. If you really want to commit to the costume, you'll spring for some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Snazaroo-Classic-Face-Paint-Green/dp/B000LWCPRI?th=1\">green face paint</a> to complete the ensemble. Walk around the party together, facing one another, for maximum effect.</p> \n<img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/evil%20kermit%20halloween.png\" alt=\"evil kermit halloween.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<h4>23. <a href=\"https://fox4kc.com/2018/10/30/5-easy-pun-halloween-costumes-you-can-make-at-the-last-minute/\">Fifty Shades of Grey: PG Paint Swatch Costume</a></h4> \n<p>Want to do something cheeky, but still office friendly?

The \"But That's None of My Business\" Meme</h4> \n<p>If you love Kermit the Frog, but don't have a colleague to team up with for the \"Evil Kermit\" costume, consider going solo with a costume based off of the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-thats-none-of-my-business\">\"But That's None of My Business\" meme</a>, where Kermit <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-thats-none-of-my-business\">is seen judgmentally drinking coffee</a>.</p> \n<p>All you have to do is stick a pair of eyes on a green hoodie and start sipping your tea or coffee.

Eleven from <em>Stranger Things</em></h4> \n<p>Eleven from Netflix's hit series <em>Stranger Things </em>is universally beloved, and it's a bonus that her signature look is a comfortable and easy-to-assemble costume.

Scoops Ahoy Employee from Stranger Things</h4> \n<p>While Eleven, noted above, is an absolute classic Stranger Things character, 2019's season inspired another great costume opportunity. During the newest installment of episodes, Stave, a main character played by Joe Keery, worked at an icecream shop called Scoops Ahoy. As a server, he had to wear a goofy sailor uniform alongside <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/236976/stranger-things-3-steve-scoops-ahoy-friend-robin\">his coworker Robin</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the season aired, the uniform has been regularly worn by cosplayers and at Comic Con as people mimic Steve and Robin.</p> \n<p>Since it's a pretty generic sailor uniform, you might be able to easily find one that's similar in a variety of Halloween shops. This costume could work for both individuals or two colleagues.&nbsp;</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n <div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pSdZsoA_W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF; line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\"> \n   <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\"> \n    <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\">\n     &nbsp;\n    </div> \n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\"> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\">\n    &nbsp;\n   </div> \n   <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\">\n    &nbsp;\n   </div> \n   <div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> \n    <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">\n     View this post on Instagram\n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\">\n    &nbsp;\n   </div> \n   <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\"> \n    <div> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> \n     <div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n     <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\">\n      &nbsp;\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> </a> \n  <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pSdZsoA_W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\">Ahoy Ladies! 😏⚓️ I LOVED Robin in Stranger Things Season 3 ♥️ what about you?

To pay homage to the explosion of this tech trend, you'll need a t-shirt that's red, yellow, or blue. Using fabric paint or permanent marker, write Valor (for red), Instinct (for yellow), or Mystic (for blue) on your shirt.</p> \n<p>Spend Halloween walking around pointing your phone at objects, and you're the spitting image of a Pokémon GO trainer.

The Sales Lifecycle</h4> \n<p>At HubSpot, we love embracing team costumes. In 2018, a handful of HubSpot employees grabbed some T-Shirts and wrote the stages of the sales lifecycle on them. Then they lined up accordingly and passed a fake prospect listing around to symbolize the process of making a sale. This was such an easy costume to coordinate that the team could even include an out-of-office employee over a video call.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/20181031_165016.gif?width=600&amp;name=20181031_165016.gif\" alt=\"HubSpot Employee sales cycle halloween costume\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: Maggie Bomze, Principal Customer Success Manager of Strategic Accounts at HubSpot</em></span></p> \n<h4>29. Social Media Channels</h4> \n<p>While this Pinterest image shows classmates posting as the major social media networks, this could easily be modified to fit the office setting.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Simply pick out a solid list of the hottest social networks, then by blank T-Shirts that match the colors of each platform. From there, you can either draw, tape or glue the logos on to each shirt. If you're not interested in the tutus worn below, you could also find matching pants, or just wear jeans and keep things simple.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/7a/b6/4f7ab6fe86bcb3e3c903ba35dfd5d189.jpg\" alt=\"Social Media Network team costumes\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/535506211925012614/?lp=true\">Pinterest</a></em></p> \n<h4>30. Google Algorithm Update</h4> \n<p>Find a couple of office buddies for this one -- one panda, one penguin, and one pigeon. You might be thinking, \"what the heck is the pigeon algorithm update?\" 1) <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-algorithm-visual-history-infographic?_ga=2.34709217.195528841.1539902488-814765080.1538488659\">It's a thing</a>, and 2) we checked Amazon for hummingbird costumes and there aren't any cheap ones available.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-algorithm-update-halloween-costumes.jpg?width=1024&amp;name=google-algorithm-update-halloween-costumes.jpg\" alt=\"google-algorithm-update-halloween-costumes.jpg\" width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://oppmax.com/blog/7-savvy-halloween-costume-ideas-for-digital-marketers/\">Opportunity Max</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>31. Black Hat and White Hat SEO</h4> \n<p>This is another SEO-related costume, and I think you can figure this one out on your own. I recommend wearing a black hat for one, and a white hat for the other, and having \"SEO\" embroidered on each one -- which you can <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=custom+order+embroidered+hat\">easily custom order</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Black-Hat-SEO.jpg?width=513&amp;name=Black-Hat-SEO.jpg\" alt=\"Black hat with SEO label on top\" width=\"513\" style=\"width: 513px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source: <a href=\"https://seo-hacker.com/google-blackhat-1999/\" style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><em>SE</em>O-Hacker</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>32. Snapchat Filters</h4> \n<p>Here's another group costume idea that pays tribute to Snapchat's filters feature.</p> \n<p>There are numerous options that you and your team can choose from to embody this costume. You could dress up as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/snapchat-best-brands\">vomiting rainbows</a>, cat and dog ears, a flower crown, or a face swap, and this could be as DIY or store-bought as you're interested in pursuing. For example, here's some inspiration for a couple of the dog filters:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/snapchatfilter.jpg?width=669&amp;name=snapchatfilter.jpg\" alt=\"snapchat filter team costume\" width=\"669\" title=\"snapchatfilter.jpg\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/DIY-Snapchat-Filter-Halloween-Costume-42390391\">PopSugar</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>33. Snapchat Ghosts</h4> \n<p>Put a marketing spin on a classic Halloween costume by arriving as a Snapchat ghost. You'll all need a white sheet and to pick which ghost you like the most.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/maxresdefault-24.jpg?width=669&amp;name=maxresdefault-24.jpg\" alt=\"Snapchat Ghost team halloween costume\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"maxresdefault-24.jpg\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLx0waKuwRE\">YouTube</a></span></em></p> \n<h4>34. PAC-MAN and Company</h4> \n<p>Here's yet another awesome ghostly costume idea your whole team at work can get in on. Have your team lead wear the yellow pie-shaped garb of PAC-MAN, with each team member dressed as the multi-colored ghosts that roam the screen in this vintage arcade game.</p> \n<p>Just make sure the team lead doesn't <em>actually</em> try to eat the ghosts -- you're in an office, and you're all technically on the same team.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pac-man-group-costume.jpg?width=612&amp;name=pac-man-group-costume.jpg\" alt=\"Group costume with PAC-MAN, four ghosts and fruit from the vintage arcade game\" width=\"612\" style=\"width: 612px;\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\">Source: <a href=\"https://meningrey.net/galery/pacman-group-costume.html\">Meningrey</a></em></p> \n<h4>35. Instagram Filters</h4> \n<p>For this group costume, you'll need white t-shirts and fabric markers. Draw an Instagram photo frame on the front of your shirts, and each team member can write a different <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/edit-instagram-photos\">Instagram filter</a>'s name inside the photo frame. Or, create frame props with different filters on them like the group did below:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/M-nahalloween-1.jpg?width=600&amp;name=M-nahalloween-1.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Filter Halloween costumes\" width=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;\" title=\"M-nahalloween-1.jpg\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.nailsmag.com/blogpost/109187/nails-flashback-friday-halloween\">Nails Magazine</a></span></em></p> \n<p>The clothes don't make the marketer, but the costume can certainly make the culture at your company.

href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/meet-search-engines/\">second largest search engine in the world</a>, so keyword-optimizing your videos on the platform is just as important as keyword-optimizing your blog posts for Google.</p> \n<p>Even if you’ve just created the next “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM\">Charlie bit my finger</a>” video, you must remember that an algorithm dictates which videos YouTube will serve to its audience -- and which ones it won’t.</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/youtube-marketing\">keyword-optimize your videos for YouTube</a> is leveraging tags. Below, we’ve put together a guide that will explain exactly what YouTube tags are, why they’re important, and some best practices to follow. We’ll also show you three YouTube tag generators that can help you discover the keywords that could rocket your videos to the top of the platform’s search results.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What are tags for YouTube?</h2> \n <p>YouTube Tags are words and phrases you can include in your YouTube videos’ description. They let your viewers, and YouTube, know what your videos are about and can help them rank higher in the platform’s search results.</p> \n</div> \n<h2><strong>Why are YouTube tags important?</strong></h2> \n<p>YouTube tags are important because they help YouTube grasp your video’s content and context. This way, YouTube can understand your video’s topic and category, and associate it with similar content, which can amplify your video’s reach.</p> \n<h2><strong>YouTube Tags Best Practices</strong></h2> \n<p>To leverage YouTube tags to their fullest potential, check out these tips and tricks.</p> \n<h3>1. Make your first tag your target keyword and order the rest by importance.</h3> \n<p>YouTube heavily accounts for your video’s first few tags when ranking content in their search results, especially the first tag. So make sure your first tag is the exact keyword you want to target.</p> \n<h3>2. Use some broad keywords that describe the overarching topic your video falls under as other tags.</h3> \n<p>Using broad keywords as other tags helps YouTube understand your video’s context. For example, if you’re creating a video called “How to Hit a Baseball”, you’d want to add “Baseball” as a broad tag to indicate to YouTube that your video’s overarching topic is about baseball.</p> \n<h3>3. Use some specific keywords that describe the topics you covered in your video as other tags.</h3> \n<p>Using specific keywords that describe the topics you cover in your video as other tags helps YouTube understand your video’s content. For instance, in the same “How to Hit a Baseball” video, adding “hitting off a tee” or “hitting batting practice” as specific tags would indicate to YouTube the exact topics your video covers.</p> \n<h2><strong>Best YouTube Tag Generators</strong></h2> \n<p>To discover the keywords you can tag in your videos and help them rank higher in YouTube’s search results, here are three of the best YouTube Tag Generators to try.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://keywordkeg.com/\">Keyword Keg</a></h3> \n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1BKxGryQKTdmUrL_vNs3aU-TozY80Wn6MQrfx1-VJl491uleI-O4c-2oAMT7JXqJxtHU3N5bR3p13gwP8hrjhSeLVdfEBZ94Sr5WxwDgu83ovZjZjPAmGI_LjjdkgXkKf7FUmrTv\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p>Using Keyword Keg, you can enter your target keyword into the tool and it’ll serve up its search volume, cost-per-click, competition, on-page difficulty, off-page difficulty, SEO difficulty, CTR scope, keyword power, trends, and suggested keywords. You can also filter your results by country and language.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://keywordtool.io/youtube\">Keywordtool.io</a></h3> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/unnamed%20(1)-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p>After plugging your target keyword into its YouTube search bar, Keywordtool.io will provide you with suggested keywords, their search volume, how they’ve trended over the past 12 months, and questions, prepositions, and hashtags that also include your target keyword.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://vidiq.com/\">VidIQ</a></h3> \n<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">VidIQ will display your target keyword’s related keywords, related score, search volume, search score, competition score, and overall score, which is a combination of a keyword’s related score, search score, and competition score.</span> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-tags&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4f7a8cd440da82f80ab1f8e1ff62f300","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1BKxGryQKTdmUrL_vNs3aU-TozY80Wn6MQrfx1-VJl491uleI-O4c-2oAMT7JXqJxtHU3N5bR3p13gwP8hrjhSeLVdfEBZ94Sr5WxwDgu83ovZjZjPAmGI_LjjdkgXkKf7FUmrTv":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/unnamed%20(1)-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-49-142_16e2e172af89ede1.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-tags&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-08-970_e93f0c226e88be1a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624925},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Content Creation","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation","description":"<p>Where is the first place you go for expert advice or an answer to a burning question? My guess is Google (or your preferred search engine). You’re not alone — Google alone answers over four billion search queries everyday.</p> \n<p>When you enter a question into the search bar, those links that appear in your search results are content. Whether you know it or not, you consume content on a daily basis.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>That <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy-guide\">marketing strategy guide</a> ... content.</p> \n<p>Those articles that diagnose your symptoms ... content.</p> \n<p>The video tutorial on how to create Victoria Secret-level hair volume ... content.</p> \n<p>News stories, Instagram feeds, blog posts, cat videos, GIFs, memes ... all content.</p> \n<p>Content is a large part of your everyday life. It’s hard to avoid, but why would you want to? Content keeps us informed, answers our questions, entertains us, makes us smile, guides our decisions, and more.</p> \n<p>Content helps you attract, engage, and delight prospects and customers, bring new visitors to your site, and ultimately, generate revenue for your company.</p> \n<p>In other words, if you’re not creating content, then you’re <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">behind the curve</a>.</p> \n<h3>Why Is Content Important?</h3> \n<p>Content creation is the ultimate inbound marketing practice. When you create content, you’re providing free and useful information to your audience, attracting potential customers to your website, and retaining existing customers through quality engagement.</p> \n<p>You’re also generating some major ROI for your company, as these content marketing stats demonstrate:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Content marketing brings in <a href=\"https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic\">3X</a> as many leads as traditional marketing and costs 62% less.</li> \n <li>SMBs that use content marketing get <a href=\"https://www.impactbnd.com/blogging-statistics-55-reasons-blogging-creates-55-more-traffic\">126%</a> more leads than those that don’t.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/10/know-like-trust-content/\">61% of online purchases</a> are the direct result of a customer reading a blog.</li> \n <li>Companies that publish 16+ blog posts per month get <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks\">3.5X</a> more traffic than those that post four or fewer posts per month.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Content equals business growth. So, let’s get started with your content strategy.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Content Planning and Strategy</strong></h2> \n<p>You wouldn’t start building a house without a blueprint, a sculpture without a sketch, or a company without a mission statement. So, there should be no content creation without a plan. Otherwise you risk getting derailed from your objective.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">content strategy</a> includes everything from brand and tone to how you will promote your content and eventually repurpose it. Let’s go over how to create your content plan, step-by-step.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training-workbook?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Interactive Content Marketing Workbook</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Set Your Content Goals</h3> \n<p>Similar to a traditional marketing campaign, your content strategy should be centered on your marketing goals (which should, in turn, be derived from your company goals).</p> \n<p>Your goals could range from attracting more visitors to your site to generating more leads to anything in between — as long as they’re <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/how-to-set-smart-marketing-goals-for-2013-template.aspx\">SMART</a> goals. An example of this kind of goal would be to increase organic traffic to the blog by 25% in the next quarter.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Once you determine that, each piece of content you create should be aligned with your goal and contribute to your desired outcome.</p> \n<p>In sum, start with your goals, then create your content.</p> \n<h3>Create a Buyer Persona</h3> \n<p>Building a content strategy is more than considering what type of content you want to create. You first need to know who you’re speaking to, how you want to speak to them, and where to find them.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>The key to creating successful inbound content is to make each reader feel like you’re speaking directly to them.</p> \n<p>The only way to do this is to get intimate with your visitors, leads, and customers — you need to know them like you know an old friend. You should be aware of their obstacles, their pain points, their challenges, and fears. Similarly, you should understand their best possible outcome, their dream solution, and their biggest fantasies.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Always remember that you are marketing to <strong>humans</strong> that want to feel connected.</p> \n<p>Ideally you’d know and be able to speak directly to every individual that visits your website, but you can’t. The solution? Create a buyer persona.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Your buyer persona is the person that you want to reach with your content. This semi-fictional character serves as a representation of your target audience, i.e., the people who are most likely to benefit from your message and become customers.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Creating a buyer persona takes a bit of research, some guesswork, and tweaking. But the end result is a clear picture of the person you want to market to and someone who will happily consume your content.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Not sure where to start? Use </strong><a href=\"https://www.makemypersona.com/\">MakeMyPersona</a><strong> to build out your buyer persona.</strong></p> \n<h3>Rely on the Buyer’s Journey</h3> \n<p>If you’ve ever had a headache, the first thing you likely did was try to figure out the cause. Perhaps you were dehydrated, or caffeine-depleted, or maybe you were sick. After you diagnosed the problem, you moved on to solutions — drink some water, grab an espresso, or take some medicine. Finally, you decide between solutions: Evian or tap water? Starbucks or Peet’s Coffee? Aleve or Tylenol? Hopefully, your headache then subsided and you were able to go about your day.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>This is a representation of the buyer’s journey. Each of your prospects follows a path to a solution — that path involves awareness, consideration, and decision stages. But each of your prospects is in a different part of that journey, so it’s important to use your content to appeal to each stage.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IGJVUQefJ4EBBW2vSYn2EoRA_b20ZkRLB6FngQc7Df8L9kiAnv1xpjxyb3n-P-YY9EB5bBUq-acrqbZoJZwuDPBKzQsRCHYiMrTcry4JCX1qcGVTstjJVsmum7LmTMo3iGo6XIPc\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/apply-the-buyers-journey-to-your-inbound-strategy\">HubSpot</a></span></span>\n</div> \n<p>By creating content for each stage of the buyer’s journey, you’re ensuring that no visitors fall through the cracks and that every individual that comes to your site feels like they are receiving relevant, useful information.</p> \n<p>You also want to select a format for your content so that it’s tailored to each stage of the buyer’s journey. A new visitor in the awareness stage won’t want a live demo of your product, but they <em>would</em> read a quick checklist or blog post that helps them better understand their problem. A prospect in the decision stage doesn’t need to know about all the possible solutions, they need a consultation or demo that shows them that your product is the <em>right</em> solution. Always meet your audience where they are.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">Here’s a guide to the best content formats for each stage of the buyer’s journey:</span></p> \n<p><strong>Awareness: </strong>Whitepaper, Blog Post, Checklist, Tip Sheet, Infographic, Ebook, Game, Quiz</p> \n<p><strong>Consideration: </strong>Podcast, Webinar, Worksheet, Comparison Matrix, Template<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Decision: </strong>Demo, Free Trial, Product Guide, Consultation, Coupon</p> \n<h3>Perform a Content Audit</h3> \n<p>Whether you’ve been creating content for a while without any clear direction or you’ve been following a strategy all along, every marketing department can benefit from a content audit. Just because you didn’t start out with a clearly defined strategy doesn’t mean that the content you already have won’t fit into one.</p> \n<p>A content audit is simply taking inventory of the work you’ve already done, then organizing it to fit under a your new content plan.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>The process might involve some re-writing, or it could reveal gaps that need to be filled with content that appeals to your persona and their journey stage.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Here’s how you’d perform your content audit:<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ol> \n <li>Gather all of your content in a spreadsheet.</li> \n <li>Create columns for target keywords, buyer persona, buyer’s journey stage, format, and main topic, then fill these in for each content piece.</li> \n <li>Add columns for your key metrics, like page views, shares, engagement, etc.</li> \n <li>Finally, categorize each post (using highlights or another column) by those that are doing well, need improvement, should be rewritten, or can be merged with another post.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While a content audit may seem tedious, all the manual labor will be worth the <a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/03/content-strategy-editorial-planning/\">increased traffic and leads</a>. Plus, you’ll have a verified plan moving forward.</p> \n<p>If this process seems a bit overwhelming, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/creating-a-content-inventory\">this post</a> for some more guidance.</p> \n<h3>Choose the Right Format</h3> \n<p>Remember that buyer person you created? You’re creating content <em>for</em> them. That means you should be crafting content in a format that is most easily and enjoyably consumed by your prospects.</p> \n<p>The format you choose might be a blog post, video, slideshare, graphic, ebook, whitepaper, podcast, or whatever your creative mind can conceive. As long as it serves your persona, you’ll be in good shape.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Also, you don’t need to stick to one format for every piece of content that you create. But you should be able to create content — in whatever format — on a consistent cadence. What I mean is, a podcast series might be a great marketing tactic, but if you lack the resources (and patience) to stick to it, then a blog might be a better route.</p> \n<p>Use these questions as a guide when choosing your content format:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What stage of buyer’s journey is this for?</li> \n <li>How easy is it for your audience to consume this content?</li> \n <li>Where does your persona spend their time online?</li> \n <li>What format can you create on a consistent basis?</li> \n <li>Are you able to produce this content at aquality level that’s competitive?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Content Promotion</h3> \n<p>What good is it to create all this great content if no one sees it? In a perfect world, herds of people would flock to your site every time you published a new post. In reality — especially when you’re just starting out — you’ll need to entice people to consume your content and even shepherd them into your online space.</p> \n<p>Hence why content promotion is just as important to your strategy as whatever content you create.</p> \n<p>Your promotion plan should be guided by your persona. Where do they spend their time online? What time of day do they use a particular platform? How often do they want to see content from you? How do they like to consume content? What email subject lines get them to click?<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Content promotion varies by medium, and there are <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/how-to-effectively-promote-content\">specific rules to follow</a> for each.</p> \n<h4>Social Media</h4> \n<p>While social media is a relationship building tool, it can be <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/understanding-social-media-promotion\">used to promote content</a>. It’s all about finding the right balance between self-promotion, sharing useful information, and entertainment. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat are all great mediums to both create and share relevant content. The key is modifying that content to fit the platform.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resources</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-twitter-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Use Twitter for Business (+ Follower Growth Tracking Template)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/30-days-of-instagram?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">30 Days of Instagram: A Guide for Businesses</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-attract-customers-with-facebook?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Attract Customers With Facebook</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Email Marketing</h4> \n<p>Email is one of the best ways to reach your audience for any reason, especially to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas\">promote content</a>. The reason is anyone on your email list has opted in to hear from you <em>and</em> you can guarantee that they’ll get your messages. Better yet, you can improve your open rates by sending relevant content to segmented lists, meaning they’ll be eager to read everything you send their way.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/an-introduction-to-email-marketing?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">The Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Paid Promotion</h4> \n<p>Pay-per-click (PPC) helps you get your content in front of new audiences through targeted, paid advertisements. These ads can run on social media, search engines, or other websites. Once you define your buyer persona, you’ll want to go the paid route so not to waste money targeting uninterested parties.

Syndication gets your brand in front of fresh eyes (and wallets) that you wouldn’t otherwise reach with your own efforts.</p> \n<h3>Repurposing Content</h3> \n<p>When you repurpose content, you’re reusing something you spent a lot of time to create and transforming it in various formats so that it can be more widely consumed.</p> \n<p>Think of it as recycling. You want to spend less time creating and more time getting your content in front of your audience. For example, that blog post that you wrote on marketing stats can also serve as a great infographic or even a video.</p> \n<p>If you created something in one format, try to think of all the other ways that you could reuse that information that might be just as effective.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>The Content Creation Process</strong></h2> \n<p>We marketers are busy. We don’t have time to waste on inefficient systems. That’s why we create processes for everything we do. We devise a system, roll it out, tweak it until it works, then repeat that system over and over to generate the results we want. Think about every marketing campaign you’ve ever done — webinars, autoresponders, surveys. Each of them had a process. Content creation is no different.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Follow these steps to create content, remove the guesswork, and allow for more creative mental space.</p> \n<h3>1. SEO Research</h3> \n<p>Creating your buyer persona likely gave you some ideas about what topics to write about and what questions your audience might have, which is a great start. Now, you need to confirm if those ideas can apply on a bigger scale to a larger audience. Sure, it would be great to write a blog post directed toward a single person, but, <em>boy</em>, would it be a waste of energy.</p> \n<p>SEO research — a.k.a. keyword research — will show you the search volume of a specific keyword phrase and whether it’s worth the investment of creating a piece of content around it.</p> \n<p>A good way to go about keyword research is to write down some questions that your persona might have based on their obstacles and goals. Then, perform some keyword research around those queries to see if enough people are searching for them. A rule of thumb is to target keywords that are attainable, meaning that have a monthly search volume (MSV) and keyword difficulty that corresponds to your domain authority. Trying to target high volume (read: highly competitive) keywords when you’ve just started blogging won’t pan out too well for you.</p> \n<p><em>Before we go any further, let’s detour into a quick-and-dirty SEO explanation:</em></p> \n<p>One important factor that helps you to rank in search engines is domain authority. You gain domain authority by how many external sites link back to your content. In order for this to happen, you need to have a pretty large library of content that is valuable enough to cite. That means, the longer you write high quality content, the higher your domain authority and the easier it is to rank for highly competitive keywords that will put you on the first page of Google.</p> \n<p>If you’re not quite there yet, the best thing to do is to target <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-long-tail-keyword-100-words-sr\">long-tail</a>, low-volume keywords with minimal keyword difficulty (&lt;50) — we’re talking 200-1000 MSV. This will give you the best chance at ranking for keywords and getting your content in front of more people.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><em>SEO lesson concluded. Back to our scheduled programming.</em></p> \n<p>There are a few ways you could perform your keyword research:<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use keyword research tools, like <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMRush</a> or <a href=\"https://moz.com/explorer\">Moz Keyword Explorer</a>.</li> \n <li>Type your keyword into a search engine and take note of the auto-filled queries.</li> \n <li>Check out the related searches section on search engine results pages (SERPs).</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Featured Resources</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-conduct-technical-seo-audit?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Conduct a Technical SEO Audit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-myths?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">22 SEO Myths to Leave Behind in 2019</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Ideation</h3> \n<p>Now that you’ve determined which keywords to target, it’s time to brainstorm some content ideas. HubSpot research shows that the best way to organize content is through <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/topic-clusters-seo\">topic clusters</a>, meaning you create a long-form, comprehensive pillar page based on a keyword that then links to content you’ve created on related subtopics (think blog posts).</p> \n<p>To illustrate the point, it looks something like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DxOGxyw9DSa8&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1531793246976000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4n7Q0NmI5OO6vE8xnnmM_RWkUmQ\">this</a>.</p> \n<p>The topic cluster model makes brainstorming so much easier because now you have structure to follow (... told you we like processes). You can use your main keyword to create a pillar piece that covers that topic in depth, like … say a guide to content creation. Then, you can create shorter pieces of content — infographics, blog posts, templates — that help your audience dive deeper into the topic and target long-tail keywords.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>If you’re stumped for ideas, you might want to consider looking for inspiration from books you’ve read, industry studies, your competitor’s sites, or related searches on SERPs.</p> \n<p>Once you have all of your ideas down, you can develop your <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates\">editorial calendar</a> and start creating.</p> \n<h3>3. Writing</h3> \n<p>I’m going to talk about the writing process because … well, that’s what I do. <em>Your</em> specific content creation strength might be videos or graphics or podcasts. Whatever it is, the creation process follows some pretty similar guidelines:<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Write to your persona. Use their voice, their euphemisms, even their humor to construct a piece that resonates.</li> \n <li>Use titles, meta descriptions, and other teasers to compel your audience to read your content. Put the benefit of your content <em>right</em> in the title to let them know why they should read it.</li> \n <li>Create something unique. Don’t simply regurgitate the information that’s already out there. Infuse a unique style or cite new research to emphasize your points.</li> \n <li>Stick to one idea and use your content to reinforce it. Don’t confuse your reader by going on tangents or trying to explain multiple semi-related topics in a single piece.</li> \n <li>Stay true to your voice. Don’t try to impress your audience with eloquent prose or an expansive vocabulary if <em>they</em> don’t speak that way.</li> \n <li>Be concise and clear. You want your audience to relate to you and derive value from your content … and not have to sift through jargon or confusing metaphors.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketers-guide-to-writing-well?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">HubSpot's Guide to Writing Well in Marketing</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Editing</h3> \n<p>The way you edit your (or others’) work is a very subjective process. You may want to edit as you go, or you might wait a few days and review the work with fresh eyes. You might care a great deal about grammar, or you might aim for a more colloquial piece.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Either way, there are a few things that should definitely look out for as you refine your content, like active voice, clear language, short sentences, and plenty of whitespace. Consider having a colleague or manager review your work, too.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Some tools that will help you cut down on your editing time are <a href=\"https://app.grammarly.com/?network=g&amp;utm_source=google&amp;matchtype=b&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyZrNjNiX3AIVg8VkCh0EsgpcEAAYASAAEgL0oPD_BwE&amp;placement=&amp;q=grammar&amp;utm_content=244431933073&amp;utm_campaign=Search1&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%2Bhemingway+%2Bapp\">Grammarly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\">Hemingway Editor</a>.</p> \n<h3>5. Uploading</h3> \n<p>Now that your content is ready, you’ll need to put it somewhere that people can access it. A content management system (CMS) is software that hosts digital content and allows you to display it on your website (or anywhere else on the web).<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>The benefit to a CMS is that it connects all of your content and stores it in one place. So, you can easily link to a landing page in your blog article or insert a content offer in an email. Not only that, but you can analyze the results of all the content you created for a specific campaign (which can help with content audits). A CMS saves you from having a disjointed content marketing system.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-optimization-system\">CMS Hub</a> is home to our blog, where you get access to all of our great content and useful free offers.</p> \n<h3>6. Publishing</h3> \n<p>Publishing content is as simple as clicking a button. So, why include a section on it? Well, because it’s not always that simple. Yes, you can publish your content immediately after uploading, or you can maximize its impact by waiting for an optimal time.</p> \n<p>If you’re just starting out, then clicking publish right away probably won’t impact your audience too much. But if you have committed to a regular publishing schedule, like delivering a new post every Wednesday, your audience will expect to see posts published on Wednesdays.</p> \n<p>Something else to keep in mind is to publish according to trends or time-sensitive events. For example, if you create content about national holidays or current events, then you’ll want to publish those at specific times.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>A CMS will allow you schedule posts for a future date and specific time, so you can click, schedule, and forget.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Content Creation Tools</strong></h2> \n<p>While a CMS will help you manage your content, it won’t help you create it. That’s where content creation tools come in handy. These are especially useful if you’re artistically impaired, like me, or if you don’t have the capacity to hire help. From GIFs to infographics, these content creation tools will help you look like a professional, regardless of what kind of content you’re making.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a> will help you create beautiful designs for any platform, from social ads to Facebook cover photos to infographics. The software features aesthetically pleasing templates that you can customize with colors, images, and text ... for free.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/\">Giphy</a> The GIF has replaced emojis as a completely normal form of communication, and, therefore, an acceptable way to present content. Giphy allows you to search millions of pre-created GIFs in their database or even create your own.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/\">Vidyard</a> is a video hosting platform that was made for marketers. The software allows you to customize your video by adding overlays, text, or CTA buttons, split test, transcribe, and has SEO features.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a> is a leading survey creation platform. Why might you need such a thing? Because a good marketer knows that customer feedback is critical to an effective marketing campaign.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.makemypersona.com/\">MakeMyPersona</a> is HubSpot’s own nifty tool that will walk you through the process of creating your buyer persona. You can generate a document to reference throughout your content creation process.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/\">Anchor</a> is the podcasting tool for beginners. It’s free, allows you to record and store unlimited episodes, and you can easily upload to any third-party platform.</p> \n<p>This is far from an exhaustive list of all the great content creation tools out there — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-marketing-tools-list\">this list</a> is much better!</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Creating a Content Plan</strong></h2> \n<p>Content exists everywhere, but its success relies on <em>your</em> ability to adapt it to the medium on which it lives. One size does not fit all when it comes to posting on different mediums — or the platforms within those mediums, for that matter.</p> \n<p>Social media content varies from blog content, which is different than website content. So, you need to know how to tailor your creation to reach your audience where they are.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Let’s dive into some guidelines for sharing content on various platforms.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Content</h3> \n<p>There is an art to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-creation\">creating content for social media</a>. But it’s well worth your time since there are <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/\">2.6 billion</a> users across social media platforms worldwide. Plus, someone who follows you on social media is like a warm lead — they already like you and are interested in what you have to say. So, you have an eager audience that’s ready to engage with your content.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Here are a few quick tips for creating content on some popular social channels.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Facebook</strong> can be used to build micro communities via Facebook Groups or to share to a mass audience on Facebook Pages. When it comes to sharing content, questions and videos reap the most engagement.</p> \n<p><strong>Instagram</strong> is best for sharing high-quality imagery and short videos with brief captions. Hashtags work well on this platform as long as they’re relevant to your account and business. Instagram Stories has introduced a new way to engage with your followers, from quick polls to questions to real-time videos.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>YouTube</strong> has <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/12-best-types-of-youtube-content/\">1.3 billion users</a> and counting. Users frequent this platform to watch content ranging from DIY videos to parodies. Some of the most successful content on this platform are how-to guides, vlogs, product reviews, and educational videos.<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resources</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/beginners-guide-to-video-marketing?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">The Ultimate Video Marketing Starter Pack</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">YouTube for Business: A 30-Day Roadmap for Channel Growth</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Twitter</strong> best practices include short messages, supporting images, relevant hashtags, and retweets. And, of course, replies go a long way to win over your audience.</p> \n<h3>Website Content</h3> \n<p>Website content should focus on three things: your persona, your target keywords, and your solution. Not unlike your blog content, the copy on your website needs to guide visitors to your solution in a cohesive and natural way. Think of web content like a map to your product.</p> \n<p>Be careful not to turn visitors away through social media feeds and other distracting elements. Once you you’ve attracted a potential customer, you must do everything you can to keep them there, and that’s the key function of your website content.</p> \n<h3>Blog Content</h3> \n<p>The purpose of blog content is to support your business by attracting strangers and bringing in qualified leads. Blog content is a free resource that’s not often directly tied to sales, but don’t underestimate the power of a well-crafted blog to ultimately generate <a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/10/know-like-trust-content/\">revenue</a> for your business. Research shows that companies that blog more get more traffic and more leads than those that don’t.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resources</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-start-a-successful-blog?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Start a Successful Blog</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">5 Free Blog Post Templates</a></li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Analyzing Your Content</strong></h2> \n<p>The final, and arguably most important step in content creation is analyzing your content. Without data, you can’t know what’s working or how to improve it.</p> \n<p>There are several data points you could track when analyzing your content, so use your goals as a guide to set some parameters. Whatever you want to accomplish with your content will help you choose your metrics.

Use gridlines to balance your shot.</h3> \n<p>One of the easiest and best ways to improve your mobile photos is to turn on the camera's gridlines. That superimposes a series of lines on the screen of your smartphone's camera that are based on the \"<a href=\"http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/\">rule of thirds</a>\" — a photographic composition principle that says an image should be broken down into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, so you have nine parts in total.</p> \n<p>According to this theory, if you place points of interest in these intersections or along the lines, your photo will be more balanced, level, and allow viewers to interact with it more naturally.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rule-of-thirds.jpg?width=560&amp;name=rule-of-thirds.jpg\" alt=\"rule-of-thirds.jpg\" title=\"rule-of-thirds.jpg\" width=\"560\" style=\"width: 560px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/\">Digital Photography School</a></em></p> \n<p>To switch the grid on ...</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>iPhone:</strong> Go to \"Settings,\" choose \"Photos &amp; Camera,\" and switch \"Grid\" on.</li> \n <li><strong>Samsung Galaxy:</strong> Launch the camera app, go to \"Settings,\" scroll down and switch the \"grid lines\" option to \"on.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gridlines.jpg?width=600&amp;name=gridlines.jpg\" alt=\"gridlines.jpg\" title=\"gridlines.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEpKOHqELAM\">Lynda.com</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>2. Set your camera's focus.</h3> \n<p>Today's phone cameras automatically focus on the foreground of your frame, but not every picture you take on your phone has an obvious subject. To adjust where you want your camera lens to focus, open your camera app and tap the screen where you want to sharpen the view.</p> \n<p>If you're taking a photo of something in motion, for example, it can be difficult for your camera to follow this subject and refocus as needed. Tap the screen to correct your phone camera's focus just before snapping the picture to ensure the moving subject has as much focus as possible. A square or circular icon should then appear on your camera screen, shifting the focus of your shot to all of the content inside that icon.</p> \n<h3>3. Focus on one subject.</h3> \n<p>Many of the best photos include just one, interesting subject. So when taking a picture of one, spend some extra time setting up the shot. Some professional photographers say that the subject <a href=\"http://www.photokonnexion.com/the-simple-secrets-of-the-single-subject-shot/\">shouldn't fill the entire frame, and that two-thirds of the photo should be negative space</a> — that helps the subject stand out even more.</p> \n<p>But be sure you tap the screen of your smartphone to focus the camera on your subject — that'll help to ensure that it's focused and the lighting is optimized.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Once you've taken your photo, you can use filters and apps to make the subject even more vivid, or to crop it to frame the subject correctly. The brightness, contrast, and saturation of the photo can also be adjusted accordingly — all from your phone.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/patrick-2.png?width=1612&amp;name=patrick-2.png\" alt=\"@aguynamedpatrick instagram picture of himself in mirror holding a phone taking a picture of himself\" width=\"1612\" style=\"width: 1612px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aguynamedpatrick/\">Patrick Janelle</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>4. Embrace negative space.</h3> \n<p>\"Negative space\" simply refers to the areas around and between the subjects of an image — and it can take a photo from \"good\" to \"great.\"</p> \n<p>When you include a lot of empty space in a photo, your subject will stand out more and evoke a stronger reaction from your viewer. And what does negative space looks like? It's often a large expanse of open sky, an empty field, a large wall, or water, as in the example below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/eric%20christian.png?width=1618&amp;name=eric%20christian.png\" alt=\"eric christian in front of an ocean on instagram\" width=\"1618\" style=\"width: 1618px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericchristian/\">Eric Christian</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>5. Find different perspectives.</h3> \n<p>Taking photos from a unique, unexpected angle can make them more memorable — it tends to create an illusion of depth or height with the subjects. It also makes the image stand out, since most mobile photos are taken either straight -on or from a bird's eye view.</p> \n<p>Try taking a photo directly upward and playing with the sky as negative space, like in the first photo below. Or, you can try taking it at a slight downward angle.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you take a photo and find the perspective is a little askew or tilted, use the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile\">SKRWT photo editing app</a> to make the lines look clean and square.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bookshelf-perspective.png?width=599&amp;name=bookshelf-perspective.png\" alt=\"bookshelf-perspective.png\" title=\"bookshelf-perspective.png\" width=\"599\" style=\"width: 599px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://iphonephotographyschool.com/architecture/\">iPhone Photography School</a>; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/y70fRQoAqa/?taken-by=pauloctavious\">Paul Octavious</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>6. Play with reflections.</h3> \n<p>There's something so idyllic about seeing the sky reflected in a body of water. There's a reason why we love seeing that — our eyes are drawn to reflections. So look for opportunities to play with them in photos.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of out-of-the-box places to find reflections — puddles, larger bodies of water, mirrors, sunglasses, drinking glasses, and metallic surfaces are just a few.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/capture-reflections.png?width=599&amp;name=capture-reflections.png\" alt=\"capture-reflections.png\" title=\"capture-reflections.png\" width=\"599\" style=\"width: 599px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/yAonfphKvR/\">Joshua Lott</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>7. Use leading lines.</h3> \n<p>In some photos, there's a line that draws the viewer's eye toward a certain part of the frame. Those are called leading lines. They can be straight or circulinear — think staircases, building facades, train tracks, roads, or even a path through the woods.</p> \n<p>Leading lines are great for creating a sense of depth in an image, and can make your photo look purposefully designed — even if you just happened to come upon a really cool shape by accident.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/leading-lines-path.png?width=599&amp;name=leading-lines-path.png\" alt=\"leading-lines-path.png\" title=\"leading-lines-path.png\" width=\"599\" style=\"width: 599px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/srHhAzpMLj/?taken-by=carloscopertone\">Carlos Copertone</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>8. Look for symmetry.</h3> \n<p>Symmetry can be <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CSymmetry+is+a+vague+sense+of+harmonious+and+beautiful+proportion+and+balance%E2%80%9D.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ms5K2cCG4a&amp;sig=m6qY0wE_lVbWxPdvHkp3-9GDB3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV___Ms6fJAhVHGT4KHdJoAvkQ6AEIKjAC\">defined</a> as \"a vague sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.\" And pictures that contain symmetry can be incredibly pleasing to the eye — it's also one of the simplest and most compelling ways to compose a photo.</p> \n<p>In photography, <a href=\"http://www.school-of-digital-photography.com/2014/01/using-symmetry-to-improve-your-photography-composition.html\">symmetry usually means</a> creating an image that can be divided into two equal parts that are mirror images of each other. That's a bit different than reflections — symmetry can be found \"in the wild,\" as per the staircase picture, or you can set up your photo accordingly, like photographer Eric Christian did in the first photo below.</p> \n<p>And remember — use those gridlines from tip #1 to line everything up perfectly.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/symmetry.png?width=600&amp;name=symmetry.png\" alt=\"symmetry.png\" title=\"symmetry.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/6plxSXvOFr/?taken-by=ericchristian\">Eric Christian</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>9. Keep an eye out for repetitive patterns.</h3> \n<p>Repetitive patterns are very pleasing to the eye — they appear whenever strong graphic elements are repeated over and over again, like lines, geometric shapes, forms, and colors. These patterns can make a strong visual impact, and photographing something like a beautiful, tiled floor can be enough to create a striking image. Other times, it's more fun to keep an eye out for where they appear naturally or unintentionally, like with the congruent fire escapes on the left.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/soup-pattern.png?width=598&amp;name=soup-pattern.png\" alt=\"soup-pattern.png\" title=\"soup-pattern.png\" width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aguynamedpatrick/\">Patrick Janelle</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>10. Play around with color blocking.</h3> \n<p>Isn't it cool when an entire photo is black and white, except for a single object? It turns out that yes, indeed, there are apps for that. One of our favorites is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touch-color-black-white-partial/id560810455?mt=8\">Touch Color</a> — an app that automatically converts a picture to grayscale and lets you fill in the parts you want to colorize.</p> \n<p>Color blocking can help to highlight the elements of a photo that you want to stand out, like a plant or something else with a bold hue. It achieves a similar goal as negative space, in that it can help a single subject stand out — but with color blocking, the photo's other elements remain intact for a cohesive image.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/img_3845-copy.jpg?width=600&amp;name=img_3845-copy.jpg\" width=\"600\" title=\"img_3845-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Grayscaled photo taken on mobile camera with color blocking to reveal purple flower in woman's hand\"></span></em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://coloring.mibanquero.com/how-to-make-color-photos-black-and-white/\">Coloring Pages</a></span></em></p> \n<h3>11. Avoid zooming in.</h3> \n<p>When you take a photo from a distance, it's tempting to zoom in on something specific you're trying to capture. But it's actually better <em>not</em> to zoom in — doing so can make the photo appear grainy, blurry, or pixelated.</p> \n<p>Instead, try to get closer to your subject — unless it's a wild animal, in which case we would advise keeping your distance — or take the photo from a default distance, and crop it later on. That way, you won't compromise quality, and it's easier to play around or optimize a larger image.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/crop-photo-1.jpg?width=600&amp;name=crop-photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"crop-photo-1.jpg\" title=\"crop-photo-1.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://obamapacman.com/2011/10/apple-iphone-4s-icloud-camera-siri-tv-ads/\">Obama Pacman</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>12. Capture small details.</h3> \n<p>You may have heard the phrase, \"It's the little things.\" Sometimes, that also applies to photos. Close-up images that capture small, intricate, and delicate details can make for really compelling visual content. Keep an eye out for textures and patterns like peeling paint, a gravel road, or a tile tabletop.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Use the \"sharpen\" tool <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile\">in your favorite photo editing app</a> to (conservatively) sharpen the details of your photo. You might also download the Camera+ app and use its Clarity filter, which is what <em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577305702578426084\">The Wall Street Journal</a></em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577305702578426084\">'s Kevin Sintumuang calls</a> the app's \"secret sauce — it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tile-patterns.png?width=599&amp;name=tile-patterns.png\" alt=\"tile-patterns.png\" title=\"tile-patterns.png\" width=\"599\" style=\"width: 599px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/204_lWPOI2/?taken-by=ericchristian\">Eric Christian</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>13. Use natural light.</h3> \n<p>It's hard to find a great smartphone photo that was taken with a flash. Most of the time, they make a photo look overexposed, negatively altering colors and making human subjects look washed out. In fact, even the iPhone 7's flash is <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article/347907/iphone-7-plus-vs-iphone-6s-vs-galaxy-s7-cameras-compared\">rumored to have some flaws</a>.</p> \n<p>Take advantage of the sources of natural light you can find, even after dark. This gives you a chance to play with shadows, like in the second image below, or create a silhouette with other ambient sources of light, like traffic and surrounding buildings.</p> \n<p>Once you've taken the photo, play with the \"Exposure\" tool <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile\">in your favorite photo editing app</a> to see if you can make the image slightly brighter, without making it too grainy.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/no-flash-flower.png?width=596&amp;name=no-flash-flower.png\" alt=\"no-flash-flower.png\" title=\"no-flash-flower.png\" width=\"596\" style=\"width: 596px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/tDM9R1oAte/?taken-by=pauloctavious\">Paul Octavious</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>14. If you use flash, only do so during the day.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, using your camera's flash can improve a photo — but rarely does it do so at night. Because dark shots reveal a much sharper contrast against your phone's flash, it can make any flash look look invasive and uneven</p> \n<p>In already well-lit spaces, however, a flash can help to soften some dark shadows behind or beneath your main subject.</p> \n<p>When framing your next shot, look on the ground or against vertical surfaces for any dark shadows you might want to remove. If you see any, flip on the flash manually in your camera app. Setting your phone's camera flash to \"auto\" won't guarantee that your phone will notice the shadows you want to get rid of. Just remember to turn the flash off again when you're done.</p> \n<p>Consider the importance of flash for enhancing or hiding certain lines and features the next time you're shooting <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-photography-tips\">product photography</a>.</p> \n<h3>15. Consider buying a mobile tripod.</h3> \n<p>Although mobile devices make it easy to snap any photo on the go, there's never been an easy way to ensure the shot stays level and balanced when you shoot — especially if you want to be in the picture and not just take a typical selfie with your extended arm.</p> \n<p>Mobile tripods give you the freedom to mount your smartphone for quick hands-free shots without lugging any heavy equipment with you. Most mobile tripods are barely bigger than your mobile device, and can bend to any angle. Check out one of them from Joby, above, and learn how these miniature tripods can help enhance your mobile <em>video</em> experience below.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 380px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 59.38%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/anWNGQNr8DM?ecver=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>16. Set your camera app's exposure manually.</h3> \n<p>Another mobile camera feature you'll want to set manually is your exposure. Tapping your screen when your phone's camera is on doesn't just refocus the lens on a new subject — it also automatically adjusts how much light the camera lets in. This, too, won't always look just right. It's best to adjust it by hand.</p> \n<p>To change your mobile camera's exposure by hand, open your camera app and tap the screen. When you see the lens refocus, you'll see a very small sun icon and a vertical scale. Slowly swipe your finger up and down this scale to adjust the light level.</p> \n<h3>17. Create abstracts.</h3> \n<p>Abstract photos are meant to capture the essence of an object, or a series of them, without revealing the entire landscape as a whole. In other words, they serve the purpose of creating unique, surprising images from ordinary subjects.</p> \n<p>This look can be accomplished by cropping an abstract portion of an otherwise normal photo, or by taking close-up shots of objects that leave the viewer wondering — in admiration, of course — what the subject might be. And subjects with patterns or repetition are great candidates for abstract photography, like in the photo of sliced figs below.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/abstract-architecture.jpg?width=560&amp;name=abstract-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"abstract-architecture.jpg\" title=\"abstract-architecture.jpg\" width=\"560\" style=\"width: 560px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://iphonephotographyschool.com/architecture/\">iPhone Photography School</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>18. Take candids.</h3> \n<p>Posed photos can be great for the sake of memories — happy moments with friends, family, or the occasional run-in with a celebrity. But sometimes, candid shots of people doing things, or people with people, can be far more interesting.</p> \n<p>That's because candid photos are better able to effectively capture the emotion and essence of a moment. One of the best ways to capture this kind of shot is to just take as many photos as possible. You'll have more to choose from, and the best photos often happen when the \"stars align,\" so to speak, in a single moment — everyone's eyes are open, one person is tilting their head just so, and you finally got a shot of your chronically closed-lip friend smiling with his teeth.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/eating-candid.png?width=597&amp;name=eating-candid.png\" alt=\"eating-candid.png\" title=\"eating-candid.png\" width=\"597\" style=\"width: 597px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aguynamedpatrick/\">Patrick Janelle</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>19. Be non-conventional.</h3> \n<p>Composition is a huge part of what makes a photo great, but so is the photo's subject. Some of the most delightful and remarkable photos come out of cool, unique ideas. <a href=\"https://www.liveplan.com/blog/2016/01/scientific-reasons-why-you-should-present-your-data-visually/\">Images are more effective than text at evoking emotion</a> from your viewers — that often means getting your photos to <em>say </em>something.</p> \n<p>Try thinking outside of the box when it comes to what you're capturing — your viewers could be pleasantly surprised by a cool or unexpected subject.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/leaf-dog-constellation.png?width=599&amp;name=leaf-dog-constellation.png\" alt=\"leaf-dog-constellation.png\" title=\"leaf-dog-constellation.png\" width=\"599\" style=\"width: 599px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pauloctavious/\">Paul Octavious</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>20. Make 'em laugh.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of evoking emotion, sometimes the most memorable photos are the ones that make us giggle. The image below of an older woman wearing a brightly-colored shirt stating \"Hi hater\" is funny because it's unexpected — and there's a part of us that admires her, too. The second image of the dog toy on a dinner plate pokes fun at classic Instagram food shots, but it's from a dog's perspective. If you can make your audience laugh, they're likely to enjoy your photo.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pug-eating-toy.png?width=597&amp;name=pug-eating-toy.png\" alt=\"pug-eating-toy.png\" title=\"pug-eating-toy.png\" width=\"597\" style=\"width: 597px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/4R-6wiCgy7/?taken-by=jermzlee\">Jeremy Veach</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>21. Clean your phone's lens.</h3> \n<p>A smartphone camera might be more convenient to carry around than a full-fledged photojournalist's camera, but it comes at the cost of protection.</p> \n<p>Your phone is usually in your pocket or your bag when you're out of the house. All the while, the device's camera lens is collecting all kinds of dust and lint. Be sure to clean this lens with a soft handkerchief before taking a photo. You might not be able to tell just how dirty the lens was until you start editing your picture, and making sure the lens is crystal clear before taking a shot can keep you from starting from scratch.</p> \n<h3>22. Attach an external lens.</h3> \n<p>Want to get really fancy? External lenses are for you. There are actually several out there that can be attached to the top of your smartphone's native camera lens — from fish-eye to wide-angle lenses, these add-ons can bring an entirely new quality and perspective to your photos.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-lenses-for-iphone/\">According to Wirecutter</a>, the best camera lenses for iPhone photography are made by <a href=\"https://momentlens.co\">Moment</a>, a manufacturer of mobile lenses. Start there, or do some research to find the lens add-ons that fit your smartphone photography needs.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fish-eye-horses.jpg?width=504&amp;name=fish-eye-horses.jpg\" alt=\"Horses looking into fisheye external lens attached to phone camera\" title=\"fish-eye-horses.jpg\" width=\"504\" style=\"width: 504px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.mobilefun.co.uk/thumbsup-fish-eye-lens-for-iphone-4-5-5s-p39297.htm\">MobileFun.co.uk</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>23. Don't be afraid to edit.</h3> \n<p>Composing and taking your smartphone photo is just the first step to making it visually compelling. Editing your photos is the next step — and a very critical one, at that. Filters can be a valuable photographic tool, particularly when it comes to two goals: 1) Removing blemishes from a picture, and 2) making food look even more delicious.</p> \n<p>For the first, <em>InStyle</em> magazine compiled a fun list of \"<a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/news/instagram-filters-beauty-complaints\">The Best Instagram Filters for Every Beauty Complaint</a>\" — and now, the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/photos/\">iPhone photos app</a> offers many similar filters. There are also apps like <a href=\"http://makeup.pho.to/\">Pho.to</a>, which can automatically retouch facial photos without a lot of work. And when it comes to those photos of your daily meals? One of the latest apps available is <a href=\"https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2016/1236\">Foodie</a>, which comes with its own set of filters optimized for different types of food.</p> \n<p>But there are many other great photo and video editing apps out there for mobile devices — check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile?_ga=1.120640904.1053898511.1470656920\">this post</a> to see some of the best ones out there.</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/51b3f40f.png?width=730&amp;height=365&amp;name=51b3f40f.png\" alt=\"51b3f40f.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"365\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://official-blog.line.me/en/archives/1052175945.html\">LINE Corp.</a></span></em></p> \n<p>Want more tips on creating visual content?

As ecommerce grows, so does competition, making it hard to differentiate your website from everyone else's.</p> \n<p>It isn't enough to have a one-of-a-kind product: to attract your ideal audience — and more importantly, to turn that audience into passionate brand ambassadors — you need a one-of-a-kind website.</p> \n<p>A sleek and captivating Shopify website can attract a large audience and even act as your start-to-finish marketing pitch.</p> \n<p>But you need to know what makes one Shopify website better than the rest. Here, we've curated a list of 16 best of the best <a href=\"https://www.websitetooltester.com/en/reviews/shopify/\">Shopify</a> stores to inspire your own.</p> \n<p>Whether you're new to ecommerce and about to design your first website, or an ecommerce veteran considering a redesign to outshine your competitors in 2018, this list offers plenty of creative ideas.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Top Shopify Stores</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>UgMonk</li> \n  <li>Pipcorn</li> \n  <li>Taylor Stitch</li> \n  <li>Happiness Abscissa</li> \n  <li>Skinny Teatox</li> \n  <li>HELM Boots</li> \n  <li>BioLite</li> \n  <li>Pop Chart Lab</li> \n  <li>Luca and Danni</li> \n  <li>Harris Farm Markets</li> \n  <li>So Worth Loving</li> \n  <li>Great George Watches</li> \n  <li>Choose Muse</li> \n  <li>Brilliant</li> \n  <li>Holstee</li> \n  <li>Kylie Cosmetics</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/-hubspot-becomes-one-of-the-first-marketing-software-companies-to-integrate-with-linkedin-company-pages\">UgMonk</a></h3> \n<p>Jeff Sheldon starts the \"About\" section on his UgMonk website with a simple question: \"Why was it so difficult to find fresh, high-quality, unique items in a modern aesthetic?\" His Shopify site is simple and fresh, and exhibits UgMonk's clothing, workplace items, bags, and prints in the same modern aesthetic style he sought while designing his unique products.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ugmonk.png\" alt=\"UgMonk Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.pipsnacks.com/\">Pipcorn</a></h3> \n<p>When you think about popcorn, I'm betting the first concern that comes to mind isn't \"is it healthy?\" Pipcorn knows this, so their homepage features a simple slogan: \"Most tender, crunchy, delicious popcorn … and it won't destroy your teeth like the ‘generic' stuff.\"&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">The best websites know their target audience's primary concerns (in this case, the taste of popcorn and the kernels in teeth), and sell them on those solutions upfront. </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">If you look on their \"About Us\" page, you'll find Pipcorn's products are also non-GMO, vegan, gluten free, and whole grain. Even though this could have easily been incorporated into their slogan, they chose to exclude it in favor of tackling our bigger concern: </span><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1.1rem;\">Does it taste good?</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pipcorn.png\" alt=\"Pipcorn Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.taylorstitch.com/\">Taylor Stitch</a></h3> \n<p>The inner child in me loves Taylor Stitch's website because of the creative alternatives displayed when you hover over a product: a jacket, for instance, flips to an image of a model posing with the jacket on a motorcycle.</p> \n<p>The Taylor Stitch website does something else really cool, too: it almost immediately calls more attention to its message than its products, with \"Three Simple Ingredients\" written across most of the images you see on the homepage. Taylor Stitch doesn't just make high-quality clothing. It also aims to reduce waste and help the environment by creating clothing with recycled or 100% natural products.</p> \n<p>On their website, you can't miss their environmental efforts, and I'm betting this is a differentiating factor for most buyers when they come across the site.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/taylor%20stitch.png\" alt=\"Taylor Stitch Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.happinessabscissa.com/\">Happiness Abscissa</a></h3> \n<p>Many of the websites I mention on this list have clean, straight lines. Happiness Abscissa is unique. It shows a playful side by displaying a layout with bright abstract images, and even products hanging from different angles.</p> \n<p>The company's logo, a crooked \"Ha,\" draws in the viewer's attention, and then they use Ha in a sentence without defining the word, further stimulating viewers' curiosity. You get the sense they don't take themselves too seriously, affording the viewer a cheerful and fun experience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/happinessabscissa.png\" alt=\"Happiness Abscissa Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://skinny-teatox.com/\">Skinny Teatox</a></h3> \n<p>I myself was tempted to purchase the Teatox product when I checked out this site (in my defense, they were having a one-day flash sale I did not want to miss). The Skinny Teatox homepage immediately confronts your biggest concerns (\"Is it natural? Yes. Will it work? Yes.\"), and uses pastel colors and cute icons of bikinis and mugs to convey a fresh vibe.</p> \n<p>As I've noticed with a few other Shopify websites, Skinny Teatox places its products on the homepage with an easy \"buy now\" call-to-action. For a company that isn't too complex to figure out (\"All Natural Detox Weight Loss Tea\" is written beside the company name in search engines), I think it makes sense to offer the viewers what they want upfront.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/skinnyteatox.png\" alt=\"Skinny Teatox Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://helmboots.com/\">HELM Boots</a></h3> \n<p>\"Our boots give men confidence from the ground up, confidence to take steps they've never taken before.\" Immediately, HELM incentivizes viewers through emotion: <em>I might just be a guy looking to buy some boots, but yes, I'd definitely also like some confidence and bravery while I'm at it.</em> The website looks elegant, and you can find everything from the homepage, which is designed to convert viewers at various stages of the buyer's journey and assuage doubts as you scroll.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/helm-1.png\" alt=\"HELM Boots Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.bioliteenergy.com/\">BioLite</a></h3> \n<p>I might be a sucker for the little details, but the product images on BioLite's website are enough to make me want to buy something (they look 3-D and illuminated, and some even look wet from rain!).</p> \n<p>Since BioLite's major selling point is its humanitarian impact (the products bring affordable energy access to places in India and Africa), the first thing on the homepage is their slogan, \"Gear That Brings Energy Everywhere,\" which will appeal to their target audience.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">The navigation bar at the top also has a clever twist: beside each product title, there are little black-and-white cartoon drawings of the product.</span></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/biolite.png\" alt=\"BioLite Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.popchartlab.com/\">Pop Chart Lab </a></h3> \n<p>This site looks like one of the vintage and trendy prints they sell. It's also organized in different categories depending on a viewer's browsing preference.</p> \n<p>First, Pop Chart Lab's Shopify store has a scroll-down navigation with sub-categories ranging from, \"NYC\" to \"Kids\" to \"Hip Hop\" to \"Wine.\" They also have a carousel with some of their top prints on display. Below the carousel, they offer \"wholesale,\" \"gift guides,\" and \"scratch-off\" collections, for viewers who are having a difficult time discerning what they want. The shop manages to appear simple, despite its vast array of different print products, which is no easy feat.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/popchart.png\" alt=\"Pop Chart Lab Shopify store with Marvel superhero promotion\"></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://lucadanni.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlJL7gvuU2gIVhLrACh2YXw8VEAAYASAAEgI7wPD_BwE\">Luca and Danni </a></h3> \n<p>There's something addictive about an ecommerce store that changes as you scroll. Luca and Danni's page is highly interactive: as you scroll, some images get bigger and others get smaller, boxes of bracelets open up within images, and some images follow you down the page. It can be tricky to offer so much movement on a page while remaining coherent, but somehow, Luca and Danni accomplish this. There's also a very zen vibe to the whole layout, with images of palm trees and cactuses, and calls-to-action with language like \"brighter days: shop soil to sky,\" and \"find what speaks to you.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/lucadanni.png\" alt=\"Luca and Danni Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>10.<a href=\"https://www.harrisfarm.com.au/\"> Harris Farm Markets</a></h3> \n<p>This is a family-owned company, something you can't miss from the homepage. It's casual and playful, with text that looks like a child's handwriting and colorful drawings of fruit (there's even an adorable drawing of a bee with animated wings!). Even the calls-to-action sound laid-back, like \"What's nature been up to?\" It's so genuine, you can imagine a family building the site together.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/harrisfarms.png\" alt=\"Harris Farm Markets Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://shop.soworthloving.com/\">So Worth Loving </a></h3> \n<p>Sometimes, being evasive pays off. While it's not always a good idea to hide your products from the viewer, it can be a very smart move if your product doesn't make sense without understanding the backstory. With So Worth Loving's site, you don't even see the t-shirts for sale until a third of the way down the page. By that point, you've already read their slogan, a little bio from the founder, Eryn, and a full narrative about how the site began.</p> \n<p>The site leans into personal touches, with handwritten-looking quotes scrawled across images and very normal looking images of people posing in t-shirts. This is a great example of knowing your audience enough to break the rules.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/soworthloving.png\" alt=\"So Worth Loving Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://www.greatgeorgewatches.com/\">Great George Watches</a></h3> \n<p>I'm not an experienced watch shopper, so when I first read, \"Made with Swiss parts and 100% square,\" on Great George Watches' homepage, I thought maybe \"square\" was a fancy term I'd understand if I knew watches. But as I scrolled and read, \"Think outside the circle,\" I realized these terms were unique to Great George Watches, which are all square-faced.</p> \n<p>By emphasizing what makes their product unique before even showing the produce, Great George Watches captivates the viewer. I love this shop because it has a refined and polished look, with black-and-white photos and an attention-grabbing red call-to-action button.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/george.png\" alt=\"Great George Watches Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"http://www.choosemuse.com/\">Choose Muse </a></h3> \n<p>Choose Muse incorporates a full-display video of a man putting headphones on and using Choose Muse's product right from the homepage. The video starts playing immediately (as opposed to offering a play button option), which is especially eye-catching. I usually think <em>simple is better</em> when it comes to design, but Choose Muse proves me wrong, incorporating compelling designs with a ton of images and text, while still retaining a clean and enjoyable viewer experience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/choosemuse.png\" alt=\"Choose Muse Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>14. <a href=\"https://brilliant.org/\">Brilliant</a></h3> \n<p>For a math and science website, Brilliant is surprisingly easy-to-navigate (even for someone like me, an English major … ), with big, colorful block buttons to choose the math concept you want to learn. This shop is also a fantastic example of using a call-to-action button wisely: there's a big \"sign up for free\" button prominently displayed in the top right, and then another at the bottom of the page, after you've scrolled past the information you need.</p> \n<p>The site doesn't have a navigation bar, but instead uses the web page to answer all the questions a viewer might have.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/brilliant.png\" alt=\"Brilliant Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>15. <a href=\"https://www.holstee.com/\">Holstee</a></h3> \n<p>Holstee does a fantastic job of designing their site in tiers depending on a person's initial level of interest in the product. For starters, you see the text, \"We help you along your journey to live more fully and mindfully.\" If you're already convinced, you can click \"Join today\" right below the text. If not, you can continue to scroll down the homepage to find pain points this product reduces, read a \"Holstee Manifesto,\" see Membership benefits, check out testimonials, and find publications Holstee's been featured in.</p> \n<p>Throughout the page, there are various calls-to-action, like \"Choose a plan that's right for you,\" and then, at the end, \"Become a member today.\" I love this site because it becomes increasingly convincing and in-depth as you scroll: it's clear they use their homepage as a start-to-finish marketing pitch.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/holstee.png\" alt=\"Holstee Shopify store\"></p> \n<h3>16. <a href=\"https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/\">Kylie Cosmetics </a></h3> \n<p>As one of the top <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-top-10-people-2017-2017-11\">10 most followed accounts on Instagram</a>, Kylie Jenner's Cosmetic brand is one of the bigger brands using Shopify today. Her site has a very distinct girly-girl vibe, with a bubble-gum pink background showing off her lip kits and gloss.</p> \n<p>Kylie's site is also well-organized for her audience: the lip kits, her best-known items, are shown first on the homepage, with \"top sellers\" below that. I didn't feel overwhelmed looking through the various cosmetic products like I thought I would, and what really stood out to me about Kylie's site is the fun, colorful layout. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm betting it appeals to her target audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/kylie.png\" alt=\"Kylie Cosmetics Shopify store\"></p> \n<p>See a store design above that you like?

Or perhaps you got an email about an upcoming workshop, but you were busy and forgot to put a reminder in your calendar for it? Yep, I'm guessing that's happened even to the most type-A of us.</p> \n<p>Well, if you're an email marketer, you've been on the other side of this, when half of the registrants for an event you promoted never showed up. It sucks.</p> \n<p>Luckily for you, you don't have to worry about that anymore, because we're about to share a marketing hack with you: how to insert Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Google Calendar invites right into your email in a few easy steps. That way, registrants can add the event directly to their calendars, and then be much less likely to forget about your event.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/schedule-meeting?hubs_campaign=freemiumacquisition&amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/calendar-invites-ical-outlook-google&amp;hubs_cta=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/calendar-invites-ical-outlook-google-text\">Get instant access to our free meeting scheduling software. No more wasting time with back and forth emails or setting up calendar invites.</a></h3> \n<p>Unless you somehow magically know what type of calendar your target audience uses, your best bet is to include all three major calendar invites in your email, giving recipients a choice that works for them. Outlook and Apple Calendar users will get an .ics file and Google Calendar users will use a URL-based custom invitation.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All screenshots and steps were taken on a Mac, but if you're on a PC, the process is similar.</p> \n<h2><strong>Step 1: Create a New Event</strong></h2> \n<p>If you have a Mac, you can create your invitation in Apple Calendar. If you have a PC, you can create it in Outlook. For Google Calendar, you'll create the URL directly from your calendar application (you'll need to be logged into your Google account to do this) -- it doesn't matter which type of computer you have.</p> \n<h3><strong>Apple Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p>Open <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/calendar/\">Apple Calendar</a> and click on the \"+\" sign in the bottom right corner of the window. A pop-up will appear. Enter the name of your event in the \"New Event\" text box and hit return/enter on your keyboard. This will create an event on your calendar, but it will place the event on the current date and time and leave the rest of the details blank. You'll need to change this information to reflect the details of your event (more on that in the next section).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/apple%20calendar.jpg?width=2872&amp;name=apple%20calendar.jpg\" alt=\"the apple calendar homepage with an arrow to the new event button in bottom right corner\" width=\"2872\" style=\"width: 2872px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>Outlook</strong></h3> \n<p>Open up <a href=\"https://outlook.live.com/calendar/0/view/month\">Outlook Calendar</a>, then click on the \"New Event\" icon in the top left corner. An event pop-up will open for editing — simply include the title of the event, time and date, location, and whether or not you want to set a reminder. To find the option to \"Invite attendees\", click \"More options\".&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook%20calendar.jpg?width=2766&amp;name=outlook%20calendar.jpg\" alt=\"outlook calendar homepage with arrow pointing to new event button\" width=\"2766\" style=\"width: 2766px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>Google Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar/\">Open Google Calendar</a> in a new browser window. You'll need to be logged into your Google account. Click the \"Create\" button on the top left side of the screen. A new event window should open.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20chrome.jpg?width=2444&amp;name=google%20chrome.jpg\" alt=\"google calendar homepage with arrow pointing to create button\" width=\"2444\" style=\"width: 2444px;\"></p> \n<h2><strong>Step 2: Set Details for Your Event</strong></h2> \n<p>While Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Google Calendar events have slightly different formats, you'll still need the same components for each one:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Event name</li> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Time</li> \n <li>Event description</li> \n <li>URL of your event's landing page</li> \n <li>Optional event alert</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Below are examples of how these details look in the different applications, as well as a clarification of what information and format to use for each of these components.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Apple Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/apple%20calendar%20event.png?width=420&amp;name=apple%20calendar%20event.png\" alt=\"apple calendar event\" width=\"420\" style=\"width: 420px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><br></strong></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Outlook</strong></h3> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook%20calendar.png?width=1062&amp;name=outlook%20calendar.png\" alt=\"outlook calendar event\" width=\"1062\" style=\"width: 1062px;\"></strong></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Google Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20calendar.png?width=1190&amp;name=hubspot%20calendar.png\" alt=\"google calendar event\" width=\"1190\" style=\"width: 1190px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>The Details You Need to Include</strong></h3> \n<h4><strong>Event Name&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>Make sure the name reflects what your actual event name is called on your website and in your other promotions (this is a no-brainer, but we're being thorough here). You may want to also include your company name at the end so registrants can quickly remember who is hosting the event when they stumble on it in their calendar later<strong>.</strong></p> \n<h4><strong>Location</strong></h4> \n<p>Physical address of the event (one line, such as \"123 Business Ave, Springfield, TX\") or the landing page URL, in the case of an online event.</p> \n<h4><strong>Time</strong></h4> \n<p>Enter the start and end dates and times of the actual event. Adjust the timing of the event to <strong>your time zone</strong>, as you're the one creating the .ics file. It will automatically change the time to correspond with each person's time zone. For example, if you're creating the event file in Boston for a webinar in San Francisco that starts at 10 a.m. PST, you should enter the start time as 1 p.m. EST.</p> \n<h4><strong>Alert (Optional)</strong></h4> \n<p>You can set up alerts so attendees don't forget about the event between when you sent the invite and the time of the event. In Outlook, you can set a time for one reminder to go off (such as one hour before). In Apple Calendar and Google Calendar you can set multiple alerts.</p> \n<p>It's important to not overwhelm people with too many alerts, as this creates a negative, intrusive experience. Below is an example of an alert sequence in Apple Calendar that reminds folks about your event but isn't in-your-face:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20alerts%20on%20calendar.png?width=882&amp;name=hubspot%20alerts%20on%20calendar.png\" alt=\"hubspot alerts on calendar\" width=\"882\" style=\"width: 882px;\"></p> \n<h4><strong>URL of Event Landing Page</strong></h4> \n<p>Do you have a specific landing page for your event or webinar? Include its URL, as it acts as a refresher for those who may be fuzzy on the details of what the event is about. Include it in the URL section of an Apple Calendar invite as well as in the body text of your Gmail or Outlook invites if you haven't already included it in the Location section.</p> \n<h4><strong>Description</strong></h4> \n<p>Here, you should include a snippet of the event's details. This goes in the \"note\" section of your Apple Calendar invite, in the body of your Outlook invite, or in the \"description\" text box in Google Calendar.</p> \n<p>It's also helpful to provide your contact info in this section. That way, people can reach out if they have any questions.</p> \n<h2><strong>Step 3: Save and Send Your Event</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you're all set editing the invite, you can save it to use as an attachment in your marketing email.</p> \n<h3><strong>Outlook</strong></h3> \n<p>Click on your event in Outlook, select \"Edit\", and then click \"More options\". Once you see the pop-up (shown below), type the emails of people you'd like to invite into the text bar \"Invite attendees\". When you're ready, click \"Send\" in the top left of the screen to send the invite to people in your recipient list.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook%20save%20and%20send.png?width=1426&amp;name=outlook%20save%20and%20send.png\" alt=\"outlook save and send\" width=\"1426\" style=\"width: 1426px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>Apple Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p>Double click on your Apple event to open it up, and then type emails into the \"Invitees\" text box. When you're ready, click \"OK\", and the invite will automatically be sent to the emails you've included in the event details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/apple%20save%20and%20send.png?width=740&amp;name=apple%20save%20and%20send.png\" alt=\"apple save and send\" width=\"740\" style=\"width: 740px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>Google Calendar</strong></h3> \n<p>Click on your event in your Google calendar and click \"Edit event\". Then type emails into the \"Add guests\" text box to the right of your event details (next to \"Rooms\"). When you're ready, select \"Save\". If you've done it correctly, Google Calendar will show you a pop-up confirming you'd like to send the event to guests. Click \"Send\" to ensure it gets sent to the emails you've included.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail%20save%20and%20send.png?width=2058&amp;name=gmail%20save%20and%20send.png\" alt=\"gmail save and send\" width=\"2058\" style=\"width: 2058px;\"></p> \n<h2><strong>Step 4: Insert Invites Into Your Marketing Email</strong></h2> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The easiest way to send an event via email for Outlook, Apple, and Gmail is to do it directly from the event invite itself. Each of these email providers give you the opportunity to type emails directly into the event, and include additional text, attachments, etc.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Best of all, the invite you'll receive is clean and offers you the opportunity to accept or deny the invite directly from your email inbox:&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/invite-Oct-26-2020-03-44-36-08-PM.png?width=998&amp;name=invite-Oct-26-2020-03-44-36-08-PM.png\" alt=\"invite-Oct-26-2020-03-44-36-08-PM\" width=\"998\" style=\"width: 998px;\">However, there are a few workarounds you can try if you'd prefer to include the event URL in a marketing email.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Gmail Calendar</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For Gmail calendar, click \"Edit\" to open the event in a new window, and then select the \"More actions\" dropdown. From there, click \"Publish event\":&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.27.57%20AM.png?width=2284&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.27.57%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11.27.57 AM\" width=\"2284\" style=\"width: 2284px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the pop-up screen, you'll see an HTML code or a link to the event. Simply click \"Copy\" beside the link to copy the link, and then open the email you intend to send and paste the URL.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.28.07%20AM.png?width=1178&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.28.07%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11.28.07 AM\" width=\"1178\" style=\"width: 1178px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You'll want to ensure, however, that each email recipient has been included on the event invite list, as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Apple Calendar</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you're using Apple Calendar, alternatively, you'll need to get a little more creative. To workaround the option of sending the event to a recipient directly from the event details, simply send the event&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>to your own email. When you open the invite, you'll see a .ics link attached to the email:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.50.16%20AM.png?width=476&amp;height=98&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2011.50.16%20AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 11.50.16 AM\" width=\"476\" height=\"98\" style=\"width: 476px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simply download the .ics attachment, and then drag-and-drop that calendar event into an email to send it to recipients.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Outlook Calendar</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, if you're using Outlook, you'll need to open your inbox and select \"New Items\" &gt; \"Meeting\":</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2012.15.22%20PM.png?width=524&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2012.15.22%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 12.15.22 PM\" width=\"524\" style=\"width: 524px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/schedule-a-meeting-with-other-people-5c9877bc-ab91-4a7c-99fb-b0b68d7ea94f\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Click \"New Meeting\", and finally, select \"Reply with Meeting\" from within an email itself:&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2012.13.48%20PM.png?width=492&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%2012.13.48%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 12.13.48 PM\" width=\"492\" style=\"width: 492px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/schedule-a-meeting-with-other-people-5c9877bc-ab91-4a7c-99fb-b0b68d7ea94f\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that's it!

Check. Instagram? Check. Pinterest? Check.</p> \n<p>But — what about Amazon?</p> \n<p>In 2018, Amazon launched <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-advertising-simplified\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>\"Amazon Advertising\"</span></a>, (formerly Amazon Marketing Services, or AMS), as a search advertising solution for Amazon vendors. Similar to pay-per-click ads on Google, sellers only pay when shoppers click on ads.</p> \n<p>AMS is rapidly growing. In fact, Amazon's ad revenues are projected to amount to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/259811/net-us-advertising-revenues-of-amazon/\"><span>12.75 billion in 2020</span></a>, with an impressive <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/259811/net-us-advertising-revenues-of-amazon/\"><span>23% growth since 2019</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you're already not using <span>AMS</span>, your team should consider it. Amazon Advertising could become a core advertising platform for many businesses, as well as a good alternative to Google and Facebook.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>To help you get started advertising on Amazon, we've created this ultimate guide that fleshes out each type of ad you can run on Amazon and some of their best practices. Read on to learn how to advertise on the ecommerce platform in 2020.</p> \n<p>Keep reading, or jump to a specific type of Amazon advertising:</p> \n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#amazon-sponsored-ads\">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#Amazon-Headline-Search-Ads\">Amazon Headline Search Ads</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#amazon-product-display-ads\">Amazon Product Display Ads</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#amazon-native-ads\">Amazon Native Ads</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#amazon-video-ads\">Amazon Video Ads</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-advertising#amazon-stores\">Amazon Stores</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Amazon Advertising Strategy</strong></h2> \n<p>Even though we'll be describing five unique types of Amazon advertisements that all have different best practices, here are seven general tips for shaping a successful <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-marketing-strategy\">Amazon advertising strategy</a>:</p> \n<h3><strong>1. Determine your goals.</strong></h3> \n<p>Whether you want to drive more sales or boost brand awareness, Amazon allows you to align your targets with your goals. For instance, you can deem your <a href=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201528520\"><span>Advertising Cost of Sales</span></a> (ACoS) as your metric of success if you're focusing on driving more sales.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can deem impressions as your metric of success if you're focusing on boosting brand awareness.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Amazon divides its product page up into \"Objectives\" if it's easiest for you to figure out which Amazon ad product works best for you depending on your goals. For instance, video ads, display ads, audio ads, and custom advertising solutions are <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/objectives/brand-advertising?ref_=a20m_us_hnav_obj_brd\"><span>recommended if your goal is to grow brand awareness</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By working backwards from your goals, you'll ensure the strategy you implement on Amazon is best-suited for your business needs.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>2. Choose the right products to advertise.</strong></h3> \n<p>Advertising your most popular products gives you the best chance to convert clicks into purchases. You should also make sure these products are in stock and priced competitively.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you have a new product or service for which you'd like to increase awareness. When choosing the right products or services to advertise, you'll want to keep your goals in-mind, and also ensure you've done your research to determine <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-marketing-strategy\"><span>whether Amazon is the right platform</span></a> to showcase your products in the first place.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Craft clear, concise, and compelling product detail pages.</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon ads can entice shoppers to visit your product detail pages, but the product detail page is what will ultimately turn those shoppers into customers. To craft a persuasive product detail page, consider including accurate and descriptive titles, high-quality images, and relevant and useful product information.</p> \n<h3><strong>4. Choose where you want to place your ads.</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon offers a variety of products within its full advertising suite — for instance, you can create voice ads to display across Alexa-enabled devices, video ads to stream across Fire TV or Amazon-exclusive sites like IMBD, or display ads to attract Amazon users to your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Once you've determined whether voice, video, or search is right for you, you'll want to investigate various options, including sponsored brand ads versus sponsored product ads (which we'll discuss in the next step).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, there are tons of opportunities to place your ads on various devices or sites with Amazon, so consider getting creative. Perhaps an audio advertisement that plays on Alexa-enabed devices is best-suited for your business, or maybe you'll find the highest ROI with Amazon DSP, which allows you to reach Amazon audiences on both Amazon-owned and third-party sites and apps.</p> \n<h3><strong>5. Test out sponsored brands versus sponsored products.</strong></h3> \n<p>To explore the differences between sponsored brands versus sponsored products, let's consider the following example.</p> \n<p>When I search <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby+food&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2\"><span>\"baby food\" on Amazon</span></a>, the first sponsored placement I see is <a href=\"https://www.gerber.com/about/\"><span>Gerber's</span></a> sponsored brand post, which highlights a few different Gerber products to increase brand awareness and drive sales:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gerber%20sponsored%20brand%20on%20amazon.png?width=1752&amp;name=gerber%20sponsored%20brand%20on%20amazon.png\" alt=\"gerber sponsored brand on amazon\" width=\"1752\" style=\"width: 1752px;\" /></p> \n<p>However, consider what happens when I click on an individual Gerber baby food product. In the bottom right of the product screen right below the \"Buy Now\" button, I see a <a href=\"https://www.happyfamilyorganics.com/tot/\"><span>Happy Family Organics</span></a> advertisement for an individual product — Stage 4 Fiber &amp; Protein baby food pouches:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/happy%20tot%20sponsored%20product%20on%20amazon.png?width=444&amp;name=happy%20tot%20sponsored%20product%20on%20amazon.png\" alt=\"happy tot sponsored product on amazon\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<p>This is the difference between a sponsored brand versus a sponsored product post. Simply put, a <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/sponsored-brands\"><span>sponsored brand</span></a> post can display a few of your products or services, and is ultimately best-suited for companies aiming to increase brand awareness around an entire product line.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, a <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/sponsored-products\"><span>sponsored product</span></a> post is a cost-per-click (CPC) ad that promotes individual product listings on Amazon. If you're hoping to drive sales to a specific product or you'd like to target a niche audience (for instance, anyone who's already clicked on a competitor's product), this might be the better option for you.</p> \n<h3><strong>6. Use category-specific targeting.&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon offers <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/new-bidding-and-targeting-options-for-sponsored-products\"><span>advanced targeting functionality</span></a> to help you display your products alongside top-rated products, or even alongside tangentially-related products — for instance, if you sell K-cups for a keurig, you might serve your ad to Amazon users who've searched for \"keurig\".&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By using Product Attribute Targeting, you're able to show ads to shoppers who've shown interest in other products within your industry. This advanced targeting capability helps you maximize effectiveness of your ads. Plus, it allows you to increase brand recognition with a high-intent audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, when I search for basketballs on Amazon and click on a Wilson product, I can scroll down and see a section labelled \"Sponsored products related to this item\":&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sponsored%20products%20related%20to%20basketball%20on%20amazon.png?width=2332&amp;name=sponsored%20products%20related%20to%20basketball%20on%20amazon.png\" alt=\"sponsored products related to basketball on amazon\" width=\"2332\" style=\"width: 2332px;\" /></p> \n<p>Avid basketball players are likely more inclined to take a look at knee braces or sports cones, making this an effective ad placement. Even if shoppers arent' in the&nbsp;</p> \n<p>even if I'm not in the market right now, I'll ideally keep these brands in-mind for the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>7. Take advantage of negative keywords to reduce wasted spend.&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>It's important you avoid wasting ad spend by including negative keywords — or which keywords you <em>don't </em>want to appear for — to avoid serving your ad to people who won't convert.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Consider, for instance, the difference between a search for \"granola bars\" and a search for \"KIND granola bars\". You don't want to appear in a search for \"KIND granola bars\", when the user is clearly determined to find a specific granola brand.</p> \n<p>For this reason, you might want to include brands like \"KIND\" or \"Chewy\" in your negative keywords list, so your ad can be served to users with a more general interest in perusing various granola brand products.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You'll also want to include negative keywords if they don't relate to your product to avoid wasting your ad spend towards people who aren't interested in your product. For instance, if your product isn't gluten-free, you'll want \"gluten free\" on your negative keywords list.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, you might consider getting more specific to target your ads at a smaller, more high-intent group of people. Rather than simply targeting \"granola bar\", you might try targeting \"low-sugar granola bar\", for instance.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Amazon Sponsored Ads</strong></h2> \n<p>Amazon Sponsored Product Ads are pay-per-click, keyword-targeted display ads for individual products that appear on the search results and product detail pages. With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/amazon-sponsored-product-ads\">Sponsored Product Ads,</a> there are three types of keywords you can bid on if you decide to leverage manual targeting — broad, phrase, and exact.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sponsored%20sock%20product%20on%20amazon.png?width=2008&amp;name=sponsored%20sock%20product%20on%20amazon.png\" alt=\"sponsored sock product on amazon\" width=\"2008\" style=\"width: 2008px;\" /></p> \n<p>Broad keywords can include words before and after the target keyword, like \"white hand mixers\", if you sell hand mixers. Targeting these keywords will expose your ads to the greatest amount of traffic.</p> \n<p><strong>Phrase keywords</strong> focus on how the sequence of the words you use changes the context of a query. For example, \"stainless steel hand mixer\" indicates you sell hand mixers. But \"hand stainless steel mixer\" indicates you sell stainless steel mixers, but not necessarily stainless steel hand mixers.</p> \n<p><strong>Exact keywords</strong> are the most constraining type of targeted keyword — a shopper's search query must contain the exact keyword for your ad to show up and no words can come before or after the keyword. For example, if you choose to target exact keywords, you can target an ad for \"hand mixer\", but it won't show up for the query \"electric hand mixer\".</p> \n<p>Using Sponsored Product Ads, you can also use automatic keyword targeting, which leverages an algorithm to target the most relevant keywords for your product ads.</p> \n<p>To gauge the performance of your ads, Sponsored Product Ads offers a reporting tool that displays your ads' clicks, spend, sales, and advertising cost of sales (ACoS).</p> \n<h3>Amazon Sponsored Ads Best Practices</h3> \n<h4>Targeting</h4> \n<p>With Amazon Sponsored Product Ads, you can find keywords that have low conversion rates and flag them as negative. This way, Amazon will stop showing your ad to shoppers who search for those queries. Ensuring you flag certain keywords as negative is critical — even if these keywords have a high click-through-rate, their low conversion rate means they're probably not reaching the right type of shoppers.</p> \n<h4>Bidding</h4> \n<p>Available in Manual Targeting ad campaigns, you can leverage Bid+ to boost the odds of your ad appearing at the top of search results. You can only use Bid+ on ads that are eligible to appear at the top of search results, but when you do, you can increase your default bid by up to 50%, keeping your top performing campaigns competitive, without having to constantly adjust your bids manually.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2><strong>Amazon Headline Search Ads (a.k.a. Sponsored Brand Campaigns)</strong></h2> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(1)-12.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"example of amazon headline search ad of crossbody bag\"> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/sponsored-brands-6-tips\">Image Source</a></em></p> <p>Currently known as Sponsored Brand Campaigns, this type of Amazon advertising allows you to promote keyword-targeted ads of multiple products above, below, and alongside search results.</p> <p>Using Sponsored Brand Campaigns, you can target three types of keywords -- branded product keywords, complementary product keywords, and sponsored products automatic targeting keywords.</p> <p><strong>Branded product keywords</strong> are a combination of your brand name and a product you sell.</p> <p><strong>Complimentary product keywords</strong> are a bundle of two individual products that influence the demand for each other and can be sold together (like ketchup and mustard).</p> <p><strong>Sponsored products automatic targeting keywords</strong> are search queries that you've already experienced success with while running automatic targeted sponsored product campaigns.</p> <p>Sponsored Brand Campaigns also lets you feature up to three unique products in your ads, customize your ads' image, headline, and landing page, and even tests these elements.</p> <p>Below is an image from Amazon that details the keywords that you can use for your sponsored brand campaigns:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/amazon-keywords.png?width=582&amp;name=amazon-keywords.png\" alt=\"Amazon details the various types of keywords.\" width=\"582\" style=\"width: 582px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com\">Image Source</a></em></p> <p>To determine how much you pay for Sponsored Brand Campaigns, Amazon uses a pay-per-click, auction-based pricing model, so you'll never pay more than you bid per click. In addition to manual bidding, you can choose automated bidding, which will optimize your ads for conversion.</p> <p>If you want to know how well your advertisements are performing, Sponsored Brand Campaigns offers a reporting feature that displays your ads' clicks, spend, sales, estimated win rate for keywords, and ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales).</p> <p>Below, <a href=\"https://www.shirtinvaders.com/\">Shirt Invaders</a> promotes three of their T-shirts. Clicking on each of the shirts goes specifically to the product page. However, clicking on the \"Shop Now\" button below the copy takes you to its Amazon Store:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/headline-search-ads-amazon.jpg?width=600&amp;name=headline-search-ads-amazon.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Shirt Invaders Amazon headline search ads above the search results.\"><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Image Source</a></em></img></p> <h3>Sponsored Brand Campaigns&nbsp;Best Practices</h3> <h4>Ad Creative</h4> <p>It's a good idea to feature three top-performing products in your Sponsored Brands Campaign to increase the amount of clicks and sales your ads generate.</p> <p>Amazon also recommends including your product's top benefit in your ad's headline because mobile shoppers can only see the ad's main image and headline.</p> <p>Additionally, when describing your product, try not to claim your product is \"#1\" or a \"Best Seller\" -- your ad won't get approved.</p> <h4>Testing</h4> <p>To run the most accurate and fruitful tests, consider only changing one variable at a time, run them for at least two weeks, and anchor the success of your tests to business goals.</p> <h4>Landing Page Design</h4> <p>With Sponsored Brands, you can direct shoppers to your Amazon store or a customized product page. Consider testing how different product pages convert visitors into customers, as well as the order in which your products appear.</p> <a></a> <h2><strong>Amazon Product Display Ads</strong></h2> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/amazon-Product-Display-Ads.webp\" alt=\"amazon-Product-Display-Ads\" style=\"display: none !important;\" /></em></strong></p> <p>Product display ads are pay-per-click ads that appear on product detail pages, customer review pages, on top of the offer listing page, and below search results.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can also place these ads on abandoned cart emails, follow-up emails, and recommendations emails. Their main objective is to cross-sell or upsell your customers.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sponsored%20products%20related%20to%20razors%20on%20amazon.png?width=2396&amp;name=sponsored%20products%20related%20to%20razors%20on%20amazon.png\" alt=\"sponsored products related to razors on amazon\" width=\"2396\" style=\"width: 2396px;\" /></p> <p>Using product display ads, you can use two types of campaign targeting: product and interest. <strong>Product targeting</strong> is a contextual form of targeting, so you can target specific products and related categories. <strong>Interest targeting</strong> is a behavioral form of targeting, so you can target shopper interest and reach a larger audience.</p> <p>Product display ads also let you choose which in-category detail pages you want to advertise on, customize your creative, and offers a reporting tool that displays your campaigns' clicks, spend, sales, advertising cost of sales (ACoS), detail page views, spend, units sold, total sales, and average cost-per-click (ACPC).</p> <h3>Amazon Product Display Ads Best Practices</h3> <h4>Targeting</h4> <p>Use product targeting on competitor pages, complementary product detail pages, and your own product detail pages to cross-sell and upsell similar products. Using product targeting on related categories also extends your reach to sections of Amazon's catalogue that are related to your products.</p> <h4>Ad Creative</h4> <p>When crafting your headlines, Amazon allows you to include phrases like \"Exclusive\", \"New\", \"Buy Now\", and \"Save Now\", but making claims like \"#1\" or \"Beat Seller\" will get your ad rejected.</p> <a></a> <h2><strong>Amazon Native Ads</strong></h2> <p>Amazon Native Ads are ads that you can place on your brand's own website. There are three types of native ads: recommendation ads, search ads, and custom ads.</p> <p><strong>Recommendation ads</strong> are ads you can place in product article pages on your website. These ads are dynamic, so Amazon will populate your most relevant product recommendation based on your web page's content and visitors.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-13%20at%202.28.30%20PM.png?width=778&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-13%20at%202.28.30%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-13 at 2.28.30 PM\" width=\"778\" style=\"width: 778px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/ads/ref=amb_link_9BrQiYIcOTC6v2zRDxnBQA_1?pf_rd_p=39487255-fae5-4cf5-8219-4e0f53516f8d\">Image Source</a></span></img></p> <p><strong>Search ads</strong> are ads that populate on your website based off keywords that your customers search for on Amazon or on your website.</p> \n <div> \n  <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(3)-8.png?width=600&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(3)-8.png\" alt=\"Search ads on Amazon.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n </div> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/ads/ref=amb_link_9BrQiYIcOTC6v2zRDxnBQA_1?pf_rd_p=39487255-fae5-4cf5-8219-4e0f53516f8d\">Image Source</a></em></p> <p><strong>Custom ads</strong> allow you to select your own assortment of products you'd like to promote and place them on your product article posts.</p> <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200-27.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Custom ads on Amazon feature men's running shoes.\"> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/ads/ref=amb_link_9BrQiYIcOTC6v2zRDxnBQA_1?pf_rd_p=39487255-fae5-4cf5-8219-4e0f53516f8d\">Image Source</a></em></p> <h3>Amazon Native Ads Best Practice</h3> <p>Just like a call-to-action on a blog post, make sure your native shopping ads are extremely relevant to the pages you place them on. This way, when your website visitors finish reading your post, the ads are a natural next step and can lead to more conversions.</p> <a></a> <h2><strong>Amazon Video Ads</strong></h2> <p>Amazon Video Ads are ads that you can place on Amazon-owned sites like Amazon.com and IMDb, Amazon devices like Fire TV, and various properties across the web. You can buy Amazon video ads regardless of whether you sell products on Amazon or not, and you can set your ad's landing page as an Amazon product page, your own website, or any other web page on the internet.</p> <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(4)-7.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"example of peloton video ad on amazon\"> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/products/video-ads\">Image Source</a></em></p> <p>If you want to work with Amazon's video ad consultants, you can sign up for their managed-service option, but to be eligible, you usually need to spend a minimum of $35,000 on video ads.</p> <a></a> <h2><strong>Amazon Stores</strong></h2> <p>Users can promote their brand or product on your own multi-page <a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/products/stores?ref=a20m_blog_fs_drivetrffcstore_052819\">Amazon Store</a>. Using Amazon's templates or drag-and-drop tiles, you can showcase your brand's products or portfolio of work.</p> <p>With Amazon Stores, brands get an Amazon URL and can view traffic analytics, which enables them to keep track of sales, traffic sources, and ad campaigns.</p> <p>Additionally, creating an Amazon Store is free.</p> <h3>Amazon Stores Best Practices</h3> <p>Once you create an Amazon Store, you can use the analytics tool to find the top performing keywords which have converted to sales. Additionally, the analytics tool will let you know which products sell.</p> <p>This lets you know which products you might want to consider for a paid ad campaign. Plus, it also shows what potential buyers are interested in.</p> <p>Below is an example of an Amazon Store:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/amazon-stores.jpg?width=600&amp;name=amazon-stores.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Kitchen Smart Amazon Store featuring their best products.\"><a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/products/stores?ref=a20m_blog_fs_drivetrffcstore_052819\"></a></img></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><em><a href=\"https://advertising.amazon.com/products/stores?ref=a20m_blog_fs_drivetrffcstore_052819\">Image Source</a></em></p> <p>When you create an Amazon Store, the best practices are similar to best practices of any landing page — use clear photos, easy-to-read captions, and clear pricing. Additionally, make sure you showcase your highest performing products. Or you could opt to introduce new products on your Store as well.</p> <p>Before you craft your Store, come up with the products you want to feature on your navigation. Then, list all your products that you will showcase on those pages. Lastly, gather the clear, professional photos of your product, write your captions, and list your prices.</p> <p>Ultimately, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-sell-on-amazon\">selling on Amazon</a> can be an impactful marketing strategy for ecommerce brands. As consumers continue to lean into online shopping, Amazon advertising can play a large role in your online sales.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in February 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> <p></p> <p></p> <img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Famazon-advertising&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important;

background-color: transparent;\">It's no question social media is an important part of most college students' lives. </span></p> \n<p>And Instagram is an undeniably important one for teens and young adults — in fact, <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/\">72% of teens use Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/\">67% of U.S. adults ages 18-29</a> use the social platform.</p> \n<p>Plenty of universities and colleges have taken note of Instagram's popularity, and now use the social platform as an opportunity to appeal to current students, alumni, and high school prospects alike.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After all, when it comes to choosing which social platforms to spend time and resources on, it's a best practice to go where your target audience goes.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-for-business\">Download the complete guide to using Instagram for business and marketing here.</a></h3> \n<p>We were excited to see many universities and colleges posting awesome Instagram content — <span>shots of campus buildings, live-action photos of sports games, colorful graphics promoting school-sponsored campaigns — </span>on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>While there were many colleges and universities doing well on Instagram, here are 17 of the best ones we saw to inspire your own brand's Instagram content. (And if you're feeling especially motivated, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile\">read this blog post for a list of the 11 best photo and video editing apps for mobile</a>.)</p> \n<h2><strong>17 of the Best College Instagram Accounts</strong></h2> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/coloradostateuniversity/\">Colorado State University</a></h3> \n<p><span><span>When it comes to posting a diversity of Instagram content, Colorado State University covered it all — and everything came out beautifully. We had a hard time choosing from the multitude of adorable pictures of their mascot CAM the Ram, which included playful captions such as \"Our mascot is cuter than your mascot.\" </span></span></p> \n<p><span><span>They also did a great job with campaign graphics, like the one below on ending hazing.<br></span></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/colorado-state-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=colorado-state-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"colorado state university instagram posts\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/colorado-state-instagram-4.png?width=523&amp;name=colorado-state-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 523px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"523\" alt=\"colorado state university instagram posts\"></span></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/dartmouthcollege/\">Dartmouth College</a></h3> \n<p>Located in scenic Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth's campus has a lot to work with — and their social media team doesn't sell it short. Their Instagram account is chock full of breathtaking, high-definition pictures of their campus in every season and at every time of day. We love the drone shots they used to show their campus from a new perspective.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dartmouth-instagram-4.png?width=523&amp;name=dartmouth-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 523px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"523\" alt=\"dartmouth college instagram post\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dartmouth-instagram-2.png?width=523&amp;name=dartmouth-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 523px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"523\" alt=\"dartmouth college instagram post\"></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/libertyuniversity/\">Liberty University</a></h3> \n<p>Liberty University's Instagram is a great mix of beautiful campus shots and photos of students, staff, guest speakers, and other members of the Liberty community. When it comes to posting photos of people, they don't rely on generic group pictures of people hanging out around campus.</p> \n<p>Instead, they post photos of people that appeal to followers who don't know the person or people in the photo, like the one with the championship ring below that can ignite school spirit in any student or alum. Check out how they brand each photo with their logo for anyone who might regram.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/liberty-university-instagram-1.png?width=514&amp;name=liberty-university-instagram-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"liberty university instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/liberty-university-instagram-4.png?width=514&amp;name=liberty-university-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"liberty university instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/cambridgeuniversity/\">University of Cambridge</a></h3> \n<p>University of Cambridge in England has mastered <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile\">the art of photo editing</a>. Most of their Instagram photos are landscape photos of areas around their campus, but check out how they've edited them to intensify the colors and bring out the details in each photo.</p> \n<p>We also love how they frame their photos, like the building through the archway and the quad through the window below. You might see certain buildings or areas every day, but when you're taking photos, think about the unique and interesting ways you can photograph them.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cambridge-instagram-4.png?width=514&amp;name=cambridge-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"university of cambridge instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cambridge-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=cambridge-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"university of cambridge instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/arizonastateuniversity/\">Arizona State University</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Arizona State University lets its school pride shine through its Instagram account, which features a lot of content related to their sports teams. They do a great job of creating cool graphics for game day announcements, and we love that they include all the relevant information both as text in the graphic <em>and </em>in the caption. That way, anyone who wants to re-gram doesn't have to copy the caption, too.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/arizona-state-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=arizona-state-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"arizona state instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/arizona-state-instagram-1.png?width=514&amp;name=arizona-state-instagram-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"arizona state instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/uai_cl/\">Adolfo Ibáñez University</a></h3> \n<p>Adolfo Ibáñez University is located just beside the beautiful Andes Mountains in Chile, giving them a lot of great scenery to work with for campus and city shots. They do a great job of capturing the closeness of the mountains to the school in photos like the 'regram in the one below.</p> \n<p>We love how the social media team there credits 'regrams not only in the caption, but also in the photo itself using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-regram-for-instagram/id797818385?mt=8\">the Repost &amp; Regram App</a>. They also use their Instagram account to highlight cool student projects, like the bicycle below that won some of their students a top entrepreneurial prize. They could've chosen to post a photo of the bike in the lab or on display, but instead, they chose to post a particularly cool photo of it outside and at night, probably borrowed from the students themselves.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adolfo-ibanez-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=adolfo-ibanez-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"Adolfo Ibáñez University instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adolfo-ibanez-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=adolfo-ibanez-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"Adolfo Ibáñez University instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/westvirginiau/\">West Virginia University</a></h3> \n<p>Here's another example of a college Instagram account that publishes cool, new perspectives of their campus. We love the theme of their logo in front of a blurred background, like the keychain below. Alongside gorgeous, high-definition photos of all different parts of campus and student life, they have a few epic shots sprinkled in — like the one on the bottom right of a student who climbed a mountain with a WVU flag. #casual.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/west-virginia-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=west-virginia-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"west virginia instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/west-virginia-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=west-virginia-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"west virginia instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/theuniversityofsheffield/\">The University of Sheffield</a></h3> \n<p><span><span>The University of Sheffield's photos boast a high level of sophistication we should all aspire to achieve. In addition to playing with perspective and color, they also play with angles and lines in a lot of their photos. </span></span></p> \n<p><span><span>For instance, the photo at the top is a cool bird's eye view of students studying for exams, and it features a lot of lines and rectangles of different shapes and sizes. We were also big fans of the colorful graphics they post, like the \"Good Luck\" graphic on the bottom left.</span></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-sheffield-instagram-1.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-sheffield-instagram-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"University of Sheffield instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-sheffield-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-sheffield-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"University of Sheffield instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/aub_lebanon/\">American University of Beirut</a></h3> \n<p>AUB does a lot of things well on Instagram, but what we liked in particular was what they've been doing with their 150th birthday celebration for the school. To celebrate its history, they've interspersed more typical posts with old photos taken in black-and-white, which they've marked with \"AUB/LIBRARY ARCHIVES\" right on the photo to indicate that it was taken from their archives.</p> \n<p>In the captions of each of these photos, they encourage students to send a modern version of the exact same photo by posting it with the hashtag #myaubstory or sending it to a specific email address they set up for the campaign. In addition to this cool campaign, they periodically post beautiful graphics to wish students well for the holidays, like the graphic below for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.01.23%20PM.png?width=514&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.01.23%20PM.png\" alt=\"AUB instagram posts\" width=\"514\" style=\"width: 514px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/aub-instagram-1-1.png?width=514&amp;name=aub-instagram-1-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"American University of Beirut instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/uniofnottingham/?hl=en\">University of Nottingham</a></h3> \n<p><span><span>Go to University of Nottingham's Instagram account and you'll scroll through an impressive display of beautiful campus photos. We love the creativity and variety in these shots: Note how they play with light, shadows, and color so that no two shots of the same building look too similar. </span></span></p> \n<p><span><span>We also love how they post photos that highlight their school's and city's histories. For example, the photo of the inn below is accompanied by a bit of trivia in the caption: \"Did you know that Nottingham is home to the oldest pub in England?\"<br></span></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-nottingham-instagram-4.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-nottingham-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"University of Nottingham's instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-nottingham-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-nottingham-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"University of Nottingham's instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/urochester/\">University of Rochester</a></h3> \n<p>The University of Rochester lets its personality shine through its Instagram photos. The photo of the empty campus square at bottom left, which \"quotes\" the square, was part of a three-part photo series during the school's winter break that showed how much the school was missing all its students. The folks here also have an ongoing mascot photo campaign, where they have students snap pictures with their mascot all over the country, which they then share with the whole community.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.03.04%20PM.png?width=514&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.03.04%20PM.png\" alt=\"university of rochester instagram posts\" width=\"514\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-rochester-instagram-4.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-rochester-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"University of rochester's instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/texastech/\">Texas Tech University</a></h3> \n<p>Texas Tech does a lot of really great stuff with their Instagram account, but what really makes them stand out is their videos and their seasonal content. They post a lot of short, simple videos that inspire a lot of Likes — from their football team running onto the field before a game to the Texas Tech NASCAR racing on the track. Their seasonal content is top-notch too. Check out the playful, Texas Tech-themed pumpkins carved for Halloween, below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/texas-tech-football-flag.png?width=514&amp;name=texas-tech-football-flag.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"texas tech instagram posts\" title=\"texas-tech-football-flag.png\" width=\"514\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/texas-tech-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=texas-tech-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"texas tech instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/unsw/\">University of New South Wales</a></h3> \n<p>UNSW does a great job mixing beautifully framed, artistic photos and more real-time ones, like the photo of their rugby team below that they regrammed from @unigames.</p> \n<p>They also do a great job creating informative graphics, like the simple one below accompanied by the caption, \"5 days until UNSW Open Day! Tag your Open Day photos with <a href=\"https://instagram.com/explore/tags/unswopenday/\">#unswopenday</a> <span>and we'll print them for you at our Open Day photo booth!\" This is a perfect campaign for college kids, who love to put photos up on their dorm room walls. (Want to create a graphic using icons, like UNSW did in the one below? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-icon-download-design-list\">Check out our list of 135 royalty-free icons here</a>.)</span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.04.42%20PM.png?width=514&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-10-26%20at%202.04.42%20PM.png\" width=\"514\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"university of new south wales instagram posts\"></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"s1\"> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unsw-instagram-2-1.png?width=514&amp;name=unsw-instagram-2-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"university of new south wales instagram posts\"></span><span class=\"s1\"></span></p> \n<h3>14. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/bostonu/\">Boston University</a></h3> \n<p>Boston University does a great job of adding humor to their plethora of high-end photos of campus and student life. We love photos like the \"Hire Me\" graduation photo below, which is worthy of a 'regram regardless of whether or not you know the graduates in the photo. We also love that they promote the best content from #AwkwardBU Twitter campaign on Instagram alongside relevant photos.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/boston-university-instagram-4.png?width=514&amp;name=boston-university-instagram-4.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"boston university instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/boston-university-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=boston-university-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"boston university instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">15. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/unibarcelona/\">University of Barcelona</a></h3> \n<p>The buildings at the University of Barcelona are gorgeous, both inside and out, and Instagram is the perfect platform for their social media team to showcase all that great design and architecture.</p> \n<p>These folks create fun, lighthearted graphics to promote some of their events, like they did with the \"Vespres UB\" event below. Notice, too, how some of their photos are branded with the \"Universitat de Barcelona\" logo — a nice touch for anything that might be regrammed.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-barcelona-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-barcelona-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"university of barcelona instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/university-of-barcelona-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=university-of-barcelona-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"university of barcelona instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">16. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/georgetownuniversity/\">Georgetown University</a></h3> \n<p>While Georgetown's Instagram account includes plenty of high-definition photos, we love that a lot of their photos have the look and feel of well-framed photos taken from an iPhone. This could be because they, like many other colleges on this list, post a lot of photos submitted to them by members of their community.</p> \n<p>We also love that they post in real time and in a chronological manner, making their feed read kind of like a photo journal of a specific time. The #HomeSweetHilltop collage below, posted over Homecoming Weekend, is a great example of a timely photo. Another example is a photo of the Pope in Georgetown during his visit.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/georgetown-instagram-home-sweet-hilltop.png?width=514&amp;name=georgetown-instagram-home-sweet-hilltop.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"georgetown university instagram posts\" title=\"georgetown-instagram-home-sweet-hilltop.png\" width=\"514\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/georgetown-instagram-3.png?width=514&amp;name=georgetown-instagram-3.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"georgetown university instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3>17. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/pennstate/\">Penn State University</a></h3> \n<p>Alongside beautiful, high-end photos of campus and student life (are you seeing a theme here?), one of our favorite themes in Penn State's Instagram photos are their \"love stories.\" These are photos of couples that met at Penn State, whether it's one alum proposing to another (as in the photo at bottom) or kissing at graduation after starting to date during freshman orientation. These photos are accompanied by each couple's brief backstory, and always inspire a lot of well-deserved Likes and \"aww\"'s.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/penn-state-instagram-1.png?width=514&amp;name=penn-state-instagram-1.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"penn state instagram posts\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/penn-state-instagram-2.png?width=514&amp;name=penn-state-instagram-2.png\" style=\"width: 514px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"514\" alt=\"penn state instagram posts\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">18. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/ouranu/\">Australia National University</a></h3> \n<p>Australia National University nails the whole \"breathtaking landscape photo\" thing. Every single time. Their Instagram feed is an inspiring collection of photos of campus, student performances, and even detailed, up-close photos of animals found in the area. The common theme? Beautiful uses of light and shadow and reflections, as you can see in the photos below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\"

Video]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-video-script-ht","description":"<p>Movie producers and inbound marketers aren't that different when it comes to creating and editing video content.</p> \n<p>We're both telling a story, and whether that story is about a protagonist or a product, we're both trying to captive our audiences and make them believe in the story we tell.</p> \n<p>What happens at the end of the story is a little different, though.</p> \n<p>Most marketers wear a lot of hats and let's just say, out of all the hats worn, the videographer one isn't always their favorite. That's because creating videos can be intimidating, especially if you're new to it.</p> \n<p>And if you're more of a copywriter than a videographer, as I am, you might overlook how important the planning stage of video production is -- the part where you really solidify your video concept, goals, and script.</p> \n<p>That's what we're going to tackle in this blog post: how to write an effective video script to ensure the best possible product emerges from your editing software, and lives wherever you're publishing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Start with a brief.</h3> \n<p>Although this step might seem trivial, it's extremely necessary to the final script.</p> \n<p>Starting with a brief allows you and your team to document the answers to the most important project questions so everyone involved in creating the video can get on the same page. When you're three-quarters of the way through the editing process, and your boss or colleague wants to completely redo that whole shot where you demonstrate how your product solves a problem, <em>that's</em>a huge problem -- for you.</p> \n<p>When pesky predicaments like this one stand in the way of progress, you can just refer back to the brief that documents the goals and project plan your team mapped out together, and say, \"Actually, that's not what we agreed to.\"</p> \n<p>Then, you can move forward.</p> \n<h4 style=\"display: block;\">Focus on your goals, topic, and takeaways when developing your brief.</h4> \n<p style=\"display: block;\">A brief doesn't have to be fancy, nor does it have to follow a specific formula, but there are several key questions it should include to craft an effective video script.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"display: block;\">What's the <strong>goal</strong> of this video? Why are we making the video in the first place?</li> \n <li>Who is the <strong>audience</strong> of this video?</li> \n <li>What's our video <strong>topic</strong>? (The more specific, the better. For example, if you're in the house painting business, you might choose a topic like, \"buying the right paint brush\").</li> \n <li>What are the <strong>key takeaways</strong> of the video? What should viewers learn from watching it?</li> \n <li>What's our call-to-action? What do we want viewers to do after they've finished watching the video?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can easily create a brief in Google Docs to serve as a living, breathing template that you revise over time -- and that your team can collaborate on.</p> \n<h3>2. Use your brief to write an outline.</h3> \n<p>Once you've picked a topic and written a brief, it's time to start constructing your video script. We recommend starting with an outline before diving into the full script -- this way, you can break your video into subtopics and determine how your dialogue (or monologue) will progress.</p> \n<p>Contrary to what I previously thought, you can't just rewrite a blog post and call it a day -- there's a specific way to write a script so that it shapes an effective video. Are you basing your video script on a blog post? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciacollins/\">Alicia Collins</a> can teach you a bit more in the video below (and yes, we wrote a script for it!).</p>  \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zY-JlBESYs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>  \n<p>Like Alicia says in the video above, a video script shouldn't simply regurgitate the blog post word-for-word. Although blog posts are ideally written to be conversational, there are pauses and verbal explanations you need to incorporate into your speech patterns that you wouldn't have on&nbsp;paper.</p> \n<p>But, using the blog post's subsections is a helpful starting point when figuring out how your script will progress from one section to the next. If you're <em>not</em> basing your video script on a blog post, you can still create a well-structured outline. Consider the individual best practices of the subject you're planning to cover in your video. Where do the natural transitions occur when explaining this subject to your audience?</p> \n<p>For example, if the topic of your video is <em>How to Start a Business</em>, you might outline your script by the individual tasks an aspiring entrepreneur needs to tackle when launching a company, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Perform market research.</li> \n <li>Draft a budget for research and development.</li> \n <li>Meet with potential investors.</li> \n <li>Develop a marketing strategy.</li> \n <li>Develop a sales strategy.</li> \n <li>Identify your office space.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Introduce yourself and/or the topic at the beginning of your script.</h3> \n<p>Even though videos are the channel of choice for many people who want to learn something new, they need to hook their audience in the first few seconds -- just like written content. After all, you have just as much competition on YouTube as you do in the blogosphere, and your viewers can bounce from your video just as quickly as they would from an article if they don't feel engaged with it.</p> \n<p>To help hook your audience in a video script, use the very first few lines to introduce the narrator (the person on screen) and what the audience is going to learn by the end of the video.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're teaching viewers how to optimize their blog for SEO, your introduction might be:</p> \n<p><em>\"Hi there! I'm [narrator's name] from [company], and in the next [length of video] minutes, I'm gonna teach you how to get your blog ranking on Google.\"</em></p> \n<h3>4. Start writing your script, section by section.</h3> \n<p>Just like the brief, the video script doesn't have to be fancy. You're not trying to submit this script for any awards -- its purpose is strictly functional. A good script makes it easy for the people on camera to get their messages across while sounding and acting naturally.</p> \n<h4>Write conversationally.</h4> \n<p>Writing a script is not the same as writing a college paper or marketing research report. You want to write the script how you want the video subject to speak. Saying, \"I'm gonna create a video after reading this blog post\" on camera will read much better than, \"I am going to create a video after reading this blog post.\" Keep sentences short and crisp -- I recommend avoiding compound sentences, if possible.</p> \n<h4>Make it thorough.</h4> \n<p>A script doesn't just include dialogue. If your video will require multiple shots, characters, or scenes, include these details. Be sure to include any necessary information about the set or stage actions, such as a wardrobe change.</p> \n<p>Basically, you want the script to be thorough enough that you could hand it off to someone else to shoot, and they'd understand it.</p> \n<h4>Write for the audience and the platform.</h4> \n<p>Is your audience made up of young teens, middle-aged professionals, or older retirees? Will your video live on Instagram, YouTube, or your website? Make sure you're keeping it conversational for the people you're trying to connect with -- and infuse humor, tone, and inflection accordingly. Furthermore, if you're writing a short-form video for Facebook, you might want to consider keeping your script choppier with sentence fragments -- but if you're producing a long-form explainer video for your website, make sure you're as thorough as possible.</p> \n<h4>Script every <em>single</em> word.</h4> \n<p>It's understandable to think you can just jot down the main bullet points for a script, and then just wing it on camera, especially if you know your subject matter. This approach makes it tough to communicate a message as clearly and concisely as possible (which you should aim to do in every video you create), and it usually results in a lot of re-dos.</p> \n<p>So, we suggest scripting every last word. Trust me -- doing this will keep you organized during filming and save you loads of time later.</p> \n<h3>5. Support any B-roll with the proper callouts in your main narrative.</h3> \n<p>If your video will transition from a person speaking in front of a camera, to a close-up shot of your product or a demonstration, you'll want to write these cues into in your script so anyone who reads it knows to introduce these things for the viewer. These secondary shots are often referred to as B-roll, which take place while the person continues to speak off-screen. It's one of the main differences between a blog post and a video script.</p> \n<p>For example, if a blog post reads, \"take a look at the graph below,\" it's clearly referring to a graph embedded below that sentence. This phrasing won't work on camera. Instead, your video script might read, \"in the graph you see here\" -- while the graph is shown on-screen instead of the narrator.</p> \n<p>These written exceptions can also help cue the narrator to take certain unspoken actions while reciting the script. For example, take a look at how the folks over at Wistia did that in the video script for <a href=\"http://wistia.com/blog/learning-center-wistias-scripting-tips\">Wistia's scripting tips</a> below. Text overlay is called out with a big, bold \"TEXT,\" audio is called out in all caps (REWIND SOUND), and B-roll or additional details are called out in italics (with glasses on). (Note: It might help to <a href=\"http://wistia.com/blog/learning-center-wistias-scripting-tips\">watch the video</a> first for the excerpt of this script to make sense).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 616px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-371940948-png/how_to_write_a_video_script_example_keep_conversational.png?width=616&amp;name=how_to_write_a_video_script_example_keep_conversational.png\" alt=\"how_to_write_a_video_script_example_keep_conversational\" width=\"616\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://wistia.com/blog/learning-center-wistias-scripting-tips\"><em>Wistia</em></a></span></p> \n<h3>6. Be as concise as you can.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to marketing, shorter videos tend to be more compelling than longer videos. In fact, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data\">68% of people</a> said they'd rather learn about new products and services through a \"short video,\" according to a survey by Wyzowl.</p> \n<p>To make short videos, you need a short script. Don't write a script any longer than two pages. If you can keep it to one page, even better. It's also worth doing two to three rounds of edits solely focused on cutting all unnecessary fat in your writing. Reading it out loud to listen for opportunities to make the language more conversational, or sentences shorter, can also help.</p> \n<p>The result is a video that's succinct, engaging, and allows for a simple editing process.</p> \n<h3>7.

Organic traffic.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organic-search-definition-100-words\">Organic traffic</a> is one of the most important metrics to track for SEO. However, keep in mind that this shouldn't be the only metric you track. You'll track this in combination with other KPIs.</p> \n<p>Aja Frost, the head of SEO content at HubSpot, says, \"Any metric—in isolation—can be misleading. For example, HubSpot's SEO team used to obsess over organic traffic. And it seemed like our focus was paying off: Monthly organic sessions skyrocketed. However, we'd lost sight of the quality of those users... and leads and signups weren't following sessions.\"</p> \n<p>So, while you'll want to know what your organic traffic is doing and how it's trending, it's important to use the other SEO KPIs on this list in addition.</p> \n<h3>2. MRR-based metric.</h3> \n<p>Paired with your organic traffic, you should measure a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/monthly-recurring-revenue\">monthly recurring revenue</a> (MRR) based metric.</p> \n<p>So, what does that mean?</p> \n<p>According to Frost, \"I recommend SEO teams pair organic traffic with one or two MRR-based metrics (if possible). You can figure out which MRR-based metrics are the right ones by talking to leadership and/or the other team(s) you support. What numbers do they care about? How does organic traffic feed into those numbers?\"</p> \n<p>A few examples include:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\"> \n <li>Organic search</li> \n <li>Demo requests</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Or:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\"> \n <li>Organic search</li> \n <li>Purchases</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Or:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\"> \n <li>Organic search</li> \n <li>Percentage of chats that convert into customers</li> \n</ol> \n<p>For HubSpot, we track content leads and user signups in addition to organic traffic.</p> \n<p>Frost says, \"If all three of those metrics are trending in the right direction, we know we're generating the right type of traffic.\"</p> \n<h2>Paid Search KPIs</h2> \n<h3>3. Cost-per-click (CPC).</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">Cost-per-click</a> (CPC) is the amount that you'll pay for each click on your ad. You set your CPC at the maximum price you are willing to pay per click on your ad. What you actually pay is determined by the following formula: (Competitor's Ad Rank / Your Quality Score) + 0.01 = Actual CPC.</p> \n<p>Victor Pan, a principal marketer and technical SEO at HubSpot, says, \"When you're just starting to grow organic traffic and you just don't have the full picture on what the return on investment will be, the average cost per click is a great KPI to use as a temporary replacement for average organic traffic value. For example, if there's an average of 2400 searches for X/year and the average CPC is $20, then you can make projections on the advertising value gained from capturing 5%, 10%, or 20% of that traffic in a year to be $120, $240, or $480 per year respectively.\"</p> \n<p>He adds, \"Average CPC is a KPI that can also be used to capture content strategy gaps. There are a lot of high purchase intent keywords where the ROAS (return on ad spend) in pay per click ads does not make business sense. These are golden opportunities to consider longer-term organic search tactics to win as a part of your overall content marketing strategy to become a trusted authority on a particular topic.\"</p> \n<p>Laura Mittelmann, a marketing manager on the paid acquisition team at HubSpot, says, \"CPC tells me how much on average I'm paying for a click. This is important when setting bids and working within the constraints of a set budget, and can also help me decide which keywords and match types to bid on.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Clickthrough rate (CTR).</h3> \n<p>Clickthrough rate reveals how often people who view your ad end up actually clicking it.</p> \n<p>Mittelmann says, \"There are many helpful paid search KPIs to watch depends on the goal of the campaign. CTR helps me to understand how effective and relevant my ad copy is, and if it matches the intent of the user searching for my keywords.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Cost per acquisition (CPA).</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cost-per-acquisition\">Cost per acquisition</a> is a great metric that can help you track how much you're spending for each acquisition.</p> \n<p>Mittelmann remarks, \"CPA is typically the KPI I use most to optimize on a daily basis. CPA factors in other metrics and ultimately tells me how much I paid for a conversion.\"</p> \n<h3>6. Return on ad spend (ROAS).</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend\">Return on ad spend</a> is a metric that measures the revenue that's generated compared to every dollar of an advertising campaign. For example, let's say you made $10 for every $1 spent on an advertising campaign. That means your ROAS for that campaign is 10:1.</p> \n<p>Mittelmann says, \"While there are many KPIs to track and use for paid search optimizations, at the end of the day I measure the success of a campaign based on its return on ad spend. It's important for me to know that the value of the conversions the campaign is generating outweighs the cost of the campaign.\"</p> \n<p>It's important to keep in mind that any metric in isolation can be misleading. It's critical to track several SEO KPIs to truly measure success.

You might be picturing Harvard students from the movie, <em>The Social Network</em>, sitting at their computers with gigantic headphones on and hammering out code, and think to yourself, 'I could never do that.'</p> \n<p>Actually, you can.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can learn a new language. In fact, programming is kind of like speaking a foreign language -- which is exactly why they're called programming <em>languages</em><em>.</em> Each one has its own rules and syntax that need to be learned step by step. Those rules are ways to tell your computer what to do. More specifically, in web programming, they're ways of telling your <em>browsers</em> what to do.</p> \n<p>The goal of this post is to, in plain English, teach you with the basics of HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages, JavaScript. But before we begin, let's get an idea of what programming languages actually are.</p> \n<h2>What Is a Programming Language?</h2> \n<p>Programming, or coding, is like solving a puzzle. Consider a human language, like English or French. We use these languages to turn thoughts and ideas into actions and behavior. In programming, the goal of the puzzle is exactly the same -- you're just driving different kinds of behavior, and the source of that behavior isn't a human. It's a computer.</p> \n<p>A<strong> programming language</strong> is our way of communicating with software. The people who use programming languages are often called programmers or developers. The things we tell software using a programming language could be to make a webpage look a certain way, or to make an object on the page move if the human user takes a certain action.</p> \n<h3>Programming in Web Development</h3> \n<p>So, when a web designer is given an end goal like \"create a webpage that has this header, this font, these colors, these pictures, and an animated unicorn walking across the screen when users click on this button,\" the web designer's job is to take that big idea and break it apart into tiny pieces, and then translate these pieces into instructions that the computer can understand -- including putting all these instructions in the correct order or syntax.</p> \n<p>Every page on the web that you visit is built using a sequence of separate instructions, one after another. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and so on) is a big actor in translating code into something we can see on our screens and even interact with. It can be easy to forget that code without a browser is just a text file -- it's when you put that text file into a <em>browser</em> that the magic happens. When you open a web page, your browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.</p> \n<p>HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're just page structure and style information. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and application.</p> \n<p>In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language available on the web. Web developers had to painstakingly code static sites, page by page. A lot's changed since then: Now there are many computer programming languages available.</p> \n<p>In this post, I'll talk about HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages: JavaScript.</p> \n<h2>HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript: A Tutorial</h2> \n<p>An overview:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>HTML </strong>provides the <em>basic structure</em> of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</li> \n <li><strong>CSS</strong> is used to control <em>presentation, formatting, and layout</em>.</li> \n <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to control the <em>behavior</em> of different elements.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let's go over each one individually to help you understand the roles each plays on a website and then we'll cover how they fit together. Let's start with good ol' HTML.</p> \n<h3>HTML</h3> \n<p>HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How does HTML work?</h2> \n <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. \"Markup language\" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Let me show you what I mean. Take a look at the article below. If I were to ask you to label the types of content on the page, you'd probably do pretty well: There's the header at the top, then a subheader below it, the body text, and some images at the bottom followed by a few more bits of text.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 475px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1765453003-jpg/magazine-page-example.jpg?width=475&amp;name=magazine-page-example.jpg\" alt=\"magazine-page-example\" width=\"475\"></p> \n<p>Markup languages work in the same way as <em>you </em>just did when you labeled those content types, except they use code to do it -- specifically, they use HTML tags, also known as \"elements.\" These tags have pretty intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on.</p> \n<p>Every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content on the page. Each type of content on the page is \"wrapped\" in, i.e. surrounded by, HTML tags.</p> \n<p>For example, the words you're reading right now are part of a paragraph. If I were coding this web page from scratch (instead of using the WYSIWG editor in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/content-optimization-system\">HubSpot's CMS</a>), I would have started this paragraph with an <em>opening</em> paragraph tag: &lt;p&gt;. The \"tag\" part is denoted by open brackets, and the letter \"p\" tells the computer that we're opening a paragraph instead of some other type of content.</p> \n<p>Once a tag has been opened, all of the content that follows is assumed to be part of that tag until you \"close\" the tag. When the paragraph ends, I'd put a closing paragraph tag: &lt;/p&gt;. Notice that closing tags look exactly the same as opening tags, except there is a forward slash after the left angle bracket. Here's an example:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier;\">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p> \n<p>Using HTML, you can add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.</p> \n<p>To learn more about coding in HTML, I recommend <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/html-hacks-for-marketers\">checking out our guide to basic HTML</a>, and using the free classes and resources on <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development\">codecademy</a> -- but for now, let's move on to CSS.</p> \n<h3>CSS</h3> \n<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>HTML vs CSS</h2> \n <p>HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.</p> \n</div> \n<p>If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.</p> \n<p>Whereas HTML was the basic <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/website-optimization?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=website_optimization\">structure of your website</a>, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.</p> \n<p>To show you what CSS does to a website, look at the following two screenshots. The first screenshot is my colleague's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23454/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Mastering-LinkedIn.aspx\">blog post</a>, but shown in Basic HTML, and the second screenshot is that same blog post with HTML <em>and </em>CSS.</p> \n<h4>Example of HTML (with no CSS)</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1806258563-png/Basic-HTML-1.png\" alt=\"Example of HTML with no CSS resulting in an unformatted HubSpot blog post\"></p> \n<p>Notice all the content is still there, but the visual styling isn't. This is what you might see if the style sheet doesn't load on the website, for whatever reason. Now, here's what the same web page looks like with CSS added.</p> \n<h4>Example of HTML + CSS</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1806981694-png/CSS-1.png\" alt=\"Example of HTML + CSS used to format a HubSpot blog post\"></strong></p> \n<p>Isn't that prettier?</p> \n<p>Put simply, CSS is a list of rules that can assign different properties to HTML tags, either specified to single tags, multiple tags, an entire document, or multiple documents. It exists because, as design elements like fonts and colors were developed, web designers had a lot of trouble adapting HTML to these new features.</p> \n<p>You see, HTML, developed back in 1990, was not really intended to show any physical formatting information. It was originally meant only to define a document's structural content, like headers versus paragraphs. HTML outgrew these new design features, and CSS was invented and released in 1996: All formatting could be removed from HTML documents and stored in separate CSS (.css) files.</p> \n<p>So, what exactly does CSS stand for? It stands for Cascading Style Sheets -- and \"style sheet\" refers to the document itself. Ever web browser has a default style sheet, so every web page out there is affected by at least one style sheet -- the default style sheet of whatever browser the web page visitor is using -- regardless whether or not the web designer applies any styles. For example, my browser's default font style is Times New Roman, size 12, so if I visited a web page where the designer didn't apply a style sheet of their own, I would see the web page in Times New Roman, size 12.</p> \n<p>Obviously, the vast majority of web pages I visit don't use Times New Roman, size 12 -- that's because the web designers behind those pages started out with a default style sheet that had a default font style, and then they overrode my browser's defaults with custom CSS. That's where the word \"cascading\" comes into play. Think about a waterfall -- as water cascades down the fall, it hits all the rocks on the way down, but only the rocks at the bottom affect where it will end up flowing. In the same way, the last defined style sheet informs my browser which instructions have precedence.</p> \n<p>To learn the specifics of coding in CSS, I'll point you again to the free classes and resources on <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development\">codecademy</a>. But for now, let's talk a bit about JavaScript.</p> \n<h3>JavaScript</h3> \n<p>JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What is JavaScript used for?</h2> \n <p>JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information.</p> \n</div> \n<p>In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.</p> \n<h4>Creating Confirmation Boxes</h4> \n<p>One example of JavaScript in action is boxes that pop up on your screen. Think about the last time you entered your information into an online form and a confirmation box popped up, asking you to press \"OK\" or \"Cancel\" to proceed. That was made possible because of JavaScript -- in the code, you'd find an \"if ... else ...\" statement that tells the computer to do one thing if the user clicks \"OK,\" and a different thing if the user clicks \"Cancel.\"</p> \n<h4>Triggering Slide-In CTAs</h4> \n<p>Another example of JavaScript in action is a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-a-slide-in-call-to-action-to-your-blog-posts\">slide-in call-to-action (CTA)</a>, like the ones we put on our blog posts, which appears on the bottom right-hand side of your screen when you scroll past the end of the sidebar. Here's what it looks like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1807844259-gif/JavaScript-SlideIn.gif\" alt=\"Slide-in CTA using JavaScript to appear in a HubSpot blog post\"></p> \n<h4>Storing New Information</h4> \n<p>JavaScript is particularly useful for assigning new identities to existing website elements, according to the decisions the user makes while visiting the page. For example, let's say you're building a landing page with a form you'd like to generates leads from by capturing information about a website visitor. You might have a \"string\" of JavaScript dedicated to the user's first name. That string might look something like this:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier;\">function updateFirstname() {</span></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier;\">let Firstname = prompt('First Name'); </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier;\">}</span></p> \n<p>Then, after the website visitor enters his or her first name -- and any other information you require on the landing page -- and submits the form, this action updates the identity of the initially undefined \"Firstname\" element in your code. Here's how you might thank your website visitor by name in JavaScript:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier;\">para.textContent = 'Thanks, ' + Firstname + \"! You can now download your ebook.\"</span></p> \n<p>In the string of JavaScript above, the \"Firstname\" element has been assigned the first name of the website visitor, and will therefore produce his or her actual first name on the frontend of the webpage. To a user named Kevin, the sentence would look like this:</p> \n<p><em>Thanks, Kevin! You can now download your ebook.</em></p> \n<h4><i>Security, Games, and Special Effects</i></h4> \n<p>Other uses for JavaScript include security password creation, check forms, interactive games, animations, and special effects. It's also used to build mobile apps and create server-based applications. You can add JavaScript to an HTML document by adding these \"scripts,\" or snippets of JavaScript code, into your document's header or body.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn more about JavaScript, <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript\">codecademy has free online courses</a> you can take, too.</p> \n<p>The hardest part of coding is getting started -- but once you learn the basics, it'll be easier to learn more advanced programming languages. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, head over to <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"http://hackertyper.net/\">hackertyper.net</a> and hit random keys on your keyboard.</p> \n<p>Trust me, you'll feel better.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<div></div> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fweb-design-html-css-javascript&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0efe9dbf2e54fc9192974fb56c703fe3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1765453003-jpg/magazine-page-example.jpg?width=475&name=magazine-page-example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn93@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-14-421_53ba401238891ba7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1806258563-png/Basic-HTML-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn71@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-51-135_e79b547a38a60c58.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1806981694-png/CSS-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-54-09-208_799365adad238ae7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1807844259-gif/JavaScript-SlideIn.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-05-429_ae18297adf687468.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fweb-design-html-css-javascript&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn66@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-05-712_28a2ab21df9bcfc4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624912},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"15 Excel Formulas, Keyboard Shortcuts & Tricks That'll Save You Lots of Time","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts","description":"<p>For most marketers, trying to organize and analyze spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel can feel like walking into a brick wall over and over again. You're manually replicating columns and scribbling down long-form math on a scrap of paper, all while thinking to yourself, \"There <em>has</em> to be a better way to do this.\"</p> \n<p>Truth be told, there is -- you just don't know it yet.</p> \n<p>Excel can be tricky that way. On the one hand, it's an exceptionally powerful tool for reporting and analyzing marketing data. On the other, without the proper training, it's easy to feel like it's working against you. For starters, there are more than a dozen critical formulas Excel can automatically run for you so you're not combing through hundreds of cells with a calculator on your desk.</p> \n<h2>What are Excel Formulas?</h2> \n<p>Excel formulas help you identify relationships between values in the cells of your spreadsheet, perform mathematical calculations using those values, and return the resulting value&nbsp;in the cell of your choice. Formulas you can automatically perform include sum, subtraction, percentage, division, average, and even dates/times.</p> \n<p>We'll go over all of these, and many more, in this blog post.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How to Insert Formulas in Excel</h2> \n<p>You might wonder what the \"Formulas\" tab on the top navigation toolbar in Excel means. In more recent versions of Excel, this horizontal menu -- shown below -- allows you to find and insert Excel formulas into specific cells of your spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/formulas-toolbar-excel.jpg?width=545&amp;name=formulas-toolbar-excel.jpg\" alt=\"formulas-toolbar-excel\" width=\"545\" style=\"width: 545px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<p>The more you use various formulas in Excel, the easier it'll be to remember them and perform&nbsp;them manually. Nonetheless, the suite of icons above is a handy catalog of formulas you can browse and refer back to as you hone your spreadsheet skills.</p> \n<p>Excel formulas are also called \"functions.\" To insert one into your spreadsheet, highlight a cell in which you want to run a formula, then click the far-left icon, \"Insert Function,\" to browse popular formulas and what they do. That browsing window will look like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/insert-function-menu.jpg?width=300&amp;name=insert-function-menu.jpg\" alt=\"insert-function-menu\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Want a more sorted browsing experience? Use any of the icons we've highlighted (inside&nbsp;the long red rectangle in the first screenshot above) to find formulas related to a variety of common subjects -- such as&nbsp;finance, logic, and more. Once you've found the formula that suits your needs, click \"Insert Function,\" as shown in the window above.</img></p> \n<p>Now, let's do a deeper dive into some of the most crucial Excel formulas and how to perform each one&nbsp;in typical situations.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Excel Formulas</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#sum\">SUM</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#if\">IF</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#percentage\">Percentage</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#subtraction\">Subtraction</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#multiplication\">Multiplication</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#division\">Division</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#date\">DATE</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#array\">Array</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#count\">COUNT</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#average\">AVERAGE</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#sumif\">SUMIF</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#trim\">TRIM</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#left\">LEFT, MID, and RIGHT</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts#vlookup\">VLOOKUP</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/randomize\">RANDOMIZE</a></li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>To help you use Excel more effectively (and save a ton of time), we've compiled a list of essential formulas, keyboard shortcuts, and other small tricks and functions you should know.</p> \n<p><em>NOTE: The following formulas apply to <strong>Excel 2017</strong>. If you're using a slightly older version of Excel, the location of each feature mentioned below might be slightly different.</em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. SUM&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>All Excel formulas begin with the equals sign, =, followed by a specific text tag denoting the formula you'd like Excel to perform.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span>The SUM formula in Excel is one of the most basic formulas you can enter into a spreadsheet, allowing you to find the sum (or total) of two or more values.<span>&nbsp;To perform the SUM formula, enter the values you'd like to add together using the format, <strong>=SUM(value 1, value 2, etc)</strong>. </span></span></p> \n<p><span><span>The values you enter into the SUM formula can either be actual numbers or equal to the number in a specific cell of your spreadsheet.&nbsp;</span></span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><span><span>To find the SUM of 30 and 80, for example, type the following formula into a cell of your spreadsheet: <strong>=SUM(30, 80)</strong>. Press \"Enter,\" and the cell will produce the total of both numbers: 110.&nbsp;</span></span></li> \n <li><span><span>To find the SUM of the values in cells B2 and B11, for example, type the following formula into a cell of your spreadsheet: <strong>=SUM(B2, B11)</strong>. Press \"Enter,\" and the cell will produce the total of the numbers currently filled in cells B2 and B11. If there are no numbers in either cell, the formula will return 0.&nbsp;</span></span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><span>Keep in mind you can also find the total value of a <em>list</em> of numbers in Excel. To find the SUM of the values in cells B2&nbsp;<em>through</em>&nbsp;B11, type the following formula into a cell of your spreadsheet: <strong>=SUM(B2:B11)</strong>. Note the colon between both cells, rather than a comma. See how this might look in an Excel spreadsheet for a content marketer, below:</span></span></p> \n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sum-formula-excel.jpg?width=294&amp;name=sum-formula-excel.jpg\" alt=\"sum-formula-excel\" width=\"294\" style=\"width: 294px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. IF</h3> \n<p>The IF formula in Excel is denoted <strong>=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)</strong>. This allows you to enter a text value into the cell \"if\" something else in your spreadsheet is true or false. For example, =IF(D2=\"Gryffindor\",\"10\",\"0\") would award 10 points to cell D2 if that cell contained the word \"Gryffindor.\"</p> \n<p>There are times when we want to know how many times a value appears in our spreadsheets. But there are also those times when we want to find the cells that contain those values, and input specific data next to it.</p> \n<p>We'll go back to Sprung's example for this one. If we want to award 10 points to everyone who belongs in the Gryffindor house, instead of manually typing in 10's next to each Gryffindor student's name, we'll use the IF-THEN formula to say: <em>If </em>the student is in Gryffindor, <em>then </em>he or she should get ten points.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The formula: <strong>IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)</strong> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Logical_Test: </strong>The logical test is the \"IF\" part of the statement. In this case, the logic is D2=\"Gryffindor.\" Make sure your Logical_Test value is in quotation marks.</li> \n   <li><strong>Value_if_True: </strong>If the value is true -- that is, if the student lives in Gryffindor -- this value is the one that we want to be displayed. In this case, we want it to be the number 10, to indicate that the student was awarded the 10 points. Note: Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number.</li> \n   <li><strong>Value_if_False: </strong>If the value is false -- and the student does <em>not</em> live in Gryffindor -- we want the cell to show \"0,\" for 0 points.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Formula in below example:<strong> =IF(D2=\"Gryffindor\",\"10\",\"0\")</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<br> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2418490971-gif/IF_THEN_GIF.gif?t=1483125926675&amp;width=669&amp;name=IF_THEN_GIF.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\"> <a></a> <h3>3. Percentage</h3> <p>To perform the percentage formula in Excel, enter the cells you're finding a percentage for in the format, <strong>=A1/B1</strong>. To convert the resulting decimal value to a percentage, highlight the cell, click the Home tab, and select \"Percentage\" from the numbers dropdown.</p> <p>There isn't an Excel \"formula\" for percentages per se, but Excel makes it easy to convert the value of any cell into a percentage so you're not stuck calculating and reentering the numbers yourself.</p> <p>The basic setting to convert a cell's value into a percentage is under Excel's <strong>Home tab</strong>. Select this tab, highlight the cell(s) you'd like to convert to a percentage, and click into the dropdown menu next to Conditional Formatting (this menu button might say \"General\" at first). Then, select <strong>\"Percentage\"</strong> from the list of options that appears. This will convert the value of each cell you've highlighted into a percentage. See this feature below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/percentage-formula-in-excel.png?width=690&amp;name=percentage-formula-in-excel.png\" alt=\"percentage-formula-in-excel\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\" /></p> <p>Keep in mind if you're using other formulas, such as the division formula (denoted <strong>=A1/B1</strong>), to return new values, your values might show up as decimals by default. Simply highlight your cells before or after you perform this formula, and set these cells' format to \"Percentage\" from the Home tab -- as shown above.</p> <a></a> <h3>4. Subtraction</h3> <p>To perform the subtraction formula in Excel, enter the cells you're subtracting in the format, <strong>=SUM(A1, -B1)</strong>. This will subtract a cell using the SUM formula by adding a negative sign before the cell you're subtracting. For example, if A1 was 10 and B1 was 6, =SUM(A1, -B1) would perform 10 + -6, returning a value of 4.</p> <p>Like percentages, subtracting doesn't have its own formula in Excel either, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. You can subtract any values (or those values inside cells) two different ways.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/subtraction-formula-excel.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Subtraction formula in Excel\" /></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Using the =SUM formula.</strong> To subtract multiple values from one another, enter the cells you'd like to subtract in the format =SUM(A1, -B1), with a negative sign (denoted with a hyphen) before the cell whose value you're subtracting. Press enter to return the difference between both cells included in the parentheses. See how this looks in the screenshot above.</li> \n   <li><strong>Using the format, =A1-B1</strong>. To subtract multiple values from one another, simply type an equals sign followed by your first value or cell, a hyphen, and the value or cell you're subtracting. Press Enter to return the difference between both values.</li> \n  </ul> <a></a> <h3>5. Multiplication</h3> <p>To perform the multiplication formula in Excel, enter the cells you're multiplying in the format, <strong>=A1*B1</strong>. This formula uses an asterisk to multiply cell A1 by cell B1. For example, if A1 was 10 and B1 was 6, =A1*B1 would return a value of 60.</p> <p>You might think multiplying values in Excel has its own formula or uses the \"x\" character to denote multiplication between multiple values. Actually, it's as easy as an asterisk -- *.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/multiplication-formula-in-excel.png?width=566&amp;name=multiplication-formula-in-excel.png\" alt=\"multiplication-formula-in-excel\" width=\"566\" style=\"width: 566px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">To multiply two or more values in an Excel spreadsheet, highlight an empty cell. Then, enter the values or cells you want to multiply together in the format, <strong>=A1*B1*C1</strong> ... etc. The asterisk will effectively multiply each value included in the formula. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">Press Enter to return your desired product. See how this looks in the screenshot above.</span></p> <a></a> <h3>6. Division</h3> <p>To perform the division formula in Excel, enter the cells you're dividing in the format, <strong>=A1/B1</strong>. This formula uses a forward slash, \"/,\" to divide cell A1 by cell B1. For example, if A1 was 5 and B1 was 10, =A1/B1 would return a decimal value of 0.5.</p> <p>Division in Excel is one of the simplest functions you can perform. To do so, highlight an empty cell, enter an equals sign, \"=,\" and follow it up with the two (or more) values you'd like to divide with a forward slash, \"/,\" in between. The result should be in the following format: <strong>=B2/A2</strong>, as shown in the screenshot below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-division-formula.png?width=411&amp;name=excel-division-formula.png\" alt=\"excel-division-formula\" width=\"411\" style=\"width: 411px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> <p>Hit Enter, and your desired quotient should appear in the cell you initially highlighted.</p> <a></a> <h3>7. DATE</h3> <p>The Excel DATE formula is denoted <strong>=DATE(year, month, day)</strong>. This formula will return a date that corresponds to the values entered in the parentheses -- even values referred from other cells. For example, if A1 was 2018, B1 was 7, and C1 was 11, =DATE(A1,B1,C1) would return 7/11/2018.</p> <p>Creating dates in the cells of an Excel spreadsheet can be a fickle task every now and then. Luckily, there's a handy formula to make formatting your dates easy. There are two ways to use this formula:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Create dates from a series of cell values.</strong> To do this, highlight an empty cell, enter \"=DATE,\" and in parentheses, enter the cells whose values create your desired date -- starting with the year, then the month number, then the day. The final format should look like this: =DATE(year, month, day). See how this looks in the screenshot below.</li> \n   <li><strong>Automatically set today's date.</strong> To do this, highlight an empty cell and enter the following string of text: <span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">=DATE(YEAR(TODAY()), MONTH(TODAY()), DAY(TODAY()))</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">.</span> <span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">Pressing enter will return the current date you're working in your Excel spreadsheet.</span></li> \n  </ul> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-date-formula.png?width=552&amp;name=excel-date-formula.png\" alt=\"excel-date-formula\" width=\"552\" style=\"width: 552px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">In either usage of Excel's date formula, your returned date should be in the form of <strong>\"mm/dd/yy\" </strong>-- unless your Excel program is formatted differently.</span></p> <a></a> <h3>8. Array</h3> <p>An array formula in Excel surrounds a simple formula in brace characters using the format, <strong>{=(Start Value 1:End Value 1)*(Start Value 2:End Value 2)}</strong>. By pressing ctrl+shift+center, this will calculate and return value from multiple ranges, rather than just individual cells added to or multiplied by one another.</p> <p>Calculating the sum, product, or quotient of individual cells is easy -- just use the =SUM formula and enter the cells, values, or range of cells you want to perform that arithmetic on. But what about multiple ranges? How do you find the combined value of a large group of cells?</p> <p>Numerical arrays are a useful way to perform more than one formula at the same time in a single cell so you can see one final sum, difference, product, or quotient. <span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\">If you're looking to find total sales revenue from several sold units, for example, the array formula in Excel is perfect for you. Here's how you'd do it:</span></p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>To start using the array formula, type \"=SUM,\" and in parentheses, enter the <em>first</em> of two (or three, or four) ranges of cells you'd like to multiply together. Here's what your progress might look like: <strong>=SUM(C2:C5</strong></li> \n   <li>Next, add an asterisk after the last cell of the first range you included in your formula. This stands for multiplication. Following this asterisk, enter your second range of cells. You'll be multiplying this second range of cells by the first. Your progress in this formula should now look like this: <strong>=SUM(C2:C5*D2:D5)</strong></li> \n   <li>Ready to press Enter? Not so fast ... Because this formula is so complicated, Excel reserves a different keyboard command for arrays. Once you've closed the parentheses on your array formula, press <strong>C</strong><strong>trl+Shift+Enter</strong>. <span>This will recognize your formula as an array, wrapping your formula in brace characters and successfully returning your product of both ranges combined. </span></li> \n  </ol> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/excel-array-formula.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Excel array formula\" /></p> <p>In revenue calculations, this can cut down on your time and effort significantly. See the final formula in the screenshot above.</p> <a></a> <h3>9. COUNT</h3> <p>The COUNT formula in Excel is denoted <strong>=COUNT(Start Cell:End Cell)</strong>. This formula will return a value that is equal to the number of entries found within your desired range of cells. For example, if there are eight cells with entered values between A1 and A10, =COUNT(A1:A10) will return a value of 8.</p> <p>The COUNT formula in Excel is particularly useful for <em>large</em> spreadsheets, wherein you want to see how many cells contain actual entries. Don't be fooled: <strong>This formula won't do any math on the values of the cells themselves.</strong> This formula is simply to find out how many cells in a selected range are occupied with something.</p> <p>Using the formula in bold above, you can easily run a count of active cells in your spreadsheet. The result will look a little something like this:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/count-formula-in-excel.png?width=301&amp;name=count-formula-in-excel.png\" alt=\"count-formula-in-excel\" width=\"301\" style=\"width: 301px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> <a></a> <h3>10. AVERAGE</h3> <p>To perform the average formula in Excel, enter the values, cells, or range of cells of which you're calculating the average in the format, <strong>=AVERAGE(number1, number2, etc.)</strong> or =AVERAGE(Start Value:End Value). This will calculate the average of all the values or range of cells included in the parentheses.</p> <p>Finding the average of a range of cells in Excel keeps you from having to find individual sums and then performing a separate division equation on your total. Using <strong>=AVERAGE</strong> as your initial text entry, you can let Excel do all the work for you.</p> <p>For reference, the average of a group of numbers is equal to the sum of those numbers, divided by the number of items in that group.</p> <a></a> <h3>11. SUMIF</h3> <p>The SUMIF formula in Excel is denoted <strong>=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum range])</strong>. This will return the sum of the values within a desired range of cells that all meet one criterion. For example, =SUMIF(C3:C12,\"&gt;70,000\") would return the sum of values between cells C3 and C12 from only the cells that are greater than 70,000.</p> <p>Let's say you want to determine the profit you generated from a list of leads who are associated with specific area codes, or calculate the sum of certain employees' salaries -- but only if they fall above a particular amount. Doing that manually sounds a bit time-consuming, to say the least.</p> <p>With the SUMIF function, it doesn't have to be -- you can easily add up the sum of cells that meet certain criteria, like in the salary example above.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The formula</strong>: <strong>=<strong class=\"ocpLegacyBold\">SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])</strong></strong><br> \n     <ul> \n      <li><strong>Range: </strong>The range that is being tested using your criteria.</li> \n      <li><strong>Criteria: </strong>The criteria that determine which cells in Criteria_range1 will be added together</li> \n      <li><strong>[Sum_range]:</strong><span> An</span> optional range of cells you're going to add up in addition to the first <strong>Range </strong>entered. This field may be omitted.</li> \n     </ul> </br></li> \n  </ul> <p>In the example below, we wanted to calculate the sum of the salaries that were greater than $70,000. The SUMIF function added up the dollar amounts that exceeded that number in the cells C3 through C12, with the formula <strong>=SUMIF(C3:C12,\"&gt;70,000\")</strong>.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SUMIF.png?width=669&amp;name=SUMIF.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"SUMIF formula in Excel\"> <a></a> <h3>12. TRIM</h3> <p>The TRIM formula in Excel is denoted <strong>=TRIM(text)</strong>. This formula will remove any spaces entered before and after the text entered in the cell. For example, if A2 includes the name \" Steve Peterson\" with unwanted spaces before the first name, =TRIM(A2) would return \"Steve Peterson\" with no spaces in a new cell.</p> <p>Email and file sharing are wonderful tools in today's workplace. That is, until one of your colleagues sends you a worksheet with some really funky spacing. Not only can those rogue spaces make it difficult to search for data, but they also affect the results when you try to add up columns of numbers.</p> <p>Rather than painstakingly removing and adding spaces as needed, you can clean up any irregular spacing using the TRIM function, which is used to remove extra spaces from data (except for single spaces between words).</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>The formula</strong>: <strong>=TRIM(text).</strong> \n     <ul> \n      <li><strong>Text: </strong>The text or cell from which you want to remove spaces.</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n   </ul> <p>Here's an example of how we used the TRIM function to remove extra spaces before a list of names. To do so, we entered <strong>=TRIM(\"A2\")</strong> into the Formula Bar, and replicated this for each name below it in a new column next to the column with unwanted spaces.</p> <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/trim-formula-in-excel.png?width=280&amp;name=trim-formula-in-excel.png\" alt=\"trim-formula-in-excel\" width=\"280\" style=\"width: 280px;\"> <p><em>Below are some other Excel formulas you might find useful as your data management needs grow.</em></p> <a></a> <h3>13. LEFT, MID, and RIGHT</h3> <p>Let's say you have a line of text within a cell that you want to break down into a few different segments. Rather than manually retyping each piece of the code into its respective column, users can leverage a series of string functions to deconstruct the sequence as needed: LEFT, MID, or RIGHT.</p> <h4>LEFT</h4> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used to extract the first X numbers or characters in a cell.</li> \n     <li><strong>The formula</strong>:<strong> =</strong><strong>LEFT(text, number_of_characters)</strong><br> \n       <ul> \n        <li><strong>Text</strong>: The string that you wish to extract from.</li> \n        <li><strong>Number_of_characters</strong>: The number of characters that you wish to extract starting from the left-most character.</li> \n       </ul> </br></li> \n    </ul> <p>In the example below, we entered <strong>=LEFT(A2,4)</strong> into cell B2, and copied it into B3:B6. That allowed us to extract the first 4 characters of the code.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Left_Function_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Left_Function_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"LEFT formula in Excel\"> <h4>MID</h4> \n     <ul> \n      <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used to extract characters or numbers in the middle based on position.</li> \n      <li><strong>The formula</strong>:<strong> =</strong><strong>MID(text, start_position, number_of_characters)</strong><br> \n        <ul> \n         <li><strong>Text</strong>: The string that you wish to extract from.</li> \n         <li><strong>Start_position</strong>: The position in the string that you want to begin extracting from. For example, the first position in the string is 1.</li> \n         <li><strong>Number_of_characters</strong>: The number of characters that you wish to extract.</li> \n        </ul> </br></li> \n     </ul> <p>In this example, we entered<strong> =MID(A2,5,2)</strong> into cell B2, and copied it into B3:B6. That allowed us to extract the two numbers starting in the fifth position of the code.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mid_Function_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Mid_Function_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"MID formula in Excel\"> <h4>RIGHT</h4> \n      <ul> \n       <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Used to extract the last X numbers or characters in a cell.</li> \n       <li>The formula:<strong> =</strong><strong>RIGHT(text, number_of_characters)</strong><br> \n         <ul> \n          <li><strong>Text</strong>: The string that you wish to extract from.</li> \n          <li><strong>Number_of_characters</strong>: The number of characters that you want to extract starting from the right-most character.</li> \n         </ul> </br></li> \n      </ul> <p>For the sake of this example, we entered <strong>=RIGHT(A2,2)</strong> into cell B2, and copied it into B3:B6. That allowed us to extract the last two numbers of the code.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Right_Function_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Right_Function_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"RIGHT formula in EXCEL\"> <a></a> <h3>14. VLOOKUP</h3> <p>This one is an oldie, but a goodie -- and it's a bit more in depth than some of the other formulas we've listed here. But it's especially helpful for those times when you have two sets of data on two different spreadsheets, and want to combine them into a single spreadsheet.</p> <p>My colleague, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/rachel-sprung#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj\">Rachel Sprung</a> -- whose \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-excel-tips#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj\">How to Use Excel</a>\" tutorial is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn -- uses a list of names, email addresses, and companies as an example. If you have a list of people's names next to their email addresses in one spreadsheet, and a list of those same people's email addresses next to their company names in the other, but you want the names, email addresses, and company names of those people to appear in one place -- that's where VLOOKUP comes in.</p> <p>Note: When using this formula, you must be certain that at least one column appears <em>identically</em> in both spreadsheets. Scour your data sets to make sure the column of data you're using to combine your information is exactly the same, including no extra spaces.</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li>The formula: <strong>VLOOKUP(lookup value, table array, column number, [range lookup])</strong> \n         <ul> \n          <li><strong>Lookup Value:</strong> The identical value you have in both spreadsheets. Choose the first value in your first spreadsheet. In Sprung's example that follows, this means the first email address on the list, or cell 2 (C2).</li> \n          <li><strong>Table Array:</strong> The range of columns on Sheet 2 you're going to pull your data from, including the column of data identical to your lookup value (in our example, email addresses) in Sheet 1 as well as the column of data you're trying to copy to Sheet 1. In our example, this is \"Sheet2!A:B.\" \"A\" means Column A in Sheet 2, which is the column in Sheet 2 where the data identical to our lookup value (email) in Sheet 1 is listed. The \"B\" means Column B, which contains the information that's only available in Sheet 2 that you want to translate to Sheet 1.</li> \n          <li><strong>Column Number:</strong> The table array tells Excel where (which column) the new data you want to copy to Sheet 1 is located. In our example, this would be the \"House\" column, the second one in our table array, making it column number 2.</li> \n          <li><strong>Range Lookup:</strong> Use FALSE to ensure you pull in only exact value matches.</li> \n         </ul> </li> \n        <li>The formula with variables from Sprung's example below:<strong> =VLOOKUP(C2,Sheet2!A:B,2,FALSE)</strong></li> \n       </ul> <p>In this example, Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 contain lists describing different information about the same people, and the common thread between the two is their email addresses. Let's say we want to combine both datasets so that all the house information from Sheet 2 translates over to Sheet 1. Here's how that would work:</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2415754598-gif/VLOOKUP_GIF.gif?width=669&amp;name=VLOOKUP_GIF.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"VLOOKUP formula in Excel\"> <a></a> <h3>15. RANDOMIZE</h3> <p>There's a<a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/randomize-contents-column-excel-73137.html\"> great article</a> that likens Excel's RANDOMIZE formula to shuffling a deck of cards. The entire deck is a column, and each card -- 52 in a deck -- is a row. \"To shuffle the deck,\" writes Steve McDonnell, \"you can compute a new column of data, populate each cell in the column with a random number, and sort the workbook based on the random number field.\"</p> <p>In marketing, you might use this feature when you want to assign a random number to a list of contacts -- like if you wanted to experiment with a new email campaign and had to use blind criteria to select who would receive it. By assigning numbers to said contacts, you could apply the rule, “Any contact with a figure of 6 or above will be added to the new campaign.”</p> \n        <ul> \n         <li>The formula: <strong>RAND</strong><strong>()</strong> \n          <ul> \n           <li>Start with a single column of contacts. Then, in the column adjacent to it, type “RAND()” -- without the quotation marks -- starting with the top contact’s row.</li> \n          </ul> </li> \n         <li>For the example below: <strong>RANDBETWEEN</strong><strong>(bottom,top)</strong> \n          <ul> \n           <li>RANDBETWEEN allows you to dictate the range of numbers that you want to be assigned. In the case of this example, I wanted to use one through 10.</li> \n           <li><strong>bottom: </strong>The lowest number in the range.</li> \n           <li><strong>top: </strong>The highest number in the range,</li> \n          </ul> </li> \n         <li>Formula in below example:<strong> =RANDBETWEEN(1,10)</strong></li> \n        </ul> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VNFmtgENTK.gif?width=669&amp;name=VNFmtgENTK.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" title=\"VNFmtgENTK.gif\" alt=\"RANDOMIZE formula in Excel\"> <p>Helpful stuff, right?

Customize the color of your tabs.</h3> <p>If you've got a ton of different sheets in one workbook -- which happens to the best of us -- make it easier to identify where you need to go by color-coding the tabs. For example, you might label last month's marketing reports with red, and this month's with orange.</p> <p>Simply right click a tab and select <strong>\"Tab Color.\" </strong>A popup will appear that allows you to choose a color from an existing theme, or customize one to meet your needs.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/Screen_Shot_2015-10-16_at_2.17.46_PM.png?width=669&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2015-10-16_at_2.17.46_PM.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" alt=\"Customize the color of your tabs in Excel\"> <h3>2.

Copy and duplicate formatting.</h3> <p>If you've ever spent some time formatting a sheet to your liking, you probably agree that it's not exactly the most enjoyable activity. In fact, it's pretty tedious.</p> <p>For that reason, it's likely that you don't want to repeat the process next time -- nor do you have to. Thanks to Excel's Format Painter, you can easily copy the formatting from one area of a worksheet to another.</p> <p>Select what you'd like to replicate, then select the <strong>Format Painter</strong> option -- the paintbrush icon -- from the dashboard. The pointer will then display a paintbrush, prompting you to select the cell, text, or entire worksheet to which you want to apply that formatting, as shown below:</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/z60Q6TJJnt.gif?width=669&amp;name=z60Q6TJJnt.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"Copy and duplicate formatting in Excel\" title=\"z60Q6TJJnt.gif\"> <h3>4. Identify duplicate values.</h3> <p>In many instances, duplicate values -- like duplicate content when managing SEO -- can be troublesome if gone uncorrected. In some cases, though, you simply need to be aware of it.</p> <p>Whatever the situation may be, it's easy to surface any existing duplicate values within your worksheet in just a few quick steps. To do so, click into the <strong>Conditional Formatting</strong> option, and select <strong>Highlight Cell Rules &gt; Duplicate Values</strong></p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Duplicate_Values_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Duplicate_Values_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" alt=\"Identify duplicate values in Excel\"> <p>Using the popup, create the desired formatting rule to specify which type of duplicate content you wish to bring forward.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Identify_Duplicate_Values_Rule_Excel.png?width=669&amp;name=Identify_Duplicate_Values_Rule_Excel.png\" width=\"669\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\"> <p>In the example above, we were looking to identify any duplicate salaries within the selected range, and formatted the duplicate cells in yellow.</p> <p>In marketing, the use of Excel is pretty inevitable -- but with these tricks, it doesn't have to be so daunting.

about occasions when you're so tired of hearing a certain commercial that you switch off your radio completely.</p> \n<p>These are both examples of ad fatigue — an issue that occurs when users become too accustomed to a specific type of ad, thus reducing its effectiveness.</p> \n<p>As marketers, it's crucial we continuously serve fresh, high-quality, and<a

your audience, rather than causing frustration.</p> \n<p>Below, we'll discuss what ad fatigue is, common symptoms attributed to ad fatigue, and what you can do to fix it. Let's dive in.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>What is ad fatigue?</strong></h2> \n<p>Ad fatigue occurs when your audience sees your ads so often that they become bored with them and stop paying attention.</p> \n<p>This, in turn, causes your campaigns to become less effective, prevents users from moving down the sales funnel, and ultimately hurts your company's bottom line.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the purpose of advertising is to turn new viewers into customers, which can't happen if you're over-serving your ads to the same viewers, or creating low-quality ads.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, if you recognize ad fatigue early on, you can reverse its effects by building new campaigns. It may be as simple as altering the image you use on your Facebook ads, or using Google ad features to adapt text based on your audience's habits and preferences.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you need to employ a strategic schedule to make sure your ads are only served at the most relevant times so that you can achieve optimal ROI.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, we have a few tips and tricks to help you maximize your marketing success. Let's explore those, next.</p> \n<h2><strong>3 Signs Your Audience Has Ad Fatigue</strong></h2> \n<p>Perhaps you suspect that ad fatigue is affecting your campaigns, but you're not entirely sure how to detect it.</p> \n<p>The following are some common symptoms that you might experience if your audience is growing tired of your ads:</p> \n<h3>1. Lower Click-Through Rates (CTRs)</h3> \n<p>Your<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/google-adwords-benchmark-data\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/google-adwords-benchmark-data?_ga=2.199229103.145042032.1603289570-718172879.1603289570\">click-through rates</a> (CTR) are arguably among the most important metrics to measure when it comes to tracking and addressing ad fatigue. CTR demonstrates how engaging your ad is — and, in particular, whether it's convincing enough to compel visitors to explore your brand further.</p> \n<p>For instance, if your ad displays a 10% discount on your new fall shoe line and it has a high CTR, you can assume the ad is effectively encouraging visitors to stop what they're doing, and take a look at your newly-discounted products.</p> \n<p>If your CTR numbers fall considerably over time, it could be because you're boring your audience, and they're no longer willing to engage with your brand.</p> \n<h3>2. Less Engagement</h3> \n<p>Speaking of engagement, have you checked in to see how followers are interacting with your business on social media?</p> \n<p>If people casually view your ads and move on, they're not really engaged — and an engaged audience is key to yielding comments and shares. If you're noticing reduced social engagement, it could be a sign that you've inflicted ad fatigue onto your followers in ways that make them less motivated to interact with <em>all</em> your content: both paid and organic.</p> \n<h3>3. Fewer Impressions</h3> \n<p>Social media algorithms are set up so that only the most relevant content appears at the top. The same goes for advertisements ­— paid social media ads will only appear if they're applicable for that particular user. This means that, if people aren't interacting with your paid posts, they're not as likely to see them in the future. So, if your impressions have decreased over time, it might be time to revamp your ad campaigns.</p> \n<p>Like most obstacles in life, you can't remedy ad fatigue until you recognize that it's a problem. By examining the aforementioned metrics continuously over time, you'll get a better understanding of how your audience feels about your brand. Once you know that ad fatigue may be to blame for less-than-stellar campaign performance, you can make small-but-strategic improvements to breathe new life into your marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at a few potential ad fatigue cures now.</p> \n<h2><strong>How Can You Cure Ad Fatigue?</strong></h2> \n<p>It doesn't always take a ton of work to reduce ad fatigue. Sometimes, simple changes can be all you need to update the look and feel of your advertisements.</p> \n<p>Here are three steps you can take to refresh your campaigns so that your audience will be more interested in the content you're sharing.</p> \n<h3>1. Update the background color of your display ads.</h3> \n<p>Everyone needs a change of scenery now and then.</p> \n<p>We're often exposed to the same images over and over, which can be tiring and compel us to ignore the ads next time we see them.</p> \n<p>Display ads can be particularly susceptible to ad fatigue because you're showing the same audience the same advertisement multiple times.</p> \n<p>Luckily, there's a simple fix to avoid this conundrum: by changing the background color of your ads, you can refresh your audience's interest in your content. This small change is often enough to make your advertisements appear brand-new.</p> \n<h3>2. Customize your ads using ad customizers.</h3> \n<p>Google's ad customizers have been around for a few years now, and they're powerful tools for increasing conversions and maintaining ad freshness.</p> \n<p>If you're running<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.199229103.145042032.1603289570-718172879.1603289570\">Pay-Per-Click (PPC) ads</a>, you might not be aware of the power that customizers hold, but it's time to change that — ultimately, Google's ad customizers ensure your ads stay fresh and relevant, while simultaneously creating a sense of urgency that entices your followers to click on your calls-to-action.</p> \n<p>In short, ad customizers dynamically update your advertisements with content that's tailored to your audience, and deliver that content in a time-sensitive manner.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you have a limited time, end-of-year promotion happening right now. Ad customizers allow you to get the word out about your promotion in real-time when it's most relevant to users. You can use this feature for one-time situations, recurring events, or location-specific opportunities. Even better, once you get them set up, ad customizations are pretty hands-off.</p> \n<h3>3. Rotate your ads frequently.</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, you know that schedules are important: you need a clear plan to keep all of your campaigns on-track.</p> \n<p>That being said, showing an ad too many times to the same people can easily lead to ad fatigue.</p> \n<p>Combat this issue by creating multiple ads and rotating them. These versions can all deliver the same content, but should include differences in text or design. This helps to keep your content fresh and allows you to optimize your campaigns based on which ads perform best. (A/B testing these ads can be an effective option for ensuring you're serving the highest-performing ads to your visitors.)</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that when you're rotating your ads, you should also ensure that you're only delivering your messages at the most relevant <em>times</em> of day (and on the most relevant days). Include your rotations in your marketing calendar for streamlined execution and better results.</p> \n<h3>4. Monitor your campaigns.</h3> \n<p>It's not enough to write new copy or swap out your creative — you'll need to continuously<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7249/a-marketer-s-guide-to-tracking-online-campaigns.aspx\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7249/a-marketer-s-guide-to-tracking-online-campaigns.aspx?_ga=2.199229103.145042032.1603289570-718172879.1603289570\">track your ads</a> to ensure fatigue doesn't set in with your updated campaigns. If you're not monitoring your ads' performance, you won't be able to tell if your audience has lost interest in them.</p> \n<p>To keep ad fatigue on your radar, be sure to monitor frequency (the number of times users see your ads) and CTR (the number of times people click on your ads divided by the number of impressions). This allows you to identify ad fatigue early on and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p> \n<h3>How One Marketing Agency Cured Ad Fatigue</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://zerogravitymarketing.com/\">Zero Gravity Marketing (ZGM)</a>, a full-service digital marketing agency located in Connecticut, was put to the test when it came to curing ad fatigue for one of its clients. In this case study, a client was running a paid social media campaign that hadn't changed ad variations in over three months.</p> \n<p>ZGM employed a strategic approach to improve organic traffic and turn visitors into loyal customers. To reduce the ad fatigue the client's audience was experiencing, the agency first identified and scaled back ineffective campaigns. Then, they took the following steps to refresh the existing PPC strategy:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Conducted Keyword Research</strong>: ZGM's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) team conducted keyword research to pinpoint new, more effective search queries related to the client's brand. The PPC team then used these terms within the ads.</li> \n <li><strong>Rewrote Ad Content</strong>: Leaning on the new keyword research, ZGM refreshed the campaign's messaging to be more relevant to the target audience.</li> \n <li><strong>Set Up Goal Tracking</strong>: To better monitor progress, the team also set up goal tracking for social media button clicks, account log-in form fills, and more.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The results? ZGM's strategy quickly lent itself to significant improvements in campaign ROI. In just three months, the client experienced a 17% increase in organic traffic, and a 10% increase compared to the previous year.</p> \n<p>No matter what type of business you run, your ultimate goal is to build brand awareness and turn leads into loyal customers. Of course, one of the best ways to do this is through fresh, relevant paid ads.

You can turn any YouTube video into a GIF using the URL.</h3> \n<p>Everyone loves GIFs, but knowing how to make them isn't common knowledge. Well, it should be, because all it takes is a little YouTube URL trick.</p> \n<p><strong>To create a GIF from a YouTube video:</strong> Select a video to watch on YouTube and find the URL at the top of your browser. Add the word \"gif\" right before the domain name so it reads, \"www.gifyoutube.com/[your-video-tag].\"</p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.01em;\">This will bring you to gifs.com, with your video already uploaded and ready for editing. Here, you'll find a menu of options to the left-hand side with a timeline bar along the bottom of your video. You can set the GIF duration, crop its frame, add captions, and more.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.01em;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_features_gif.png?width=555&amp;name=youtube_features_gif.png\" alt=\"YouTube trick to create a GIF from a video.\" width=\"555\" title=\"YouTube trick to create a GIF from a video.\" style=\"width: 555px;\"></span></p> \n<p>Click \"Create GIF\" on the top-right and it'll prompt you for a GIF title and set of tags. Then click \"Next,\" and you have a handy landing page from which to share your newly minted GIF. Keep in mind you can only download this GIF to an offline file by signing up with gifs.com.</p> \n<h3>2. You can create a link that starts a YouTube video at a certain time.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ever wanted to send someone a YouTube video, but point them to a specific moment? Let's say you're trying to recruit your friends to learn the dance in Justin Bieber's \"Sorry\" music video with you.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Instead of sending your friends the general YouTube link and instructing them to fast-forward to the 0:50 minute mark, you can actually send them a specific YouTube time link that starts the video at whichever time you choose. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fRh_vgS2dFE?t=50s\">Click here to see what I mean</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Alright, here's how to do it:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To create a link that starts a YouTube video at a certain time: </strong>Open up the video and click \"Share\" to the far right of the video title. Then, in the window of options that appears, check the box next to \"Start at:\" and type in the time (in hours:minutes:seconds) you want. Alternatively, you can pause the video at the time you want it to start and that field will autofill.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_share_screenshot.png?width=854&amp;name=youtube_share_screenshot.png\" alt=\"YouTube time link of a Justin Bieber video.\" width=\"854\" title=\"YouTube time link of a Justin Bieber video.\" style=\"width: 854px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After a few moments, you'll see a tag add itself to the end of the generic YouTube link (in this case, <strong>?t=50s</strong>). Simply copy that link and paste it wherever you'd like.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It's worth noting that you can't embed a video so it starts at a certain time; you can't only link to it.</p> \n<h3>3. You can easily see the written transcripts of people's videos.</h3> \n<p>Did you know YouTube automatically generates a written transcript for every single video uploaded to its website? That's right -- and anyone has access to that transcript unless the user <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en\">manually hides it</a> from viewers.</p> \n<p>I can think of a number of different situations where video transcripts can come in handy. For example, maybe you want to write down a quote from a video, but the tedium of pausing-and-typing, pausing-and-typing would drive you up a wall. Or perhaps you need to find a specific section of a video, but don't want to rewatch the whole thing to find it. With a transcript in hand, you can find information like this without doing it all by hand.</p> \n<p><strong>To see a video's transcript:</strong> Open the video in YouTube and press the \"More\" tab underneath the video title. Choose \"Transcript\" from the drop-down menu.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_moretab.png?width=854&amp;name=youtube_moretab.png\" alt=\"YouTube's more tag to find the video transcript.\" width=\"854\" title=\"YouTube's more tag to find the video transcript.\" style=\"width: 854px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(If you aren't seeing this option, it's because the user chose to hide the transcript.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This transcript will appear as a new module in the same window. In many cases, the user who uploaded the video will not have gone back and manually polished the transcript, so it won't be perfect. But it'll certainly save you some time and pain.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_transcript_example.png?width=855&amp;name=youtube_transcript_example.png\" alt=\"Example of a YouTube transcript.\" width=\"855\" title=\"Example of a YouTube transcript.\" style=\"width: 855px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. You can help your video get found in search by editing or uploading a transcript.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both YouTube and its parent company Google look at a number of <a href=\"http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/16071-youtube-ranking-algorithm.html\">factors when ranking videos in search</a> to determine what your video is about, and your transcript is one of them. (An even bigger ranking factor is your video's description, which is why Digital Marketing Consultant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZvcEmaj38g\">Ryan Stewart suggests</a> that you actually paste your transcript right into the description box, too.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To add a transcript to your video:</strong> Open the video on YouTube, and you'll see a row of icons just below the play button. Click the icon on the far right for \"Subtitles/CC.\" (CC stands for \"Closed Captions.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/CC_youtube.png?width=319&amp;name=CC_youtube.png\" alt=\"YouTube closed captioning (CC).\" width=\"319\" title=\"YouTube closed captioning (CC).\" style=\"width: 319px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Set your language if you haven't already. Then, you'll then be prompted to choose among three different ways to add subtitles or closed captions to your video ...</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\">Upload a pre-written text transcript or a timed subtitles file. (Learn more about the file types you can upload and more <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en\">here</a>.)</li> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\">Paste in a full transcript of the video, wherein subtitle timings will be set automatically.</li> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\">Type them in as you watch the video.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The folks at YouTube have done some great things to make that third option (typing as you watch) as painless as possible. For example, if you check a box next to \"Pause video while typing,\" it'll make the whole process a lot faster. Here's a GIF showing that in action:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-transcribe.gif?width=730&amp;name=youtube-transcribe.gif\" alt=\"YouTube transcribe page.\" width=\"730\" title=\"YouTube transcribe page.\" style=\"width: 730px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Learn more about optimizing your YouTube videos for search in the below video.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HlBPx8ek4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>5. You can use YouTube to easily get free transcriptions of your videos and audio files.</h3> \n<p>This is the last one about transcripts, I promise -- but I'll bet you never thought about them this way. As you know from #3, YouTube automatically adds a transcript to every video. But if you're looking for a one-off transcription of an audio or video file and don't want to pay for a service, YouTube's built-in captioning system isn't a bad place to start. You can always clean it up later.</p> \n<p><strong>To get an automated transcription for a video:</strong> Simply <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en\">upload your video to YouTube</a>, open it on YouTube's website, press the \"More\" tab underneath the video title, and choose \"Transcript\" from the drop-down menu. The transcript will appear as a new module in the same window. If you want to clean it up, follow the steps outlined in #3 for a user-friendly experience.</p> \n<p><strong>To get an automated transcription for an audio file: </strong>You'll need to upload your audio recording to YouTube using a service like <a href=\"http://www.tunestotube.com/\">TunesToTube</a>. It'll take anywhere between 2–30 minutes for YouTube to upload it. Then, follow the instructions for getting an automated transcription for a video, outlined above.</p> \n<h3>6. You can create, share, and collaborate on video playlists.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just like on your other favorite media sharing sites like Spotify and iTunes, you can create a \"playlist\" on YouTube -- which is really just a place to store and organize the videos (your own and others'). You can keep playlists private, make them public, or even share them directly with others.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Playlists are useful for many different types of users, from an individual collecting cooking videos for their upcoming dinner party to a brand that's segmenting its YouTube video content by topic. For example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFp8uSYCjXOMnkUyb3CQ3Q/playlists\">Tasty's YouTube playlists</a> break up recipes by meal type, making it easier for people to browse and find what they're looking for:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tasty%20playlists%20example.png?width=1053&amp;name=tasty%20playlists%20example.png\" alt=\"Tasty playlists example.\" width=\"1053\" title=\"Tasty playlists example.\" style=\"width: 1053px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To create a playlist on desktop: </strong>Go to your Playlists page by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists\">clicking here</a> or clicking your account icon in the top right, choosing \"Creator Studio,\" clicking \"Video Manager\" on the left, and choosing \"Playlists.\" Then, click \"New Playlist\" on the top right and choose whether you'd like to keep it private or make it public.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-create-new-playlist.png?width=372&amp;name=youtube-create-new-playlist.png\" alt=\"YouTube create new playlist page.\" width=\"372\" title=\"YouTube create new playlist page.\" style=\"width: 372px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To create a playlist on mobile: </strong><a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57792?hl=en\">Click here</a> for instructions explaining how to create new playlists using your iOS or Android mobile devices.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To add a video to a playlist:</strong> If you're adding a video to a playlist while you're watching it, click the \"Add to\" icon below the video title and check the box next to the playlist to which you'd like to add it.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_playlist.png?width=475&amp;name=youtube_playlist.png\" alt=\"Add to button for creating YouTube playlists.\" width=\"475\" title=\"Add to button for creating YouTube playlists.\" style=\"width: 475px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want to add a video to a playlist right from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists\">your Playlists page</a>, simply click \"Add Video\" and either paste in a video URL, choose a video from your uploads, or search for a video on YouTube. Once you find the video you want to add, select the \"Add to\" menu from that video and add it to the playlist.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your friends can contribute to your playlists, too. All you have to do is turn on the ability to collaborate on playlists. Once you turn it on, anyone you share a playlist link with can add videos to that playlist. (They can also remove any videos they've added, too.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To add friends to a playlist:</strong> Go to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists\">your Playlists page</a> again and open the playlist you want to collaborate on. Click \"Playlist Settings\" and choose the \"Collaborate\" tag. Toggle on the setting that allows collaborators to add videos to the playlist, and from there, you can send them a link where they can add videos to the playlist.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-collaborate-playlist.png?width=628&amp;name=youtube-collaborate-playlist.png\" alt=\"YouTube collaborate playlist setting.\" width=\"628\" title=\"YouTube collaborate playlist setting.\" style=\"width: 628px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once your friend's been invited to a playlist, they'll be able to add new videos to it and remove videos they've added in the past. They just have to follow some on-screen instructions first to confirm they want to be a contributor and to save the playlist to their own account.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you add a video to a playlist you're collaborating on, your name will appear next to the video in the playlist, and everyone who's been invited to collaborate on that playlist will get a notification that a new video has been added.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(To learn more about how to manage contributors, stop accepting contributions to a playlist, and so on, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6109639\">read this YouTube Support page</a>.)</p> \n<h3>7. You can save videos to watch later.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ever seen YouTube videos you wished you could bookmark for later? Maybe you aren't able to turn the sound on at the moment, or perhaps you just don't have time to watch it. Well, YouTube took a page out of Facebook's ... book ... by adding something very similar to Facebook's \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1471345899777163\">Save for Later</a>\" feature. On YouTube, you can save videos to a \"Watch Later\" playlist to access whenever you want.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The \"Watch Later\" playlist operates just like a normal playlist, so the instructions are identical to the previous step (except you can't invite others to collaborate on your \"Watch Later\" playlist).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To add a video to your \"Watch Later\" playlist: </strong>Open the video on YouTube and click the \"Add to\" icon below the video title and check the box next to the playlist you'd like to add it to, just like you did in the previous step. The steps are very similar on mobile, but <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56101?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;hl=en&amp;oco=0\">click here</a> if you want the full instructions from YouTube's Support page.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To access those videos:</strong> Simply go to your YouTube homepage and choose \"Watch Later\" from the menu on the upper left-hand side of your screen.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtubewatchlater-1.png?width=209&amp;name=youtubewatchlater-1.png\" alt=\"YouTube watch later option.\" width=\"209\" title=\"YouTube watch later option.\" style=\"width: 209px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From there, you can watch the videos you were saving, as well as easily remove videos from that list that you've already watched.</p> \n<h3>8. You can create your own custom YouTube URL.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Want to give people an easy-to-remember web address to get to your YouTube channel? You can actually create a custom URL, which you can base on things like your display name, your YouTube username, any current vanity URLs that you have, or the name of your linked website. HubSpot's, for example, is <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hubspot\">https://www.youtube.com/<strong>hubspot</strong></a>.</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Important Note:</strong> Before you do this, make sure you're positive this is the custom URL you want -- because once it's approved, you can't request to change it, nor can you transfer it to someone else. Keep in mind that it'll be linked to both your YouTube channel and your Google+ identity, too.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unfortunately, not everyone's eligible for a custom URL. To get one, you have to have 100 or more subscribers, be at least 30 days old, have an uploaded photo as your channel icon, and have uploaded channel art. If that sounds like you, keep reading.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To claim your custom URL:</strong> Open up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/account\">your YouTube account settings</a> and click \"Advanced\" in your name section.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/overview_youtube_screenshot.png?width=493&amp;name=overview_youtube_screenshot.png\" alt=\"overview_youtube_screenshot.png\" width=\"493\" title=\"overview_youtube_screenshot.png\" style=\"width: 493px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you're eligible for a custom URL, you'll be prompted to claim yours by clicking a link.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/advanced_youtube_settlings.png?width=317&amp;name=advanced_youtube_settlings.png\" alt=\"advanced_youtube_settings.png\" width=\"317\" title=\"advanced_youtube_settings.png\" style=\"width: 317px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Select the box next to \"I agree to the Terms of Service.\" Then, once you're absolutely sure it's the URL you want (since you can't ever change it), click \"Change URL\" to make it final.</p> \n<h3>9. You can add an end screen or cards to promote content.</h3> \n<p>In 2008, YouTube began allowing clickable links YouTube called \"annotations\" that you could insert into your videos. These annotations worked kind of like call-to-action buttons for directing people to subscribe to your channel, see merchandise or a fundraising campaign, visit another resource to learn more, and so on.</p> \n<p>In order to make them more natural parts of the viewing experience, YouTube has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14953756/youtube-annotations-feature-discontinue-cards-end-screens\">replaced annotations with end screens</a>, where you can display more visually pleasing call-to-action cards in the last 30 seconds of your content.</p> \n<h4>How to Add an End Screen</h4> \n<p>Do your favorite YouTube creators have a fancy closing screen that encourages you to keep watching their videos? For example, here's one from <em>Saturday Night Live:</em></p> \n<p><em><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SNL_youtube_end%20screen.png?width=730&amp;height=506&amp;name=SNL_youtube_end%20screen.png\" alt=\"SNL_youtube_end screen.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"506\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></em></p> \n<p>You can create a customized end screen, too. They help keep viewers on your channel by suggesting other videos and sites they can check out. Here's how to do it:</p> \n<p>Navigate to your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U\">Video Manager</a>, tap \"Edit,\" and select \"End screen &amp; Annotations\" from the drop-down menu:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/endscreen_youtube.png?width=525&amp;name=endscreen_youtube.png\" alt=\"YouTube end screen call to action.\" width=\"525\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 525px;\" title=\"YouTube end screen call to action.\"></p> \n<p>From there, you're taken to the End screen creator studio, where you can play around with different templates and background to determine how you want your end screen to appear. Then, click the \"Add element\" menu to decide where you want to send viewers from your end screen.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/addelement_youtube.png?width=406&amp;height=368&amp;name=addelement_youtube.png\" alt=\"addelement_youtube.png\" width=\"406\" height=\"368\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Any YouTube creators can add an end screen to customize their channels. Here's an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6388789?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">explainer article</a> with more details and inspirational ideas.</p> \n<h4>How to Add a Card</h4> \n<p>You can use cards to advertise products used in your videos or links on your website you want to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing\">market on YouTube</a>. If viewers tap the \"i\" in the upper-right hand corner of a video, the cards expand, as in the example below:</p>  \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6HloXUtX4k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>  \n<p>To add a card to a YouTube video, head to your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U\">Video Manager</a>, tap \"Edit,\" and select \"Cards\" from the drop-down menu.</p> \n<p>Then, choose where in the video you want cards to appear, and tap the \"Add card\" drop-down menu to choose what you want the card to promote. From there, customize the content that will appear to viewers when they tap the \"i\" while viewing your video:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add_card_youtube.png?width=460&amp;height=582&amp;name=add_card_youtube.png\" alt=\"add_card_youtube.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"582\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>10. YouTube has a big library of high-quality, royalty-free sound effects and music you can browse and download.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Want to add some cool sound effects or music to your YouTube video (or any video)? YouTube is there for you. It has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects\">a whole library</a> of high-quality, 320kbps audio tracks and sound effects that you can download royalty-free and add to your videos. (Or listen to in your free time. We won't judge.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To add music or sound effects to your video:</strong> Open YouTube's Audio Library <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects\">by clicking here</a> or opening your Creator Studio, clicking \"Create\" in the menu on the left-hand side, and choosing \"Audio Library.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, the fun begins. By default, it'll start you on the \"Sound effects\" tab. Here, you can search sounds using the search bar, like I did in the screenshot below for motorcycle sounds.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-audio-library.png?width=730&amp;height=547&amp;name=youtube-audio-library.png\" alt=\"youtube-audio-library.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"547\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can also toggle by category (everything from human voices to weather sounds) or scroll through favorites that you've starred in the past. For easy access in the future, select the star to add the track to your Favorites. The bars next to the songs show how popular a track is.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you switch over to the \"Music\" bar, you can browse through all of its royalty-free music. You won't find the Beatles in here, but you will find some good stuff -- like suspenseful music, uplifting music, holiday music, jazz, and more. Instead of toggling by category, you can toggle by genre, mood, instrument, duration, and so on.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(<strong>Note:</strong> Some of the music files in there may have additional attribution requirements you have to follow, but those are pretty clearly laid out on a song-by-song-basis.

Then, you can do whatever you want with it.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want to source sounds for your videos outside of YouTube, you'll just have to make sure to you're following all the rules for sourcing them. <a href=\"https://creatoracademy.withgoogle.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/sound-effects?hl=en&amp;utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_medium=Help_Center&amp;utm_campaign=Help%20Center%20-%20Free%20Music%20Audio%20Library%20-%20Sound%20Effects%20lesson%20-%20February%202015%20-%20Top%2020%20languages\">Refer to this YouTube Support page</a> for best practices for sourcing audio, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/music_policies\">this one to learn YouTube's music policies</a>.</p> \n<h3>11. Add adjustments and creative effects with YouTube Enhancements.</h3> \n<p>YouTube has faded a number of features it experimented with at one time -- including annotations and a not-so-popular slideshow creator -- but one editing tool that remains quite handy is Enhancements. Nine effects you'd normally find on third-party video editing software, you can now take advantage of natively through YouTube:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Auto-fix lighting and color</li> \n <li>Stabilize shaky camera motions</li> \n <li>Apply slow motion</li> \n <li>Apply time lapse</li> \n <li>Trim out parts of your video</li> \n <li>Rotate the view</li> \n <li>Apply filters</li> \n <li>Custom blurring</li> \n <li>Blur faces</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>To make enhancements to an existing video: </strong>Click into your Video Manager and find a video you'd like to edit. Select the drop-down icon next to \"Edit\" to the right of the video, and select \"Enhancements.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-features-enhancements.jpg?width=555&amp;name=youtube-features-enhancements.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube enhancements and effects feature.\" width=\"555\" title=\"YouTube enhancements and effects feature.\" style=\"width: 555px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_features_filters_enhancements.jpg?width=555&amp;name=youtube_features_filters_enhancements.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube filters and other enhancements.\" width=\"555\" title=\"YouTube filters and other enhancements.\" style=\"width: 555px;\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Images via <a href=\"https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/youtube-enhancements-to-improve-video-quality.html\">filmora</a></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">If you're editing on a computer, this button will open all nine tools to the right of your video, where you can add various fixes, filters, and blurring effects and see how they change the final product in real time.</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note that not all enhancements are available on mobile devices.

Play YouTube videos in the background on mobile devices.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, your own music playlist just isn't cutting it. Or maybe you want to listen to your favorite artist's performance at an awards show.</p> \n<p>Either way, if you've tried listening to music on YouTube via your mobile device, you may have noticed one thing: You can't navigate out of the app. You have to keep YouTube open, and you can't use your phone for anything else, in order to listen to something on YouTube. Kind of frustrating if you're trying to multitask on your commute home, right?</p> \n<p>Now, there are hacks so you can listen to YouTube content in the background while still using your mobile device. Here's what you do:</p> \n<h4>How to Watch YouTube Videos in the Background: iOS</h4> \n<p>Open Safari on your mobile device, and navigate to a video you want to watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com\">https://www.youtube.com</a>. Start playing the video you want to listen to, then tap the Home button to close out of Safari. (I chose Katy Perry.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_katy1.png?width=320&amp;name=youtube_katy1.png\" alt=\"youtube_katy1.png\" width=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Then, swipe up on your home screen to reveal the Action Center.</p> \n<p>Then, swipe left to reveal the second screen on your Action Center. The details of the video you selected on YouTube should appear, and from there, simply tap Play to keep jamming.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_katy2.0.png?width=317&amp;name=youtube_katy2.0.png\" alt=\"youtube_katy2.0.png\" width=\"317\" title=\"youtube_katy2.0.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_katy2.png?width=317&amp;name=youtube_katy2.png\" alt=\"youtube_katy2.png\" width=\"317\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h4>How to Watch YouTube Videos in the Background: Android</h4> \n<p>Launch Firefox or Chrome on your mobile device, and navigate to a video you want to play on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com\">https://www.youtube.com</a>. Then, tap the \"Settings\" menu in the upper right-hand corner (the ellipses) and select \"Request Desktop Site.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/turn-to-desktop-android1-1200x800-c.jpg?width=730&amp;height=487&amp;name=turn-to-desktop-android1-1200x800-c.jpg\" alt=\"turn-to-desktop-android1-1200x800-c.jpg\" width=\"730\" height=\"487\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-play-youtube-videos-in-the-background-in-android-and-ios/3/\">DigitalTrends</a></span></p> \n<p>Then, start playing the video on YouTube, and tap the Home button to return to your home screen. The audio will keep playing in the background as you use other apps.</p> \n<h3>13. You can live stream videos to YouTube.</h3> \n<p>Live streaming video has been a big topic of conversation for the past few years. It's seen massive growth, especially in the past few years with the advent of Twitter's Periscope, Facebook Live, and Instagram live videos.</p> \n<p>Learning how to go live on YouTube is a little more complex (and confusing) than live streaming using similar platforms. On YouTube's easier streaming option, there's no simple \"start\" button; instead, you actually have to download encoding software and set it up to use live streaming at all. YouTube has identified <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en&amp;authuser=1\">13+ encoders</a> that are Live Verified.</p> \n<p>If you're streaming a live event, though, all you need is a webcam. We'll get to that in a second.</p> \n<h4>Live Stream From Your Desktop Computer</h4> \n<p>Log in to YouTube and click the \"Upload\" button at the top-right of your screen. Normally, this is where you'd upload a pre-existing video -- but instead, you'll want to find the \"Live Streaming\" module on the right-hand side of your screen. Click \"Get Started\" in that module.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_features_live_streaming.png?width=555&amp;height=296&amp;name=youtube_features_live_streaming.png\" alt=\"youtube_features_live_streaming.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"296\"></p> \n<p>Before you go live, YouTube will first confirm that <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171664\">your channel is verified</a> and that you have no <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853834\">live stream restrictions</a> in the last 90 days. Once that's all set, you have two options for streaming: \"Stream now\" and \"Live Events.\"</p> \n<h4>Stream Now</h4> \n<p>Stream Now is the simpler, quicker option for live streaming, which is why it's YouTube's default for live streaming. You'll see a fancy dashboard like the one below when you choose \"Live Streaming\" on the left-hand Creator Studio menu:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_livestream%20dashboard.png?width=998&amp;name=youtube_livestream%20dashboard.png\" alt=\"youtube_livestream dashboard.png\" width=\"998\" title=\"youtube_livestream dashboard.png\"></p> \n<p>Again, you'll notice there's no \"start\" button on the dashboard. This is where you'll need to open your encoder and start and stop your streaming from there. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6273849?hl=en&amp;authuser=1\">Here's YouTube's Live Streaming FAQ page</a> for more detailed information.</p> \n<h4>Live Events</h4> \n<p>Live Events gives you a lot more control over the live stream. You can preview it before it goes live, it'll give you backup redundancy streams, and you can start and stop the stream when you want.</p> \n<p>Choose \"Live Events\" from your live streaming dashboard once you've enabled it. Here's what the events dashboard looks like, and you can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events\">learn more about it here</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-live-event.png?width=730&amp;height=291&amp;name=youtube-live-event.png\" alt=\"youtube-live-event.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"291\"></p> \n<p>When you stop streaming, we’ll automatically upload an archive of your live stream to your channel. Note that your completed live stream videos are automatically made public on your channel by default as soon as you're done recording. To make them disappear from the public eye once you're done, you can select “Make archive private when complete” in the \"Stream Options\" section of your live dashboard.</p> \n<h4>Live Stream From Your Mobile Device</h4> \n<p>YouTube has also <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/02/mobile-live-streaming-super-chat-live.html\">rolled out</a> live streaming from mobile devices for YouTube creators with 10,000 or more subscribers (as of the date of this posting -- that will be available to all creators soon, according to YouTube's blog post).</p> \n<p>Live streaming is more intuitive from mobile devices than on desktop computers. Qualified creators can simply open their YouTube app on mobile, tap the camera icon at the top of the screen, and choose \"Go Live.\"</p> \n<p>From there, creators can enter details about the broadcast before immediately recording live for their subscribers, as shown below:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/CameoFlow-1.gif?width=303&amp;height=540&amp;name=CameoFlow-1.gif\" alt=\"CameoFlow-1.gif\" width=\"303\" height=\"540\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/02/mobile-live-streaming-super-chat-live.html\">YouTube</a></span></p> \n<p>For more instruction on how to go live on YouTube across devices, YouTube published a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853700?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;hl=en&amp;oco=0\">Help article here</a>.

You can upload and watch 360-degree videos (live and pre-recorded) -- and in VR.</h3> \n<p>YouTube first announced its support for 360-degree videos <a href=\"https://youtubecreator.blogspot.com/2015/03/a-new-way-to-see-and-share-your-world.html\">back in March 2015</a>, and it was a total novelty -- not to mention a game-changer. Since then, brands, athletes, and other users have created some awesome 360-degree content, like this video from Samsung:</p>  \n<div> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 669px; max-height: 376px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.20%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gjR60TSn8Q\" width=\"669\" height=\"376\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>  \n<p>As you can see, the experience as a viewer is really, really cool. On desktop, you can click around the video to see all the different angles while the video plays. On mobile, it's even cooler: You can move your camera around to change the angle. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ\">browse the trending 360-degree and VR videos here</a>.</p> \n<h4>How to Create a 360-degree Video on YouTube</h4> \n<p>For this, you'll need some serious equipment. Cameras with 360-degree capability that are compatible with YouTube are listed <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631\">here on YouTube's Support page</a>, along with how to create and upload a 360-degree video file.</p> \n<p>What about live video in 360 degrees? That announcement would come a year after the first one, <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2016/04/one-step-closer-to-reality-introducing.html\">in April 2016</a> -- the very same week <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395898/facebook-surround-360-video-camera-vr-f8-conference\">Facebook announced</a> its own design for a 360-degree camera. Luckily for the folks at YouTube, it beat out Facebook by supporting both live video and 360-degree footage all at once.</p> \n<h4>How to Watch Any YouTube Video in VR</h4> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/18/11450484/youtube-live-360-degree-video-announced-neal-mohan-interview\">The Verge called 360 live-streamed videos</a> \"the gateway drug to virtual reality\" for YouTube. Other than the YouTube website or app, you don't need any fancy equipment to be able to watch a 360-degree live video and feel like you're basically there.</p> \n<p>That doesn't mean a headset isn't an option -- and an awesome one at that, since YouTube released its Cardboard feature. Cardboard is available on <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/watch-any-youtube-video-in-vr-mode/\">any YouTube video</a> you watch or upload, and works with <a href=\"https://vr.google.com/cardboard/\">Google Cardboard</a> (an actual VR headset by Google) and several other VR headsets available today.</p> \n<p><strong>To use Cardboard while watching a YouTube video via mobile: </strong>Select any video in your YouTube mobile app, then tap the three dots in the upper-right hand corner of the video. <span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.01em;\">In the drop-down, select \"View in Cardboard.\" </span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.01em;\">You may already see this option visible in the bottom-right of 360-degree videos.</span></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_features_view_cardboard.png?width=399&amp;name=youtube_features_view_cardboard.png\" alt=\"youtube_features_view_cardboard.png\" width=\"399\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 399px;\"></p> \n<p>This will prompt you to connect your mobile device to a compatible VR device. Once you do, prepare for a stellar experience, and just imagine what this could mean for the content with which you populate your own YouTube channel.</p> \n<h3>15. YouTube ads target you based on an algorithm similar to Google and Facebook.</h3> \n<p>How does the YouTube algorithm decide which ads play on the videos you watch?</p> \n<p>Turns out it works a lot like Google and Facebook ads do. Like on other free sites, the advertisers help fund the YouTube experience in return for exposure to ads. You'll <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2454017?hl=en\">see certain ads over others</a> because of your demographic groups, your interests (which is judged in part by what you search on <a href=\"https://adwords.googleblog.com/2017/01/making-youtube-better-in-mobile-cross.html\">Google and YouTube</a>) and the content you've viewed before, including whether or not you've interacted with the advertiser's videos, ads, or YouTube channel.</p> \n<p>YouTube’s algorithms also try to make sure people aren’t overloaded with ads while watching videos -- so it actually sometimes won't show ads on monetizable videos, even when there's a demographic match.</p> \n<p>Here are the five ad formats you can expect to see on YouTube, and how they work:</p> \n<p><strong>A. Display ads</strong>, which show up next to the video and only appear only on desktop and laptop computers. The advertiser gets paid when you see or click on the ad, depending on their selection.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-display-ads.png?width=383&amp;height=222&amp;name=youtube-display-ads.png\" alt=\"youtube-display-ads.png\" width=\"383\" height=\"222\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://youtube.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/ad-types#yt-creators-strategies-2\">YouTube's Creator Academy</a></span></p> \n<p><strong>B. Overlay ads</strong>, which appear across the bottom 20% of the video window and currently only appears only on desktop and laptop computers. You can X out of the ad at any time.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-overlay-ads.png?width=259&amp;height=222&amp;name=youtube-overlay-ads.png\" alt=\"youtube-overlay-ads.png\" width=\"259\" height=\"222\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://youtube.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/ad-types#yt-creators-strategies-2\">YouTube's Creator Academy</a></span></p> \n<p><strong>C. TrueView in-stream, skippable video ads</strong>, which are most common ads. These are the ones you can skip after watching for five seconds. Advertisers can put it before, during (yikes!), or after the video plays, and they get paid only if you watch at least 30 seconds of the clip or to the end of the video ad -- whichever comes first.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-in-stream-skippable-video-ads.png?width=364&amp;height=266&amp;name=youtube-in-stream-skippable-video-ads.png\" alt=\"youtube-in-stream-skippable-video-ads.png\" width=\"364\" height=\"266\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://youtube.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/ad-types#yt-creators-strategies-2\">YouTube's Creator Academy</a></span></p> \n<p><strong>D. Non-skippable video ads</strong>, which are those longer, 15-or-more-second ads you see before plays and can't skip after any period of time, no matter how much you shout at your screen.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-non-skippable-video-ads-2.png?width=350&amp;name=youtube-non-skippable-video-ads-2.png\" alt=\"youtube-non-skippable-video-ads-2.png\" width=\"350\" title=\"youtube-non-skippable-video-ads-2.png\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://youtube.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/ad-types#yt-creators-strategies-2\">YouTube's Creator Academy</a></span></p> \n<p><strong>E. Midroll ads</strong>, which are ads that are only available for videos over 15 minutes long that are spaced within the video like TV commercials. You need to watch the ad before continuing through the video. How the advertiser gets paid depends on the type of ad: If the midroll is a TrueView ad, you'd have to watch 30 seconds of the end or the entire ad -- whichever is shorter. If it's a CPM-based ad, you have to watch the entire ad no matter how long it is.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-midroll-ads-1.png?width=229&amp;name=youtube-midroll-ads-1.png\" alt=\"youtube-midroll-ads-1.png\" width=\"229\" title=\"youtube-midroll-ads-1.png\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/creatoracademy/page/lesson/ad-types#yt-creators-strategies-2\">YouTube's Creator Academy</a></span></p> \n<p><strong>F. Bumper ads</strong>, which are short, non-skippable ads up to six seconds long that play before the video the viewer has selected. Bumper ads are optimized for mobile devices and must be watched in their entirety before viewers can progress to the video they want to view.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bumperad_youtube.png?noresize&amp;width=301&amp;name=bumperad_youtube.png\" alt=\"bumperad_youtube.png\" width=\"301\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>16. You can remove ads from YouTube videos (and watch videos offline) for 10 bucks a month.</h3> \n<p>Video ads are the reason you can watch videos for free on YouTube. It's a fact many of us have come to accept. But with YouTube's subscription service <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/red\">YouTube Red</a>, that doesn't necessarily have to be true anymore.</p> \n<p>For $9.99 a month, you can watch YouTube videos ... without any ads. And, in addition to ad-free videos, you can save videos on your mobile device and watch them in the background and/or offline, and you can use YouTube's Music App (on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&amp;hl=en\">Android</a>) in the background, offline, and/or on audio mode. This is not a drill.</p> \n<p>You'd think the lure of ad-free videos would have caused more of an uproar since its launch in late 2015, especially given YouTube's domination in the music space. Surprisingly, I haven't heard much noise about it. But YouTube <a href=\"http://digiday.com/platforms/watch-free-go-red-youtubes-long-term-plan-get-people-pay/\">hasn't disclosed subscriber numbers</a> (the service reportedly has around <a href=\"http://www.tubefilter.com/2016/11/03/youtube-red-subscriber-numbers/\">1.5 million subscribers</a>) so it's hard to tell how well it's doing. Either way, it's good to know about -- especially if you like collecting songs and music videos like I do, but don't like when they get broken up by ads.</p> \n<h3>17. You can use Google Trends to explore and compare popular YouTube search terms over time.</h3> \n<p>You might already use Google Trends to look at the popularity of specific search terms over time. (It can be a great marketing tool for making smarter keyword choices, for instance.) But did you know you can use it to compare the popularity of YouTube search queries, specifically?</p> \n<p>All you have to do is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\">open Google Trends</a> and type a search term into the \"Explore topics\" search bar at the top. Once that page opens up, click on \"Web Search\" to open a drop-down menu, and choose \"YouTube Search\" so it filters by YouTube searches specifically.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_googletrends.png?width=998&amp;name=youtube_googletrends.png\" alt=\"youtube_googletrends.png\" width=\"998\" title=\"youtube_googletrends.png\"></p> \n<p>You might find that, for some search terms, the search trends are very different on Google (above) than on YouTube (below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_googletrends_2.png?width=998&amp;name=youtube_googletrends_2.png\" alt=\"youtube_googletrends_2.png\" width=\"998\" title=\"youtube_googletrends_2.png\"></p> \n<h3>18. There's a 'safer' version of YouTube available for your kids.</h3> \n<p>Any parent will tell you how scary it is for their kids to theoretically have access to everything public on the internet. But for your younger kids, there are ways to curb that access and have more control of what they're watching and finding -- including a kids' version of YouTube called <a href=\"https://kids.youtube.com/\">YouTube Kids</a>.</p> \n<p>The folks at YouTube call YouTube Kids \"a safer version of YouTube.\" It's not a wide-open library of online videos like YouTube is; instead, it uses filters powered by algorithms to select videos from YouTube that are safe for kids to watch. It's also totally free, thanks to ads (<a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130561?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6130504\">which are regulated as carefully as possible</a>).</p> \n<p>You can either turn the search feature on or off, depending on whether you're cool with your kids searching for videos themselves -- or if you'd rather limit them to a certain set of videos selected by the app, along with those the app recommends based on what they’ve watched already. You can set a timer to limit how much time a child spends on the app, which is music to many parents' ears.</p> \n<p>The algorithm is darn good -- remember, Google is YouTube's parent company -- but, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130561?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6130504\">as it warns in its parents' guide,</a> \"no algorithm is perfect.\"</p> \n<h3>19. You can now clear your YouTube History.</h3> \n<p>You might eventually want to delete items from your YouTube search or watch history. YouTube lets you completely clear your history, pause your history so it stops recording what you search for and watch from that point forward, or go through your history and delete certain videos.</p> \n<p><strong>To delete your history on your desktop or mobile device:</strong> Navigate to the \"Watch History\" menu. Here's where it lives on your desktop browser homepage and in your mobile app, respectively:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_history.png?width=730&amp;height=183&amp;name=youtube_history.png\" alt=\"youtube_history.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"183\"></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_library.png?width=320&amp;name=youtube_library.png\" alt=\"youtube_library.png\" width=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_history_mobile.png?width=320&amp;name=youtube_history_mobile.png\" alt=\"youtube_history_mobile.png\" width=\"320\" title=\"youtube_history_mobile.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>From there, you can \"clear all watch history\" (permanently delete the record of everything you've watched), \"pause watch history\" (stop recording the videos you watch going forward), or individually remove videos from your history by tapping the X or ellipses next to videos. Here's what it looks like on desktop and on mobile, below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_features_clear_watch_history.png?width=555&amp;height=232&amp;name=youtube_features_clear_watch_history.png\" alt=\"youtube_features_clear_watch_history.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"232\"></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube_delete_history_mobile.png?width=320&amp;name=youtube_delete_history_mobile.png\" alt=\"youtube_delete_history_mobile.png\" width=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>YouTube published a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?source=gsearch&amp;hl=en\">Help article</a> if you need more instruction for deleting items from your YouTube watch history, too.</p> \n<h3>20. You can learn about YouTube's copyrights terms from a cast of ridiculous puppets.</h3> \n<p>Made it this far? Here's a little reward: YouTube's \"Copyrights Basics\" FAQ page, which is, fittingly a YouTube video -- and features a pretty colorful cast of characters. It's actually super informative, and it looks like YouTube's video team had a lot of fun making it.</p> \n<p>My favorite line is probably, \"You know there are links on this webpage, right? You don't have to watch this.\" Although the chorus of gorilla puppets was pretty great, too.</p> \n<p>Enjoy.</p>  \n<div> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 669px; max-height: 376px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.20%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQVHWsTHcoc\" width=\"669\" height=\"376\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>  \n<p>We hope we've opened your eyes to some of the more awesome YouTube hacks, tips, and features out there that you may not have known about.

Right","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cover-letter-examples","description":"<p>Let’s face it: A job search is, typically, anything but fun.</p> \n<p>It’s almost as if it carries its own five stages of grief. At first, there’s denial of its demoralizing nature. Then comes the anger over either radio silence or rejection from prospective employers. Of course, there’s bargaining -- “I promise to never complain about work again, if I can find a new job!”</p>  \n<p>That’s often followed by depression, and the idea that one is simply just unhireable. Then, there’s acceptance: “This is awful, but I have to keep trying, anyway.”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But we have good news. It <em>is</em> possible to have a little fun with your job search -- and maybe even make yourself a better candidate in the process. The magic, it turns out, could be in your cover letter.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It may be true that only <a href=\"https://www.jobvite.com/jobvite-news-and-reports/2017-job-seeker-nation-survey-finding-fault-lines-american-workforce/\">26% of recruiters have deemed cover letters important</a>, but that doesn't mean yours has to contribute to that statistic. In fact, it might be that cover letters are deemed insignificant because so few of them stand out. Here's an opportunity for you to exercise your creativity at the earliest stage of the recruitment process.</p> \n<p>Personalization, after all, goes beyond replacing the title and company name in each letter you send to recruiters.</p> \n<p>What does that look like in practice, and how can you make your cover letter stand out? We found six examples from job seekers who decided to do things a bit differently.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Note: Some of these cover letters contain real company names and NSFW language that we've covered up.</em></p> \n<h2>Best Cover Letter Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. The Cover Letter That Explains 'Why,' Not Just 'How'</h3> \n<p>We’ve already covered the importance of addressing <i>how</i> you’ll best execute a certain role in your cover letter. But there’s another question you might want to answer: Why the heck do you want to work here?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples\">The Muse</a>, a career guidance site, says that it’s often best to lead with the why -- especially if it makes a good story. We advise against blathering on and on, but a brief tale that illuminates your desire to work for that particular employer can really make you stand out.</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Example.png?width=524&amp;name=Why%20Example.png\" alt=\"Why Example.png\" width=\"524\" title=\"Why Example.png\" style=\"width: 524px;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples\">The Muse</a></span> \n<p>Here’s another instance of the power of personalization. The author of this cover letter clearly has a passion for this prospective employer -- the Chicago Cubs -- and if she’s lying about it, well, that probably would eventually be revealed in an interview.</p> \n<p>Make sure your story is nonfiction, and relatable according to each job. While we love a good tale of childhood baseball games, an introduction like this one probably wouldn’t be fitting in a cover letter for, say, a software company. But a story of how the hours you spent playing with DOS games as a kid led to your passion for coding? Sure, we’d find that fitting.</p> \n<p>If you’re really passionate about a particular job opening, think about where that deep interest is rooted. Then, tell your hiring manager about it in a few sentences.</p> \n<h3>2. The 'We're Meant for Each Other' Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>This cover letter example is a special one because it was submitted to us here at HubSpot. What does the letter do well? It makes a connection with us before we've even met the letter's author.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/we're%20meant%20for%20each%20other%20cover%20letter%20example%20(1).png\" alt=\"We're meant for each other cover letter submitted to HubSpot\"></p> \n<p>\"Content Marketing Certified\" indicates the applicant has taken the content marketing certification course in our HubSpot Academy (you can <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training\">take the same course here</a>). Our \"records\" indicate he/she did indeed give an interview with us before -- <em>and</em> was a HubSpot customer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The cover letter sang references to a relationship we didn't even know we had with the candidate.</p> \n<p>The letter ends with a charming pitch for why, despite him/her not getting hired previously, our interests complement each other this time around.</p> \n<p>(Yes, the applicant was hired).&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. The Cover Letter with H.E.A.R.T.</h3> \n<p>HubSpot has a lot of H.E.A.R.T. -- Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent. Our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx?_ga=2.257739915.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477\">Culture Code</a> is the foundation of the company's culture, the driving force behind our mission to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/our-story?_ga=2.257739915.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477\">help millions grow better</a>, and serves as the scaffolding for our hiring practices. Recruiters at HubSpot look for applicants that demonstrate how they embody the Culture Code and job description, paying extra attention to cover letters that are <i>super</i> custom to HubSpot.</p> \n<p>In another HubSpot submission, a HubSpot applicant writes about how she found out about HubSpot, why she likes the company, and how her professional experience aligns with H.E.A.R.T.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Best-cover-letter-example.jpg?width=600&amp;name=Best-cover-letter-example.jpg\" alt=\"Best-cover-letter-example\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>HubSpot's recruiting team was impressed with her dedication to the company and how she went beyond what was asked for by link her portfolio in her closing paragraph.</p> \n<h2>Short Cover Letter Examples</h2> \n<h3>4. The Short-and-Sweet Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>In 2009, David Silverman penned an article for <i>Harvard Business Review</i> titled, “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/06/the-best-cover-letter\">The Best Cover Letter I Ever Received.</a>” That letter contained three complete sentences, as follows:</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/short-and-sweet.png?width=680&amp;name=short-and-sweet.png\" alt=\"Short and sweet cover letter example\" width=\"680\" title=\"short-and-sweet.png\" style=\"width: 680px;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/06/the-best-cover-letter\">Harvard Business Review</a></span> \n<p>One might argue that this particular letter is less than outstanding. It’s brief, to say the least, and the author doesn’t go into a ton of detail about what makes him or her qualified for the job in question. But that’s what Silverman likes about it -- the fact that the applicant only included the pieces of information that would matter the most to the recipient.</p> \n<p>“The writer of this letter took the time to think through what would be relevant to me,” writes Silverman. “Instead of scattering lots of facts in hopes that one was relevant, the candidate offered up an opinion as to which experiences I should focus on.”</p> \n<p>When you apply for a job, start by determining two things:</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who might oversee the role -- that’s often included in the description, under “reports to.” Address your letter to that individual.</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure out what problems this role is meant to solve for that person. Then, concisely phrase in your cover letter how and why your experience can and will resolve those problems.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The key here is research -- by looking into who you’ll be reporting to and learning more about that person’s leadership style, you’ll be better prepared to tailor your cover letter to focus on how you provide solutions for her. Not sure how to learn more about a leader’s personality? Check out any content she shares on social media, or use <a href=\"https://growthbot.org/\">Growthbot’s</a> Personality Profile feature.</p> \n<p>Insert incredible compelling writing here</p> \n<h3>5. The Bare Bones Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>In today's job market, cover letters aren't always necessary. Even though many recruiters won't ask for or even read them, cover letters can still be effective and convey personality to a reader. Writing a strong cover letter can help you better convey your interest in the position and company.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This template from <a href=\"https://www.thebalancecareers.com/best-cover-letters-a-z-list-of-examples-2060172\">The Balance Careers</a> puts together the essential components of a short cover letter: excitement about the position, your qualifications, and a call-to-action for the recruiter to follow up with you. Combining these central aspects in a well-written, compelling narrative will go a long way in convincing readers to hire you.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=492&amp;name=best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg\" alt=\"best short cover letter example\" width=\"492\" style=\"width: 492px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.thebalancecareers.com/best-cover-letters-a-z-list-of-examples-2060172\">The Balance Careers</a></span></p> \n<h2>Creative Cover Letter Examples</h2> \n<h3>6. The Brutally Honest Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>Then, there are the occasions when your future boss might appreciate honesty -- in its purest form. Livestream CEO Jesse Hertzberg, by his own admission, is one of those people, which might be why he called this example “<a href=\"http://titleneeded.com/blog/the-best-cover-letter\">the best cover letter</a>” (which he received while he was with Squarespace):</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png?width=562&amp;height=405&amp;name=brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png\" width=\"562\" height=\"405\" style=\"width: 562px;\" alt=\"Brutally honest cover letter example\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://titleneeded.com/blog/the-best-cover-letter\">Title Needed</a></span> \n<p>As Hertzberg says in the blog post elaborating on this excerpt -- it’s not appropriate for every job or company. But if you happen to be sure that the corporate culture of this prospective employer gets a kick out of a complete lack of filter, then there’s a chance that the hiring manager might appreciate your candor.</p> \n<p>“Remember that I'm reading these all day long,” Hertzberg writes. “You need to quickly convince me I should keep reading. You need to stand out.”</p> \n<h3>7. The Straw (Wo)man Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>When I was in the throes of my own job search and reached one of the later stages, a friend said to me, “For the next job you apply for, you should just submit a picture of yourself a stick figure that somehow represents you working there.”</p> \n<p>Et voilà:</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg?width=432&amp;name=AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg\" alt=\"Funny illustration cover letter by Amanda Zantal-Wiener\" width=\"432\" title=\"AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg\" style=\"width: 432px;\"> \n<p>I never did end up working for the recipient of this particular piece of art, but it did result in an interview. Again, be careful where you send a cover letter like this one -- if it doesn’t match the company’s culture, it might be interpreted as you not taking the opportunity seriously.</p> \n<p>Be sure to pair it with a little bit of explanatory text, too. For example, when I submitted this picture-as-a-cover letter, I also wrote, “Perhaps I took the ‘sense of humor’ alluded to in your job description a bit too seriously.”</p> \n<h3>8. The Overconfident Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>I’ll admit that I considered leaving out this example. It’s rife with profanity, vanity, and arrogance. But maybe, in some settings, that’s the right way to do a cover letter.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/epic-cover-letter_n_865569.html\"><i>Huffington Post</i></a> published this note as an example of how to “get noticed” and “get hired for your dream job”:</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=479&amp;height=647&amp;name=epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg\" width=\"479\" height=\"647\" style=\"width: 479px;\" alt=\"Overconfident cover letter example\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/epic-cover-letter_n_865569.html\">Huffington Post</a></span> \n<p>Here’s the thing: if the Aviary cited in this letter is the same Aviary I researched upon discovering it, then, well, I’m not sure this tone was the best approach. I read the company’s blog and looked at the careers site, and neither one indicates that the culture encourages this -- or lowercasing proper nouns like \"Google,\" for which I personally cannot forgive the applicant ...</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/adobe-acquires-aviary/\">Aviary was acquired by Adobe in 2014</a>, and this letter was written in 2011. So while it’s possible that the brand was a bit more relaxed at that time, we wouldn’t suggest submitting a letter with that tone to the company today. That’s not to say it would go unappreciated elsewhere -- <a href=\"https://velocitypartners.com/blog/how-to-use-swear-words-in-your-content-marketing/\">Doug Kessler</a> frequently discusses the marketers and brands that value colorful language, for example.</p> \n<p>The point is, this example further illustrates the importance of research. Make sure you understand the culture of the company to which you’re applying before you send a completely unfiltered cover letter -- if you don’t, there’s a good chance it’ll completely miss the mark.</p> \n<h3>9. The Interactive Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>When designer Rachel McBee applied for a job with the Denver Broncos, she didn’t just write a personalized cover letter -- she designed an entire digital, interactive microsite:</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.pondertart.com/broncos/\">Rachel McBee</a></span> \n<p>This cover letter -- if you can even call it that -- checks off all of the boxes we’ve discussed here in a remarkable way. It concisely addresses and organizes what many hiring managers hope to see in any cover letter: how her skills lend themselves to the role, why she wants the job, and how to contact her.</p> \n<p>She even includes a “traditional” body of text at the bottom, with a form that allows the reader to easily get in touch with her.</p> \n<h2>Take Cover</h2> \n<p>We’d like to add a sixth stage to the job search: experimentation.</p> \n<p>In today’s competitive landscape, it’s so easy to feel defeated, less-than-good-enough, or like giving up your job search. But don’t let the process become so monotonous. Have fun discovering the qualitative data we’ve discussed here -- then, have even more by getting creative with your cover letter composition.</p> \n<p>We certainly can’t guarantee that every prospective employer will respond positively -- or at all -- to even the most unique, compelling cover letter. But the one that’s right for you will. That’s why it’s important <i>not to copy these examples</i>. That defeats the purpose of personalization.</p> \n<p>So get creative. And, by the way -- <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/jobs\">we’re hiring</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-cover-letter-examples&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:17:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8f8125049e2a4b3468819609fce2a3d0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Amanda Zantal-Wiener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Example.png?width=524&name=Why%20Example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn90@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-59-893_fd565b67afa643c0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/we're%20meant%20for%20each%20other%20cover%20letter%20example%20(1).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn34@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-54-01-874_04ff5cbdf949c997.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Best-cover-letter-example.jpg?width=600&name=Best-cover-letter-example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-49-275_3a6d7ba50abfe57b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/short-and-sweet.png?width=680&name=short-and-sweet.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn45@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-12-591_4a5d532e1e26a8e7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=492&name=best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-50-552_2ae1e38a1de29742.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png?width=562&height=405&name=brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-52-536_e3409e745526062a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg?width=432&name=AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-04-031_ab9d8444aad84010.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=479&height=647&name=epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn65@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-54-07-479_2bc227eb48d9f7f0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-cover-letter-examples&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-58-887_7eb5429d663a4acc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624891},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"The 12 Best Graphic Design Portfolios We've Ever Seen, & How to Start Your Own","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/graphic-design-portfolio","description":"<p>Whether you're a full-time graphic designer or simply someone who's interested in dabbling in design as a side project in her free time, it's critical you create a sleek graphic design portfolio to showcase your work to potential clients.</p> \n<p>A graphic design portfolio is typically the only element a client needs to see when choosing a graphic designer -- which means a portfolio is vital for proving your skill as a designer.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a graphic design portfolio, much like a resume, provides necessary contact information, and any case studies you care to include from past employers.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Simply put, a graphic design portfolio can establish your legitimacy as a designer worth hiring.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>With all that said, you're probably thinking -- <em>gee, thanks, no pressure or anything. </em></p> \n<p>Fortunately, we've cultivated a list of 12 impressive graphic design portfolios, followed by instructions on how you can create your own.

Curate your best work, and show a wide breadth of skill.</h3> \n<p>Lindsay Burke, a HubSpot Product Designer, emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to curating a graphic design portfolio. She says, \"I recommend selecting your strongest projects and making these the primary focus of your portfolio website.\"</p> \n<p>Ideally, your portfolio will feature your sharpest, most impressive 10-20 designs -- undoubtedly, someone pursuing your portfolio won't have the time to look at more, and if your first couple projects are impressive enough, they shouldn't need to. However, it's equally critical you show potential clients your versatility. If you've dabbled in logo design as well as video animation, it's good to include both kinds of projects in your portfolio.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose the right platform to showcase your work.</h3> \n<p>Investing in a quality website with a custom domain URL will pay-off in the long run by demonstrating your professionalism to potential clients. Having your own website helps you organize your portfolio to suit all your business needs -- for instance, perhaps you'll include 'Projects', 'About Me', and 'Contact Me' sections, so visitors can peruse your content and then contact you without ever leaving the site.</p> \n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-builder\">7 of the Best Website Builders for 2019</a> if you need help choosing the best platform for your portfolio.</p> \n<h3>3. Include a professional case study, or client recommendations.</h3> \n<p>Lindsay Burke told me it's incredibly valuable to write out a case study to complement any website visuals -- \"Through a written case study, your site visitors can get a sense of your project's background, the problem you were aiming to solve through design, and the process you took to arrive at a final deliverable. A lot of time, effort and iteration goes into design solutions, and a written case study will help communicate your unique process.\"</p> \n<p>To cultivate a strong case study, consider including the background of the project, the problem, the process, your deliverable, and any next steps. In the process section of your case study, Burke suggests including research, experience mapping, persona development, wire-framing, sketching, usability testing, and iteration.</p> \n<p>For further inspiration, check out <a href=\"http://www.lindsayjoburke.com/#/school-lunch-application/\">one of the case studies</a> Lindsay Burke uses for her personal website.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it will impress future clients if you can include recommendations from prior employers, which allows you to demonstrate a level of professionalism.</p> \n<h3>4. Integrate your personality.</h3> \n<p>As the examples above indicate, each portfolio is drastically different depending on the artist's unique style. Someone checking out Tobias van Schneider's portfolio will expect something vastly different than someone looking at Ling K's site. Ensure your portfolio -- including layout, background, and website title -- reflect who <em>you </em>are as a designer.</p> \n<h3>5. Describe the creative process.</h3> \n<p>Each designer has a unique process when working with clients -- and the sooner a potential client can learn about your process, the better. It's important you include context, so visitors can get a sense for how you handle challenges, and how your designs solve real-world problems.</p> \n<p>Plus, including a description of your creative process can help a potential client determine whether you're capable of handling the scope of their project. For instance, they might be unsure of your ability to handle graphic designs for mobile until they read how you single-handedly brainstormed and created the designs for another client's mobile site. In this case, context is critical.</p> \n<h3>6. Show non-client work, or side projects.</h3> \n<p>Amanda Chong, a HubSpot Designer, says, \"side projects are a great way to demonstrate your will to take initiative and your ability to balance multiple things at once. They're also a great way to show some of the more experimental, creative ideas that you might not be able to show through your day-to-day work.\"</p> \n<p>If you're just starting out, it's acceptable to include side projects or non-client work so potential customers can get a sense for your ability and style. Consider incorporating school work, a logo you designed for your aunt's company, or an internal design you created for your current company -- ideally, your designs will negate any concerns potential clients have over your lack of career experience.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Ideas for graphic design portfolio projects</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Reach out to local businesses or start-ups and ask if they need help with a marketing campaign or packaging materials.</li> \n  <li>Create content for your own personal brand, and ensure that your content is cohesive across all your personal marketing materials.</li> \n  <li>Implement a mock website redesign for a brand you love.</li> \n  <li>Put together a creative brief for a fake website, and create graphic design materials for the fictitious company.</li> \n  <li>Design a logo for a brand you love.</li> \n  <li>Create a stock theme for WordPress.</li> \n  <li>Participate in a design challenge.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Reach out to local businesses or start-ups and ask if they need help with a marketing campaign or packaging materials.</h3> \n<p>One of the easiest ways to begin building your client base is by reaching out to non-profits or local businesses in your area. Consider implementing mock-ups or sketches in advance, so you can give these businesses a sense for your skill and vision. Perhaps you think a local restaurant needs a new menu logo, or want to help a gift shop with their online marketing materials. Ideally, in exchange for your services, these businesses will offer to leave a testimonial on your portfolio.</p> \n<h3>2. Create content for your own personal brand, and ensure that your content is cohesive across all your personal marketing materials.</h3> \n<p>Take the time to ensure your own marketing materials are cohesive and sleek. Create a unique design for your website, and implement that same design or logo across various materials, including your business card and resume. A client is more likely to work with you if they can see the type of high-quality work you're able to create for yourself.</p> \n<h3>3. Implement a mock website redesign for a brand you love.</h3> \n<p>If you're still waiting for the day LuLuLemon gives you a call to redesign their website, well … why wait? Consider creating a complete website redesign for a well-known brand to demonstrate your skills to future clients. This is a well-known strategy already implemented by plenty of designers -- just take a look at some of the impressive Behance mock-ups for designers like <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/57746935/Michael-Kors-Website-Redesign-concept\">Michael Kors</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Amanda Chong told me, \"If you're creating mockups for established brands to use as part of your portfolio, it's important to pair this with a case study or description of the process that helped you arrive at your proposed design. Talk about what you think wasn't working with the existing design, some of the constraints that you think the designers were working with, and why you made the decisions that you did.\"</p> \n<p>Chong added, \"Mockups are great at showing your visual design skills, but don't necessarily demonstrate your ability to work in a real-world context, so you'll want to take the time to explain how you would have approached it in a true business setting.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Put together a creative brief for a fake website, and create graphic design materials for the fictitious company.</h3> \n<p>If your designs are impressive enough, potential clients won't necessarily care whether you created them for a fictitious company -- and, in fact, they could be impressed with your innovativeness and creativity. Consider demonstrating your skills by putting together a creative brief for a fake company, complete with wireframes and sketches. In due time, real companies will take notice.</p> \n<h3>5. Design a logo for a brand you love.</h3> \n<p>Stick to the type of content you enjoy designing. If you're particularly adept at creating logos, and are often inspired by the logos used by real brands, consider designing an alternative logo for a brand you like. Just take a look at some of these inspiring <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/415115/uber-logo-design/\">potential Uber logos</a> -- while they ultimately weren't used by Uber, they're nonetheless good examples of the designers' skills.</p> \n<h3>6. Create a stock theme for WordPress.</h3> \n<p>WordPress, a popular content management system, allows users to develop stock themes for WP -- best of all, if your theme is approved, you can sell it as a premium theme for extra cash. Begin by studying WordPress's most popular themes, and considering how you can create an impressive alternative. Take a look at <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/\">WordPress's Theme Review Requirements</a> to learn more.</p> \n<h3>7. Participate in a design challenge.</h3> \n<p>To get inspired, practice your skills, or interact with other designers in a community and build your portfolio at the same time, you might consider participating in a design challenge. Design challenges can also help you uncover skills you didn't know you had by forcing you to step outside your design comfort-zone. There are various daily, weekly, or monthly challenges which will send you prompts on things to design -- for instance, try checking out <a href=\"https://www.dailyui.co/\">Daily UI Design Challenge</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Graphic design portfolio tips</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Show your versatility.</li> \n  <li>Quality over quantity -- display your best work.</li> \n  <li>Include case studies.</li> \n  <li>Make it clean and easy-to-navigate.</li> \n  <li>Prominently display contact information.</li> \n  <li>Display your unique personality.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgraphic-design-portfolio&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important;

That’s okay — I would, too.</p> \n<p>Marketing is a seemingly simple concept on the surface, but it becomes more complex as you break it down. What do marketers do every day? How has technology expanded the marketing field? How do you land a marketing role, and how do you excel within one? Can you switch between marketing fields?</p> \n<p>Let me be the first to tell you that marketing is <i>fun</i>. Marketing a company is essentially grabbing a bullhorn and saying, “Hey! We love this company, and here’s why you should, too!” Marketing is also an incredibly dynamic, diverse field that offers positions for people of all strengths. Whether you’re equipped with creative ability or analytical prowess, marketing’s got a spot for you.</p> \n<p>In this article, we’ll break down what marketers do, how you can get into the marketing field, and the different marketing jobs that are available in today’s economy. By the end, you’ll be able to map out your budding marketing career and pinpoint your goals. Let’s get started!</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marketing\">Merriam-Webster</a>, marketing is <i>“the process or technique of promoting, selling, and distributing a product or service</i>.<i>”</i> But the job involves much, much more than that.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/marketing-habits\">day-to-day activities</a> of a marketer depend on what they’re marketing, whom they’re targeting, and what platforms they use to promote products or services. There are too many marketing roles and functions to provide a single definition applicable to everyone in this field.</p> \n<p>Before we dive into the various positions you can find within a marketing department, let’s discuss tools and education necessary to become a marketer.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>What You Need to Be a Marketer</h3> \n<p>There’s not a single, definitive path to <i>any</i> job field. Marketing is comprised of people with all kinds of backgrounds — journalism, psychology, and more. I’ve mapped out a career path as it’s the most straightforward way to jump into a marketing job. Later in this article, I’ll dive into how to get a marketing job.</p> \n<h4>Education</h4> \n<p>If you’re serious about a long-term marketing career primed for growth and variety, a bachelor’s degree is the way to go. Four-year programs teach you the skills and competencies needed to join and excel in the competitive, fast-paced landscape that is the marketing world, including public speaking, creative problem-solving, logistics, sales, and analytics.</p> \n<p>The following degree programs can lead to a career in marketing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Marketing</li> \n <li>Management</li> \n <li>Business</li> \n <li>Economics</li> \n <li>Psychology</li> \n <li>Communications</li> \n <li>Public Relations</li> \n <li>Journalism</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<p>Nowadays, it doesn’t matter as much what you major in as it does <a href=\"http://college.usatoday.com/2014/11/12/10-top-u-s-schools-for-a-major-in-marketing/\">where you go to school</a> or what you get involved in. Organizations like the <a href=\"https://www.ama.org/Pages/default.aspx\">American Marketing Association</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nasp.com/\">National Association of Sales Professionals</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.pse.org/\">Pi Sigma Epsilon</a> (a co-ed marketing fraternity) can help you get connected outside the classroom and off-campus.</p> \n<p>Some marketers choose to extend (or return to) their schooling by pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or graduate degree in marketing. Both programs offer in-depth studies of marketing, but they differ in education specifics and structure. MBA programs focus on the humanity of business, such as people management, organizational behavior, and leadership. Graduate marketing programs study consumer behavior, changes in the domestic and international marketplace, and growing digital trends.</p> \n<p>These programs can be combined, of course, but their cost and completion time can be an issue for most students. While we can’t tell you if graduate school is the right choice for you, we can encourage you to research your options for career success. Here’s a great <a href=\"https://www.princetonreview.com/business-school-advice/is-an-mba-right-for-you-quiz\">quiz by The Princeton Review</a> to help you better understand if an MBA or master’s program is for you.</p> \n<h4>Internships and Co-ops</h4> \n<p>While a degree (or three) may not be in the cards for you, an internship or co-op most certainly should. There’s no better education than real-life experience, and internships allow you to learn on the go while you’re still learning in the classroom.</p> \n<p>Marketing internships are valuable because they help you determine what kind of marketing you want to do. Do you like the creative side of marketing, or do you like working with numbers and analytics? Does promoting a single product excite you, or would you prefer to work on overall brand awareness? Marketing departments are made up of lots of moving parts, and internships and co-ops help you determine exactly which projects and promotions you’d like to join.</p> \n<p>Lastly, internships are valuable currency in today’s job market. Think about it: Thousands of students graduate each year and enter the workforce. That’s not even considering how many workers are changing their minds and careers to pursuing marketing jobs. With some real-life experience under your belt, you automatically become a highly desirable candidate to employers. Some internships can lead to full-time jobs, too!</p> \n<p>Many educational institutions offer internships through their business or communications departments, so if you’re still in college, start there. Universities worldwide hold valuable relationships with local businesses that will hire students while still in school.</p> \n<p>If going through your college or university isn’t an option, sites like <a href=\"https://www.wayup.com/\">WayUp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.internships.com/\">Internships.com</a> can help you find open positions. <a href=\"https://www.idealist.org/\">Idealist</a> is an internship site that focuses on non-profit roles, and <a href=\"https://www.globalexperiences.com/\">Global Experiences</a> helps you find international opportunities. And, of course, you can always find open internships through <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/\">Indeed</a>.</p> \n<h4>Skills and Aptitudes</h4> \n<p>Surgeons possess incredible patience and stability, psychologists are fantastic listeners, and chefs have an excellent memory. Like any other professional role, great marketers tend to carry a particular set of skills. These can be skills you’re born with or skills you develop and fine-tune through schooling and real-life practice.</p> \n<p>Either way, the following skills and aptitudes are typically required to excel in any marketing role:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Creativity.</strong> Whether you’re writing a business plan or a campaign brief, being able to creatively spell out your vision is a must in the marketing field. In today’s world, grabbing consumers’ attention isn’t very easy. Marketers have to constantly think up new ways to attract their audience and entice them to make a purchase — great marketers are creative.</li> \n <li><strong>Problem-solving.</strong> Imagine the conundrum marketers faced when DVR was released and commercials became futile. What about the overwhelming switch to mobile versus desktop? These trends in the marketplace forever changed the way businesses sold to us, and marketers were on the front lines of those shifts, huddling and figuring out to how to solve new problems that came their way. Great marketers are problem-solvers.</li> \n <li><strong>Passion for numbers.</strong> Even the most right-brained marketers have a passion for numbers and ROI. How else do companies know that their promotional efforts are working? Whether they’re tracking retweets, click-throughs, or video views, marketers live and breathe metrics. Great marketers are analytical so they can prove the value of their work.</li> \n <li><strong>Curiosity. </strong>The marketing landscape is ever-changing, and opportunities arise every day for businesses to promote their products in new and exciting ways. But marketers wouldn’t be able to seize these opportunities if they don’t continually ask, “What if?” Great marketers stay curious and are lifelong learners.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that you know what’s recommended (if not required) to thrive in a marketing role, let’s take a look at the job market for <i>marketers</i>. How many people are looking for marketing jobs, and what companies are looking for them? Is there room for growth and innovation?</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>The Marketing Job Market</h2> \n<a></a> \n<a></a> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/marketing-careers\">According to Monster</a>, marketing jobs are expected to grow 8% from 2018 to 2028 — a faster rate than average for all other jobs, and likely not stopping anytime soon.</p> \n<p>Marketing and promotional campaigns are essential to every company, regardless of industry, as organizations seek to grow and maintain their market share.</p> \n<p>That’s why marketing jobs are available at all kinds of organizations&nbsp;<span>— large firms, startups, small businesses, and non-profits. But there are cities that have more opportunities than others, mostly due to size and population.

But what are these specific opportunities, you ask? Below we’ll break down the various marketing jobs and marketing career paths available.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Jobs and Careers</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Any given marketing department is made up of a variety of positions, projects, and goals. The difference between these roles can be minute or major — it all depends on what medium they’re working with, what they’re promoting, and who they’re promoting to.</p> \n<h3>Digital Marketing</h3> \n<p>Digital marketing refers to marketing through digital channels like search engines, websites, email, and mobile apps. In the last 30 years, the rise of the internet, smartphones, and big data has completely changed the way companies market and promote their products and services … and, in turn, created many new marketing careers.</p> \n<h4>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) / Search Engine Marketing (SEM) Specialist</h4> \n<p>Search engine optimization refers to organically optimizing web content to be indexed by search engines and easily found by your audience. Search engine marketing is paying for advertising space on said search engines. SEO, SEM, and their ever-changing trends have become such an influential part of online marketing that people are specializing in it — and companies are hiring for it, too.</p> \n<p>The responsibilities of an SEO specialist include improving the ranking of a website on a search engine results page (SERP), conducting keyword research, making technical SEO recommendations and designing the site architecture, and analyzing and applying metrics on website and keyword performance.

But that doesn’t mean it’s not a highly competitive field. With ever-changing trends and ever-changing consumers, marketers must be at the top of their game when applying to and thriving within their roles. Next, we’ll dive into how to find, apply for, and get a marketing job in your chosen field.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Get a Marketing Job</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>Getting a marketing job might be complicated, but it’s not impossible. There are a few things you can do to ensure you’re applying for the right jobs and promoting the best version of yourself in the process.</p> \n<h3>Figure out what type of role you want.</h3> \n<p>Before opening a job application, you must figure out what type of marketing job you want. As we explained above, there are plenty of marketing jobs available — and we hardly scratched the surface.</p> \n<p>Do yourself (and your potential employers) a favor and perform some self-analysis before deciding which jobs to pursue. Review the jobs we’ve described above and research others that spark your interest. Take a look at how marketing impacts your day-to-day life and see which components intrigue you.</p> \n<p>Do you find yourself gravitating towards the creative parts of marketing, or are you excited by the analytical side? Both play an important role in marketing, but the jobs for each will differ.</p> \n<p>Make a list of what you’d like to do in your role. If I were building a list of “wants,” I’d say:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>I like writing and telling stories.</li> \n <li>I like research.</li> \n <li>I like working with analytics <i>only</i> to help me create better content.</li> \n <li>I like working with a team.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Determining what kind of marketing jobs interest you will give you much more clarity in your job search and will help you decipher which specific roles best match your interests and skills.</p> \n<h3>Find jobs matching your interests.</h3> \n<p>There are a few ways to go about finding marketing jobs. First, throw your search query in Google. If you’ve decided you’d like to design marketing materials for a company, search “marketing design jobs” or “graphic design marketing jobs” and see what comes up.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Second, check out job board sites like <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/\">Indeed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.simplyhired.com/\">SimplyHired</a>. These sites aggregate available jobs and make it easy to set filters for salary, location, company size, and more. They also include suggested jobs in the search results so you can easily discover related roles.</p> \n<p>Lastly, check out available jobs on company websites. If you’ve discovered a few companies for which you’d <i>love</i> to work, go to their websites directly and see what kind of roles they have listed.</p> \n<p>Also, some roles might have different names at different companies and might not come up in common search results on job boards. For example, a “blogger” at one company might be referred to as a “content creator” at another.</p> \n<h3>Review job descriptions.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve found a few open jobs to which you’d like to apply, take a close look at the job descriptions. This is when you’ll compare your list of “likes” from earlier to the terms in the job descriptions.</p> \n<p>From my list above, I’d look for words like “writing,” “editing,” “content creation,” “research,” and more. This process will help you find the best-fit roles, which will, in turn, increase the likelihood of securing an interview —&nbsp;and the job.</p> \n<h3>Market yourself.</h3> \n<p>Outside of a job application, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cover-letter\">cover letter</a>, and interview, there are other ways to boost your chances as an applicant. As a marketing candidate, you must be able to market yourself. In fact, your “marketability” speaks volumes to companies and managers, sometimes more so than your application material.</p> \n<p>As you search for and apply to jobs, make sure your digital presence is spotless. Review your LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social channels and ensure they all promote the same message and self-image. Google your own name and make sure all results reflect positively on you.</p> \n<p>Also, depending on what role(s) you’re pursuing, consider creating a portfolio or sample of your marketing chops. If you’d like to find a position in social media, create some sample posts to include in your application. If you’re pursuing a public relations role, build a contingency plan to discuss in your interview. These steps will help you stand out from the crowd of marketing applicants and will skyrocket your chances of landing the job.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Job Resources</h2> \n<a></a> \n<p>You don’t have to pursue a marketing job on your own.

They want them quickly, and they want them to be easy to find.\n</div> \n<p>The structure users want is called taxonomy. Scientifically, a taxonomy is a classification scheme that dictates how things are organized and classified based on their characteristics.</p> \n<p>A website's taxonomy can dictate the user experience, and can also influence search engine rankings. This post will go over what a website taxonomy is, and give you the resources to create a successful organization system for their site.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Website taxonomy is also related to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-optimize-urls-for-search?_ga=2.253113353.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">URL structure</a>, which is how URLs are organized to reflect content within specific site pages. Every website domain stays the same for every URL address, but subdirectories and URL slugs change as page content gets more specific.</p> \n<p>For example, say your website’s primary domain is <em>www.samplewebsite.com</em>.</p> \n<p>Your taxonomic structure will include subdirectories within your domain that are relevant to the page’s content. So, if your samplewebsite has a ‘Contact’ or ‘Announcements’ page, the URLs would change to reflect the information displayed on each page. The URLs for these pages would be <em>www.samplewebsite.com/contact</em> and <em>www.samplewebsite.com/announcements</em>, respectively.</p> \n<h3>Why is a website taxonomy important?</h3> \n<p>A well-planned taxonomy can transform how users interact with your site, especially when your content is organized logically. If users can get to your site and find what they’re looking for, they’ll view you as a reputable source and they’ll stay longer.</p> \n<p>Websites that don’t have a specific structure tend to be difficult for people to understand. In fact, an average of <a href=\"https://www.sweor.com/firstimpressions\">38% of site visitors</a> will leave a site if it's poorly organized.</p> \n<p>A carefully crafted taxonomy is also crucial for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo?_ga=2.139817139.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">search engine optimization</a> (SEO), as a taxonomic organization is easier for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-crawler?_ga=2.139817139.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">search engine bots</a> to recognize as they analyze and index your site.</p> \n<p>Let's put all of this in context with a hypothetical website. Say you own <em>www.recipes.com</em>. Since you know that your visitors are coming to your site for specific recipes, you want to set up categories that help them find what they’re looking for as quickly as possible. If they’re looking for desserts, for example, they likely want to find those recipes through the corresponding category page, not by browsing through a list of unrelated meals.</p> \n<p>The URL for this page would be <em>www.recipes.com/desserts</em>. A user knows what they’ll find within this subcategory of recipes. For search engine bots, the URL subdirectory helps them understand what the page is about and when they should show the page in search results.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Best Practices for Creating a Website Taxonomy</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, you want both users and search bots to understand your site. You don’t want them to be bombarded with content that isn’t going to fulfill their needs. While it may seem clear cut, various factors go into creating a successful website taxonomy.</p> \n<h3>Know your audience.</h3> \n<p>Just like all types of marketing, the key to creating your taxonomy is understanding your users.</p> \n<p>You’ll want to know who they are, why they’re visiting your site, and what they want to find on your site. It’s essential to understand what their specific needs are so you can structure your content accordingly. To better understand your users, you can do things like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.201342737.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">create buyer personas</a>.</p> \n<p>Continuing with the <em>recipes.com</em> example, whoever runs the site knows that their visitors are coming because they want help with their cooking. It’s great to know this, but is there anything else they’ll want from your site? They may also want you to recommend kitchen supplies that will help them make these recipes, or recommend brands to buy ingredients from.</p> \n<p>If you take the time to get to know your future users, you can design your site accordingly.</p> \n<h3>Conduct keyword research.</h3> \n<p>When you know who your users are and what they want, you want to make sure you have the necessary information to keep them on your site.</p> \n<p>You can use your site's primary purpose to rank in search results, but it’s essential to have multiple <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.201342737.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">keywords</a> for the additional categories you’ll create within your site. These keywords should be directly related to the content that users will find on those specific pages.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you run a blog on travel tips, travel tips can be your main keyword. However, your research may show that users also associate travel tips with travel packing tips and travel insurance tips. You’ll want to use that information when creating your structure.</p> \n<h3>Be consistent.</h3> \n<p>Consistency with categories and the content within those categories makes it easier for users to understand your site. It also makes it easier for those executing your content strategy to create relevant content. For example, on the HubSpot Blog, we have four different properties: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service?_ga=2.206328723.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">Service</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales?_ga=2.206328723.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">Sales</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing?_ga=2.206328723.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">Marketing</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website?_ga=2.206328723.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">Website</a>.</p> \n<p>Blog posts are categorized based on their relationship to each property, and this organizational consistency makes it easier for visitors to find relevant information. For example, a user would know to search within <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website?_ga=2.138296496.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">blog.hubspot.com/website</a> rather than <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service?_ga=2.138296496.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">blog.hubspot.com/service</a> for a tutorial on how to use WordPress.</p> \n<p>Consistency is also important for SEO, as bots dislike poorly organized websites, and sites with jumbled and unrelated content is considered <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33748/does-google-think-your-website-is-spam.aspx?_ga=2.138296496.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">spammy</a>. Bots also recognize contextual relationships between categories and content, and they’ll learn how to index your site for specific search queries.</p> \n<h3>Keep it simple.</h3> \n<p>While there are certainly hundreds of categories and subcategories you could come up with to sort content on your site, less is more. The ideal web taxonomy is focused and straightforward.</p> \n<p>With <em>recipes.com</em>, there are so many different types of dishes that it would (and will) become overwhelming for users to sift through hundreds of different categories.</p> \n<p>Keeping it simple means creating fewer high-level categories that can house lower-level categories. You can have a high-level category page dedicated entirely to baking recipes, and the content you post within that page will be specific to baking recipes.</p> \n<p>The URL for this category would be <em>recipies.com/baking</em> rather than <em>recipes.com/pie-recipies</em> and <em>recipes.com/scone-recipies</em>. Then, if a user goes on your site to find a blueberry pie recipe, the page URL may be <em>www.recipes.com/baking/blueberrypie</em>.</p> \n<h3>Leave room for growth.</h3> \n<p>Taxonomy can, and should, change as your business scales.</p> \n<p>If you create new forms of content, you may need to shuffle categories to ensure that they still relate to each other and have room for new content.</p> \n<p>Say you’re running a blog about content marketing, but you cover the topic generally. It’s unlikely that you’ll have multiple page categories or subfolders within those pages. However, suppose you decide to hire new team members who are experts in specific types of content creation. In that case, you’ll want to create different taxonomic categories to distinguish between the different types of content.</p> \n<p>You may also realize that certain categories and subcategories aren’t as intuitive as you’ve hoped, per user feedback. Taking the time to understand what is and isn’t working for those who interact with your site is essential.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Types of Website Taxonomy</h2> \n<p>Once you know your audience and have created your keyword-relevant categories, it’s essential to decide on the taxonomic structure that works best for your site. Since taxonomy is a classification system, it may seem like the logical structure is a hierarchical one, organized by importance. However, this isn’t always the case. Let’s review the different types of website taxonomies so you can select the one that works best for your site.</p> \n<h3>Flat Taxonomy</h3> \n<p>A flat taxonomy, sometimes called unlayered taxonomy, is a simple list of top-level categories. All categories on this site carry equal weight in comparison to each other. It’s a perfect structure for smaller websites that don’t have a large amount of content.</p> \n<p>For example, a veterinarian's office likely doesn’t have many needs to fulfill. Their homepage may only have three to four categories, like ‘About Us,’ ‘Book an Appointment,’ ‘Location,’ and ‘Services.’ Users visiting the site won’t need much more than that.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-1.png?width=642&amp;name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-1.png\" alt=\"flat taxonomy website structure representational diagram\" width=\"642\" style=\"width: 642px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/prodsight/how-to-build-a-strong-tag-taxonomy-and-make-sense-of-your-feedback-f0eccb33d71f\"><em>Image Source</em></a></h3> \n<h3>&nbsp;</h3> \n<h3>Hierarchical Taxonomy</h3> \n<p>A hierarchical taxonomy is an arrangement of categories by order of importance. Larger websites typically use it, and top-level categories are broad.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-3.png?width=450&amp;name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-3.png\" alt=\"hierarchical website taxonomy model\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"450\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://slickplan.com/blog/creating-website-structures-built-last\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>Moving down a hierarchical structure means getting more specific. This allows users to quickly identify and navigate between different sections and categories. Search engines will recognize these relationships as well.</p> \n<p>For example, hubspot.com displays three main categories at the top of the page: Software, Pricing, and Resources. Each of those categories is broad and overarching. If a user mouses over them, they’re then shown more specific categories.</p> \n<p>In turn, our URLs for these categories look like this: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/?_ga=2.216495254.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">hubspot.com</a>, <a href=\"http://hubspot.com/products?_ga=2.216416022.1274343662.1602793849-2118945656.1602793849\">hubspot.com/products</a>, <a href=\"http://hubspot.com/products/marketing\">hubspot.com/products/marketing</a>, and <a href=\"http://hubspot.com/marketing/seo\">hubspot.com/marketing/seo</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that there shouldn’t be too many high-level categories or subcategories, as excessive groups can become confusing for users and SEO crawlers.</p> \n<h3>Network Taxonomy</h3> \n<p>A network taxonomy involves organizing content into associative categories. The relationships and associations between categories can be basic or arbitrary, but they should be meaningful to users.</p> \n<p>For example, a ‘Most Popular’ category within a website may contain lists of different articles covering a broad range of topics that are popular among that audience. Still, they’re all similar in the sense that they are highly rated, viewed, and visited by others.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F.png?width=457&amp;name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F.png\" alt=\"network taxonomy website structure diagram\" width=\"457\" style=\"width: 457px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\">\n <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/website-taxonomy-guidelines-tips-127706\"><em>Image Source</em></a>\n</div> \n<h3>Facet Taxonomy</h3> \n<p>A facet taxonomy is used when topics can be assigned to multiple different categories. Sites that typically use this structure allow users to find content by sorting for specific attributes. It’s also great for users who will likely arrive at certain content by different means.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-2.png?width=395&amp;name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-2.png\" alt=\"facet website taxonomy model\" width=\"395\" style=\"width: 395px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://marketingland.com/website-taxonomy-guidelines-tips-127706\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.nike.com\">Nike </a>sells a variety of different products. While there are specific categories for shoes and clothing, there are also subcategories for color, size, and price. A shoe that shows up on a search for ‘blue shoes’ may also show up on a list of cheap shoes because they’re currently on sale.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Put time into your website's taxonomy.</h2> \n<p>Creating and maintaining a successful website taxonomy that makes sense for users and search engines essential to your marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>If other elements of your site are already optimized for other SEO ranking factors, the addition of a structured taxonomy will help your site rank highly in search query results, not to mention, it’ll keep users on your site.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn more about website best practices, consider taking the HubSpot Academy <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/website-optimization\">Website Optimization</a> course!</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwebsite-taxonomy&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a08f0f2207fdee0b772a20cb0f64a2a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-1.png?width=642&name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-54-07-866_693b24010982719b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-3.png?width=450&name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn61@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-54-05-790_dd1ba0a927738e4f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F.png?width=457&name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_2/2020/10/27/16-53-59-145_8001521f9565c1de.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-2.png?width=395&name=cms%20What%20is%20a%20website%20taxonomy%3F-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-53-52-047_44abc2f2adbbd572.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwebsite-taxonomy&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_5/2020/10/27/16-54-05-924_bc490a9d46815608.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817624890},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:44","title":"Your Easy Guide to Making a YouTube Thumbnail","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-thumbnail","description":"<p>Sometimes, your YouTube thumbnail just doesn’t cut it. You could’ve uploaded the most interesting video on YouTube, but it might not get the views it deserves if you're relying on a simple freeze-frame to tell viewers what it's about.</p> \n<p>Thumbnails, the small, clickable snapshots that viewers see when they search for videos on YouTube, can be just as important as a video’s title. They preview your video and entice viewers to click through:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube%20thumbnail.png?width=494&amp;name=youtube%20thumbnail.png\" alt=\"youtube thumbnail of hubspot academy\" width=\"494\" style=\"width: 494px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Creating vibrant YouTube thumbnails can also instantly grab people’s attention -- <a href=\"https://learn.canva.com/visual-content-creation/\">the brain is programmed to respond to striking visuals</a> -- and this can help you differentiate yourself on a platform clogged with standard thumbnails all screaming for attention.</p> \n<p>Thumbnails can affect your search ranking on YouTube, too. Since your video’s click-through rate is one of the most <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robertoblake/how-bad-thumbnails-are-killing-your-youtube-channel-8d99ebfafb69\">important ranking factors in YouTube’s search algorithm</a>, especially during its first hour on the platform, an eye-catching thumbnail can make a huge difference in ranking number one for a query and not ranking at all.</p> \n<p>If your video has an ordinary or sub-par thumbnail, it won’t persuade anyone to click through. YouTube could deem the video irrelevant and won’t rank it in their search results or distribute it through the “Recommended Videos” feed.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, pulling freeze frames from your YouTube videos isn’t the only way you can create thumbnails. There are online tools, made specifically for people who might not have a ton of design experience, that can help you craft custom thumbnails -- all for free.</p> \n<p>Below, we’ll guide you through an easy five-step process for creating visually appealing YouTube thumbnails that will cut through the noise, boost your video’s click-through rate, and lift your rankings.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Visit one of the free online YouTube thumbnail makers featured below.</li> \n  <li>Upload a photo or choose one of the thumbnail makers’ templates.</li> \n  <li>Add text, clipart, or a background to your thumbnail.</li> \n  <li>Download the finished product to your computer.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>1. Visit a free online YouTube thumbnail maker.</h3> \n<p>There are seven free online YouTube thumbnail makers listed below, but we featured <a href=\"https://www.fotojet.com/features/social-media-design/youtube-thumbnail.html\">FotoJet</a> in this guide because it’s one of the only YouTube thumbnail makers that doesn’t make you sign up for a free account before you can create a thumbnail. Their robust thumbnail maker lets you customize and download your thumbnails completely for free -- no email address necessary.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%202.06.02%20PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<h3>2. Upload a photo or choose one of the thumbnail makers’ templates.</h3> \n<p>YouTube will let you upload any picture from your computer as your video’s thumbnail. But if you don’t have a vivid visual on your computer or you need some inspiration, Fotojet’s got you covered. They have over 23 free templates that can serve as your thumbnail’s foundation.</p> \n<p>To create striking a thumbnail in Fotojet, consider including a talking head. People are naturally drawn to human faces because it’s an ingrained <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-shapes-film/201311/3-reasons-why-were-drawn-faces-in-film\">survival mechanism</a> to help us quickly gauge someone’s emotions and determine if they’re a threat or friend. Research Gate also discovered that Instagram photos with faces are <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266655817_Faces_engage_us_photos_with_faces_attract_more_likes_and_comments_on_Instagram\">38% more likely to receive likes and 32% more likely to receive comments</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube%20thumbnail-1.png?width=424&amp;name=youtube%20thumbnail-1.png\" alt=\"hubspot academy youtube thumbnail of woman talking\" width=\"424\" style=\"width: 424px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Add text, clipart, or a background to your thumbnail.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve picked your picture or template, you can make your thumbnail stand out even more by adding text, clipart, or a background to it.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%203.38.15%20PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p>To further clarify your video’s subject matter, consider adding your video’s title to the thumbnail. Additionally, if your photo, graphic, or text is bright, consider placing it on top of a dark background. The color contrast will make your thumbnail pop. The same logic applies to dark objects and bright backdrops.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%204.27.45%20PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<h3>4. Download the finished product to your computer.</h3> \n<p>After you finish polishing your thumbnail, press the “Save” button at the top of the page.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-08%20at%204.29.12%20PM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p>Next, title your thumbnail and save it as a JPG or PNG. Its resolution will already match YouTube’s recommended resolution -- 1280 x 720 pixels -- so you don’t have to worry about resizing it.</p> \n<h2>7 YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2> \n<p>Along with Fotojet’s free online YouTube thumbnail maker, there are seven other thumbnail makers that can help you customize your own YouTube thumbnails.

It all starts with the \"About Us\" page.</p> \n<p>For a remarkable About page, all you need to do is figure out your company's unique identity, and then share it with the world. Easy, right? Of course not. Your \"About Us\" page is one of the most important pages on your website, and it needs to be well crafted. This profile also happens to be one of the most commonly overlooked pages, which is why you should make it stand out.</p> \n<p>The good news? It can be done. In fact, there are some companies out there with remarkable \"About Us\" pages, the elements of which you can emulate on your own website.</p> \n<p>By the end of this post, you'll be introduced to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remarkable-about-us-page-examples#about-page-examples\">The best About Us page examples</a> (and what makes them great)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remarkable-about-us-page-examples#write-about-page\">Tips on how to write your About page</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remarkable-about-us-page-examples#about-page-templates\">The best About page templates</a> (across multiple platforms)</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Best About Us Page Examples</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Yellow Leaf Hammocks</li> \n  <li>Eight Hour Day</li> \n  <li>Joe Payton</li> \n  <li>Apptopia</li> \n  <li>Moz</li> \n  <li>Aja Frost</li> \n  <li>Cultivated Wit</li> \n  <li>Kero One</li> \n  <li>Nike</li> \n  <li>Refinery29</li> \n  <li>Sara Dietschy</li> \n  <li>Marie Catribs</li> \n  <li>Marc Ensign</li> \n  <li>Bulldog Skincare</li> \n  <li>Doomtree</li> \n  <li>Bold Xchange</li> \n  <li>Ceros</li> \n  <li>Marketive</li> \n  <li>Sweet Loren's</li> \n  <li>TalEx</li> \n  <li>SkinnyDipped</li> \n  <li>LoveBug Probiotics</li> \n  <li>Brown and Coconut&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Kuno Creative</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://yellowleafhammocks.com/ourstory/\">Yellow Leaf Hammocks</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It tells us a story.</h4> \n<p>When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives, share it. The \"About Us\" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. What’s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.</p> \n<p>Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing how the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families. The company breaks down different pieces of the story into sections that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead of big chunks of text. They're clear about why they're different: \"Not a Charity,\" the page reads. And then: \"This is the basis for a brighter future, built on a hand up, not a handout.\"</p> \n<p>Every company has a story to tell, so break out your storytelling skills from that random English class you took years ago and put them to work on your \"About Us\" page. Using descriptive and emotive copy and gorgeous graphics, an \"About Us\" page with a story works harder for your business than a generic one.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/by7axLZLAo.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=by7axLZLAo.gif\" alt=\"Yellow Leaf Hammocks about us page\" title=\"by7axLZLAo.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" /></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://eighthourday.com/studio\">Eight Hour Day</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's human.</h4> \n<p>People tend to think that \"About Us\" pages have to sound formal to gain credibility and trust. But most people find it easier to trust real human beings, rather than a description that sounds like it came from an automaton. Trying to sound <em>too</em> professional on your \"About Us\" page results in stiff, “safe” copy and design -- the perfect way to make sure your company blends in with the masses.</p> \n<p>Instead, Eight Hour Day showcases the people behind the company and humanizes its brand. Introducing the founders by name and featuring the photos of them on the \"About Us\" page drives home the point that Nathan and Katie are -- as they so astutely put it -- \"two individuals with a passion for creativity -- creativity makes us happy.\"</p> \n<p>When you’re designing your \"About Us\" page,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31068/31-Fluffy-Buzzwords-Marketers-Overuse-and-Abuse.aspx\">avoid industry jargon</a> and replace it with an authentic voice -- yours -- to describe your product or service. Sure, it needs to be polished and free of errors, but it should always sound friendly and real.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/xMrVuO6EcX.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=xMrVuO6EcX.gif\" title=\"xMrVuO6EcX.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" alt=\"Eight Hour Day about us page\" /></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://josephpayton.com/about/\">Joe Payton</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Me\" Page Rocks: It's confident, creative, and easy to skim.</h4> \n<p>\"About Us\" pages might encompass the values of more than one person or entity, but they're no more important to the image of a business than your personal about page. Take Joe Payton's \"About Me\" page, below.</p> \n<p>Not only does Joe's illustrative self-portrait give him a personal brand that customers will remember, but it also demonstrates his expertise as a designer and animator. His website visitors can learn not just what he does, but <em>why</em> he does it, in an easily digestible way. Being able to express his values as a creative professional in such a well-organized page is something to be desired by anyone creating their own about page.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/joe-payton-about-me-page.png?width=690&amp;name=joe-payton-about-me-page.png\" alt=\"Joe Payton about me page\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\" /></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"http://www.apptopia.com/about\">Apptopia</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It skips the business babble.</strong></h4> \n<p>We know -- no industry jargon. If you think it makes you sound super smart on your \"About Us\" page, think again. People want and appreciate straight talk about what your business does. After all, if people can't figure out what you do, how will they know they need your product or service?</p> \n<p>So, skip the industry lingo -- that's what Apptopia does on its \"About Us\" page. The startup's simple but polished language effectively communicates the company's offering while still allowing the Average Joe to understand it.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-06%20at%202.10.03%20PM.png?width=669&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-01-06%20at%202.10.03%20PM.png\" width=\"669\" title=\"Screen Shot 2017-01-06 at 2.10.03 PM.png\" alt=\"Apptopia about us page\"><br>The moral of the story: Try to get rid of jargon on your \"About Us\" page whenever possible. Use short and punchy sentences to explain complex products and ideas in a way that isn't patronizing, but rather, is empathetic.</br></img></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://moz.com/about\">Moz</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's humble.</h4> \n<p>Instead of following the classic \"About Us\" script and writing a few paragraphs about the company's mission and origins, try something different -- there are plenty of ways to make your brand more compelling to someone who doesn't know about you.</p> \n<p>Take Moz, for example. A lot has happened since it was founded in 2004, so the company chose to share those milestones using a fun and clean design that incorporates clear headers, concise blurbs, and little graphics to break up the text.</p> \n<p>We especially love the humble references to how Moz received funding, how it switched its brand positioning -- and most importantly, how it switched back to its original model. This speaks volumes to the value honesty and humbleness can play to your customers. Don't be afraid to talk about your ups and downs; your customers will trust what you say that much more.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/moz-about-us-page.png\" alt=\"The story of Moz on its About Us page\" /></p> \n<div> \n <h3>6. <a href=\"http://www.ajafrost.com/about/\">Aja Frost</a></h3> \n <h4>Why the \"About Me\" Page Rocks: It's data-driven.</h4> \n <p>Alright, we might be biased in highlighting this professional, as Aja is our very own SEO strategist at HubSpot. Nonetheless, the ingenuity she brings to the company isn't lost on her website's \"About Me\" page.</p> \n <p>Being a data-driven professional, Aja knows her own clients as a freelance writer and strategist don't just want to see what she's written -- they want to see <em>how </em>her content has performed. With that in mind, her \"About Me\" page tells a story of her career growth, which peaks -- no pun intended -- at an impressive line graph showing the result of an SEO strategy she implemented for the HubSpot Blog. (The graph's sharp decline at September simply indicates when she stopped collecting data.)</p> \n <p>Following the impressive chart, Aja closes out her about page with a personal note on what she does in her spare time -- always a good way to humanize yourself in the eyes of your potential customers.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/aja-frost-about-me-page.jpg?width=683&amp;name=aja-frost-about-me-page.jpg\" alt=\"Aja Frost about me page\" width=\"683\" style=\"width: 683px;\" /></p> \n <h3>7. <a href=\"http://www.cultivatedwit.com/\">Cultivated Wit</a></h3> \n <h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It breaks the mold.</h4> \n <p>Yes, this post is about, well, \"About Us\" pages. But sometimes, you don't always need to wait for users to get there in order to make a statement. That's part of breaking the mold to showcase your company's personality.</p> \n <p>That's exactly what Cultivated Wit -- a creative agency and media company -- does, with both an edgy name and an incredibly fun story told through video and parallax scrolling ... right on its homepage.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/yoy42tSHd1.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=yoy42tSHd1.gif\" title=\"yoy42tSHd1.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" alt=\"Brand story of Cultivated Wit on its homepage\" /></p> \n</div> \n<p>Below is the actual \"About Us\" page, which is a gem once you get there. But it's great to see a company embrace its own brand of quirk throughout the site.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zh4fLrS0FG.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=Zh4fLrS0FG.gif\" alt=\"Cultivated Wit about us page\" title=\"Zh4fLrS0FG.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" /></p> \n<p>Even if you have a dedicated \"About Us\" page, there are plenty of ways to creatively showcase your company's personality throughout your entire website. And yeah, that's harder than filling a stock \"About Us\" template -- but it can have a significant payoff for your brand.</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.kero1.com/about/\">Kero One</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Me\" Page Rocks: It's multilingual.</h4> \n<p>Kero One is a hip-hop artist and DJ from San Francisco, and his \"About Me\" page carries a valuable lesson to personal brands who cater to more than one audience -- especially if those audiences speak different languages.</p> \n<p>Kero One's story starts at his childhood, when he was six years old and first discovered a passion for hip-hop. Knowing how old and genuine his love for the genre is adds tremendous value to his own music in the eyes of his listeners.</p> \n<p>While this entrepreneur's childhood interests help to deepen his audience, the second screenshot below helps Kero One <em>widen</em> it. His \"About Me\" page first tells his story in English, then in Japanese, then in Korean, then in Chinese. Accommodating these Southeast Asian audiences makes his brand more inclusive of all the audiences he identifies with.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kero-one-about-me-page.png?width=660&amp;name=kero-one-about-me-page.png\" alt=\"Kero One about me page\" width=\"660\" style=\"width: 660px;\" /></p> \n<p>...</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kero-one-about-me-korean.png?width=654&amp;name=kero-one-about-me-korean.png\" alt=\"kero-one-about-me-korean\" width=\"654\" style=\"width: 654px;\" /></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://about.nike.com/\">Nike</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the About Us Page Rocks: It knows its audience.</h4> \n<p>Nike might seem like a company that's too big to inspire smaller businesses. You might even wonder if Nike even still <em>has</em> an \"About Us\" page. As a matter of fact, it does, and it hasn't forgotten the company's roots.</p> \n<p>Nike began on the campus of the University of Oregon by the hand of the college's track coach, Bill Bowerman. And even though he no longer works at the company, one of his beloved quotes still brands the bottom of Nike's \"About Us\" page below: \"If you have a body, you are an athlete.\"</p> \n<p>This bold sentence, referenced by the asterisked \"Athlete\" in the words right above it, sheds important light on Nike's audience. The brand may be big today, but Nike is all about the rising stars -- who Nike depends on to, according to the rest of its \"About Us\" page, \"expand human potential.\"</p> \n<p>The takeaway for marketers? Know your audience, and make it obvious to that audience the instant they read about you on your website.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/nike-about-us-page.png\" alt=\"Nike about us page\" /></p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://corporate.r29.com/about\">Refinery29</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It tells you what's most important.</h4> \n<p>Here's another instance where any area of your website -- not just the \"About Us\" page -- is an opportunity to break the mold.</p> \n<p>Many companies add just a simple mission statement or company profile, but people often don't want to ready a wall of text explaining what you do. So, Refinery29 broke it down to convey the intangible qualities that are tough to include in a basic \"About Us\" page.</p> \n<p>Although Refinery29 does introduce its page with a description of its business, its goes out on a bang -- four bangs, to be exact. The organization is on a \"mission,\" sure, but there's also an \"essence\" of Refinery29, a \"promise\" it keeps, and a \"vibe\" it gives off.</p> \n<p>These aren't company traits you'd think to include when starting out, but they're what your customers often make gut decisions on when buying.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/refinery29-about-us-page.png\" alt=\"Refinery29 about us page\" /></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://www.saradietschy.com/\">Sara Dietschy</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Me\" Page Rocks: It has variety but still aligns with her personal brand.</h4> \n<p>This professional YouTube content creator has an eclectic collection of videos related to technology and culture, and expresses that diversity all over her \"About Me\" page.</p> \n<p>In addition to the vibrant self-portrait at the top of the page, Sara's first sentence tells you just how many people subscribe to her channel: 350,000. This is an important number to know for her potential video advertisers and collaborators who want to know how much exposure they'd get by working with her or advertising on her channel.</p> \n<p>The colored tiles lining the page -- starting with the red one, as shown below -- also do a terrific job segmenting her work by the types of projects she takes up and for whom she's done them. That Intel logo in the second photo of Sara, below, is sure to turn some visitors' heads as they're perusing her website.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sara-dietschy-about-me-page.png?width=500&amp;name=sara-dietschy-about-me-page.png\" alt=\"sara-dietschy-about-me-page\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"http://mariecatribs.com/about/\">Marie Catribs</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's unexpected.</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There's a reason why these examples are exceptional -- \"About Us\" pages aren't always the most riveting parts of a company's website. In fact, they often look like an afterthought. But even if you don't have budget for juicy graphics, video, or parallax scrolling, there are other ways to make your \"About Us\" page unexpected with the copy alone.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Marie Catrib's is a restaurant, so you might think their \"About Us\" page would be your typical \"here's how we started, here's what we believe in, and here's our food\" story. Marie Catrib's \"About Us\" page <em>does</em> tells us that -- but it does so in an unconventional way. Immediately, the user's eyes are drawn to a header that says, \"It's okay to make a mess, experiments can lead to beautiful things.\" Quite philosophical, for a place to have dinner.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But next comes the story about the owner, which starts in an unexpected way -- \"It's hard to imagine, but at one time Marie was banned from the family kitchen.\" A line like that draws in the audience, because we know it's not going to be typical.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/MS3lsE8G4R.gif?width=669&amp;name=MS3lsE8G4R.gif\" alt=\"Marie Catribs about us page\" title=\"MS3lsE8G4R.gif\" style=\"width: 669px;\" width=\"669\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, how will you use copy to really draw readers in? It's amazing what impression you can make on site visitors just by creatively telling your story with words alone.</p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://marcensign.com/about/\">Marc Ensign</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Me\" Page Rocks: It's funny but professional.</h4> \n<p>This branding expert does two things super well on his about page: He takes his work seriously, but doesn't take <em>himself </em>too seriously. Marketers know there's value to keeping a casual tone in the content they create, but in order to attract customers, you need to prove you have discipline and integrity. That's a tough balance to get right.</p> \n<p>Marc Ensign nails that balance between friendly and formal with a confident opening statement, followed by an amusing smiley photo of himself to set an inviting tone.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marc-ensign-about-me-page.png?width=656&amp;name=marc-ensign-about-me-page.png\" alt=\"marc-ensign-about-me-page\" width=\"656\" style=\"width: 656px;\" /></p> \n<h3>14. <a href=\"https://www.bulldogskincare.com/about-us#\">Bulldog Skincare</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's lovable and memorable.</h4> \n<p>What's the difference between \"average\" marketing and<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-to-lovable-marketing-campaigns\"> lovable marketing</a>? It's the difference between creating generic webpages that provide great information, but in a straightforward, black-and-white kind of way -- versus creating webpages that provide great information <em>and </em>are infused with color, personality, and stay true to a company's unique brand voice. When you create lovable marketing, you can start a movement of brand evangelists and advocates who will help you grow.</p> \n<p>Where does this fit into a company's \"About Us\" page? The folks at Bulldog, a men's skincare company that was named for the colloquial \"man's best friend\" -- a dog -- could have typed up a few paragraphs about where the brand came from and how they were one of the first in the space to redefine and eliminate stereotypes around men's grooming. But that text alone would have been a bit, well, average.</p> \n<p>Instead, the \"About Us\" page is pithy, colorful, and leads with the lovable mug of an adorable bulldog -- fitting the name and the brand. And it states the purpose of the products -- to help customers from waking up with the (admittedly adorable) wrinkly face you see when you visit Bulldog's website.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/qkiWuggGvw.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=qkiWuggGvw.gif\" alt=\"Bulldog Skin Care for Men about us page\" title=\"qkiWuggGvw.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" /></p> \n<p>Play on your own words -- it's okay to have fun and pun with your brand, as it helps to inject personality and humor into your \"About Us\" page. It primes visitors for a story in a way that makes them immediately feel something. That's how you create memorable, lovable marketing.</p> \n<h3>15. <a href=\"http://www.doomtree.net/about/\">Doomtree</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: Its shows, tells, and has a soundtrack.</h4> \n<p>One minute of video is worth 1.8 million words, <a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/a-minute-of-video-is-worth-18-million-words-according-to-forrester-research-1900666.htm\">according to Forrester Research's Dr. James McQuivey</a>. But what about audio and visual, too, all combined with a really cool story? Well, that's one way to tell your story in an engaging way -- through multimedia.</p> \n<p>Doomtree is built on a bit of an innovative concept: That a group of talented artists can each have thriving solo careers, but can still come together on a regular basis to create great music. It's not a band -- it's a crew. It's an unconventional concept with an equally interesting backstory that \"started as a mess of friends in Minneapolis, fooling around after school, trying to make music without reading the manual.\" And as soon as you arrive on Doomtree's 'About Us' page, you're greeted with big, bold photos of those friends.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mrctnYzpWz.gif?noresize&amp;width=669&amp;name=mrctnYzpWz.gif\" title=\"mrctnYzpWz.gif\" width=\"669\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"Doomtree band about us page\" /></p> \n<p>As you scroll down, users are treated to even more interaction with the crew's tracks and music videos. That makes sense, because it gives visitors an instant sample of Doomtree's product. What's more, the entire \"About Us\" page is responsive, including the video. That's important -- not only because it offers site visitors a great mobile experience, but also for Google search ranking -- especially now that such <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mobile-website-search-optimization-tips\">mobile usage has surpassed desktop</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nMlKKcFXIy.gif?noresize&amp;width=462&amp;name=nMlKKcFXIy.gif\" title=\"nMlKKcFXIy.gif\" width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Doomtree band mobile page\" /></p> \n<h3>16. <a href=\"https://boldxchange.com/our-story/\">Bold Xchange</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's sleek and focuses on the company's mission.</h4> \n<p>Bold Xchange's About Us page starts with a story of the co-founder's initial inspiration for starting the company: \"That summer, the two opened up to friends and family about doing what feels right despite obstacles that tell you to do otherwise.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sound familiar? The introduction immediately jumped out at me because of how relatable it felt.</p> \n<p>The About Us page continues in story-format and is separated into three sections: \"be bold\", \"stay bold\", and \"share bold\". Along with a moving origin story, the page has a sleek design, with a red-and-black color scheme and authentic images to support each of the three sections.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What I like best about this About Us page is that it doesn't focus on what the company <em>sells</em> — instead, it uses the space to showcase the company's ultimate mission. When creating your own About Us page, consider how you might draw visitors in with an inspiring message upfront.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bold%20x%20change%20about%20us%20page.png?width=2400&amp;name=bold%20x%20change%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"bold x change about us page\" width=\"2400\" style=\"width: 2400px;\" /></p> \n<h3>17. <a href=\"https://www.ceros.com/about/meet-the-team/\">Ceros</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's interactive and funny.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Ceros' About Us page is interactive and engaging. As you scroll, the text slowly moves up the page, with bold — and humorous — statistics, like \"4 beers on tap\". Additionally, Ceros' uses images of their impressive, unique office space to further personalize the page.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Best of all, Ceros' keeps the text on the page short-and-sweet, with powerful statements like \"We exist to unlock creativity\". The Culture section further demonstrates Ceros' playful brand voice, with core values like \"We wear our chicken suits\".</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ceros%20about%20us%20page.gif\" alt=\"ceros about us page\" /></p> \n<h3>18. <a href=\"https://marketive.io/about-us/\">Marketive</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's compelling, with fun scrollable features.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Rarely have I seen a more powerful opening statement than the one Marketive uses in their About Us page: \"Got a solid product? We tell your target audience that you exist.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, Marketive's About Us page displays original designs rather than photos to support the text, and the page is simply fun to scroll through. Plus, I appreciated Marketive's layout — starting with what they do, moving into which types of industries they help, and ending with the company's earlier milestones.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The interactive milestone calendar at the bottom is especially impressive. It authentically represents some humble beginnings (including two unsuccessful startups that inspired present-day Marketive), and features a fun scroll element that highlights various dates throughout the calendar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketive%20about%20us%20page.png?width=580&amp;name=marketive%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"marketive about us page\" width=\"580\" style=\"width: 580px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>19. <a href=\"https://sweetlorens.com/our-story/\">Sweet Loren's</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's playful and reflects the brand's personality.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Start-to-finish, Sweet Loren's About Us page is playful, engaging, and colorful. The page starts with a 60-second video, and even incorporates cookie dough-scooping gifs. As you scroll, you'll move through some of Sweet Loren's impressive values, including inclusivity and refusing to compromise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Best of all, Sweet Loren's yummy products are last on the page, ensuring you're fully primed to purchase only <em>after</em> learning about Sweet Loren's mission and differentiating factor: creating non-GMO, gluten-free, plant-based, and delicious cookie dough.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/sweet%20lorens.gif\" alt=\"sweet lorens\" /></p> \n<h3>20. <a href=\"https://www.teamtalex.com/our-story\">TalEx</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It focuses on social responsibility.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>TalEx has an <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201709/liz-welch/2017-inc5000-talex.html\"><span>interesting origin story</span></a>, in which two women left a major recruiting firm to build their own and ended up landing AOL as a major client of theirs — which was previously their old employers' client.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>TalEx has since seen unprecedented growth at <a href=\"https://www.teamtalex.com/our-story\"><span>4,900% in the three years</span></a> since it began. You'll learn all this and more on their About Us page, but what really makes their page stand out is the company's emphasis on social responsibility, which takes up nearly half the page and explains the company's dedication to giving 5% of its net profit annually to various philanthropic organizations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/talex%20about%20us%20page.png?width=862&amp;name=talex%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"talex about us page\" width=\"862\" style=\"width: 862px;\" /></p> \n<h3>21. <a href=\"https://skinnydipped.com/pages/our-story\">SkinnyDipped</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's authentic and down-to-earth.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>SkinnyDipped's About Us page features a few sweet, polaroid images of the employees (including three of the co-founders as young children), and a moving nod to Josh Dickerson, a family friend whose death inspired the family to start the business.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their About Us page is well-written and inspiring — for instance, they write, \"We decided to start a business … That it would be centered around food was obvious. For us—family, friends, food and love are all tangled up.\" By the time you finish reading their story (and the individual employee bios), you'll be as impressed by SkinnyDipped's brand values as you are by their delicious products.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/skinnydipped%20about%20us%20page.png?width=1068&amp;name=skinnydipped%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"skinnydipped about us page\" width=\"1068\" style=\"width: 1068px;\" /></p> \n<h3>22. <a href=\"https://www.lovebugprobiotics.com/about-us/\">LoveBug Probiotics</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's playful and informative.</h4> \n<p>LoveBug Probiotics' About Us page features an image of the founder's four young children wearing \"Chief Fun Officer\", \"Chief Giggle Officer\", \"Chief Silly Officer\" and \"Chief Humor Officer\" t-shirts. I'll admit — there aren't many About Us pages with cuter introductions than that.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The page effectively includes all the information you'd need on the company to make an informed purchasing decision — including how the founder came up with the idea, her personal ties to her vision, the science behind her probiotics, and even an opportunity to find local stores that carry LoveBug probiotics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plus, while the products are science-backed, the About Us page doesn't confuse visitors with difficult-to-understand facts: instead, the page is simple, straightforward, and helpful.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/lovebug.gif\" alt=\"lovebug\" /></p> \n<h3>23. <a href=\"https://brownandcoconut.com/about-brown-and-coconut/\">Brown and Coconut</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It's simple and no-fuss.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Sometimes, simpler is better — as is the case with Brown and Coconut's About Us page, which features a photo of the two co-founders alongside a few paragraphs of text, outlining the purpose and vision behind Brown and Coconut.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plus, the opening sentence is incredibly relatable and draws the reader in: \"After years of suffering from severe acne and frustrated by the lack of effectiveness and further damage they experienced with popular skin care products, Brown and Coconut founders and sisters, Letisha and Zeena Brown embarked on a journey to heal their skin from the inside out.\"</p> \n<p>What I liked best about this About Us page is the simple, no-fuss language they used to describe their business. Plus, rather than ending with a CTA directing visitors to their products, the co-founders instead choose to include a CTA to follow their business on Instagram, promoting a likely more effective, long-term lead generation strategy that starts with brand awareness.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brown%20and%20coconut%20about%20us%20page.png?width=2042&amp;name=brown%20and%20coconut%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"brown and coconut about us page\" width=\"2042\" style=\"width: 2042px;\" /></p> \n<h3>24. <a href=\"https://www.kunocreative.com/digital-marketing-agency\">Kuno Creative</a></h3> \n<h4>Why the \"About Us\" Page Rocks: It focuses on people rather than products.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Kuno Creative's About Us page effectively focuses on what makes the company different: its people. While the first paragraph describes the origin of the digital marketing agency, the majority of the page is taken up by black-and-white shots of all its employees along with descriptions of each member, like a modern day yearbook.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plus, the page looks sleek and clean, with plenty of white space and large blue lettering to draw attention without overwhelming visitors. If you're unsure what you want to include in your About Us page, consider taking note of how Kuno Creative focuses on its <em>people</em>, rather than its product, in the About Us page — a great way to humanize your brand.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kuno%20about%20us%20page.png?width=664&amp;name=kuno%20about%20us%20page.png\" alt=\"kuno about us page\" width=\"664\" style=\"width: 664px;\" /></p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Write an About Page</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Establish a mission statement.</li> \n  <li>Outline our company story.</li> \n  <li>Reveal how you've evolved.</li> \n  <li>State your \"aha!\" moment.</li> \n  <li>Explain who you serve.</li> \n  <li>Explain what you're offering them.</li> \n  <li>Cite examples of who you've served.</li> \n  <li>Describe your values.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<a></a> \n<p>It's tough to establish one all-encompassing template for your \"About Us\" page -- there are just so many ways you can go about telling your company story. But, per the real \"About Us\" pages we've just highlighted, there are some steps you should keep in mind when getting started.</p> \n<p>Here are five steps to writing an \"About Us\" page based on some of the things that impressed us about the examples above.</p> \n<h3>1. Establish a mission statement.</h3> \n<p>Your \"About Us\" page can and will be much longer than a single mission statement, but in order to draw people in, you need to succinctly state your goal in the industry up front. What are you here to do? Why should your website visitors care?</p> \n<h3>2. Outline your company story.</h3> \n<p>You might not have a long history of changes and growth your company has endured (yet), but it's a nice touch to talk about where you came from in your \"About Us\" page. So, isolate the milestones prior your company's founding, and use them to give readers some backstory on your current venture.</p> \n<h3>3. Reveal how you've evolved.</h3> \n<p>Even if you're a young company, there's no shame in admitting your business strategy -- or even personal way of thinking -- has changed since you began. In fact, in about pages, these evolutions can improve the story you tell to website visitors.</p> \n<p>About pages are perfect spaces to talk about where you started, how you've grown, and the ideals that have helped your organization mature. Use these moments to further your company story and show people that you're always ready to change and adapt to the needs of your industry.</p> \n<h3>4. State your \"aha!\" moment.</h3> \n<p>Every good company was founded on an idea -- something the current marketplace might not yet offer. What was your idea? Use this \"Aha!\" moment as a pivot point when telling your company story. What was a challenge you faced while developing your company? How did this challenge or discovery shape what you are today?</p> \n<h3>5. Explain who you serve.</h3> \n<p>As much as you want as many eyeballs on your \"About Us\" page as possible, you won't do business with every single one of them. That's why it's crucial that you identify <em>and mention </em>your core customer. Who should care you exist? Which eyeballs are you here to serve?</p> \n<h3>6. Explain what you're offering them.</h3> \n<p>As you're explaining who you serve, make it clear what it is you're offering. Too often companies generalize their product or service in the language of their website, making it hard to understand what it is the customer is actually paying for. They're afraid literal explanations of their products aren't interesting enough, or will sound unappealing in writing. And that's a fair concern.</p> \n<p>However, by investing just a sentence or two into telling your potential customers exactly what they'll receive can keep them on your website for longer and interested in learning more.</p> \n<h3>7. Cite examples of who you've served.</h3> \n<p>Got some loyal customers in your portfolio? Use your about page to let the world know who already trusts and benefits from your work.</p> \n<p>Knowing about your company's past successes can influence the purchasing decision of up to <a href=\"https://www.featuredcustomers.com/blog/7-stats-about-how-customer-success-stories-boost-b2b-sales\">90% of today's B2B customers</a>, according to Dimensional Research. Even if you don't yet have case studies to expand on the problems you've helped buyers solve, it's in your interest to briefly mention who you've done this for. And your about page is the perfect platform for it.</p> \n<h3>8. Describe your values.</h3> \n<p>Customers want to be treated like human beings. For that to happen, they need to feel that they're being treated <em>by</em> human beings. When finishing your \"About Us\" page, describe who you are as a person or a team, and what your personal values are. What's your company culture like? What bigger picture in life drives your business?</p> \n<p>An LED lightbulb maker might sell 10 different lamp styles, for example, but that might not be the most important characteristic to its primary audience. Maybe this lightbulb developer was founded on a commitment to environmental protection, and every bulb the company makes was built by people who are dedicated to making the world more energy-efficient.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind a secondary audience of your company's \"About Us\" page consists of your future employees. This is another reason describing your personal values is a good idea -- the key to your job candidates' hearts is to show them you have one too.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>About Us Page Templates That Rock</h2> \n<p>Copy is an important element of an About page. However, you'll also want to keep user experience in mind as you showcase your brand story and identity to the world. Here are some of the top About Us and About Me page templates to use or draw inspiration from:</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://marketplace.hubspot.com/products/clickray-eu/sodium-v2-about-us\">Sodium v2</a> (HubSpot)</h3> \n<p>Tell your prospects about you using bold color and by telling your story.
