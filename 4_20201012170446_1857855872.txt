The A42 is now Samsung’s cheapest phone with 5G, selling for £349 (about $455 USD). That puts it £80 below the Galaxy A51 5G, which was previously the cheapest way to buy into Samsung’s 5G lineup at £429 (or priced at $500 USD in the US).</p>\n<p id=\"GaxWlv\">The Galaxy A42 uses the Snapdragon 750G, a middle-of-the-pack processor that was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449747/qualcomm-snapdragon-750g-5g-faster-cpu-gpu-ai-engine-smartphone-processor\">just announced</a> by Qualcomm last month.
