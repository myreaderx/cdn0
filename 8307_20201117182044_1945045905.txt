In this\r\nwork we establish quantum features of an atomic soliton Josephson junction (SJJ) device, which\r\nconsists of two weakly-coupled condensates with negative scattering length. The condensates are\r\ntrapped in a double-well potential and elongated in one dimension. Starting with classical field\r\ntheory we map for the first time a two-soliton problem onto the effective two-mode Hamiltonian and\r\nperform a second quantization procedure. Compared to the conventional bosonic Josephson junction\r\ncondensate system, we show that the SJJ-model in quantum domain exhibits unusual features due to its\r\neffective nonlinear strength proportional to the square of total particle number, N 2 . A novel\r\nself-tuning effect for the effective tunneling parameter is also demonstrated in the SJJ-model,\r\nwhich depends on the particle number and rapidly vanishes as the JJ population imbalance\r\nincreases...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":8307,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7f3aff237600e117858358352389216c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dmitriy Tsarev, Alexander Alodjants, The Vinh Ngo and Ray-Kuang Lee","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605637244112}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 02:20:44","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 02:20:44","feedId":8307,"fetchDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:20:44 +0000","fetchMs":33029,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":33050,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3b520398b65f82a2a83818c2716ca970","hostName":"us-016*","requestId":"e6225dec38004ff2abef337bd07b7383_8307","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:32:30","id":8307,"name":"New Journal of Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/?rss=1","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn87@2020_3/2020/09/06/04-32-30-586_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for New Journal of Physics","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605637211074,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":33031,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
