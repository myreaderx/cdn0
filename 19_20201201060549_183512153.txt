The email informed us that starting 1 January, Audible would pay a royalty on any audiobook which is returned more than seven days after it is purchased.</p>\n<p>The email does not acknowledge the other issues raised recently, including the lack of clarity in sales reports (we&#8217;re not told how many audiobooks are returned) and Audible&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/11/03/amazon-is-actively-promoting-audiobook-exchanges-as-an-audible-subscription-feature/\">actively promote returns</a> as a feature of an Audible subscription.</p>\n<p>While this is a small improvement, we still need to keep fighting Amazon on the other two points.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the text of the email. The relevant paragraph is at the end.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Launched in 2011, the Audiobook Creation Exchange has paved the way for exponential growth in audiobook production and consumption, today supplying over 200 audiobooks in store per day to Audible, Amazon, and iTunes. The ACX online rights marketplace and production engine is available to all authors, publishers, literary agents, narrators and studio pros in the US, UK, Canada, and Ireland. ACX.com connects and educates independent authors and rising actors—many of whom are among 20,000 professional actors who have worked with Audible in the past 5 years—in the art of audiobook performance and creation, and provides title-promotion tools and methods to drive sales and audiobook awareness, allowing our creative stakeholders to reach new audiences on Audible and beyond. Free programs, including ACX University and the Promo Code Tool, seek to level the playing field and further expand opportunity for authors, narrators, rights holders and producers alike.</p>\n<p>As you know, we’ve been working to address some ACX authors’ concerns about Audible’s overall exchange policy, and we appreciate your feedback. The intent of this program is to allow listeners to discover their favorite voice, author, or story in audio. In instances where we determine the benefit is being overused, Audible can and does limit the number of exchanges and refunds allowed by a member. But as designed, this customer benefit allows active Audible members in good standing to take a chance on new content, and suspicious activity is extremely rare.</p>\n<p>We hope this helps convey perspective to our valued writers and ACX partners as to the impact of our current returns policies. However, in recognition of these concerns, moving forward and effective as of January 1, 2021, Audible will pay royalties for any title returned more than 7 days following purchase. This adjustment does not impact our customers&#8217; current benefits of membership, and we look forward to continuing to welcome millions of first-time listeners, enabling our members to discover new content they enjoy and growing the audience for our valued creative partners.</p>\n<p>Respectfully,<br />\nThe ACX Team</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Thanks, Tim!</em></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/11/24/audible-makes-tiny-change-to-its-execrable-return-royalty-policy/\">Audible Makes Tiny Change to Its Execrable Return &#038;

Bertelsmann’s global trade book publishing group, Penguin Random House, is purchasing the book publishing business from the media company ViacomCBS for $2.175 billion. Simon &#38; Schuster strengthens Bertelsmann’s footprint globally, and particular in the U.S., its second-largest market. Simon &#38; Schuster employs around 1,500 people worldwide and generated revenues of $814 million in 2019. It publishes works from well-known authors and public figures including Hillary Clinton, John Irving, Stephen King, and Bob Woodward. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close during 2021. Bertelsmann will pay the purchase price in cash from existing liquid funds. Simon &#38; Schuster will continue to be managed as a separate publishing unit under the Penguin Random House umbrella. Jonathan Karp, President &#38; CEO of Simon &#38; Schuster, and Dennis Eulau, COO and CFO, will continue at the helm of the publishing house.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I know that most will frame this story in terms of the Big 5 becoming the Big 4, but I don&#8217;t think that is really an accurate description.</p>\n<p>The thing about the Big 5 is that they aren&#8217;t really that big. There are many larger or comparable-sized publishing companies, including US publishers such as Scholastic and HMH. Also, all of the remaining &#8220;Big 5&#8221; are actually part of larger international publishing conglomerates. Hachette belongs to Legardere, PRH and S&#38;S are part of Bertelmann, Macmillan belongs to Holtzbrink, and HarperCollins belongs to Newscorp.</p>\n<p>The Big 5 (now the Big 4) are run as parts of a larger whole, and referring to them in terms of their relative size in the US market is misleading at best.</p>\n<p>Or at least, it is misleading to those outside the industry. If you are in the book publishing industry you&#8217;re going to notice a change in everything from reduced competition for new books to lower fees paid to service providers to the size of booth at book fairs (publisher booths have been getting smaller for years now, and this will probably accelerate the trend).</p>\n<p>This deal is bad news for everyone except Bertelsmann&#8217;s stockholders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/actualitte/\">ActuaLitté</a> via <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/actualitte/26347493661/\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/11/25/bertelsmann-buys-simon-schuster-from-viacomcbs/\">Bertelsmann Buys Simon &#038; Schuster from ViacomCBS</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=pW1fu0NjKcA:gOYocz2Nw6U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=pW1fu0NjKcA:gOYocz2Nw6U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=pW1fu0NjKcA:gOYocz2Nw6U:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/pW1fu0NjKcA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:21:45 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/26347493661_ce5b0acd94_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1","linkMd5":"7a29a405381b4d51c25607844a921101","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-09-191_0634cdf0025a5d51.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33802,"destBytes":33802,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/26347493661_ce5b0acd94_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_5/2020/12/01/06-05-09-191_0634cdf0025a5d51.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_1/2020/12/01/06-05-18-239_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn29@2020_6/2020/12/01/06-05-37-643_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn34@2020_2/2020/12/01/06-05-23-170_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/pW1fu0NjKcA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn37@2020_2/2020/12/01/06-05-26-598_b6bb411951d05b1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606802708203},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:08","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 14:05:08","title":"Basic Kindle Now $59, Oasis & Paperwhite to go on Sale on Cyber Monday","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=142057","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-142058\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?resize=390%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?resize=620%2C477&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?resize=250%2C193&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?resize=150%2C116&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?resize=768%2C591&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kindle-sale-black-friday.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Amazon announced a confusing number of sales today for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

The change arises from concerns about income loss from Amazon Audible’s refund and exchange policies, and deteriorating customer service to authors and narrators.</p>\n<p>ALLi now has reason to believe that Amazon Audible’s refund and return policies are resulting in unknown numbers of audiobook authors and narrators around the world being deprived of income.</p>\n<p>Audible’s payment process, which encourages subscribers to “return” or  “exchange” audiobooks for up to a year without compunction, has long been of concern to ALLi and independent authors who self-publish audiobooks. Free return and exchange is being used as a highly effective promotional tool for Audible, as it provides a nice perk to listeners, but evidence is emerging that whenever an audiobook is returned or exchanged, Audible claws back payment from the audiobook’s creators, without their consent, or even their knowledge.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On a related note, The Authors Guild, RWA, ALLi, SFWA, Novelists Inc., and Dramatists Guild have jointly published an <a href=\"https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/sign-our-letter-and-tell-audible-to-stop-charging-authors-for-returns/\" data-external=\"true\">open letter</a> to Audible’s CEO Bob Carrigan and General Counsel Stas Zakharenko, demanding that Audible end its practice of encouraging easy returns and exchanges. &#8220;This is not an exchange policy, but an unauthorized audiobook rental arrangement supported by authors’ reversed royalties, and it must stop.&#8221; You can add your name to the letter <a href=\"https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/sign-our-letter-and-tell-audible-to-stop-charging-authors-for-returns/\" data-external=\"true\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>And they are right. The thing about this &#8220;return&#8221; policy is that it costs Amazon nothing while costing creators everything.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Amazon doesn&#8217;t sell audiobooks as a subscription. They sell credits, so when an audiobook is &#8220;returned&#8221;, they give a credit back to the subscriber. Amazon then claws a royalty back from rightsholders while at the same time keeping the money they were paid for the credit.</p>\n<p>This is different from when a Kindle ebook is returned, obviously, and that difference is why the burden for an audiobook return is born entirely by rightsholders.</p>\n<p>That burden is a fundamental imbalance in Amazon&#8217;s relationship with rightsholders, and the organizations I named above are absolutely right to insist that Amazon correct this situation.</p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\"
