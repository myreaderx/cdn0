Gaining greater self-awareness can allow us to make improvements in our relationships, career, and life in general.</p>\n<p>When we’re trying to figure out what makes us tick, we typically ask ourselves, “Why?”</p>\n<p>“Why do I hate my job?”</p>\n<p>“Why do I always fall for the wrong person?”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I lose weight?”</p>\n<p>“Why do I lose my temper?”</p>\n<p>“Why am I depressed?”</p>\n<p>People can write hundreds of pages in their journals or spend months in therapy trying to answer these types of “why” questions without ever coming to any satisfactory or helpful conclusions.</p>\n<p>And there’s a reason for that: “Why?” isn’t a very useful question to ask yourself if you’re looking to enhance your self-awareness.</p>\n<p>At least, that’s what Tasha Eurich, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-644-how-to-develop-greater-self-awareness/\">AoM podcast guest</a> and author of the book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EyRUXx\"><em>Insight</em></a>, argues.</p>\n<p>Below we walk you through why you should stop asking yourself “Why?” and what you should ask yourself instead.</p>\n<h2>Why Asking Yourself “Why?” Can Get You Nowhere</h2>\n<p><strong>You may not be able to find the answer.</strong> The biggest reason you should stop asking yourself why you do or don’t do something is that you probably don’t know the answer to that question. And won’t, even with strenuous introspection, be able to completely figure it out.</p>\n<p>Which seems counterintuitive. Why wouldn’t we know why we do the things we do? Don’t we know ourselves well enough to access that insight?</p>\n<p>Maybe not.</p>\n<p>Several studies in consumer psychology have shown that when we’re asked why we like something, we often don’t really know. We might think we know, but we’re frequently fooling ourselves.</p>\n<p>For example, in one study, researchers laid out four identical pairs of pantyhose on a display table. The study’s subjects were then asked to pick any pair they wanted. People chose the pair on the far right — the one their gaze would have taken in last — to the tune of four to one.</p>\n<p>When the researchers asked subjects why they picked a particular pair, of what were, again, identical pantyhose, they’d say things like “It’s the best color” or “It has the best elasticity.” The subjects gave eighty different reasons as to why they’d chosen the pair that they did, but not one of them said that its position on the table had influenced their decision.</p>\n<p>Even when the researchers pointed out that the pairs were all the same, the subjects still stuck with their reasoning.</p>\n<p>Similar studies have generated similar results. We often make a decision quickly based on emotion, environmental factors, and the like, and then create a seemingly logical, rational explanation for the decision after the fact. We may pick the car we buy because we like it on a gut level, but when we’re asked why we chose that car, we’ll say things like “It gets good mileage” or “It’s a smooth ride.” We never say, “I just liked it.”</p>\n<p>The reality is that we do things for a mixture of complex reasons that can be hard to grasp and articulate. Dwelling too heavily on the question of why we do what we do can thus lead us in fruitless circles. </p>\n<p><strong>Asking why puts you in victim mode.</strong> In her book, Tasha notes that there’s something about asking yourself “Why?” that puts you into a victim mindset.</p>\n<p>“Why” elicits a lot of emotional reasoning, particularly negative emotional reasoning that can send you down a death spiral of rumination.</p>\n<p>“Why is my life terrible?”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t people like me?”</p>\n<p>“Why do I keep getting fired?”</p>\n<p>Notice how all those “why” questions frame your life as something that just happens <em>to</em> you?</p>\n<p>Asking why can <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/building-your-resiliency-part-iii-taking-control-of-your-life/\">externalize your locus of control</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/boosting-your-resiliency-part-2-avoiding-learned-helplessness-and-changing-your-explanatory-style/\">foster learned helplessness</a>. Instead of making things better, it makes things worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe the why doesn’t matter.</strong> There’s a popular idea that if we know why we do something or why we have a psychological hang-up, we’ll be able to solve the problem. It likely comes from Freudian psychodynamic therapy. There’s an idea that if you can figure out that the reason you’re depressed is, for example, that you had a bad relationship with your mother, then the depression can resolve itself.</p>\n<p>The idea has been called into question by more modern therapeutic approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT argues that pinning a “why” to maladaptive behavior probably won’t do much to change future action.</p>\n<p>“So your mom wasn’t affectionate to you when you were a kid. Now what?” asks the cognitive behavioral therapist.</p>\n<p>Sometimes figuring out the why of you will be helpful. But often it won’t.</p>\n<h2>What to Ask Instead of “Why?” for Better Insights</h2>\n<p>So if asking “Why?” doesn’t consistently lead to greater self-insight, what should we ask instead?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple: ask “What?”</p>\n<p>“What” questions provide more helpful information than “why” questions. “What” questions are less emotionally fraught and force you to use the cooler, more logical part of your brain. “What” questions also provide actionable insights.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of asking yourself, “Why can’t I lose weight?” ask yourself a series of questions like these:</p>\n<p>“What’s holding me back from losing weight?”</p>\n<p>“What is it about my diet that’s contributing to my weight gain?”</p>\n<p>“What’s a diet that I’ll actually stick with?”</p>\n<p>“What’s getting in the way of me exercising regularly?”</p>\n<p>“What small changes can I make in my diet to help me reduce calories?”</p>\n<p>See the difference?</p>\n<p>Asking yourself, “Why can’t I lose weight?!” will elicit vague, emotionally-based, victim-mode-creating responses (“I’m a lazy slob!” “It’s my genes!” “My mom used food to express her love!”) that aren’t very helpful.</p>\n<p>Whereas asking “what” questions will provide rational, proactive, and specific responses.</p>\n<p>I’ve also noticed that asking “how” questions can be an excellent supplement to asking “what” questions.</p>\n<p>“How can I make exercise a habit?” “How can I make better food choices?”</p>\n<p>Like the “what” questions, “how” questions provide actionable, specific insights.</p>\n<p>The next time you catch yourself asking a “why” question, try to reframe your introspection as a “what” question. You’ll likely be pleasantly surprised to discover the valuable and productive insights this little change will garner.</p>\n<p><em>For more advice on how to increase your self-awareness in healthy and effective ways, listen to our podcast with Tasha Eurich</em>:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/644-how-to-develop-greater-self-awareness/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/dont-ask-why/\">The One Question NOT to Ask for Healthy Introspection (And What to Ask Instead)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/jotFZuAzCzE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 16:30:14 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b99e1a575537e277e839fe5d8db4917e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/introspection.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-30-704_9da7d030c968f10a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/jotFZuAzCzE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn87@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-30-271_07e4b89da337fdb0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761708242},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","title":"Your First Style Steps: Beyond Jeans, T-Shirts, and Tennis Shoes","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=106607","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><a href=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4.jpg\"><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-106664 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4.jpg\" alt=\"Man trying on clothes at store.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></a></p>\n<p><i>With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we’ve decided to republish a classic piece each Sunday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past. This article was originally published in October 2019.</i></p>\n<p>A lot of guys would like to improve their personal style, but they feel a little overwhelmed as to how to start. Men’s sartorial blogs and magazines often showcase photo spreads of male models wearing expensive, fashion-forward clothes that seem inaccessible and/or undesirable, and don’t point that helpfully towards a way forward.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, taking your first steps towards upping your style game doesn’t have to be intimidating or involve making dramatic changes to how you dress. Instead, it requires only modest purchases that anyone can make with a minimum of effort and some very basic knowledge. Together, these wardrobe additions will significantly upgrade your look from the basics of jeans, t-shirts, and tennis shoes, all without breaking the bank, or making you break much of a sweat.</p>\n<p>Think of the following items as the starter set for any well-dressed man:</p>\n<h2>1. A Couple of Plain White Dress Shirts</h2>\n<p>They may look like serious business pieces on the rack, but plain white dress shirts can go with pretty much any outfit.</p>\n<p>You can wear them with slacks and a tie, or a suit if you have one, but you can also throw them on with blue jeans and a pair of beat-up work boots.</p>\n<p>You want a couple of these because they’re never going to be wrong. While you figure out the rest of your style, basic white shirts hold the fort.</p>\n<p>Point collars are a little nicer than button-downs, but the casual look of the latter will probably best fit your day-to-day style. Get ’em for $20 or so at any department store, or keep an eye out for sales online. Secondhand is fine too, so long as the pits aren’t yellowed or you’re confident in <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-remove-yellow-armpit-stains/\">your stain-removing abilities</a>.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, make sure your dress shirts fit really well, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-a-mens-dress-shirt-should-fit/\">checking out this full guide to how they should look</a> and taking them to a tailor to get them altered.</p>\n<h2>2. A Casual Sports Jacket</h2>\n<p>It might not seem like a high priority if you’ve never been a jacket-wearing kind of guy, but don’t underestimate <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/suit-sport-jacket-blazer-difference/\">the value of a sports jacket</a>.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t have to be anything fancy, or even new. Secondhand is just fine — if anything, a little wear and tear around the edges adds authenticity. Look for sales <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/thrifting-5-tips-for-getting-top-quality-products-at-rock-bottom-prices/\">or thrifted pieces</a> and you can expect to spend anywhere between $10-$100.</p>\n<p>Try for something simple and casual when you’re just getting started. Gray tweed or a brown tone of some kind should work well, in textures or patterns if you like that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Experiment with throwing the jacket on over a simple dress shirt and jeans when you go out to dinner or to a party. It’ll be a painless upgrade to your usual look — and one that’s not <em>so</em> dressy that it’ll rock the boat.</p>\n<h2>3. Nice Jeans</h2>\n<p>Upgrading your style a little doesn’t mean saying goodbye to blue jeans forever. In fact <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/blue-jeans-denim-intro/\">they’re a staple (or at least should be) in every man’s wardrobe</a>.</p>\n<p>So rather than ditching them, you’re going to improve the quality of your jeans. Skip the offerings from places like Target or Macy’s and head to a store that specializes in denim instead — a Levi’s or a Lee’s outlet works great. You can also shop online, where you’ll have your pick of everything from the major brands to small batch <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/raw-selvedge-denim-introduction/\">raw and selvedge denim jeans</a>. Expect to spend a little bit here if you’re buying new — $60 is a good price, and it can go higher for specialty brands.</p>\n<p>Find a pair you like and opt for a fairly close fit in dark indigo. These are your new “dress jeans,” for any occasion when you want to look comfortable and relaxed but still like someone who cares about his appearance.</p>\n<p>The fit is important here. The denim doesn’t have to be skin-tight, but it shouldn’t have too much excess either. You want a little taper to the legs, and an overall more “tailored” look than the jeans you’d wear to work in the yard.</p>\n<h2>4. Casual Leather Shoes</h2>\n<p>A pair of decent shoes changes the entire outfit they’re worn with.</p>\n<p>Swap tennies for leather footwear and you’ve suddenly got a much more respectable look.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to spend much to get the effect. Most department stores will have leather shoes (generally with rubber soles) for around $50.</p>\n<p>Leather footwear, of course, comes in a variety of styles, from brogues to loafers to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/3-things-to-look-for-in-leather-boots/\">work boots</a>. Choose a pair based on your personal style and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/shoes/the-mens-dress-shoe-hierarchy/\">the formality of your outfit</a>. Whichever way you go, they’ll be a big upgrade from sneakers.</p>\n<h2>5. A Lightweight Sweater</h2>\n<p>Sweaters are a little like sports jackets in that some guys love ’em and own about a dozen, and other guys never even think about putting one on.</p>\n<p>Split the difference and grab one or two thin, lightweight sweaters. Solid colors are best — <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-layer-clothing-men/\">you’ll be layering with other pieces</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sweater-mans-guide/\">A good sweater</a> can be a top layer or can go under a sport coat — wear that instead of a more technical-looking jacket for warmth on cool days.</p>\n<p>Your price is going to vary depending on what the sweater is made out of, but you can get cheap knit cotton ones for around $30. Wool (especially cashmere) is going to be warmer and sturdier, but it’ll also cost more, in the $100 range for a good one bought new.</p>\n<p>It may seem like a strange investment at first if you’re not a sweater-loving guy, but give it a try. For about half the year (in temperate climates), a plain sweater with a dress shirt under it and a decent pair of blue jeans will be temperature-perfect — and stylish.</p>\n<h2>6. A Handsome Overcoat</h2>\n<p>If you’re going backpacking or mountain climbing, bring the high-tech parkas and performance gear you need to keep your body warm. For bumming around town, however, skip the puffy fabrics, high-gloss plastics, and chunky pull-tabs of outdoors gear whenever you can. If you’re not going to be out in bad weather for hours on end, your overcoat doesn’t need to be high-tech. Rather, get a coat that’s both warm and classically handsome.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of options here, depending on your climate and your style. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/man-guide-trench-coat/\">Trench coats</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-minimal-wardrobe-how-to-choose-a-swiss-army-overcoat/\">dressier wool overcoats</a> work well for suit-wearing men; guys who don’t have a suit jacket’s length to cover up can get away with shorter options like <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/mans-guide-pea-coat/\">pea coats</a> and fatigue jackets.</p>\n<p>You can almost always find decent secondhand coats at thrift stores or online. Don’t pay more than $50-$75 for it unless you find one you really want; if you’re patient and willing to try some odd styles out you can probably end up spending as little as $20.</p>\n<h2>7. A Good Leather Belt</h2>\n<p>A nice belt is an accessory that can go a surprising ways towards pulling a getup together.</p>\n<p>If you’re expecting to be wearing a business suit, you’ll need a slimmer black dress belt in your collection, but for most guys’ day-to-day wear, a brown, leather, thicker/wider “work belt” style is the real essential. The strap should be 1.5″ in width or more, and made of a natural or tan leather. The buckle should match the metals you wear (watch/rings). <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/complete-guide-mens-belts/\">Here are all the details you could ever want for picking out a good one</a>.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to invest up front in a really sturdy piece of leather. Leather goods companies sell high-quality belts for around $30-$50, and you can add handcrafted or vintage buckles for $5-$25 a pop, if you’re into that. </p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Building Your Wardrobe Over Time</span></h2>\n<p>Take a quick look back over the estimates we made in this list and you’ll see that even the bare minimum investment is going to be more than $200. Depending on your current financial circumstances, that may seem like a lot.</p>\n<p>But remember, this isn’t a package deal. You’re not going out and grabbing these overnight.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to pick up one or two pieces per month, just by browsing around online and keeping an eye out for deals, or by swinging through the mall once in a while.</p>\n<p>Many of these also make good gifts — relatives who don’t know what to get you for Christmas would probably be thrilled to hear that all you want is a leather belt or a couple of dress shirts.</p>\n<p>Take it slow, and remember that the most important part of these upgrades is <em>wearing</em> them.</p>\n<p>You’ll come to see that while the effort involved in trading in old blue jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers, for fitted jeans, a dress shirt, and brogues, will be minimal, the difference in your appearance and the impression you make will be huge.</p>\n<p>_____________________________</p>\n<p><em>Written By Antonio Centeno</em><br></br><em>Founder, <a href=\"https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Real Men Real Style</a></em><br></br><em><a href=\"https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/free-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here to grab my free ebooks on men’s style</a></em></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/your-first-style-steps-beyond-jeans-t-shirts-and-tennis-shoes/\">Your First Style Steps: Beyond Jeans, T-Shirts, and Tennis Shoes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/eJHVIxuTwwg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 18:02:23 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a38f452c72603fde150b39830a868bca","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Antonio","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/10/stylesteps4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn100@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-30-397_37cab9c9647f1692.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/eJHVIxuTwwg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn91@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-33-758_a0151721c466d2eb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761708241},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","title":"How to Read More Books","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=82192","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82262 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Poster about reading more books by Art of Manliness.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header.jpg 700w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header-320x183.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header-640x366.jpg 640w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header-400x229.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></img></p>\n<p><i>With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we’ve decided to republish a classic piece each Sunday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past. This article was originally published in February 2018.</i></p>\n<p>Last year I read over 120 books. When I posted a collage of my favorite of those 120 reads <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artofmanliness/\">on Instagram</a>, a lot of guys asked me what my secret was for digesting that many tomes in 12 months.</p>\n<p>I’ve developed some tactics during my years of reading for both work and pleasure, and I share them below. If you’re looking to increase your physical and mental library and read more books this year, maybe they’ll work for you too.</p>\n<h3>The Biggest Trick to Reading More</h3>\n<p>When people ask me how I read so many books, they’re usually fishing for a speed reading technique that will allow their brains to swallow books whole.</p>\n<p>Speed reading certainly plays a role in my reading technique (more on that later), but it’s not my killer secret.</p>\n<p>Lean in. I’m going to whisper the secret to reading a lot of books.</p>\n<p>Are you ready?</p>\n<p><em>You need to spend more time reading. </em></p>\n<p>I spend a lot of time reading because it’s part of my job.</p>\n<p>To prepare for <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/\">my podcast</a>, I read my guest’s book(s). When I write articles, I read books for research. Reading is just part of my job description.</p>\n<p>Being amazed at how many books I read in a year would be like being amazed at how many leaky faucets a plumber fixed in a year. It’s not that impressive when it’s what you do for work.</p>\n<p>With that said, in addition to the books I read specifically for the Art of Manliness last year, I also managed to read 2-3 books every month for pleasure. That’s more than two dozen non-work related books in 12 months. It’s an amount that I think most men with even the busiest of schedules can very viably knock off in a year too.</p>\n<p>So the #1 secret to reading more is to spend more time reading. </p>\n<p>How can you find this time?</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule time for reading. </strong>You can’t in fact <em>find </em>time for reading; you’ve got to <em>make</em> time for it. And the best way to make time for something is to put it on your daily schedule. You don’t need to set aside an hour straight for reading. If you’re just starting off with making reading a priority, you probably don’t yet have the attention span for it, and trying to read that long in one sitting will likely set you up for frustration. Instead, block off 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes at night for reading. Heck, make those 20-minute blocks if a half hour still seems too long. Instead of doing your typical time-wasting smartphone scan at those times, you’ll read. You’ll be amazed at how many books you can knock off in a month by reading an hour a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Use spare moments for reading.</strong> Even though your daily schedule may seem packed, there are invariably small pockets of time hidden in its interstices that you typically waste. A few minutes of downtime between activities or appointments may seem trivial, but they soon add up to hours, and to entire books read; <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/possibilities-spare-moments/\">there’s great possibilities in spare moments</a>!</p>\n<p>Standing in line at the post office? Read a book. Cooling your heels at the dentist? Read a book. Pooping? Read a book. Waiting to pick up your kid from school? Read. I’ll even read in between sets while I’m lifting weights. #barbellsandbooks</p>\n<p>The easiest way to be ready to read when you find yourself with a little slice of time is to download the Kindle app on your phone. You almost always have your phone with you, and will thus almost always have a library at your fingertips. (And on the cheap if you want; you can get thousands of classics for free.) </p>\n<p><strong>Avoid reading on your smartphone.</strong> So I just recommended using the Kindle app on your smartphone to get more reading done. Now I’m going to completely contradict that advice by recommending you avoid reading on your smartphone as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that when I read on my phone, I tend to get really distracted. I’ll read for 5 minutes, but then get the itch to check my email or scroll through Instagram. I’ll do a quick check of other apps and then get back to reading. Five minutes later the itch comes back, and I repeat the cycle. I never get in any good, focused reading when I read on my phone.</p>\n<p>Consequently, I try to do most of my reading with physical books. What’s more, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/?error=cookies_not_supported&#38;code=8d743c31-c118-43ec-9722-efc2b0d4971e\">studies suggest</a> that reading comprehension increases when you read an analog book compared to reading on digital devices. It’s probably because you simply focus more when using the former medium.</p>\n<p>The other advantage of paper books is that I find it easier to highlight and make notes compared to e-readers.</p>\n<p>While I try to do most of my reading with physical books, digital books still have a place in my reading schedule. I use the Kindle app for spare moment reading and nothing more. A spare “moment” lasts about 5-15 minutes, or about the amount of time I can read on my phone before the itch to check another app arises.</p>\n<p>Of course, I read different books on my phone and in paperback; it would be a huge pain in the rear to try to switch back and forth between a digital and hard copy of the very same book. At any given time, I’ll be reading one book as a paperback, and a different book on my Kindle app, often picking a “lighter” book for the latter selection, since I won’t be engaging it with as much sustained attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Take advantage of travel time.</strong> If you commute by subway or bus, use that travel time to read.</p>\n<p>My favorite time to get reading done is when I’m on a plane. You’d be surprised how much reading you can accomplish during a two-hour flight in the absence of Wi-Fi-dependent distractions. In fact, you can finish entire books from beginning to end in that amount of time. Short books, of course. I’ve read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OI0G1Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000OI0G1Q&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Road</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0PDA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000FC0PDA&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EHV4Oy\"><em>Death of a Salesman</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DI7R5G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B004DI7R5G&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Bhagavad Gita</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012BLTM6I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B012BLTM6I&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em></a> all on 2-hour trips.</p>\n<p>Next time you’re traveling by plane, instead of loading your phone with apps and movies, stock it with books. Better yet, bring a physical book or two in your carry-on.</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to audiobooks.</strong> I don’t listen to too many audiobooks; it’s just not my preferred method of consuming literature. But if I’m going on a long road trip where I’ll be doing most of the driving, I’ll buy a few on Audible to pass the time. If you’re on the road a lot, your drive can be a golden opportunity to consume a big ol’ library of books.</p>\n<p>Pro-tip: speed up the narration to 1.5x or 2x. You can still understand everything, but it will allow you to get through a book much faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed read strategically.</strong> As mentioned above, when people ask me how I read so many books, they often assume I’m speed reading. But when I utilize the reading methods above, I’m typically reading at a fairly normal pace (I think my normal pace is a little faster than average, but it’s not so fast it would qualify as speed reading). </p>\n<p>Speed reading courses will claim that you can have fantastic comprehension while reading a million words a minute. It’s not true. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-speed-read-like-theodore-roosevelt/\">While it is possible, with lots of practice, to increase reading speed while maintaining decent comprehension</a>, there’s inevitably going to be some comprehension loss the faster you go. For that reason, I don’t like speed reading.</p>\n<p>With that said, I do occasionally speed read or skim books. But I do so strategically.</p>\n<p>Certain kinds of books lend themselves well to speed reading. Specifically, business books and “pop-y” self-development books — the kind of books you’d grab at the front of an airport bookstore. These genres of books are typically formatted for easy scanning. They make extensive use of headings, bolded first sentences, and bulleted lists. You can read and scan through these books pretty quick and still get what they’re about. The extra text in them often doesn’t actually add very much to the main points; it typically consists of anecdotes that demonstrate how a certain principle was put into action. Such stories can be interesting, but they’re often just fluff.</p>\n<p>The other reason these pop self-improvement/business books are so easy to speed read is that they all pretty much say the same thing. If you’ve read one personal development book you’ve read them all. I can’t count the number I’ve read that have referenced the marshmallow test or that “invisible” gorilla on the basketball court study. As soon as I see “marshmallow test” in a book, I’m skipping all the pages that describe the experiment and the obligatory explanation on the importance of delayed gratification because I’ve already read about it a bajillion times.</p>\n<p>While I’ll speed read/scan business and personal development books, I don’t speed read stuff that requires concentration and attention to understand fully, like works of philosophy, history, or science. For example, Alistair MacIntyre’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D4TAYZO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B01D4TAYZO&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>After Virtue</em></a> is super hard to understand when you’re reading it at a snail’s pace; it’d be impossible to comprehend if you sped through it.</p>\n<p>I also don’t speed read fiction. First, with fiction, there’s a lot of nuance in the story that can be lost if you skim it. Second, fiction is often filled with literary flourishes that must be read slowly and deliberately to really be absorbed and appreciated. If you’re speed reading Dickens or Austen (<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-every-man-should-read-jane-austen/\">yes, there’s a place for Jane Austen in a man’s library</a>), you’re going to miss out on prose that should be relished. Finally, reading fiction is supposed to be enjoyable. Why would you want to rush through a pleasant experience as quickly as possible? I remember how bummed I felt when I finished <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE6HD4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B003NE6HD4&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Lonesome Dove</em></a> the first time; I just wanted it to keep going and going.</p>\n<p>So yes, speed read — but only occasionally and strategically.</p>\n<p>Well, there you go. How I get so much reading done. There’s really no secret — you simply need to make it a priority!</p>\n<p><em><strong>For more insights on how to read more books (more effectively), listen to our podcast with a man who owns 60,000 of them:</strong></em></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/what-a-man-with-60-000-books-can-teach-you-about-l/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/how-to-read-more-books/\">How to Read More Books</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/Vt2sienAwxg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 07:14:31 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"548b544c8e524b714b82d9c9ea82b59d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2018/02/Read-Books-Header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn21@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-30-425_b6bf2a67f7a4cd60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/theartofmanliness/~4/Vt2sienAwxg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn79@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-30-308_82c85d48cf4d7995.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761708241},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:08","title":"Sunday Firesides: There Are No Second Chances","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=138417","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138423\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/No-Second-Chances-Header-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/No-Second-Chances-Header-5.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/No-Second-Chances-Header-5-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/No-Second-Chances-Header-5-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/No-Second-Chances-Header-5-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of an awkward date, blown job interview, aborted attempt to meet a mentor, abandoned decision to share a heartfelt belief with a friend — any scuttled act of potential courage — comes the invariable cognitive salve:</p>\n<p>“I’ll do it next time.”</p>\n<p>Yet, no matter how embarrassment-diminishing, self-incrimination-resolving, and dissonance-soothing this rationalization may be, you will not get a second chance.</p>\n<p>For there are none.</p>\n<p>At best, you may get another, very similar shot, but under different (typically less optimal) conditions; it will not be a second chance at the same opening, but the first chance at an altered one.</p>\n<p>Frequently, you do not even get this.

Besides being used to provide structural support for your home, drywall is mounted to the studs to give your house its solid walls. </p>\n<p>After drywall is affixed to the framing of your home, you can, of course, no longer see a wall’s studs with the naked eye. But there are devices which can help you “look” into the wall to find them.</p>\n<p>There are two different kinds of these stud finders which each help you locate studs in a different way:</p>\n<h2>Magnetic Stud Finders</h2>\n<p>The more rudimentary type of stud finder uses a magnet. </p>\n<p>Magnetic stud finders don’t actually locate studs. Instead, they locate metal fasteners (like nails and screws) that fasten the drywall onto the studs. As you slide the magnetic stud finder across the wall, its magnet will stick to the wall when you’ve come across a metal fastener; if there’s a metal fastener, there must be a stud that it’s fastened to. </p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138476\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studybuddyzigzag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studybuddyzigzag.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studybuddyzigzag-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p>Any high-powered magnet can work as a magnetic stud finder. But there are ones made for the purpose like the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EM6IlN\">StudBuddy</a>, which you can pick up for $10 at most home improvement stores. Just run it back and forth across your wall in a zig-zag pattern. When the StudBuddy sticks to the wall, you’ve found your stud. You can leave the StudBuddy on the wall to act as your stud marker. No need to mark up your wall with pencil. </p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138484\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studbuddy2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studbuddy2.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studbuddy2-320x252.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p>The upside of a magnetic stud finder is that it’s cheap, easy to use, and accurate. </p>\n<p>Its downside is that you can spend a long time running it up and down and across the wall to find a metal fastener so that you can find the stud. This is the big reason why most people have upgraded to . . .</p>\n<h3>Electronic Stud Finders</h3>\n<p>Electronic stud finders use capacitance to help you locate a stud behind the drywall. If you’re interested in the details of how capacitance works, <a href=\"https://home.howstuffworks.com/question271.htm\">read this article</a>. The short and dirty explanation is that an electronic stud finder can sense when there’s a density change behind your drywall. When it senses more density, thar be your stud, matey, and the stud finder will start lighting up to tell you so.</p>\n<p>Below, I show you how to use an electronic stud finder. In the demo, I’m using a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3o2EIEr\">Zircon stud finder that locates the edges of studs</a>. Zircon has stud finders that can pinpoint where the center of the stud is, but they’re more expensive.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-138462 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studfinder1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studfinder1.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/studfinder1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Place the stud finder on the wall.</strong> Press the button only <em>after</em> you’ve placed the stud finder on the wall. If you press it before doing so, you’ll get an erroneous reading. Slowly move the stud finder from left to right. Keep it level as you do.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138464\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/first_edge_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/first_edge_1.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/first_edge_1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>3. When your stud finder lights up, make a faint mark with a pencil.</strong> This is the outside edge of your stud.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138465\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/stud-finder_swipe2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/stud-finder_swipe2.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/stud-finder_swipe2-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>4. Place the stud finder a few inches to the right of your mark</strong>, and slowly move the stud finder left. If your stud finder lights up, make another faint mark. This is the opposite outside edge of your stud.</p>\n<p>The middle of those two marks is the center of your stud. You can drive a nail or screw into your wall at that point, and it will be secure.</p>\n<p>FYI, most studs are 2×4’s, but if you’ve <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/primer-on-lumber/\">read our primer on lumber</a>, you know that a 2×4 isn’t actually 2 inches x 4 inches; it’s 1.5 inches x 3.5 inches. The way studs are placed in the wall, your markings on the wall should be 1.5 inches apart, so the center of the two markings will be at the .75 inch line.</p>\n<p>Once you know where the middle of one stud is, you can easily find the center of the studs that are to the left or right of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/tape-measure-guide/\">Using your trusty tape measure</a>, place the 0 line on the center of the stud you’ve marked off on the wall. Extend your tape measure out. See how the 16″ mark on your tape measure is surrounded by a red square? That indicates the standard (in the United States) 16-on-center spacing between studs. Bam! That’s where the center of your next stud is.</p>\n<p>Most modern electronic stud finders are pretty reliable, but I’ve had issues with some. I’ve had instances where the electronic stud finder will give multiple readings of where a stud is located and all those readings were different from each other by a half inch, leaving me scratching my head wondering where the stud actually is. On the glitchy ones I’ve had problems with, I usually end up hammering a very small nail into the wall to verify that the stud finder did indeed find the stud.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for speed in finding a stud, go with an electronic stud finder; if you’re looking for consistent accuracy, go with with a magnetic one.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Find a Stud If You Don’t Have a Stud Finder</span></h2>\n<p>What if you don’t have a stud finder on hand? How can you find a stud behind drywall?</p>\n<p>You’ll need to become a stud detective.</p>\n<p><strong>Flashlight method.</strong> Shine a flashlight at an angle against the wall. You may (the operative word here is <em>may</em>) be able to see a column of slight bumps. Those are the nails used to fasten the drywall to the stud, and that column of bumps indicates where the center of the stud is.</p>\n<p>Again, this may or may not work depending on how deep the nails were driven into the drywall and the amount of paint or plaster you’ve got over your wall.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138486\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/floorboard3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/floorboard3.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/floorboard3-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><strong>Check the baseboards for nail holes.</strong> Baseboards are usually (operative word <em>usually</em>) nailed to a stud.

If you hit some resistance, you’ve found the stud.</p>\n<p>To find the center of the stud that the outlet or switch is attached to, just measure .75 inches from the outside of the outlet. Put a mark.

Now you can find the center of all the studs to the left or right of that stud.</p>\n<p><strong>Verify by driving a small nail into the wall.</strong> If you go with one of these methods, you’ll want to verify by driving a small nail into the wall. If the nail doesn’t hit wood, you’ve missed the stud.

After the show’s over, check out our show notes at aom.is/strangers.</p>\n<p>Alright, Joe Keohane, welcome to the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Thanks so much, Brett. I’m happy to be here.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So you got a new book out called The Power of Strangers: The Benefits of Connecting in a Suspicious World, and it’s all about talking to strangers. I’m curious what kick-started this, and this book is really in-depth, you go into the psychology, the anthropology, the sociology of talking to strangers. What kick-started this journey?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, I definitely ended up going down a series of rabbit holes for this one. So basically, I was raised by people who talk to strangers a lot. I grew up in Boston, my parents are super chatty. I grew up watching them… Watching the benefits of this to their lives, like watching them just having more fun and making more friends and that sort of thing. So it was never weird to me in a way that it’s weird to a lot of people, I think. But I realized at a certain point that I had kind of stopped doing it. I was never as good at it as they were, like they’re relentless, they’ll lean across the table in a crowded restaurant and start talking to people and somehow make it work. It’s amazing, like how deft they are at this stuff, they’re just very social people. And I was always pretty good about it, I would talk to people in bars, I would talk to people in coffee shops and stuff like that; on the subway sometimes, which I know is a big violation of a long-standing social rule. But I realized one day as I was going into a CVS that I kept choosing the self-checkout line, and then I realized that I had just been kind of avoiding talking to strangers.</p>\n<p>I’d go to a bar and I wouldn’t talk to anybody, and stare at my phone. I was like… Everything was automated to the extent possible. I would use my phone to accomplish everything that I used to have to talk to strangers in order to do, like asking for directions and stuff like that. So for me I started wondering what changed, ’cause I certainly didn’t make a decision to stop doing this. In my past, I had had good experiences talking to people oftentimes it would be hilarious, it would be poignant, it would be interesting, it would be a good diversion. So why did I stop? And for me, the reason was two-fold. Number one, I had a young kid and I had a demanding job, so I was tired, I was stretched thin, I was stressed out, and so the prospect of just mustering the attentional resources to talk to someone, which can be significant, they just weren’t there. I was just burnt out. So I would go to a bar, on the rare occasion that I would go to a bar, and I would just sit there quietly. But I would stare at Twitter or something like that, then I would come away feeling sort of bad about myself and about humanity, as one does after mainlining Twitter for a while.</p>\n<p>So that was a big part of it. And then the other part for me was just the phone. When you have a smartphone and you’re of a certain position, you really don’t have to ever talk to anyone again. That’s what it comes down to. So anything that you need to do, from ordering pizza to asking for directions for stuff like that, even just for entertainment and company, if you’re in a public place, you never have to do any of that anymore. And I felt that I had lost something. I felt that my life was a little less rich and a little less surprising as a result of it. So after I asked questions about myself, I started asking bigger questions about, why don’t other people talk to strangers, what are the things that keep us from doing it, and what are some of the benefits that can come of choosing to live life this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And I’m sure everyone listening to this podcast has experienced that same sort of thing. If given the choice between looking at their phone and talking to a stranger, most people are going to look at their phone. We’re not gonna talk to a stranger.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Right. It’s easier. It’s like the human wiring basically goes toward whatever is more efficient, whatever is easier. The question is, is it good for you? It might be easier, but do you feel good after you do it, do you feel more connected, do you feel healthy? That sort of thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And you start off the book highlighting research that shows that talking to strangers is good for us. I think oftentimes we think, oh, yeah, it’s not gonna be enjoyable, it’s gonna be awkward. But there’s a lot of research showing that once you talk to a stranger, you actually feel great about the experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, yeah, for sure. It’s interesting, ’cause strangers have been a part of the lives of humans for quite some time now, right, but only in the last 15 years or so have psychologists started to study what happens; what happens when we do talk to strangers and what might keep us from doing it. And the consensus so far, and this has been replicated in studies from Toronto to Turkey, involving men, women, people of various ethnicities, genders, races, nationalities, is that even after a relatively passing interaction with a stranger, so like a nice little chat with the kid at Starbucks or something, makes people feel happier. It makes them feel more connected to the place that they live, it makes them feel more optimistic about people, it makes them feel less lonely, which is really important at a time of epidemic loneliness, and that was something that existed before Covid, so that is obviously worse now. Makes them feel more trusting. Done in a certain context and with a certain purpose it can alleviate partisanship, it can alleviate prejudice, things like that. It really is remarkably powerful. And I stress that that can be a pleasant little interaction, and it can range all the way to one of those times when you just end up talking to someone on a plane and it’s a pretty meaningful conversation. I think we’ve all had those from time to time too.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Yeah. We’ve had one of the researchers, Gillian Sandstrom, on the podcast…</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Talking about her research.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> I love Gillian, she’s the best.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Yeah. And her whole thing was like she noticed she wasn’t talking to the hot dog stand person anymore, and so she… Why is that? And what happens when I start talking to people? And what was interesting too, the research shows that, like I said, most people, they think they’re gonna hate it. If you ask them before, okay, you’re gonna go talk to a stranger, how do you think it’s gonna go? And they’re like, oh, that sounds terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Right. They think it’s gonna be a disaster. Right. Yeah, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Right. But then it goes swimmingly. It’s like, wow, that was fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Right, yeah, we’ve definitely been poisoned against it to a certain degree. You know, Gillian’s done a lot of good work on the pessimism that people feel. And other psychologists, like Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago and Juliana Schroeder who was his student for a while who’s now in California, they were interested in that too. They were on the subway in Chicago and they were wondering why the subway was filled with people, members of a hyper-social species, right, like we’re a successful species because we’re so good at being social, and no one would talk to each other. So they wanted to get into that too. But, for sure, people worry that they’re not gonna know how to do it, that they’re gonna suck at it, they’re gonna sound ridiculous, they’re gonna be rejected. If they do start the conversation, they’re gonna run out of things to say, that people are gonna think they’re boring. There are so many reasons why people are pessimistic about these interactions. And you can go deeper too, you can look at generations of Stranger Danger propaganda that has been directed at kids. I grew up in the ’80s, so my entire childhood was like cops coming into my class and telling me that everyone I didn’t know in the world was a threat to me; it turns out that’s not a great thing to tell kids, and also it’s not based on any statistics. We’re much more likely to be harmed by someone we know than by a stranger, by a long shot.</p>\n<p>So all these things, yeah, all these things amount to make people think that this is gonna go badly. That the stranger might be dangerous, that the stranger is gonna think that they’re boring, all these things. And for a lot of people, these seem insurmountable. The good news is that the research has found that when people do make the effort to do it, they are surprised by how well it goes. And I think this is where the low expectations actually help, because the bar is so low that people are like, whoa, I wasn’t murdered, this is fantastic. But it really does seem to go well, and we’ve seen that again and again and again in the research, and I talked to so many people for this book and they all reported the same thing back.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And it’s interesting too, it’s not only the people who wanna initiate stranger talk, small talk, think it’s gonna go bad. People who, if you tell them like, hey, a stranger’s gonna come up and talk to you, how would that go? And they’re like, I would hate that. But even if they’re the one who has the stranger talk foisted upon them, they love it too. Like, this is great, I’m so glad someone took the time to talk to me. Alright, so our idea or perception of what stranger talk will be like, completely off. We think it’s gonna be terrible, but usually we end up enjoying it and there’s all these benefits to it. So why does talking to strangers make us feel so good? Like why is it that we, as human beings, enjoy talking to people we don’t know?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, it kind of cuts… You gotta go deeper into human history for this, and it’s… All of this stuff is pretty complicated, so there’s no real pat answer to this question. It’s a great question. I think it has to do with the fact that we’re a social species, we’re a hyper-social species. We are the rarer animal that can communicate and cooperate with strangers, relatively easily, right? We certainly can be horrible to strangers too, we have kind of a switch. We can be super xenophobic, we can be super dehumanizing and violent, but we can also be remarkably cooperative and remarkably open to interacting with and connecting with people that we don’t know. And that’s in many ways the secret of the success of the human species, is that the foundation of civilization, of human civilization, of all societies is the ability, or most many societies, is the ability to cooperate with strangers.</p>\n<p>And that was… We were so successful at that for so long, that through this process that evolutionary biologists referred to as culture gene co-evolution, it basically means that if you do something long enough, if a species does something long enough that leads to its success, it will become encoded in the genes, and there’ll be like a certain pleasure that comes from it, there’ll be an incentive to do that. There is an incentive to expand our social networks because expanding social networks is like the key to human civilization, it’s how you scale innovation, it’s how you meet new mates, it’s how you diversify your gene pool, all these things that are really important. So the thinking is that it feels good because it’s good for us, right? Because we are hyper-social, because we need to do this in order to continue the species, but also because on a chemical level this is good for us. We require socializing. When we don’t socialize, when we don’t get enough social contact, we start to get depressed, you start to see rising levels of social anxiety, mental illness, things like that. You start to see fractures in society when people start to feel lonely. We’re really wired for it, in a really profound way.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And you paint this picture and you go into detail on just sort of our circles, social circles, have just continually gotten bigger and bigger as the species has progressed. And early on it might have been just like your kin, but then our concepts of like, what is kin, it expanded. It’s like, well, if you wear the same kind of jewelry as me then we might be related, so I might not know you but we’re kind of the same. And it just kept on getting bigger and bigger until we started developing cultures and civilizations. And you point at the fact that we often typically think of ancient civilizations or even hunter-gatherers as fiercely tribal, they only care about their own, but you point out, if you look closely enough, pretty much all ancient cultures, all ancient civilizations, had very robust moral laws about how to treat strangers. Can you walk through some of these stranger rules?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, yeah, so I went deep into the anthropological record to look into how hunter-gatherer groups dealt with strangers, because our popular conception of what humans are like is that we’re tribal, and there’s this idea that we have just lived in our own groups without strangers for 99% of our entire existence on earth. And it turns out that it’s more complicated than that. It turns out that, according to field research that’s been done, and this is kind of best guess, because people weren’t writing diaries a million years ago, but based on the field research that’s been done over the last 300 years or so, that a lot of hunter-gatherer groups did figure out ways to admit strangers to their groups. And one way they would do it is by something called greeting rituals. Which is, it was like a ritualized way of interacting that allowed the stranger to demonstrate that they weren’t violent or crazy or dangerous.</p>\n<p>And there’s a lot of research into this too, how we have a very pessimistic reading of strangers, we tend to believe that they might not have the willpower that we have, or the self-control that we have, or the internal life that we have, and so the greeting rituals were a way to establish for strangers to show that they have self-control, that they know the rules, that they’re respectful, that they’re curious, that they’re not gonna be an agent of chaos. And as a result of the development of those greeting rituals, it allowed for a great deal of traffic between hunter-gatherer bands. And according to some pretty good research on this by an anthropologist named Douglas Fry, it allowed… That traffic of people between hunter-gatherer groups was like a hedge against violence.</p>\n<p>Right? So you think about it. So, Brett, you’re in one band, I’m in another band. My cousin leaves my band and goes to your band. Now, there’s maybe some sort of conflict or some sort of tension between both of our bands. If I didn’t know anyone in your band, I would be like, those aren’t even people, we can just kill them and take their water, take their food. But because my cousin’s over there, I will stop and be like, well, my cousin’s over there, he’s not a bad guy, maybe we can talk; maybe I can talk to my cousin and he can talk to the rest of the people. So the idea there is that that’s the basis of human civilization, the ability to do that. And they weren’t careless about it, they knew what they were doing, they were very cautious about it, but it allowed them to expand their groups and expand their social networks. And from there you see hunter-gatherer bands expand to whole cultures, like you said, where they’re developing language, they’re developing certain esthetic, like certain headwear, certain beads, things that advertise that they are a member of the group, even if you don’t recognize them and you don’t know who they are. And then from there, you can go all the way up, you can go to chiefdoms, you can go to nations, you can go to the EU, whatever. It goes and goes and goes.</p>\n<p> This is obviously, this is a bit of a stem-winder of an answer, so if I’m going on too long feel free to stop me. But you see a lot of this sort of thing in Western religions, and you see it in ancient Greece, where the ancient religions, the Western religions were devised in a time of violence and war. So in many ways, it’s wartime literature, which accounts for why it’s often so violent. But there’s a lot of rules in there about treating strangers well. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that the formation of those religions helped pave over some of the tribal differences to create a bigger we, right, a bigger us. So when you had a fractured world of a bunch of little warring tribes, it created a more expansive sense of belonging for everyone, it made strangers less strange. You definitely saw a lot of that, that was very important. And for me, I’m a pretty secular guy. I tend to be skeptical of religion even though I was raised Catholic and I did 16 years of Catholic schools, but there’s something inspiring about a species that has the capacity to do that, right?</p>\n<p>To consider someone that they’ve never met who lives a 1000 miles away, to consider them one of their group. For me, that’s something that you can really build on. And clearly for the people who developed religion, or if you’re a religious person, the deity that pass these messages on, you saw a lot in the Old Testament and the New Testament and the Quran, like you have to be good to strangers, you have to be good to strangers, you have to accept strangers. And there are mixed messages in there too, because again it’s wartime literature. But for me that was a really inspiring thing. And ancient Greece was the same way. To violate a stranger, if a stranger came to your town and you harmed them, according to mythology, Zeus would represent the stranger and Zeus would punish you; that’s how important strangers were. Because they needed to create bigger social networks, and they needed to have alliances to be able to live in a pretty chaotic world. So the idea of the stranger became really intertwined with the Divine in those kind of early Western religions and through Greek mythology.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Oh, yeah, and the Greeks are interesting, ’cause they had this whole… It was called Xenia, so basically an etiquette on how to treat strangers, and The Odyssey we typically think of as, oh, it’s a cool adventure story, where Odysseus kills the cyclops and does all this cool stuff, but it really… It’s like the Bible of how to treat strangers. And if you look at it closely, it’s all about what happens when you treat strangers poorly, and then what happens when you treat strangers correctly. The cyclops… Odysseus goes in there, and the nice thing to do… The cyclops should have just like, “Yeah, eat my goat cheese and I’m gonna treat you well.” Instead, he’s like, “I wanna eat you guys. You guys are terrible people. I don’t care if Zeus does anything to me. You guys, I don’t like you ’cause you’re strangers.”</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah. And Odysseus is like, and it’s the funniest part in The Odyssey, where Odysseus is like, “What are you, nuts? Like, why would you harm a stranger?” And you realize the reason why that is so sacred, that was so important to the Greeks, is because it was a chaotic world, you didn’t have central institutions, you didn’t have national armies or police or governments or things like that, necessarily. There was a great deal of conflict. And in order to travel in that world, and in order to flourish in that world and develop trading relationships and all the stuff you have to do, you needed to be able to make friends, you needed to make alliances. So when a stranger came to town, it was a big deal, it was an opportunity, right? It was an opportunity to make a friend, to learn something about the world, to get news, to maybe gain access to an innovation, and it was reciprocal, right, so you would host the stranger who to you is literally Zeus. Like Zeus is watching you as you did this, this was the belief. It’s just like with Christianity, it’s kind of the same thing. Jesus is entwined with the stranger, protects the stranger. That you would host this person, you’d give them lots of food, you’d be really good to them, maybe they stay a couple of days, whatever, but now you have an ally later.</p>\n<p>So if you need a favor, if you’re traveling through this unstable and dangerous world, there’s a person that you can go crash with. And the idea is the more people who did that, the bigger their social networks became and the easier it became for them to move and for them to live in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Right, yeah. Xenia is hospitality, is how it’s usually translated.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, hospitality. Yeah, hospitality.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Yeah, and what’s interesting, it’s like it’s two ways. So you had to treat the guest a certain way, but the guest had to act a certain way, or else there would be consequences for that. If you look at The Odyssey, the suitors were… Odysseus just slaughters all the suitors. Well, the suitors were just violating Xenia, they were just free-loading off of Odysseus, didn’t care, and there were consequences for that. Grave consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah. That’s exactly right. Yeah, you had to be… Everybody had to be on their best behavior. And this ended up being a big part of the book, is the… Humans, they can be very cooperative, they can be xenophilic, which is the word which means they actually favor strangers in a way under the right circumstances. But I don’t mean to pass it off as being like, “People are great.” People can be good, people can be bad, it depends on the circumstances. But the thing that I kept coming upon from everything from anthropological research to theology, to philosophy to governance, was the need to reconcile the opportunity that the stranger presented with the threat that they might have posed. And the way you did that is through this sort of ritualized behavior, so you do it through hospitality where you both had to demonstrate that you’re not gonna kill each other.</p>\n<p>You can be trusted to a certain degree, you’re gonna host the person, but you’re gonna host them knowing that they’re gonna behave themselves too, and when the time comes, they’re gonna reciprocate. But a lot of it is from hunter-gatherers to the rise of hospitality, was that. It doesn’t mean that people are being hospitable because they think all people are good and lovely and wonderful and interesting, and they wanna talk to them. It was very practical. There was a way of winnowing threat from opportunity and it worked phenomenally well, ’cause again, this is the cornerstone of human civilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Well, that’s okay, this idea that the reason why we are hospitable and treat strangers nice is ’cause we’re kind of afraid of them?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> If you highlight research, this kind of explains the Nordic people. We typically think of them as unfriendly, they’re kind of known for just keeping to themselves, but they’re actually some of the nicest, kindest people. So why is it that they’re really kind of nice, but they’re not friendly?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, because being friendly is being social in a way, and the research that I found, I was wondering… For a while, I thought that as I was trying to figure out why cultures became friendly versus unfriendly to strangers, which turns to be a pretty big question, why places that are unstable tended to be considered more friendly. So like Brazil, for example, Brazilians are amazingly social, a lot of Latin American peoples are super social, but those places don’t have really strong governments, they have a lot of corruption, they have a lot of… Often a lot of crime. And so you would think that being in an unstable place like that would make you more wary of people, and you would think that in Norway, where nothing bad ever happens basically, or Finland or the Nordic countries, you would think that because people trust each other, they trust the system and there are really high levels of social trust, which basically means you trust strangers to not kill you, you would think they’d be friendly because people aren’t a threat. And it turns out to be the opposite. In places where there is instability and there is a little more… It could be more danger, people end up being more friendly because again, you need each other, you need to make those connections in order to live in an unstable place.</p>\n<p>And also you need to winnow the threat from the opportunities, so you need to talk to people to understand what their intentions are. And you wanna demonstrate to them that you’re not a threat. That you mean them no harm and that means maybe you can work together on something, maybe you can exchange information, maybe you can be friends, whatever. You expand your social networks. Whereas you go to a Nordic country, there’s very little social friction. There’s very little need to be social, because the state takes care of everything. And the state’s phenomenally efficient and runs really well and there are very low rates of teen pregnancy and poverty and illiteracy and crime and all that stuff. So people don’t have to be social.</p>\n<p>And as a result, they’re just not. I spent a decent amount of time in Finland trying to figure this out. And the Finns are really sweet people, they’re really nice. It’s a lovely place. Helsinki’s a really nice town, but no one ever talks to strangers because they don’t have to, because they don’t need to rely on other citizens in order to get their business done. They just rely on the state, so you end up with a really introverted culture, whereas you go to Brazil and it’s a very extroverted culture. I thought that was fascinating. And it really is friction makes us social, friction… Socializing is a… You don’t think that friction makes us super xenophobic and it can, but it also creates a very practical need to be social, to be more social with people.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> We’re gonna take a quick break for a word from our sponsors. And now back to the show. Okay, so if talking to strangers makes us feel great, and we’ve developed cultures over thousands of years that have facilitated stranger interaction, why don’t we like to talk to strangers? I guess the Nordics would be like, well, they have a stable, high-trust government that takes care of everything so that would be the answer to them, but why in America, why don’t we like to talk to talk to strangers anymore? What’s going on in us individually, and then also as a culture that makes talking to strangers not seem very pleasant?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, that’s a great question. I would preface it by saying that the US is probably better at talking to strangers than a lot of other places. And the theory behind that is that it was done out of utility. So that kind of freestyle socializing that you get in Americans that Europeans always gonna roll their eyes at, that probably happened as a result of diversity. So over the entirety of our time here, at least post-colonization, there have been a ton of immigrants in America. There have been a lot of different cultures represented, different languages spoken. And there’s this theory that when you have a situation like that, where people can’t rely on one another knowing the same language or having the same social norms, they tend to be friendlier because they need to work a little harder to convey to the other people that they’re cooperative, but also to try to get a sense of where the other person is coming from so they can work together, again, so they can function, so they can expand their social network. So America is pretty friendly generally, certainly compared to… Pretty pro-social, I’ll say social, they’re pretty social, ’cause I found Finns totally friendly too, they’re just very quiet.</p>\n<p>But some of the things that would keep you from doing it… Like I said, the stranger danger propaganda definitely gave us a pretty warped conception or warped perception of what people are like by literally teaching children that every stranger in the world is a threat to them, that’s bad for trust, that’s bad… That gives you a pretty inaccurate view of what the world is, and it makes it more difficult for you to maybe grow your social networks and meet people. I think cities versus small towns is a big thing. People talk to strangers more in small towns, maybe less than cities, just because of overload, there are so many people around that it’s almost disorienting. Where do you even begin? And a lot of people are respectful of one another knowing that we have limited personal space in the city, and as a result, we might be outside, we might be wanting to get a moment to ourselves. But I think over the last few years, I think it’s just been the phone, to be honest, I’m not a Luddite. I love my phone. I text with people all the time, but I think it’s that. I think a mix of the sort of social norms against talking to strangers, the stranger danger stuff, and the phone has combined to take us out of the public realm to a certain degree. And I think the less frequently we interact with strangers, the more daunting it seems to be, and that drives up the pessimism.</p>\n<p>It’s like exercise, you stop exercising for a while, you’re not just gonna get off the couch and run 26 miles, you need to build yourself back up again. I feel like we’re really out of shape socially, and so we really underestimate our social skills. And I think our social skills have probably eroded to a certain degree. I felt like mine certainly did, and I think we need to practice up a little bit, but the research found this, and I found this and a lot of people I talked to found this, that when you do make an effort to do it again, you’ll find that it comes pretty naturally. It’ll take a minute to get used to it again, to readjust to being that alert which is what you have to do, when you talk to a stranger you have to pay attention to so many different parts, so many different moving parts of the interaction from body language to what they’re saying to what you’re gonna say, and all this stuff. But yeah, it’s just getting people over that hump, it’s a mix of these people worrying that they’re gonna be bad at it, and that keeps them from doing it, and the less they do it, the worse they think they’re gonna do, and it’s just this cycle until they just withdraw from the public.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Yeah, humans are lazy. We like to take the path of least resistance. Yeah, like you said, talking, just social interaction is a very… It’s very complex. It’s very engaging. It’s one of the most complex things we do. And so, given the choice between doing this really kind of hard, engaged, complex activity, “I’ll just look at Twitter.” And that’s pretty much anything as opposed to… If the choice is between exercising and watching Netflix, we’re gonna choose Netflix. So you have to be intentional about this.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, you really do. And just because it’s easier, our bias toward efficiency was probably really useful at a certain point, but it’s not useful now if it’s keeping us from getting what we need, which is we need social contact, we really do need social contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So Gillian Sandstrom, one of the things she argues is that the reason that people don’t talk to strangers, they just don’t know how to do it. And they’ve forgotten how to do it like you said ’cause we have the phone. I think one of the things too about the phone that people like, it gives you this incredible sense of control. You can phrase what you’re gonna say perfectly, and you can workshop it with friends, like, is this the right thing to say? You can’t do that on the fly, conversation face-to-face. So you decide, okay, look… You recognize, my skills in talking to people, to strangers has degraded, I need to take a class on how to get better at this. And there’s lots of classes, surprisingly, you think like, “Wow, why is there classes to teach people how to do this very basic, very human thing?” But you went to several. I’m curious, what were some tips that you picked up on how to initiate conversations with strangers?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, I got a lot. I took a class in London with a woman named Georgie Nightingall, which is the greatest English name I’ve ever heard that didn’t come from a Dickens novel. But Georgie runs an organization called Trigger Conversations, and Gillian Sandstrom referred me to Georgie. And I talked to Georgie and she told me she was gonna do a class on talking to strangers. So I bought a plane ticket and I flew to London and I took this class. And what I wanted to do with the book is I wanted to create a road map for people who are just out of circulation. So we’re gonna start from zero. To use the marathon analogy again, we’re gonna start at the couch and we’re gonna rebuild ourselves, my assumption for a lot of people is that they’re just… They’re not doing this. They’re out of shape. They need to get back in shape. So according to Georgie, who created… It’s circuit training for becoming a social animal, again, she would start small and get used to it and get used to confronting the discomfort and kind of questioning the discomfort you feel and observing what people’s reactions are. So Georgie had us start by making eye contact with people. Now, I think in a small town, this is probably a little different, but a city, there’s not a lot of eye contact.</p>\n<p>When you’re walking down the street, you’re not pausing to make eye contact with everyone on 5th Avenue in New York City. So Georgie was like, “Just make eye contact. People you walk by, you just make eye contact and monitor how that feels.” And how it felt was super weird because I wasn’t doing that, and I live in New York. This is not how people usually engage. But I did it for a few days and it started to feel normal and I started to notice that people were actually pretty receptive to it. The ones who noticed kind of lit up at being seen, at being greeted. And from there, Georgie had us just start greeting people, say, “Good morning. I hope you have a good day.” Wishing people well, which again feels really weird and forward, but people really lit up when you did that. I got kind of avant-garde with it, and I started just telling people to, “Give ’em hell out there today.” And stuff like that, and they really liked that and you’d get a laugh and you’d feel good, you felt this little connection, maybe they felt that someone noticed them. Because I think a lot of people don’t really feel noticed all that much, but some of the really good tips beyond that, once you get comfortable with that really rudimentary form of social contact, you can start to do things…</p>\n<p>Georgie had this brilliant idea of when you’re in a situation where someone’s asking you how you are, but they don’t care, and you don’t care either, so you’re buying something in the store and the person is like, “How ya doing?” And you’re like, “Fine, how are you?” “I’m fine” but no information has been exchanged and no one’s really paying attention, to answer those scripted questions with specificity and honesty, and that doesn’t mean, “I have this boil that’s been bothering me.” You wanna be appropriate about it, but Georgie always did this thing where someone would ask how she’s doing at a coffee shop or something, and she would answer numerically. She would say, “I’m about a seven out of 10, I would say.” And then she would say, “How are you?” And so what does this do? This shows the person that something else is happening. This is a different sort of interaction and it’s gonna require their attention. This person is actually engaging with them. And more often than not, the person Georgie was talking to would answer numerically too, “I’m an eight out of a 10.” And then Georgie would say, “What’ll it take to get you to a 9?” And in two seconds, you’re having a conversation, and this doesn’t have to go on forever, this is just a little connection.</p>\n<p>They get a little taste of what it’s like to be you, you get a little taste of what it’s like to be them. If it goes for a bit, if you have a little bit of time, it can go on to some pretty profound places, but as the research shows, even if it’s a little thing, it’ll make us feel better. It’ll make the world feel a little less chaotic, it’ll make us feel better about people. It really is kind of a magic trick in a way.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> You can do this stuff with the cashier, the barista, it doesn’t have to be just random people you walk up to, which you could if you wanted to, but…</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, yeah, it’s… They’re great to practice on, because it’s finite, you’re not gonna… You can’t stand at that cash register for like half an hour. You’re gonna have to do it quick. And it’s just a good way to practice. It’s in a public environment, there’s not gonna be any suspicion or anything because it’s clear what your roles are. You’re a customer, they work in the store, or they’re a waiter, or whatever it is. So a lot of the uncertainty that people have about a stranger is kind of eliminated, when you’re in that sort of context. So it makes it a really good place to practice. So you start with the eye contact and things like that, then you can start practicing in a service context, and then the better you get at it, the quicker you get at it, and the more attentive you get, then you can start doing it in other places too, where the interactions are gonna be much more complicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Another tip I like that she had was, you start with statements, not questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> If you’re doing it in a public place where it’s not the norm to talk to strangers, so a good example is a subway where people don’t really talk to strangers, you can alleviate the fear that you are unhinged, which is everybody’s fear when you’re talking to strangers, that there’s something wrong, because why else would they be talking to someone on the subway? Why else would they be violating a social norm? You can alleviate that just by acknowledging that you’re violating the social norm. It’s called a pre-frame basically, and it’s a way of establishing what the interaction is right out of the gate. So instead of you’re on the train with someone and you just say, “Where’d you get your hat?” That’s gonna put people on the defensive, they’re not gonna know who you are and now you’re asking them questions, “Do I have to answer this question?” When you ask someone a question, you’re basically demanding that they do something, you’re asking something. Instead of doing that, you can pre-frame it by just saying, “Look, I know we’re not supposed to talk to people on the subway, but I really like your hat.” And then leave it there.</p>\n<p>And they’ll probably respond. People are flattered when you notice something about them, as long as it’s appropriate, and maybe they tell you about the hat. And maybe in telling you about the hat, you learn about a trip they took, and then you can talk about a trip, these little things. But to start with that, to start with a statement, to use a pre-frame just to demonstrate out of the gate that there’s not something wrong with you, that you are of sound mind, that you are a human with self-control and self-awareness. And then they tell you about the hat and you just listen. You don’t immediately barge in and start talking about your hat. You just ask questions, ask basic questions. Once they’re comfortable, “Oh, okay. You got this hat in New Hampshire. Do you go to New Hampshire often?” “Oh yeah, I used to go there as a kid. Blah, blah, blah.” And then you can go from there. But you do need to kinda leave it in their court a little bit and be very respectful, and if they’re not interested in talking, you have to respect that and just thank them and pull away.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So one argument I’ve heard why people wouldn’t wanna do this, they’d be like, “Well, that sort of stranger talk, it’s very shallow and superficial, it’s small talk. It’s not meaningful. So it’s a waste of time.” What would you say to those people?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, I was definitely one of those people. I’d die inside every time someone asked me what I do for a living. And I really like what I do for living. People don’t understand what small talk is. So there’s a social anthropologist named Kate Fox in the UK who studied this, she studied weather talk in England. And the English are notorious for this. They always talk about weather and people make fun of them for it because they think it’s an indication that they don’t have anything else to talk about. But Fox’s finding was that it’s not a conversation, it’s a bonding ritual. So small talk isn’t about the exchange of information, it’s not supposed to be the state of the entire interaction. What it does is that it shows that you’re both of sound mind and that you’re experiencing something together. So when you talk about the rain, “It’s raining out.” okay, I know this person at least understands that it’s raining outside, so maybe we can talk. But it’s a way of just getting people comfortable with one another, establishing that you’re in the presence of this other person, that maybe you’re experiencing something together, maybe you’re watching a street performer, maybe there’s a snowstorm.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, and then going from there. So the trick with small talk is to use it just to have that initial engagement and just to make yourself more comfortable and make them more comfortable, and then from there, you can have a real interaction. The problem is when people get stuck in that stage, it’s brutal, it’s horrible. There’s research that shows that small talk, if you do it enough, it’s just bad for you, it just rots your insides. And I certainly feel that way as a pathologically impatient person, that I hate it, but now I understand what it is. And there are certain tweaks that you can do to get out of the small talk. So say, you’re talking to someone at a networking event or something like that, the first question is always, “What do you do?” What you can do instead of saying, “What do you do?” Which is usually interpreted as a signal that you don’t care and you have nothing to offer and this is gonna be another soul-deadening small talk conversation, flip it, flip the question and ask, “What would you like to do more of?” You know what I mean? So you can ask them what they do and they can tell you and then say, “Okay, let me ask you another question. What would you like to do more of?” And that gets you right into a real conversation.</p>\n<p>So the small talk part establishes the hint of a connection, it starts the conversation. The goal is to get out of there as quick as possible. And for me, “What would you like to do more of?” Is one of the best ways to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> When you started doing this or talking to strangers, beginning with small talk, a lot of times I imagine the conversation maybe stopped after two or three minutes, it was very on the surface. And that’s fine. You still felt good after your experience, how often did your small talk with a stranger switch over to more of a deep conversation?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> It depended on the context. If you’re waiting in line or something that’s not gonna go that long, you do have to be sitting with a person for quite some time. On planes… And I know this tends to drive people crazy too, or at least people have very pessimistic idea of conversations with strangers on planes ’cause you’re captive so I would caution people who do wanna initiate conversations on planes or buses, be very mindful of the reaction that the person is giving you. Don’t be oblivious to the social cues that they’re giving off that they don’t wanna talk to you, but yeah, I literally took a 48-hour train trip across the country just to see what kind of conversations I would have. And I had extraordinarily good conversations. People were fascinating. I took this Amtrak train from Chicago to LA, those went really well. And almost every single conversation I had was like an hour-long conversation ’cause we were there, we were in the same space. We had all the time in the world. If I’m talking to someone on the subway, it kind of depends on when I’m getting off, but I’ve had 20-minute conversations on the subway too that were great, that were really interesting and illuminating and that I still think about today.</p>\n<p>It just has to do with the context and you do have to be really aware of what else is going on, so you can’t be the chatter box in line at the supermarket when there are 10 people waiting behind you, you gotta be very alert to everything to the conversation you’re having, but also the effect that you might be having on the people around you.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Speaking of being aware of context, how do you deal with rejection, let’s say you try to initiate a conversation and you’re getting a vibe that this person doesn’t want anything to do with you, how do you deal with that without deciding, oh, humanity is terrible, I’m gonna stop doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, Georgie Nightingall’s idea is that most of the time what we interpret as rejection isn’t even rejection, it might be confusion because this is… It can be unusual if you initiate a conversation on the subway or something or on a sidewalk in a city, people just aren’t gonna understand what it is, ’cause they’re not waiting for it, they’re not expecting it. And so sometimes people might walk away or they might turn away, and it’s not because they have rejected you, it’s because they’re just sort of confused, and so Georgie’s advice on this that she told us is, if you say something and people don’t seem to get it, you can just say it again. That’s okay. If people are rejecting you, if people are fleeing from you, if people are being, God forbid, someone’s alarmed by you, then you have to pull away. I didn’t have any experiences like that, certainly, there was a great deal of confusion when I would start talking to people, but once you’ve got adept enough at this, you could make it clear what this was, what you’re interested in and what you were asking about or what you were saying, and people would go along for the ride. I think once you get past that initial hump, people were amazingly receptive.</p>\n<p>And I can’t say… Some people weren’t really game, but it was still kind of fun to do, I can’t say that I was rejected at any point, and the research by Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder, and they’ve done this in Chicago and in London, found that the chance of actual rejection was very, very low, but it really is just making it clear to the person what’s happening here and making them feel comfortable, and then the research shows that these conversations can even go like three times longer than people anticipated they would go.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So here in America, there’s a lot of polarization politically, and this idea of talking to a stranger who might be completely different from us, see the world different from us is… It’s fraught, “I don’t know if I wanna do that.” There’s been a lot of research saying how we’re starting to sort politically, the different neighborhood zip codes, etcetera, or sort of segregating ourselves, how can talking to strangers overcome the polarization that we’re seeing in our country?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane: </strong>Yeah, so polarization is basically when it gets extreme, like it has now, it’s a form of dehumanization, and the way people talk about their opponents on the other side of the aisle is that they aren’t like us culturally, but also just we tend to believe that our political opponents in times like this, they don’t have the same will power we have, they’re just obedient cogs in a machine, they’re not individuals like we are, like we are the snowflakes. We’re so much smarter and we’re savvy and we’re subtle, we have nuanced thoughts and everything, and those people over there are just like a witless machine. That’s dehumanization, and it can turn very bad obviously, and it’s turning very bad right now. But what talking strangers does is that it makes it virtually impossible to maintain a really simplistic idea of what a person is, of who a person is and who a representative of a group is. So I spent a decent amount of time with a group called Braver Angels, at that their convention in St. Louis, which is just a group that literally teaches Democrats and Republicans to sit across from each other and have a conversation, and it turns out that that’s a really complicated, difficult thing to do, just so far gone we are, that we need to be trained to do something that we’ve been doing since we were in nursery school.</p>\n<p>And a big part of it is making sure that these people talk as individuals before they talk as members of their cliques, of their parties, and so they sit them down and they just give them questions. They say, where are you from? What brought you here? Why are you interested in this? Do you have kids? Are you married? Do you have any pets? Like just small talk stuff. And again, this is the importance of small talk, is that it demonstrates across party lines that the other person is an individual, that the other person is complex, that the other person is intelligent and respectful, and they kinda hang out there for a while, and then the questions get a little more heavy as they go through, but they’ve established this connection, they’ve established that they both believe one another are full human beings, and only once you’ve secured that bond can you move on to more difficult things, and this is basically the opposite of how political discussion happens in America, which is always just like, okay, abortion, gun control, go, and then people fight and no one talks and no one listens and nothing ever gets done and it just keeps getting worse.</p>\n<p>So you need to foster those connections, those personal connections, and you need to reinforce the idea that the other people, the other block, it consists of individuals that have thoughts of their own, and maybe those people are interesting and maybe you talk enough, maybe there is something you can agree on. You’re not gonna solve all of the big problems this way, you’re probably not gonna solve any of the big problems this way, but it’s a start. The thinking with Braver Angels is that if you can get charming enough and comfortable enough with one another that you live in a town together and you can fix some potholes, then that’s great. That’s a start. That builds up a little bit of trust. It demonstrates that we can work together, that we are reasonable, and then you can scale it from there, that’s the idea, but it really is like you have to make an effort to deny yourself the idea that other people are simpler than you are. That’s a really important thing. In a time like this, it’s critical.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And I imagine that’s why conversations about politics online, particularly Twitter are so fraught, ’cause it’s so easy to dehumanize ’cause you don’t even see anybody. It’s like it’s just an app, digital avatar.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Yeah, it’s like you take a view and then you invent a fictitious person based on that view and then you rage against that person, you don’t see the entirety of the person, and you can certainly do that if you use… If you go online with a certain discipline and a certain intent, you can have extraordinarily good exchanges with strangers online, but you just have to resist the temptation to dismiss and be contemptuous of people, you really have to ask questions, you have to be curious. You know, I had a guy from Texas who threatened to kill me one time over a story I wrote and sent me a threatening email saying he’d kill me if I ever came to Texas, and I didn’t have a lot to do that day, this was a few years ago, and I was like, you know, I’m gonna write back to this guy, I’m gonna push back and demonstrate to him like, look, I’m a guy, I’m a person like you are. Maybe we can talk about this. And it worked great. By the end of it, he was inviting me to Texas to drink. But that’s the sort of stuff, resisting the temptation, the self-righteous thrill of dismissing and being contemptuous of someone else is really important if we’re gonna repair some of the political damage that’s been done in this country, but I do think it’s not a silver bullet, it’s gonna say 20 years to fix this damage, but this is where it starts.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So how has your life changed since writing this book and starting to talk to strangers on the regular?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> It made me weirdly optimistic in a way that I wasn’t before, I work in a cynical business, I work in journalism, I was raised by funeral directors and a family of funeral directors, so I’m not by nature, a super sunny-minded person, I am skeptical, I can be cynical, I can be pessimistic. But what I found is that talking to as many people as I could made me feel better about humanity at a time when everybody felt worse about humanity. And this is a thought I had after I finished the book. I think it comes down to the data that you get when you make a habit of talking to more people you don’t know.</p>\n<p>I think when your perception of the world is fueled by social media and by the media, which is overwhelmingly negative, that’s the incentive structure, that’s the business, you get a really warped perception of what everyone is like, you see some jerk on Twitter and you’re like, ah, people are disgusting, there are certainly some terrible things happening, there are some people who can be really awful, but when that’s coloring your perception of humans, that’s really unhealthy. When you do go out and you interact with people in person, and you find… And the research found this, and then I found it, and a lot of other people found it, that it goes well, that people are receptive and people are interesting, and people are pretty good, it gives you better data, it gives you more complete data and it allows you to create maybe a more accurate perception of what people are like.</p>\n<p>So for me, I think that was the case. I just got so good at talking to people all the time that it became part of my life, and I literally made new friends. I actually made new friends while doing this book, but I feel a little bit better. I feel a little bit more secure in the world, and I find that especially when I have interactions with people from different groups than me, I find that that’s a hedge against generalization, and I think it’s really valuable, and I think gaining perspective into the lives of people who are different than we are is the road to wisdom. I think it’s the road to good citizenship. I think it’s really, really, really valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Well, Joe, this has been a great conversation, where can people go to learn more about the book and your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> The book is called The Power of strangers. It’s available anywhere books are sold. I’m on Twitter @JoeKeohane. I have a fairly bare-bones website, joekeohane.net. But yeah, that’s about it. But you can get the book anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Fantastic. Well, Joe Keohane, thanks for your time. It’s been a pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Keohane:</strong> Thanks, Brett.

Thanks for having me.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So you’ve got a book called Exercise for Mood and Anxiety: Proven Strategies for Overcoming Depression and Enhancing Well-being, and you’re a psychologist, and you’ve taken a look at exercise, but you’re taking a look at exercise, the mental health benefits of exercise. I think most times when you see research about the benefits of exercise, it’s always in the physiological, how it helps your heart, your muscles… What led you down the path to exploring the psychological benefits of exercise?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, as I have been interested in getting good treatment to people with mood and anxiety problems, and as a psychologist, as you just mentioned, I’ve been a big fan of psychotherapy, trained in cognitive behavior therapy or CBT. I like the evidence for that treatment, and I’m heavily involved in the implementation of it locally, but also through trainings and so forth. And I also really appreciate medications, I think they have an important role in the treatment of mental health problems, anxiety and mood disorders. And when you take a look at how these two fare, they do really well. There’s a good evidence base for CBT, it produces strong effects. Same is true for medications, but as you could probably expect, a lot of people also don’t do very well with CBT or don’t do very well with medications. And even if they could, let’s say they have the right disposition to respond well to these interventions, they may not have access to it, to CBT, like, I can’t find a good provider, or they may not care for it.</p>\n<p>Some people just don’t like talk therapy or they don’t like taking medications, and I think it’s up to us people who research these kind of interventions who are invested in getting good treatments out to people is to increase the offering. I’m really excited to see the expansion of digital health products, I think that’s gonna help a great deal, and when I think about what’s available and what should be part of the offering, I think exercise should be part of that. And exercise has strong effects for mood and anxiety disorders and the later problems, and I also think that exercise fits in well for people who come to see us. Most people, they come to see us obviously for symptom relief, and that’s for the medications and psychotherapy can really be effective. The most people actually come, not just for that, but they just want a better life, they want to increase their well-being, and I think exercise is part of that picture for most people.</p>\n<p>If you ask people who are physically active, “What does it do for you?” People will say, “It improves my well-being, it makes me feel physically better, and the direction from physical health to mental health is there.” If you feel physically better, you often feel mentally better as well. And it’s been rewarding to be involved in sort of pushing this out as one of many available strategies for people who struggle with mood and anxiety problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Alright. So the goal is to increase the offerings or the options for people who have some mental health issue. So let’s talk about exercise. In the book, you highlight a lot of research that talks about the mental health benefits of exercise. For example, what do we know about the benefits of exercise for mitigating or managing depression?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> For depression, the evidence base is actually really pretty good, the gold standard for interventions is to do a randomized controlled trial, and that’s how we study drugs, that’s how we study psychological treatments, and when you look at those trials for exercise, they yield effects that are comparable to what we see in direct therapies and psychotherapy, so it’s good, it’s not as strong as these two established interventions, but mostly because there’ve been just fewer studies, so when you look at the size of the evidence base, it’s less, but when you look at the effects, it’s about equally effective. There’ve only been a handful of studies that have actually compared exercise to, let’s say, medications for psychotherapy, there are few in number, they’re small in size, but when you look at those exercise [0:05:34.3] ____ actually pretty well in terms of tolerability, drop out rates are about similar to those interventions and the effects are about comparable as well, so that evidence base is what gives us the comfort of suggesting this as a prescription for people with mild to modern forms of depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And what about anxiety? Is there any research about exercise and anxiety?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> There is and often I actually studied mostly in medical population, so anxiety among people who have a chronic illness and less so in the anxiety disorders, let’s say, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, evidence is growing there, but much smaller in number. But the findings that are out there today also suggests that the effects are really pretty good, and to where I feel comfortable making a part of the offering and say when I look at these trials and look at the effects, I think it shows that exercise does definitely better than doing nothing, and in many cases, also better than what is a reasonable control, like stretching or something else that is of a minimal intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> I know the research is limited, but has any research been done about particular types of exercise being particularly useful for specific type of mood disorder? I guess the question, I mean like, do you prescribe like, okay, if you’re depressed, do cardio or if you’re anxious do yoga, is there anything like that, or is it basically just any type of exercise will give you benefits no matter your mood disorder?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, I think if we just stick with the evidence, and that’s never a bad idea, if we stick with the evidence, we’d say if you follow the Public Health guidelines for exercise, which is like 75 minutes of vigorous or 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week, aerobic, with a combination of some strength training, put you in a good position to see the effects over a few months, and that’s… I’m saying that because that’s often the dose has been studied in these large randomized controlled trials, so that’s a safe bet, but I think we’re starting to see and some initial research here that an effective exercise prescription for people with any mood or anxiety disorder or whatever they present with is going to require that you really take into account their preferences in terms of what they would like to do and what they think they can do, as well as the targets.</p>\n<p>And let me speak a little bit more about the targets, targets, I think about let’s take someone with a mood problem where you find that isolation, for example, is a big factor in their depressed mood, then an exercise program that involves social activity, so a group like exercise or exercise with a buddy is likely going to be more effective in getting them their effects than if they are exercising on their own, preference is to most people, particularly those who come to us who are inactive, don’t necessarily have a positive experience with exercise or a history with exercise, they don’t necessarily like exercise otherwise, often they will be doing it.</p>\n<p>And so exercise, I often equate it with hard work, we’re running, running outside, running in the heat, running in the cold, and those are not the things that you wanna start with with someone who already is suffering from depressed mood and who has a hard time engaging in values based actions, and so much of the work upfront is really about getting a good sense of what it is that a person might be interested in doing and going over a list of different possible activities that count as exercise, and that’s often where you start, and so for some people that might be taking a yoga class, or for other people that might be taking up swimming, for others that might be playing tennis, any kind of exercise that is often different from aerobic, and that might be a really good starting point for people to start forming an exercise habit, and to also recognize that over time, that exercise habit might change, so as people get more comfortable with, let’s say a yoga activity and more comfortable with actually making that part of their weekly habit.</p>\n<p>Tuesday mornings is an hour that I reserve for yoga and they may be more interested and willing and able to pick up or add another activity that may be a bit more strenuous, more strongly in aerobics, so they may go from an easy so-to-speak yoga to more of a power yoga, or they may find another class that’s available at the gym that they attend, and so I am a big believer in spending a good amount of time with people at the beginning to get a sense of what they think they might like, list those activities, and then time again to what the targets are for them, and then start building that exercise program over time, making sure that you stay flexible, that that program likely will change as people get more used to activity in general.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So with a lot of mental health interventions, whether it’s talk therapy or drugs, and sometimes it takes a while before you see the effect… Totally. With cognitive behavioral therapy, it’s not something you… Oftentimes, you don’t notice it right away. Is it the same thing with exercise, does the benefit take a while, or once people start moving their body, do they notice a mark difference?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s one of the beauties of exercise and particularly exercise for mental health, we often think about exercise for physical health, and let’s say we think about a weight loss as something that is going to take a while, and so the distance between starting the exercise or the activity and the desired outcome is a long time, and I think that’s actually also true for stable reductions in depressed mood, when you think about these large randomized controlled trials, they often go for three months and then assess where people are in terms of their depressed mood for that particular week. And then the follow-up period. But as I said, the beauty for exercises that most people, even if they don’t enjoy the actual activity, and that is the during the activity, they report it being difficult and challenging, they will report a nice reduction from how they felt in terms of stress, retention or depressed mood before the activity, relative to after the activity, so you get that immediate boost of like, “Hey, I did the exercise, that may have been really difficult, but man, I feel much better now than I did at the beginning”. And we use that usually has the hook to get people interested and curious about making this part of their regular habit, is pay attention to what exercise does for you that particular day.</p>\n<p> I usually tie exercise prescription to what is relevant to a person for that particular day, let’s say I take someone who gets really stressed by attending work meetings, and they have a big meeting on a Thursday… I might say, “Hey, this meeting is at Thursday at noon. Can we plan an exercise bout, let’s say in the morning, so that you feel the effects of exercise before you go into that meeting, fare better in that meeting in terms of feeling a bit more stress resistant, a little less reactivity during that meeting, so that at the end of that day you look back, you can say, “Hey, this really worked for me, like today, even though it was difficult this morning when I woke up and I decided to do that activity it paid off for me immediately, and that’s a reason for me to continue to do it.” And then as people get into that habit of doing this more over time, they will start seeing those more durable reductions in depressed mood or anxiety, whatever it is that they are seeking help for.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Okay, so yeah, that’s an interesting point. Exercise, as you said, when you’re pitching this to a patient and saying, “Hey, is this might give you immediate benefits in the short-term,” and it can be a nice supplement to what we’re doing… The talk therapy as well. So I think, I’m sure. Imagine a lot of people when they’re coming to you, they want a quick fix, they know that it’s not gonna be a quick fix, they gotta do some work, but exercise, hey, this can do maybe something a little bit for you to keep you going.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> I do think that’s one of the appealing parts of the exercise prescriptions that you can use it, and the short bout prescription, like one of the things that I do sometimes with my patients, it’s just the 10 push-ups, people who sometimes experience intense activation of stress or frustration and don’t really know what to do with that feeling and feel like all they can do is maybe act on that feeling in a way that’s ultimately going to be more harmful than good. Then something like 10 push-ups can be really helpful to allow people to shift their attention from that intensity to again, back to where they wanna be, which is to focus on what’s in front of them, whether that’s their work or whatever they were doing at that time, so the short bout can be really helpful for getting people to see those quick reductions and whether it’s frustration, tensions or sad mood, that allows them to stay engaged in a way that really works for them in the long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So we’ve talked about there are benefits. The research says there are… Do we know how exercise works in helping with mood disorders?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> I think we have a lot of ideas of why it may work, and as a psychologist have been mostly interested in sort of the behavioral psychological mechanisms, and so one of the reasons why I actually started researching exercises because I thought in an intense form, and that is when you really get people to do aerobic exercise and they feel all kinds of bodily sensations, like racing heart, sweating, breathing faster, it can actually serve almost like something that we call Exposure Therapy, which is really effective with people who have anxiety problems, and that is… If you get people to do these quick bouts of exercise, they get to really see that even though it could be uncomfortable to see your heart racing or that you’re breathing faster, that you’re sweating, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to lead to disastrous consequences. People with anxiety sometimes are concerned that heart racing is gonna lead to, let’s say, a heart attack, or that breathing faster is going to lead to suffocation, so in that way, exercise can be a really effective way to deliver that kind of Exposure Therapy.</p>\n<p>So we’ve thought, “Hey, maybe it’s… ” One of the mechanisms of exercise is what we call this reduction in fear or fear or anxiety sensitivity, the sensitivity to anxiety and the related sensation or building up people’s what we call the stress tolerance, the ability to withstand the stress and say like, “Hey, it’s there… Feeling it, I do have a tendency to want to push this away, but because I’m exercising and I have this experience, I know that I can actually stick with it and persist over time,” and that is a powerful mechanism for many anxiety and related problems. And so that may be what’s happened at the psychological level.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay: </strong>And then I think also in the book, you highlight there’s probably some endorphins stuff going on, we all know about your body releases neurotransmitters when you exercise. And that could help too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> For sure. I think, does exercise affect the brain? The answer is for sure. And I think that question is particularly interesting for researchers who are obviously interested in figuring out the mechanisms of action for any intervention, the idea is that if we know how it works, maybe we can make it even better, or we can learn about new treatments if we figure out how exercise can improve mood and what are the different brain regions that are involved, perhaps we can develop new drug treatments that act on these brain regions, and so it can be informative from that perspective. I also think it’s helpful sometimes for patients and provider to know how it affects the brain because somehow knowing that it affects the brain makes the intervention for many more legitimate, it makes it a real intervention, and I haven’t found that research, it’s not my expertise, and my sense is that it is challenging to pinpoint where the action is, and I think in part, because it’s difficult to study, study of mechanisms of actions really require lots of assessments, lots of subjects to really figure this out.</p>\n<p>I also think it is challenging because exercise works for so many different things, works great for mood and anxiety, it also works for all kinds of physical health problems, so most likely, exercise will have broad effects and also lots of different mechanisms at different levels of analysis, so it’s an important puzzle, I really like the work that’s being done in that area, but I do think it’s gonna take a while for us to really get some good insights as to where the action really is, but hopefully we will see it in the years to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> We’re gonna take a quick break for a word from our sponsors.</p>\n<p>And now back to the show.</p>\n<p>Okay, so your focus is, you know it works. There’s research to suggest that it does work. So your goal is, “Okay, what can I do to help my patients do this thing that I know that… Know could help them.” But the catch-22 with a lot of mental health issues, particularly depression and anxiety is that you typically are not motivated to do anything. So it’s like how do you get motivated to exercise, which a lot of people aren’t motivated to do anyways. And so you spend a lot of time in the book walking through strategies to overcome this obstacle. So let’s talk about this. Let’s talk about… First off the obstacle of depression getting in the way of exercise… What are the cognitive distortions that can occur with depression or even anxiety too, that gets in the way of people doing something that they know could help them?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, I think… Let’s go through a few, but the first is, this is not gonna work for me. A pessimistic outlook. And fitting with that is, this particular intervention doesn’t work with me. And perhaps there’s also some history of exercise that feels to the patient confirms that, “I’ve never liked exercise.” Or, “I’ve never really gotten the benefit of exercise like others have.” So that’s then a challenge for the provider. And I think it starts with first some education, and just briefly outlining what the effects of exercise can be, which I think is important for any kind of intervention.</p>\n<p>But education alone is not going to do it. So ultimately, patients might appreciate knowing that it might work and it works for others, but they might still leave with this sense like, “Well, if it works for others, that’s great, but it might not work for me. I would have to see that for myself.” And I think that’s where it comes to experiential learning. So I usually set up basically, an experiment with my patients and hope that I can get them to be willing to try exercise for a short period of time, even like let’s say a week.</p>\n<p>And the experiment is really to see if we manipulate exercise… So we give people to commit to some sort of exercise for that week. If it actually, does deliver or yield the kind of effects that they will be interested in. So now I go back to what I mentioned before, which is the target. So let’s say if someone with a depressed mood who also struggles with sleep. Well one of the powerful effects of exercise is improved sleep. So I might ask that person to say like, “How about we track sleep for the next week.” And just kind of a sleep rating in the morning. What was the quality of your sleep?</p>\n<p>And what we can do is come up with what we think is reasonable exercise for you. And I’m saying just for a week… I’m not asking you to exercise for the rest of your life, or even for two weeks. For the next week, would you be willing on some of these days to engage in exercise and then see what happens with your sleep on those days. And we can just keep track of this… We’ll manage, where we track your exercise or your physical activity. We’ll also track your sleep. And then we can review those data together and we can decide whether this is something that works for you. And so that’s the set up.</p>\n<p>Most patients will be intrigued and they’ll respond and say like, “Well, I can probably do anything for a week, but let’s talk a little bit more about what exercise might look like.” And then I think you have to go to preferences. And you can’t just send a person away and say like, “Hey, why don’t you go try this now.” You actually have to start talking about, “Well what might that exercise week look like for you.” So let’s think about this… Today’s Tuesday. I’ll see you again next Tuesday. What does your week look like? And what can we do in terms of an activity? Can we do something outside around you? Is there a club near? Is there a partner? Is there a friend who can do something with you? What kind of exercise history do you have? Do you remember an activity that you sort of feel like you can maybe try out for this week?</p>\n<p>Is that walking? Is that something else that might come to mind? So it’s a lot of problem-solving, troubleshooting and brainstorming there in the beginning. To come up with a plan that is feasible the question I ask at the end, it’s like, “Hey, we’ve now discussed this, we have a week. You’ve said on two of the days, you’re going to walk for 20 minutes with your friend. You’re gonna do this on Thursday at 5:00 PM. You’re also going to do this Sunday morning at 10:00 AM. We have the places where you’re gonna meet your friend. We have the tracking system set up. This is gonna be effortful, ’cause it’s gonna be very different from what you’ve done in the past, and certainly what you did over the last few weeks. How likely do you think it is you actually will be able to do this?” And so if a person says, “You know, 70%… 80%.” I’m happy… That sounds pretty good. And I think that’s a good way to get this started. If it’s less than that, we have to go back maybe in that session or subsequent sessions to figure out what parameters we need to change to get that to a higher likelihood.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And what’s interesting is the way you described that process. You’re not telling the patient to like, “We’ll just get motivated from within.” Find that from within yourself. You actually created with the patient the motivation that’s outside of them… You’ve set up a system. There’s a person. There’s a place. There’s a time. They just have to show up and do it. Nothing really is like… There’s hardly any internal motivation going on.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s right. I think that if we just tell people go do it, we will see something that we also see in the literature, which is 40% of people report being inactive, even though they hear from their physician, “You should be physically active.” So just telling people to go do it, particularly, with something that’s effortful like exercise… And then particularly, also when you already struggle with mood is just a non-starter. That’s not gonna go anywhere.</p>\n<p>So you’re going to have to work with a person to shape their environment such that they can actually be motivated to do this. So that exercise can go up to the hierarchy all the way to the top of things that they are motivated to do. I think a buddy system is really helpful there. And clearly what’s important is to build in the ongoing rewards. I want a person at the end of that exercise bout that they do, let’s say on that Sunday morning when they walk with a friend to talk to their friend about how it felt to exercise. What did you notice? How do you feel now relative to how you felt when you woke up this morning. And attend to those immediate rewards of exercise, ’cause… We’re all motivated to do something if we are rewarded for the activity.</p>\n<p>And it’s our task as a provider to figure out where the rewards lie for exercise for people. And it’s gonna be different for different people. And that’s where you have to really have this conversation with the patient about, what is it for you and what do you think it will do for you, and can we set it up in a way to where you’re gonna see the positive effects of exercise for you. ‘Cause in the end, when we think about any intervention, whether it’s psychotherapy, where much of the focus is on skills training or drug therapy, where the prescription is long-term… Exercise too.</p>\n<p>It’s not about getting a person to exercise for, let’s say two or three months and say like, “Now, you’re good.” With exercise it really is about getting a person from being a relatively inactive person to become someone who sees exercise and physical activity as part of their life. Something that they will do on a weekly or daily basis… Or whatever fits with their life. They will… Sees themselves as someone who’s physically active. And getting a person to that is just requiring that you start slowly and that you get a person excited about this in the sense that they see how this works for them and what benefits that has emotionally for them, particularly in the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So what do you do with… Let’s say you’ve got a patient and you did that first week with them success, they’ve caught the vision and they’ve got this habit of exercise going… But when you’re working with… Through any type of mental health issue, you’re gonna have days that are… You have a setback. Because of increased stress, etcetera. How do you help your patients prepare for those setbacks so that whenever it comes, they still do that thing, that exercise that can help them?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I’m glad you’re bringing that up because nothing is linear typically in the treatment of mental health problems. It isn’t like you start at the bottom, so to speak, and then you in a straight line, move up to where you wanna be. Oftentimes, you see some improvements and then you see some dips and then some improvements, and then some dips again… Lapses or relapses, if you will.</p>\n<p>And I think it’s so important to bring this up with the patients at the beginning, that even though we’re after initial successes and we are going to build on those successes together… And as a provider, I very much act like your coach… Much like a gym instructor or a fitness instructor. I know that they’re going to be times that your actions didn’t line up with your intentions. Like you had set out to go do this particular exercise, but something came up and you didn’t. Or something was really stressful when you said, “Hey, I’m all out, and I’m not going to follow through on this.”</p>\n<p>And that’s real. And that’s going to happen. And setting it up as an expectation and also normalizing that, I think is just the beginning and… Because oftentimes in the dynamic with the provider is also this, I don’t wanna disappoint this person. And if I… I’m not really doing what we set out to do, well then maybe this intervention is not right for me. So anticipating this and making this something that is going to be part of that journey moving forward to become a physically active person… That is there are going to be times that it’s not working for you, is part of it.</p>\n<p>And those times that it’s not working for them, just require more conversations with the provider. And that is like, “Hey, let’s talk about what happened.” And let’s talk about what explains that. And let’s pick up from there and see what we can do today to pick back up. And if that means, “Hey, you can start where you left off,” or we need to do something a little bit different, that’s fine. But that sort of flexibility that you have as a provider, but also from the patient’s side is what’s needed to be effective with this type of intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So it sounds like you’re doing cognitive behavioral therapy, and this is helping them exercise… So you have to like… “Okay, they didn’t do it.” Typically, people who are depressed, they have that catastrophizing, or like that… Well… The black and white thinking… Well, I didn’t do what I wanted to do, so I just shouldn’t do anything at all. And it’s all for nought. Instead you’d say, “Hey, well, you didn’t do what you wanted to do, but maybe you could just walk for 10 minutes and learn how to be okay with that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I think our CBT skills are really effective when it comes to exercise coaching and managing the exercise program and interpreting the effects and helping patients stay motivated, and attending to the cognitions, like you just said. What is it that you’re telling yourself right now? Or what are you telling yourself about exercise? Or what are you telling yourself about what’s gonna happen over the next week? And let’s take a look at that together and see if there are different ways of looking at this. And recognizing that oftentimes those predictions or the way that people talk to them are mood driven. They’re very different… How you talked about this, let’s say two weeks ago. And what does that tell us?</p>\n<p>And addressing thoughts like that or talking about thoughts like that in that way opens up the possibility that patients can develop some flexibility and say like, “Man, I am really sort of stuck right now.” And I find myself… Like you said, back where I was before in terms of how to think about myself and this intervention. But you’re right, if I look back over the last few weeks when we did this effectively, this is how it worked. And perhaps what it takes is X, Y, and Z. And that’s an opening again for them to get back and start where they were the previous week. Or maybe dive into a different set of activities to continue their exercise regimen.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> You know it’s interesting, this stuff works, even if you don’t have a diagnosed mood disorder… This is actually just useful information or skills to have if you’re trying to implement any type of healthy habit, whether it’s exercise or nutrition. The same sort of thing, it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> I think so. And I… As a psychologist, I work a lot with people who have a disorder, like a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder… But most of the patients come to me and they’re not like, “Hey, can you help me get rid of this disorder.” Most people even though that’s obviously what they want, they really come to see us because they want a better life. And a better life is they wanna feel better about themselves, they wanna feel better about what the future has to offer for them. And all the things that they are involved in. And healthy behaviors are often a big part of that.</p>\n<p>People tend to feel better when they’re physically active. They look at themselves and say like, “This is who I am.” I use my body. I noticed that that physical pain that I feel a little bit like in terms of, let’s say, a little muscle ache, that’s okay. That’s just a signal that I’m actually using my body and I’m being active. And the same is true as you said for nutrition. People tend to feel better when they’re eating more healthily than when they don’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So let’s talk at another issue that springs up with patients when you prescribe-exercise for them. So maybe they know that they’re gonna feel good after it’s done, but when they’re doing the exercise, if particularly they’ve been inactive for a really long time, it doesn’t feel good while they’re doing it. ‘Cause it’s just… It’s uncomfortable, etcetera. And that can be… That can be un-motivating… The fact like, “Ah, this doesn’t feel good. I’m gonna stop.” So what do you do with patients there to coach them through that?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Yeah, I like you’re bringing this up. And I think it depends a little bit on the patient… Actually, for some people that not feeling good during exercise can actually be something that is important for their treatment plan. That is to say like, “What can we do actually for you to increase your tolerance of these kind of sensations, and that you actually relate to that type of distress differently?” We’ve done some work on smoking cessation and evaluated an exercise program for smoking cessation. But particularly, for people who go back to smoking after they quit because they don’t know what to do with those symptoms of withdrawal.</p>\n<p>And when they experience that the first thing they do is they go back to their cigarettes because that’s how they manage that distress. And in those cases, we find actually it’s really helpful to do more of those intense exercises so that people can be more prepared to persist during the times of withdrawal. And so that then becomes a target. Patients then sign up to do that. And then it’s working with them to really learn to sort of accept those feelings and stay with the exercise.</p>\n<p>And it could be little things. It could be that reminder of like, “Hey, this is why I’m doing this, and this is why I’m actually engaged in this kind of uncomfortable set of exercises.” It could be as simple as also practicing the half smile, which is like just notice or be aware of how you’re actually showing this kind of distress right now. Is there anything that you can do in terms of your posture or your facial expression that will actually have you relate to this a little bit differently.</p>\n<p>That’s for a particular group of people, where the target really is to increase what we call distress tolerance. But for most people, like you said, exercise when it’s too uncomfortable and it’s really not a reason for them to engage in it… Like it doesn’t necessarily help them with their mood or anxiety goal, then we do figure out how to make the exercise a bit more interesting, engaging and less aversive. And so with very few people, actually, I start with intense aerobic exercise. I might work up to that with people, but oftentimes it is actually reducing that.</p>\n<p>I am totally okay, for example, in the beginning of an exercise regimen, if we get people to just exercise very lightly, and to just monitor their heart rate, keep it fairly low. And so we say, “Let’s get used to this first, and let’s actually make sure that you progress in this training to where you feel like you can handle what is a bit more intense bout down the road.”</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> And there’s another thing you do to is… As far as doing some problem-solving. If you don’t… If you feel uncomfortable doing it, like find out ways you can mitigate… Like, you’re still feeling uncomfortable, but it’s not as bad. So I guess an example, I thought of, like play a team sport. Do something with a group… For some reason, and whenever you’re suffering with other people it somehow weirdly reduces the suffering, and it kind of is motivating to see someone else is doing that. That might be another option as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Oh for sure. I like that suggestion a lot, that what are some of the ways in which you can make the exercise more tolerable. Certainly doing exercise with other people, for many will do that. If it’s a group exercise, for some actually makes it a little bit more challenging. Those people have, let’s say, social anxiety problems. They sometimes find it actually a bit more challenging to exercise with other people. But, yeah you’re right, you want to figure out ways in which people can engage with the activity to where it’s going to be a little bit more interesting.</p>\n<p>So they will notice the activation, the physiological activation, yet that’s not all that they notice. They also notice their friend around them. Or if they’re alone, they will be listening to, let’s say, a book or a podcast. And you teach them to really engage with that as well. It’s like, what are you hearing there? So can do two things at the same time? Which is you are experiencing that distress, and at the same time, you’re also able to actually listen to, let’s say a podcast or listen to your favorite play list.</p>\n<p>And so it is, again, personalized where you work with the patient to figure out, “Well, what does it take for you?” What would it take for you to be okay with the activation and also engage or notice the other things that are around you that are interesting and important to you as you participate in the physical activity?</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Yeah, it’s interesting you brought that up. Doing something that you enjoy while you’re actually like… We had Katy Milkman on the podcast a while ago about… Talking about temptation bundling. And she mentioned that. If you don’t like to exercise well, then you do something… You set something up where… Well, I can only listen or watch this movie that I really love when I’m on the treadmill… And then that can be a motivator to get on the treadmill or do whatever… Or take a walk, whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> I do that for sure for the exercises that I don’t particularly like to do. I do some strength training and I really don’t find it that interesting. Or it doesn’t feel very good. But it is the time that I listen to my favorite podcast. And it might take me a little longer to get through it, because I wanna listen to both the podcast, but I know that I get both in. Which is the podcast time and while I’m doing that I actually got that particular exercise or set of exercises done. And so I like tying activity to other rewarding activities, whether that’s something that you like to do for yourself or whether it’s something that you like to do with other people. And so look for those things that make it more motivating for you, and more likely that you actually get something out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> So yeah, again, the goal is… Enjoy yourself. Don’t think of it just as medicine that you have to take. Make it something that you can enjoy, and can be a part of your life for the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> Oh, for sure. And I think that’s definitely what you wanna work and what we work toward with our patients. It may not be there in the beginning when we just set up those initial successes, but as we’re trying to build a habit… Like something that’s going to last over time, we do want it to be something that’s enjoyable. And to your point earlier, how do you anticipate the things that might change over time, that also will change over time.</p>\n<p>A lot of people won’t like an activity for very long. They might like, let’s say running for a little bit, but at some point they get kind of sick of it. So you wanna stay flexible, anticipate that, and say over time your exercise regimen… The set of activities that you engage in might change and you’ll stay open-minded, and curious to other activities that you will use to replace the ones that you’re sort of bored with, or no longer find interesting. Or you develop new friendships. Or all of a sudden you’re exercising with your family. Like you might exercise with your kids, or you might exercise with your spouse. All these things that keep it interesting, and keep it something that is enjoyable over time, and stay flexible that it might take lots of changes along the way. And that’s where I think sometimes providers can be really helpful, is to stay creative, help troubleshoot and come up with ideas that people can implement to keep their habit alive and active over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Well, Jasper this has been a great conversation. Is there some place people can go to learn more about the book and your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jasper Smits:</strong> I think the book is just on Amazon, and that’s probably the best access for people to get a sense of how to think about exercise and how to incorporate it in their life as they have goals for improving their well-being.</p>\n<p><strong>Brett McKay:</strong> Fantastical.

But you also have three other hugely important assets at your disposal too: your time, energy, and priorities. When you manage these assets poorly, you can feel overwhelmed and scattered and yet unproductive and unfulfilled. When you manage them well, things in your personal and professional life click, and you experience traction and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>How do you avoid the first situation and achieve the second? My guest today, Carey Nieuwhof, provides answers in his book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ALRPh5\"><em>At Your Best: How to Get Time, Priorities, and Energy Working in Your Favor</em></a>. We begin our conversation with Carey’s story of achieving success, only to suffer burnout, and how burnout has become less of a job problem these days than a general life problem. We then talk about how to leave what Carey calls the “stress spiral” and get into the “thrive cycle.” We discuss the two mental shifts you need to make to better manage your time, how to keep other people (and yourself) from hijacking your priorities, the power of categorical decision-making in separating the good from the best, and why you need to put even your personal commitments on your calendar. We also talk about scheduling your daily tasks into what Carey calls your green, yellow, and red energy zones, and how to spend your time more strategically.</p>\n<h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/perfect-timing-when-daniel-pink-interview/\">AoM Podcast #369: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing With Daniel Pink</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-450-how-to-make-time-for-what-really-matters-every-day/\">AoM Podcast #450: How to Make Time for What Really Matters Every Day</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/how-to/weekly-plan/\">AoM Article: Create a Weekly Attack Plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/how-to-firmly-say-no-without-coming-off-like-a-jerk/\">AoM Article: How to Say No Without Sounding Like a Jerk</a></li>\n</ul><h2><b>Connect With Carey Nieuwhof</b></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://careynieuwhof.com/\">Carey’s Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careynieuwhof.com/at-your-best/\">At Your Best Book Info</a></li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AR7QT2\"><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-141957\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/atyourbest.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/atyourbest.jpg 350w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/atyourbest-320x481.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"></img></a></p>\n<h2>Listen to the Podcast!

To supplement their inadequate rations, many fellow prisoners took to eating insects, wild plants, and stray animals. But though the businessman lost significant weight, for months he couldn’t bring himself to try this seemingly disgusting foraged fare.</p>\n<p>Yet when he finally gave in, he found it was . . . not that bad, actually: “In a few days, an old tomcat tasted better than spring chicken to me. I would undoubtedly be dead now if I had not, in desperation, made myself eat the first one.”</p>\n<p>In our own less dire situations, we often let our preconceptions keep us from trying things that, if not life-saving, might be genuinely life-enhancing.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s brussel sprouts, certain genres of music, particular types of travel, running, therapy, church-going, or parenthood, people can feel sure, <em>sure</em>, something just isn’t for them.</p>\n<p>While one of the great privileges of adulthood is getting to lean into what you like, and eschew what you don’t, too often we’re guilty of prematurely slotting things into the latter category.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we’ve never even tried the thing we’ve already formed an opinion about. Or we did try it, once, long ago, but not under the right conditions. Maybe we didn’t stick with it long enough (things grow on you with time). Or we lacked a mentor who could have shown us some appreciation-deepening nuance. Or we just weren’t ready.</p>\n<p>Sometimes too, we adopt a professed aversion as a way to evince a desired persona . . . and then continue to hold onto it, long after we’ve outgrown that old identity.</p>\n<p>Don’t wait for desperation to drive you to try something you might (hard as it may be to admit) be hungering for.
