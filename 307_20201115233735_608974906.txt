The Indian retail giant, which retains the option to acquire the remainder stake in the seven-and-a-half-years-old startup, said it has proposed to invest up to $10.06 million more in Urban Ladder by December 2023.</p>\n<p>Founded in early 2012, Urban Ladder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/09/urban-ladder/\">sells home furniture and decor products online</a>. It also operates a chain of physical retail stores in several Indian cities. The deal size suggests that it was a fire sale.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The startup had raised about <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/urban-ladder\">$115 million</a> from Sequoia Capital, SAIF Partners, Steadview Capital, and MIT and other investors, according to Crunchbase and Tracxn. In the financial year that ended in March, the Indian startup reported a loss of $6.63 million on a turnover of $58.2 million.</p>\n<p>Reliance Retail <a href=\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/b068f936-8b13-4974-975f-480036f60124.pdf\">said</a> (PDF) the investment “will further enable the group’s digital and new commerce initiatives and widen the bouquet of consumer products provided by the group, while enhancing user engagement and experience across its retail offerings.”</p>\n<p>Urban Ladder is the latest acquisition for Reliance Retail, which earlier this year said it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/\">entered into a $3.4 billion deal with Future Group</a> to buy several of India’s second largest retail chain’s businesses. In August, Reliance acquired a 60% stake in pharma marketplace Netmeds’ parent firm Vitalic for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/indias-reliance-retail-acquires-a-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-nedmeds-for-83-2m/\">about $83.2 million</a>.</p>\n<p>Reliance Retail, which is part of Reliance Industries (India&#8217;s most valued firm), has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/reliance-retail-raises-1-3-billion-from-pif/\">raised about $6.4 billion in recent months</a> after its sister subsidiary, Jio Platforms, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/\">secured over $20 billion this year</a> from Facebook and Google among other high-profile investors.</p>\n<p>Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country, entered the e-commerce space with JioMart through a joint venture with Jio Platforms. JioMart now has a presence in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/\">over 200 Indian cities and towns</a>,
