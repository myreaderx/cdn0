Software developers are contributing by crafting technical tools to help combat the virus and save lives. In this spirit of collaboration, Google and Apple are announcing a joint effort to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus, with user privacy and security central to the design.</p><p>Since COVID-19 can be transmitted through close proximity to affected individuals, public health organizations have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread. A number of leading public health authorities, universities, and NGOs around the world have been doing important work to develop opt-in contact tracing technology. To further this cause, Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing. Given the urgent need, the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy. </p><p>First, in May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores. </p><p>Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms. This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities. Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders. We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyze.</p><p>All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems. Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Apple and Google partner on COVID-19 contact tracing technology\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/card12.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><hr/><p><br/></p><p>More information and technical specs are available at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/\">google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications</a>.<br/></p><p></p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/B1tQbNN9evQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2372,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/card12.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"df5e7120b1cfc902041074ee0e4f8ff3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-16-49-159_eea4b8197928ee03.webp","destWidth":876,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":12911,"destBytes":7590,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/card12.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-16-49-159_eea4b8197928ee03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/B1tQbNN9evQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn26@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-19-18-246_ba8ea58f2f13cf84.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282208999},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:48","title":"A new keyboard for typing braille on Android","link":"https://blog.google/products/android/braille-keyboard/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Over 150 years ago, the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036681/\">invention of braille</a> was revolutionary in making reading and writing accessible to blind people. Today, <a href=\"https://www.afb.org/node/16207/refreshable-braille-displays\">braille displays</a> make typing accessible on most phones and computers through a physical braille keyboard. But it can be time-consuming to connect an external device each time you want to type something quickly on your phone. </p><br/><p>TalkBack braille keyboard is a new virtual braille keyboard integrated directly into Android. It’s a fast, convenient way to type on your phone without any additional hardware, whether you’re posting on social media, responding to a text, or writing a brief email.

The ENS allows public health authorities to develop apps that augment manual contact tracing efforts while preserving the privacy of their citizens. As of today, public health authorities have used ENS to launch in 16 countries and regions across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, with more apps currently under development.  </p><p>In the United States, 20 states and territories—representing approximately 45 percent of the U.S. population—are exploring apps based on ENS. We expect to see the first set of these apps roll out over the coming weeks. The Association of Public Health Laboratories also <a href=\"https://www.aphlblog.org/bringing-covid-19-exposure-notification-to-the-public-health-community/\">announced</a> recently that it will host a national key server to support all U.S. states, which will allow people with Exposure Notification apps to receive alerts even if they travel across state borders.</p><p>We’ve continued to improve the technology and provide more transparency based on feedback we’ve received from public health authorities and other experts. Public health authorities will continue to make their own decisions about how exposure notifications become part of their plans in controlling COVID-19, and we will work to improve the technology in response to their feedback. Here are some of the changes we’ve already made, as well as some upcoming additional changes.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Improvements to the Exposure Notification API</h3><p>Since the <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-google-exposure-notification-api-launches/\">Exposure Notification API was publicly released in May</a>, we’ve spoken with dozens of public health authorities to understand how the API could be improved to help them better manage the COVID-19 pandemic while preserving privacy. Based on this feedback, we recently launched an update to the API, which includes the following changes:<br/><br/></p><ul><li><p>When an exposure is detected, public health authorities now have more flexibility in determining the level of risk associated with that exposure based on technical information from the API.</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth calibration values for hundreds of devices have been updated to improve the detection of nearby devices.</p></li><li><p>The API now supports interoperability between countries, following feedback from governments that have launched Exposure Notification apps.</p></li><li><p>To help public health authorities build apps more efficiently, we’ve added reliability improvements for apps and developer debug tools. </p></li><li><p>We’ve improved clarity, transparency and control for users. For example, the Exposure Notifications settings on Android now include a simple on/off toggle at the top of the page. In addition, users will also see a periodic reminder if ENS is turned on.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Technical guidance and transparency</h3><p>We’ve heard feedback that public health authorities and developers want more technical guidance about how ENS works. In response, we’ve published the following resources over the last few weeks:<br/><br/></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server\">Reference verification server</a> to help guide public health authorities in building a server that allows verification of test results when users report themselves as positive for COVID-19.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/play-services-snippets\">Implementation code</a> showing how the Exposure Notification API works underneath the hood.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/telemetry-design\">Telemetry design</a> explaining what de-identified diagnostics data is collected to ensure that ENS is functioning properly and securely.</p></li></ul><p>Additional technical resources will be publicly shared as we continue to improve ENS.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Education and privacy protections </h3><p>The Exposure Notifications <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/\">website</a> has more information about ENS, and offers educational and technical resources, as well as the latest updates. </p><p>As a quick reminder, here are some of the core privacy protections that were built into ENS: <br/><br/></p><ul><li><p>You decide whether you want to use Exposure Notifications—it’s off unless you turn it on.</p></li><li><p>ENS doesn’t use location data from your device.</p></li><li><p>Your identity is not shared with Google, Apple or other users.</p></li><li><p>Only public health authorities can use this system.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, we’ve received questions about why your Android device location setting has to be turned on if you want to use an Exposure Notification app. We want to explain why this particular setting needs to be on, and how you can control your location settings on Android.  </p><p>To be absolutely clear, ENS <a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/9930236\">does not use device location</a>, and the <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/72/Exposure_Notifications_Service_Additional_Terms.pdf\">policies for using ENS</a> prohibit public health authority apps from requesting or collecting device location. Instead, ENS uses Bluetooth technology to detect when two devices are near each other, without revealing the location of either device. While Bluetooth scanning doesn’t necessarily reveal location, it can in some cases be used to infer your device’s location. For example, if a shopping app scans for the Bluetooth signals of a stationary Bluetooth beacon located inside a store, then the app could infer that you went to that store. So in 2015, with privacy in mind, we designed the Android operating system to prevent Bluetooth scanning unless the device location setting is on. At that time no one could have anticipated that Bluetooth scanning might one day be helpful in controlling a global pandemic like COVID-19. </p><p>Our engineering teams have been working to update the next version of Android with Exposure Notifications in mind. On Android 11, which will soon be released, users will be able to use Exposure Notification apps without turning on the device location setting. We’re making this update for Exposure Notifications only, given that ENS has been designed in such a way that neither the system nor the apps using it can infer device location through Bluetooth scanning, and apps that are allowed to use ENS are subject to additional policies that disallow automatic collection of location. All other apps and services will still be prohibited from performing Bluetooth scanning unless the device location setting is on. </p><p>But even in current versions of Android, when you turn on the device location setting, your phone continues to prohibit access to any apps, including Google apps, that don’t have permission to use device location. The device location setting is like a circuit breaker in a house: When it’s on, power is flowing to the house, but you can turn the lights on or off in each room. If you turn on the device location setting to use ENS, it won’t affect the decisions you’ve already made about specific apps. You can always view and change which apps have access to your device location by going to Settings &gt; Location &gt; App permissions.</p><p>We’re committed to supporting public health authorities as they build tools to fight COVID-19. We’ll continue to improve ENS based on feedback, while ensuring that people can trust in the privacy-preserving design of this technology.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/ZSe4kbLkytQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":2372,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"484140948f716ebdbd82fdb0555d0a8b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/ZSe4kbLkytQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn45@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-19-16-342_1e110374a7b57f01.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282208996},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:49","title":"Now you can transcribe speech with Google Translate","link":"https://blog.google/products/translate/transcribe-speech/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Recently, I was at my friend’s family gathering, where her grandmother told a story from her childhood.

With Food Label, you can quickly identify packaged foods by pointing your phone’s camera at the label. Lookout will guide you to position the food product so that it can be properly identified through its packaging or barcode. This can be particularly helpful if you’re putting away groceries and want to make sure you’re handling the right items that might feel the same to your touch. For example, Food Label would be able to distinguish between a can of corn and a can of green beans.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"FoodLabel_1080X1080_TransparentBG.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/FoodLabel_1080X1080_TransparentBG_uuSCD3a.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Use Food Label to identify different food products.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Scan Document makes it easier to go through letters and mail.

As an added protection, we’re now blocking the majority of these non-Play apps from being installed on any devices with a Google Account enrolled in Advanced Protection. You can still install non-Play apps through app stores that were pre-installed by the device manufacturer and through <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#move\">Android Debug Bridge</a>. Any apps that you’ve already installed from sources outside of Google Play will not be removed and can still be updated.</p><p>G Suite users enrolled in the Advanced Protection Program will not get these new Android  protections for now; however, equivalent protections are available as part of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/identity/em\">endpoint management</a>.

This is especially important because there is a <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-in-Africa.pdf\">significant gender gap</a> in mobile internet usage in Sub-Saharan Africa.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Maisha Ni Digital_Mkulima 8.45x15.95.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Maisha_Ni_Digital_Mkulima_8.45x15.95.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With the help of the suite of Google apps designed for Go edition, people are connecting with new   opportunities and making gains in their daily lives. For example, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.searchlite\">Google Go</a> has helped connect millions of people to information by providing a lightweight search engine that works on unstable connections. And with Lens in Google Go, people can quickly translate, hear and search text they see in the real world using their phone camera—helping them understand words on street signs, medicine labels, documents, and more. </p><p>Across the Google apps designed for Android (Go edition), we’ve introduced a number of user privacy features to protect the next billion people coming online for the first time. For example, a new mode within <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.searchlite\">Google Go</a> lets people search without their searches being saved to their account, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photosgo\">Gallery Go</a> leverages on-device machine learning to help people organize photos without ever sending data to the cloud.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Bringing a beautiful, fast camera experience to affordable devices</h2><p>Your phone’s camera gives you the power to capture memories that you’ll want to share with those around you.

And, most importantly, Camera Go tracks how much photo and video storage space you have left, and then it helps you clear up space so you never miss a shot.</p><br/><p>Camera Go will be available on Nokia 1.3 and more Android (Go edition) devices soon.</p><p><br/></p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/PGkKoiAPJyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:30:00 +0000","feedId":2372,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Maisha_Ni_Digital_Mkulima_8.45x15.95.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"1768a6f108029db50e5c2758ec6765a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-16-49-397_44ea3474b9a61fe9.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":529,"sourceBytes":855604,"destBytes":93922,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Maisha_Ni_Digital_Mkulima_8.45x15.95.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/24/15-16-49-397_44ea3474b9a61fe9.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Camera_Go_inline_V2.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn17@2020_6/2020/08/24/15-19-16-305_bb2e43846ceb77a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OfficialAndroidBlog/~4/PGkKoiAPJyE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/24/15-19-16-222_bd295e6aa640353f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598282208999},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:16:48","title":"The new Google Pixel Buds are available today for your listening pleasure","link":"https://blog.google/products/pixel-buds/pixel-buds-now-available/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In October, we <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/new-pixel-buds/\">introduced</a> the all-new Google Pixel Buds—with high-quality sound, an unobtrusive design that fits securely and comfortably in your ear and helpful AI features. We wanted to make sure whether you're streaming content while working out or sitting in a noisy room talking on a conference call, you have the best possible audio experience. Today, <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds\">Pixel Buds</a> are available for $179 in Clearly White in the U.S. </p><br/><p>We sat down with some of the team behind Pixel Buds to learn more about what’s new, and also to hear how they’ve been using them. </p><br/><h2>Get started easily with Fast Pair</h2><p>“I always used to use wired headphones because I had concerns about the reliability of Bluetooth® connectivity, as lots of other earbuds have pairing problems, including the original Pixel Buds. With the new Pixel Buds, we focused on improving Fast Pair to eliminate these pain points and easily connect to your phone.”</p><p><i>- Ethan Grabau, Product Manager</i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Presto_Tap4_full.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Presto_Tap4_full.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Clear calls with special mics and sensor</h2><p>“To give you clear calls, even in noisy and windy environments, Pixel Buds combine signals from beamforming mics and a special sensor that detects when your jaw is moving. This helps so you don't have to look for a quiet place to take a call. It’s come in particularly handy these past few weeks for me working from home with two young daughters.”</p><p><i>- Jae Lee, Audio Systems Engineer</i></p><br/><h2>Adaptive Sound for better audio  </h2><p>“Adaptive Sound is perfect for those moments like when you’re steaming milk for a latte, or when you're washing your hands or the dishes. Those noises can eclipse your audio experience for a bit, until the latte, or your dishes are done.” </p><p><i>- Basheer Tome, Senior Hardware Interface Designer</i><br/></p><br/><p>“To help, Adaptive Sound temporarily and subtly adjusts your volume to accommodate for the new noise in your environment, and goes back to normal after it’s dissipated. It works kind of like auto-brightness on your phone screen: It momentarily adjusts to the world around you to make the experience of using your device a little simpler.”  </p><i>- Frank Li, UX Engineer  <br/></i><br/><h2>Hands-free help with Google Assistant</h2><p>\"When I’m working in the yard and wearing gloves, I can use  ’Hey, Google’ on my Pixel Buds and easily control my music. I can also hear my notifications, and reply to a text message with just my voice and Google Assistant. </p><br/><p>And when I'm taking my dog on our daily walk and using my Pixel Buds, I use Google Assistant to navigate and check my fitness progress hands-free while juggling a leash and bag of dog treats. The Pixel Buds are slim enough they fit snag-free under a hat or hoodie, too.\" </p><p><i>- Max Ohlendorf, Technology Manager </i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"HeyGoogle.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/HeyGoogle.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Real-time translations with conversation mode </h2><p>“We set out to see how we could use Google Translate on Pixel Buds to reduce language barriers. Making the conversation as natural as possible even with the use of the phone was important, so we decided to create the split screen UI to show exactly what was being said, and translating it in real time on the screen with conversation mode. Any exposure to a different language is also an opportunity to learn, so we wanted to make the feature is not only as helpful as possible for things like being in a different country, but also as simple as being able to help bilingual households across generations connect through language.” </p><p><i>- Tricia Fu, Product Manager</i></p><br/><h2>Peace of mind with Find My Device</h2><p>“The fear of losing expensive wireless earbuds is real, and in many cases a reason why people are afraid of trying them. We tried to reduce that fear a bit with Find My Device. If an earbud falls out when you’re walking or running, you know right away. But you may be less aware when you return home and absentmindedly put them down somewhere. So we built the ability to let you ring your earbuds from your phone. We also wanted to make sure we were thoughtful in what that experience is like. You can ring one earbud at a time, to focus on finding either the left or right earbud. The moment your hands touch the lost earbud, the ringing will stop. We hope people won’t need to use this feature often, but if they do, they can find misplaced earbuds more easily.”</p><p><i>- Alex Yee, Interaction Designer</i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"RingEarbuds.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RingEarbuds.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Like Pixel phones and other Google devices, Pixel Buds will get better over time with new features, including an update to Find My Device which will show the last known location of your earbuds. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/?hl=en#topic=7544331\">Check out</a> more cool features on Pixel Buds and see which features will work with your device.</p><p>Pixel Buds are available through the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds\">Google Store</a> and retailers including AT&amp;T, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-buds-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-clearly-white/6411707.p?skuId=6411707\">Best Buy</a>, Target (coming early May), <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/accessory/google-pixel-buds-with-wireless-charging-case?sku=193575003337\">T-Mobile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uscellular.com/accessories/google-pixel-buds-white\">U.S. Cellular</a>, <a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/products/google-pixel-buds-with-wireless-charging-case/?sku=sku3830729\">Verizon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Pixel-Buds-Clearly-White/661564183\">Walmart</a>.

So we’re using the reach of Android’s platform to help detect earthquakes.  </p><p>Starting today, your Android phone can be part of the Android Earthquake Alerts System, wherever you live in the world. This means your Android phone can be a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network. </p><p>All smartphones come with tiny accelerometers that can sense signals that indicate an earthquake might be happening. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be an earthquake, it sends a signal to our earthquake detection server, along with a coarse location of where the shaking occurred. The server then combines information from many phones to figure out if an earthquake is happening. We’re essentially racing the speed of light (which is roughly the speed at which signals from a phone travel) against the speed of an earthquake. And lucky for us, the speed of light is much faster! </p><p>To start, we’ll use this technology to share a fast, accurate view of the impacted area on Google Search. When you look up “earthquake” or “earthquake near me,” you’ll find relevant results for your area, along with helpful resources on what to do after an earthquake. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Asset3_nocaption (1).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Asset3_nocaption_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve worked with globally-renowned seismology and disaster experts <a href=\"https://rallen.berkeley.edu/\">Dr. Richard Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://seismo.berkeley.edu/qingkaikong/\">Dr. Qingkai Kong</a> and <a href=\"http://drlucyjones.com/\">Dr. Lucy Jones</a> to develop this crowdsourced approach for detecting earthquakes all around the world.</p><p>You might be wondering, “what’s next?” We’re starting with earthquake alerts in California since there’s already a great seismometer-based system in place.

Right now, those of us who no longer commute and are staying close to home may be able to sleep in, but how well and how much we’re sleeping can still be a struggle. In fact, there’s been a rise in sleep-related searches like “<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=insomnia\">insomnia</a>” and “<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=can%27t%20sleep\">can’t sleep</a>,” which reached all-time highs in April and May. At Google, we believe that technology should improve life, not distract from it–including your sleep. Today we’re sharing a few tips and new bedtime tools to help you get better and more restful sleep.</p><br/><h3>Turn on Bedtime mode to limit interruptions</h3><p>A dark, quiet environment can help with falling and staying asleep. With Bedtime mode, formerly known as Wind Down in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing\">Digital Wellbeing</a> settings, your Android phone can stay dark and quiet while you sleep. While Bedtime mode is on, it uses Do Not Disturb to silence calls, texts and other notifications that might disturb your sleep. Grayscale fades the colors on your phone to black and white to reduce the draw from enticing colors that keep you up.</p><br/><p>We’ve now made it easier to customize how and when you turn on Bedtime mode. Based on your bedtime schedule, you can choose to have it turn on automatically or after your phone is plugged in to charge. You can also add Bedtime mode to your phone's Quick Settings panel to instantly turn it on or off with a single tap. And if you need a few more minutes, you can pause Bedtime mode without needing to adjust your schedule. Bedtime mode is available on all devices with Digital Wellbeing and parental controls settings.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"1 Bedtime mode.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/1_Bedtime_mode.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Bedtime mode limits interruptions by keeping your phone dark and quiet.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Get more consistent sleep with Clock</h3>A regular bedtime and wake-up schedule (including on your off days) helps your body establish a strong circadian rhythm and can improve the quality of your sleep. With the new Bedtime tab in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock\">Clock app</a>, you can set daily sleep and wake times to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Pixel4_02_Clock_bedtime_home.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/2020-05-29_1.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Set a sleep schedule and see your bedtime habits with the new Bedtime tab in Clock.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>While sticking to a schedule is something to strive for, real life often requires flexibility. It’s helpful to start with a wake-up time and work backwards when you set your bedtime schedule. In Clock, you’ll see a preview of tomorrow’s calendar and a tally of the total hours of sleep you’d get, and you can adjust your bedtime if needed. </p><br/><p>To help you get to bed and fall asleep, you’ll receive a reminder before bedtime and an option to play calming sounds from Calm, Spotify, YouTube Music and more. For those with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing\">Digital Wellbeing</a> installed, you can pair with Bedtime mode to limit interruptions while you sleep. And if you happen to stay on your phone later than planned, you can see how much time you’re spending and which apps you’ve used after your set bedtime. </p><br/><p>Being woken up by an alarm can be jarring. To avoid interrupting deep sleep and wake up more gently, the Sunrise Alarm gives a visual cue that your wake up time is approaching, 15 minutes prior to your audio alarm. Make it an even more pleasant experience by adding your favorite song or sounds.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"3 sunrise alarm.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/3_sunrise_alarm_xh3LKLH.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The Sunrise Alarm gradually brightens your screen to help you wake up gently.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The new bedtime experience is rolling out to Pixel devices <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/new-pixel-features-drop\">starting today</a> and will be available in the Clock app on other Android devices later this summer. </p><br/><h3>Set a bedtime reminder in YouTube</h3>We also made it easier to manage how much time you spend watching on YouTube on your phone after bedtime.You can now <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830?hl=en\">get a reminder</a> that it’s time for bed in the YouTube app. You can choose to see the reminder at bedtime or after your video completes.

Google Meet is now <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/meet/google-meet-is-here-to-host-everyones-video-meetings-for-free/\">available to everyone</a> and can support larger meetings, and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/duo/family-mode\">family mode for Duo</a> lets you doodle on calls and add masks and effects, helping you express yourself in new and fun ways. </p><br/><p>To make communication easier and simpler on your phone, Android 11 will move all of your conversations across multiple messaging apps to a dedicated space in the notification section. This makes it easy to see, respond to and manage your conversations all in one place. You can mark a conversation as priority to give it preference so you never miss an important message. These key conversations show up on your always-on display and can even “break through” a Do Not Disturb setting. </p><br/><p>Android 11 also introduces Bubbles, a new feature to help you respond and engage with important conversations without switching back and forth between your current task and the messaging app. You can open a bubble for your conversation right from the notification and multitask without missing a thing.   </p><br/><p>In addition, when you type using Gboard in Android 11, you’ll get relevant and automatic suggestions for emoji and text. This is possible because of secure on-device intelligence that takes advantage of <a href=\"https://federated.withgoogle.com/\">Federated Learning</a>, and it works without Google ever seeing anything you type.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>New ways to control your connected devices and media</h2></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"Device Controls (with house).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Device_Controls_with_house.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Caption: Android 11 makes it faster and easier to access and control your connected devices</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>As the world around us becomes more connected with ambient computing, Android 11 is helping you better manage all of your connected devices. </p><br/><p>You can now quickly access and control your smart devices in one place by long pressing on the power button.

The next time the app needs access to these sensors, it will have to ask you for permission again.</p><br/><p>In addition, if you haven’t used an app for an extended period of time, we will “auto-reset” all of the permissions associated with that app and notify you of the same. You can always choose to re-grant the app permissions the next time you open the app. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"Android 11 screens.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Android_11_screens.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Caption: New privacy controls in Android 11: One-time permissions and auto-reset</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Available in Beta today with many more features</h2><br/>Android 11 brings many more features to your smartphone, like screen recorder, updated <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151848?hl=en\">Voice Access</a>, improved performance, and an improved share menu that makes it easier to share content from your phone.

But at age 22, he was in a multi-car collision that left him fighting for his life and in recovery for eight months. After the crash, Paul became quadriplegic. He soon realized that his voice was one of his most powerful assets—professionally and personally. He went back to school to study broadcasting and became a radio producer and morning show host. Along the way, Paul discovered how he could use technology as an everyday tool to help himself and others. Today, he uses accessibility features, like <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151848?hl=en\">Voice Access</a>, to produce his own radio show and share his passion for technology.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Stories like Paul’s remind us why accessible technology matters to all of us every single day.

You might have to scroll to find your video chat app, tap to open it and then type in the name of the contact you’re looking for. </p><p>For people with cognitive disabilities or age-related cognitive conditions, it can be difficult to learn and remember each of these steps. For others, it can be time consuming and cumbersome—especially if you have limited mobility.

Through this approach, public health officials contact, test, treat and advise people who may have been exposed to an affected person. One new element of contact tracing is Exposure Notifications: using privacy-preserving digital technology to tell someone they may have been exposed to the virus. Exposure Notification has the specific goal of rapid notification, which is especially important to slowing the spread of the disease with a virus that can be spread asymptomatically.   </p><p>To help, <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/\">Apple and Google cooperated</a> to build Exposure Notifications technology that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones. Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials, scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance. </p><p>Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android. What we’ve built is not an app—rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app. User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.  </p><p>Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts. </p></div></div></body></html><img
