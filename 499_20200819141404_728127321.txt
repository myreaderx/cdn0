Fast forward to today and companies are being replaced approximately every two weeks. In this rapidly changing market, traditional companies are looking for ways to stay competitive and more and more enterprises, including Nielsen, Colgate and Airbus, are turning to G Suite to help them reimagine how they work to keep pace.</p><p>We know that enterprises want to move to cloud-first collaboration to transform how they work, but, understandably, they have questions about how to make it work in a business of their size. What happens with email security? How can they manage their data? How does G Suite work with the tools and systems they already have in place?</p><p></p><p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/work-reimagined-new-ways-to-collaborate-safer-smarter-and-simpler-with-g-suite\">we announced</a> new products to help businesses reimagine how they work, and today we’re sharing additional solutions we’ve built to address these concerns.</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of what we’re announcing today. Read on for more detail.</p><ul><li><p>New Gmail (Redesigned security warnings, Snooze, Offline Access and more generally available for G Suite users)</p></li><li><p>Cloud Search (being deployed by an initial set of customers)</p></li><li><p>Google Voice for G Suite (available in our Early Adopter Program*)</p></li><li><p>Drive Enterprise Sku (available for purchase)</p></li></ul><h3>Keeping businesses (and emails) secure</h3><p>Keeping your data secure is our top priority, which is why we use machine learning to analyze threat indicators across billions of messages in Gmail to help quickly identify potential security attacks in the making. Machine learning helps protect more than 1.4 billion active Gmail user accounts from nearly 10 million spam and malicious emails every minute.</p><p>Today, <b>we’re making the new Gmail generally available to G Suite customers</b> so that, in addition to these baked-in security features, more companies can take advantage of features like redesigned security warnings, snooze, offline access and more. You can learn more <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/new-gmail-ga.html\">in this post</a>.</p><h3>Bringing the best of Google Search to enterprise data</h3><p>Searching through your company’s data should be as easy as doing a web search. But the reality is most companies’ information is spread across different silos and systems that don’t talk to each other, which makes finding things a lengthy chore. We <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-google-cloud-search-g-suite/\">introduced Cloud Search</a> last year to make it easy to find information across G Suite in a way that’s intuitive and assistive. Today, we are announcing <b>new Cloud Search functionality to help companies intelligently and securely index their third-party data beyond G Suite</b>, whether that data is stored in the cloud, or on-prem.</p><p>Companies, like Whirlpool Corporation, have started deploying Cloud Search’s new capabilities to unify search across multiple data sources. Using Cloud Search’s new SDKs, APIs and connectors for third-party connectivity, Whirlpool created a custom app called Whirlpool SearchPro that indexes more than 12 million documents across different on-prem and cloud systems and returns results in 100s of milliseconds on average. Moreover, search results reflect the specific permissions and access controls from each of the source systems to ensure that individuals only see the information they should.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Whirlpool Cloud Search - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Whirlpool-cloud-search-1280x720_PVn7Rir.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Cloud Search’s new functionality will be available to G Suite Enterprise customers as well as  any company looking to power their enterprise search needs as a new standalone offering. We’re also pleased to offer qualifying Google Search Appliance customers an <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/cloud-search-third-party.html\">upgrade path</a>to Cloud Search. Cloud Search is currently being deployed by an initial set of customers, and we’re excited to have 15 launch partners on board, including SADA, Onix and Accenture. <a href=\"http://cloud.google.com/products/search\">Learn more</a>.</p><h3>Enabling smarter and easier collaboration</h3><p>We <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/meet-the-new-enterprise-focused-hangouts/\">first introduced</a> Hangouts Chat, Hangouts Meet and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/meeting-room-g-suite/\">Hangouts Meet hardware</a> last year to make it easier for employees to collaborate with colleagues across the globe, be it face-to-face or via chat. Aside from bringing the best of video conferencing to businesses, we also want to create better telephony solutions so that employees can be more productive over the phone. For close to a decade, millions of consumers have used Google Voice to connect with folks across the globe. <b>Now we’re bringing an enterprise version of Voice to G Suite</b>.</p><p>On top of the existing features that users love, Google Voice is tightly integrated with G Suite apps, like Hangouts Meet and Google Calendar, and provides administrator capabilities best suited for the enterprise. Admins can manage users, provision and port phone numbers, access detailed reports and set up call routing functionality. Voice also lets you deploy phone numbers to employees, or even entire departments, at once, and assigns a  number that’s not tied to a specific device. AI-powered features in Voice also help facilitate voicemail transcription and spam filtering, which helps eliminate disruptions for employees so they can focus on what’s important.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\"><section class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\"><q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">Google Voice quickly emerged as our preferred telephony solution for remote teams and frequent travelers.</q> <cite class=\"uni-pull-quote__author\"><span class=\"uni-pull-quote__author-meta\"><strong class=\"h-u-font-weight-medium\">Kim Anstett</strong><br/> Chief Information Officer, Nielsen</span></cite></div></div></section></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve been testing this enterprise version with key customers since last October.

To help, our <b>customers will now be able to purchase Drive Enterprise as a standalone offering with usage-based pricing</b>.</p><p><br/></p>With Drive Enterprise, businesses can move their content to the cloud in Google Drive, and employees can create and collaborate securely with tools like Docs, Sheets and Slides without disrupting other legacy office productivity tools. More than 2 trillion files are stored in Google Drive to date, and most recently, Google was named a leader in the <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/campaigns/gartner-magic-quadrant-ccp-2018/\">Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> for Content Collaboration Platforms (CCP) for the second year in a row. <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/g-drive-enterprise/\">Learn more</a> about the new Drive Enterprise.<p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Drive Sku - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/DriveSKU1_1HZIenD.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’ve also made a concerted effort to make it easier to use G Suite with existing legacy tools so that you can avoid interruptions at work.

The security center brings together security analytics, actionable insights and best practice recommendations from Google to help you protect your organization, data and users.</p><p><b>Today, we’re announcing our new investigation tool</b> in security center, which adds integrated remediation to the prevention and detection capabilities of the security center. Admins can identify which users are potentially infected, see if anything’s been shared externally and remove access to Drive files or delete malicious emails. Since the investigation tool makes it possible to review your data security in one place and has a simple UI, it makes it easier to take action against threats without having to worry about analyzing logs which can be time-consuming and require complex scripting. Investigation tool is available today as part of our <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/campaigns/index__investigation-security.html\">Early Adopter Program</a> (EAP) for G Suite Enterprise customers. <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/07/fix-security-threats-g-suite-investigation-tool.html)\">Learn more</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Investigation Tool in Security Center - G Suite Next '18\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Blog-investigation-tool-1920x1080_1.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In addition to giving admins a simpler way to keep data secure, we’re constantly working to ensure that they have the transparency and control they need. <b>That’s why we’re adding support for data regions to G Suite.</b> For organizations with data control requirements, G Suite will now let customers choose where to store primary data for select G Suite apps—globally distributed, U.S. or Europe.

Google AI is already helping millions of people around the world navigate, communicate and get things done in our consumer products. In G Suite, we’re using AI to help businesses and their employees do their best work.</p><p>Many of you use Smart Reply in Gmail. It processes hundreds of millions of messages daily and already drives more than 10 percent of email replies. Today we’re announcing that <b>Smart Reply is coming to Hangouts Chat</b> to help you respond to messages quicker so you can free up time to focus on creative work.</p><p>Our technology recognizes which messages most likely need responses, and proposes three different replies that sound like how you typically respond.

That’s why <b>we’re introducing grammar suggestions in Docs.</b> To solve grammar corrections, we use a unique machine translation-based approach to recognize errors and suggest corrections on the fly. Our AI can catch several different types of corrections, from simple grammatical rules like how to use articles in a sentence (like “a” versus “an”), to more complicated grammatical concepts such as how to use subordinate clauses correctly. Machine learning will help improve this capability over time to detect trickier grammar issues. And because it’s built natively in Docs, it’s highly secure and reliable.

Many people still view connecting to video meetings as daunting, which is why we’re using Google AI to create a more inviting experience.</p><p>We're excited to see so many people actively engaged with Google Assistant through voice—managing their smart home and entertainment—and today, <b>we’re bringing some of that same magic to conference rooms with voice commands for Hangouts Meet hardware</b>so that teams can connect to a video meeting in seconds. We plan to roll this out to select Meet hardware customers later this year.</p><h3>Simplify work with G Suite</h3><p>One of the reasons why G Suite is able to deliver real transformation to businesses is that it’s simple to use and adopt. G Suite was born in the cloud and built for the cloud, which means real-time collaboration is effortless. This is why more than a billion people rely on G Suite apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive and more in their personal lives. Instead of defaulting to old habits—like saving content on your desktop—G Suite saves your work securely in the cloud and provides a means for teams to push the boundaries of what they create.</p><p>In fact, 74 percent of all time spent in Docs, Sheets and Slides is on collaborative work—that is, multiple people creating and editing content together.

Inboxes were overtaken by spam, and there was no easy way to search your inbox or file messages away. Plus, you had to constantly delete emails to stay under the storage limit. We built Gmail to address these problems, and it’s grown into a product that 1.5 billion users rely on to get things done every day. Today, on Gmail’s 15 birthday, we’re taking a look back and sharing where we’re headed next.</p><p><b>Different from day one</b></p><p>On April 1, 2004 we <a href=\"https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html\">launched Gmail</a> (despite the timing, not a joke). It had the power of Google Search built right in and grouped your messages into conversation threads, making it easier to find and reply to them. You could also store 1GB of data for free—nearly 100 times what was available at the time. No wonder the world thought it was a prank.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"2004_Gmail_UI.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/2004_Gmail_UI.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In the mid-2000s, email spam was a serious issue. Gmail blocked spam before it ever reached your inbox, and created a way for people to report suspected spam when they saw it, to help make email safer. Over the years, we’ve enhanced our spam filtering capabilities with artificial intelligence and today, AI helps us block nearly 10 million spam emails every minute. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbmiQhuAhU\">Here's a throwback video</a> from 2007 where our team explains how Gmail fights spam.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When Gmail launched, the first Android-powered smartphones were still years away. As mobile devices became ubiquitous, Gmail evolved from being desktop-only to also work on your phone or tablet, helping you get more done on the go. Gmail's tabbed inbox feature was the first of its kind, helping you organize messages by category, so you can see what’s new at a glance. AI-powered features like Smart Reply and Nudges helped you reply faster and stay on top of your to-dos.</p><p><b>What’s next for Gmail</b></p><p>Gmail has evolved a lot over the past 15 years. Before we blow out our birthday candles, here’s a rundown of new features coming your way.</p><p>First off, we’re making Gmail more assistive. You may have already used <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/\">Smart Compose</a>, an AI-powered feature that helps you write emails quicker. It’s already saved people from typing over 1 billion characters each week—that’s enough to fill the pages of 1,000 copies of \"Lord of the Rings.” Today, we’re updating Smart Compose to include more languages (Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese) and bringing it to Android (previously, it was only available on Pixel 3 devices), with iOS coming soon.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"SMART_COMPOSE_PERSONALIZED_GREETINGS_MOBILE.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SMART_COMPOSE_PERSONALIZED_GREETINGS_MOBILE.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Smart Compose is also getting, well, smarter. It will personalize suggestions for you, so if you prefer saying “Ahoy,\" or “Ello, mate” in your greetings, Smart Compose will suggest just that. It can also suggest a subject line based on the email you’ve written.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"SMART_COMPOSE_SUGGESTED_SUBJECT_DESKTOP.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SMART_COMPOSE_SUGGESTED_SUBJECT_DESKTOP.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Next up, you can decide when your email gets delivered to someone else’s inbox. Today, we added a new feature that lets you schedule email to be sent at a more appropriate date or time, which is helpful if you’re <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/15-years-and-counting-making-gmail-work-faster-and-smarter-for-businesses\">working across time zones</a>, or want to avoid interrupting someone’s vacation.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"SHEDULE_SEND_MOBILE.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/SHEDULE_SEND_MOBILE.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Lastly, you can now take action <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/\">without leaving your inbox</a>. You can respond to a comment thread in Google Docs, browse hotel recommendations and more, directly within emails. This way you don’t have to open a new tab or app to get things done.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Dynamic_email_Google Docs(Birthday).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Dynamic_email_Google_DocsBirthday.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We may have launched Gmail on April Fools’ Day, but the last 15 years have been no joke.
