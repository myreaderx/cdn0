With more titles available on the Oculus Quest platform than any other developer out there, we have a healthy amount of experience in the whole process &#8211; whether it&#8217;s development, platform relations, trailer and store support, marketing, community relations and more &#8211; especially when it comes to moving more swiftly in bringing challenging titles to market like multiplayer and cross-platform games.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.vrfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Carly-and-the-Reaperman-1.jpg\" alt=\"Carly and the Reaperman\" class=\"wp-image-86134\" srcset=\"https://www.vrfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Carly-and-the-Reaperman-1.jpg 600w, https://www.vrfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Carly-and-the-Reaperman-1-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Resolution Games has proven to be a leader in the VR space by providing top titles and being the most proficient studio at multiplayer and cross-platform games, so we feel that their expertise is a perfect fit to help take <em>Carly and the Reaperman</em> to the Quest audience,&#8221; adds Johan Högfeldt, CTO of Odd Raven Studios. &#8220;They&#8217;ve also proven they can effectively handle external IP (<em><a href=\"https://www.vrfocus.com/2019/02/review-angry-birds-vr-isle-of-pigs/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"97860\">Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs</a></em>), and we&#8217;re confident that together we will be able to bring success to our game.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement marks the start of Resolutions Games&#8217; publishing initiative, looking to help more VR videogame developers bring their projects to market.
