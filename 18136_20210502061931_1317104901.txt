Crew Dragon <em>Resilience</em> is scheduled to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Panama City, Florida, at 2:56 AM EDT (06:56 UTC) on Sunday May 2. It will mark the end of the first of six contracted, long duration, operational missions for SpaceX as a part of NASA&#8217;s Commercial Crew Program.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-77611\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Resilience</em> undocked from the <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/news/iss/\">International Space Station</a> (ISS) at 8:30 PM on Saturday May 1 (00:30 UTC on May 2) to begin the journey home. Its return will mark the end of Expedition 64 and the start of Expedition 65, with JAXA Astronaut Akihito Hoshide becoming the commander of the ISS. He&#8217;s the second Japanese astronaut to command the station, the first being Koichi Wakata during Expedition 39.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously scheduled for Wednesday, April 28, and Friday, April 30, the Crew-1 undocking and splashdown was postponed due to unfavorable weather in the splashdown zones off the coast of Florida.

SpaceX stated that the erosion was likely caused by airflow phenomena that were not expected to occur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The heat shield design was changed to include more erosion-resistant materials at the ties. The heat shield was reinforced, and tested both on the ground and in-flight during the Cargo Dragon <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/12/spacex-next-gen-cargo-dragon-crs21/\">CRS-21</a> flight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the drogue parachutes on board the <em>Endeavour</em> spacecraft deployed lower than expected, although it was still within the allowable range. A new instrument — which measures barometric pressure — was added to determine the altitude for parachute deployment and resolve this issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We made changes to the design and part of the heat shield and drogue chute deploy algorithm,&#8221; said Nicole Jordan, NASA Mission Manager for Crew-1 in an interview with NASASpaceflight.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77628\" style=\"width: 2570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77628\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-77628 size-full\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2086\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-350x285.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-430x350.jpg 430w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-768x626.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-1920x1564.jpg 1920w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpaceX_Demo-2_Landing_NHQ202008020016-1170x953.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-77628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crew Dragon Endeavour splashes down at the conclusion of Demo-2 &#8211; via NASA</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Fortunately, those changes were made on CRS-21 Cargo Dragon first, so we&#8217;ve actually not only tested it on the ground but also validated those changes in CRS-21. They&#8217;ve both worked as intended, but that is something we&#8217;ll see for the first time with the crew onboard on Crew-1 landing.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NASA and SpaceX teams have designated seven splashdown zones for Crew Dragon. This includes four sites at the Gulf of Mexico, namely Pensacola, Panama City, Tallahassee, and Tampa, and three sites in the Atlantic Ocean: Jacksonville, Daytona, and Cape North.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks prior to the return, teams select the primary and the alternate landing sites, pending weather conditions. For the Crew-1 mission, the selected primary splashdown site was Pensacola, with Panama city being the alternate location, both located in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Florida. The Panama City landing zone was selected for splashdown on Sunday morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a backup unsupported landing site (outside of the seven sites mentioned earlier) with suitable weather conditions is also identified to mitigate the risk of weather changes and ensure a minimum of two landing sites are identified at all times. In the unlikely scenario this site is used, the rescue operations will be conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s happening!</p>\n<p>Dragon recovery ship GO Navigator has departed from the Port of Pensacola and is making its way towards the primary Crew-1 splashdown site, near Panama City, in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Splashdown is targeted for 2:56am ET on Sunday morning. <a href=\"https://t.co/Hu2HvkV6Yu\">pic.twitter.com/Hu2HvkV6Yu</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Gavin Cornwell (@SpaceXFleet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceXFleet/status/1388466232626720768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weather monitoring plays a crucial role in determining where the Crew Dragon will return and when. Six hours before the undocking, NASA and SpaceX teams make the final decision on the primary splashdown target based on the latest weather updates. SpaceX continues to monitor the changes in conditions until 2.5 hours prior to the scheduled undocking. If the conditions are acceptable, a joint recommendation is be made by SpaceX and NASA whether to proceed with the undocking or not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before undocking, the mission teams perform a Go/No Go for undocking of Crew Dragon <em>Resilience</em> while the vestibule depressurizes. Once the teams are Go, the Crew Dragon <em>Resilience</em> will undock from the space station at 20:30 EDT and perform two short-duration undock burns, lasting for 1.5 seconds and 5 seconds respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 20:35 EDT, <em>Resilience</em> performs one of four departure burns, lasting for 16 seconds, followed by a 21-second long Depart Burn 1 at 20:40 EDT.

At 01:56 EDT, the claw which connects thermal control, power, and avionics system components located on the trunk to the spacecraft, will separate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is followed by separation of the trunk which contains the solar panels and radiators for thermal control. The trunk will remain in orbit for well over a year and decay naturally before destructively entering Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SpaceX will continue to monitor the changes in weather conditions before making the decision to continue with the deorbit burn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the conditions are acceptable, Crew Dragon <em>Resilience</em> will begin its final 987 second-long deorbit burn at 02:03 EDT, allowing the spacecraft to descend to Earth towards the Gulf of Mexico.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the deorbit burn, Dragon’s protective nose cone — which covers the forward bulkhead thrusters, docking ring, and sensors crucial for autonomous approach and rendezvous — will close as the capsule prepares for its fiery atmospheric re-entry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon will re-enter the atmosphere, and a loss of signal and communications from the craft and with the crew will occur as temperatures build to 1,930° C (3,500° F) due to an envelope of ionized air around the spacecraft created by this extreme heat.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77629\" style=\"width: 2570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77629\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-77629 size-full\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-525x350.jpg 525w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-1170x780.jpg 1170w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-585x390.jpg 585w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ewr-ZjYXAAYWUdt-263x175.jpg 263w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-77629\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon recovery ships, Go Navigator and Go Searcher, in Port Canaveral &#8211; via Julia Bergeron for NSF</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reentry, drogue chutes will deploy at 02:52 EDT to begin slowing the spacecraft.

The astronauts of Crew-1 will be fully de-conditioned since they have been part of a long-duration five-month mission in contrast to the two-month-long mission of Demo-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the crew, SpaceX has made some changes to their recovery vessel. Jordan said, &#8220;SpaceX has made some mods [modifications] to their boat, added a little bit of space around the capsule. They&#8217;ve also carefully choreographed how the crew will come out and how they&#8217;ll go into the medical evaluation room.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan also added, &#8220;We&#8217;ve also changed the way we operate with the coast guard to clear the area more effectively of any private-privately owned boats.&#8221; This is in response to a large number of private boats surrounding the recovery area and hindering the recovery operations during the Demo-2 mission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Coast Guard, with the help of NASA, SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will establish a two-mile safety zone around the expected splashdown location to ensure safety for the public and for those involved in the recovery operations, as well as the crew aboard the returning spacecraft.</span></p>\n<p><em>(Lead photo via NASA)</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"
