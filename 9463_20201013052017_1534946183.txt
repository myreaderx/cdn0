What numbers and statistics should I look at before I invest? How are my stocks performing in comparison to others? It can be hard to find the right information and even harder to make sense of it. We’ve redesigned <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a> for both desktop and mobile viewing to help you easily find data for stocks you’re interested in, market trends and relevant news to make more informed investment decisions.</p><p></p><h2>Find the information you need</h2>Understanding context is key to making informed investment decisions. We’ll make it easy for you to find and compare information by organizing it in a helpful way. For example, you can group stocks you follow and build your own “Watchlists,” which will help you find relevant news, stats and earnings details, so you have more context on stock movements. You can also add company events and earnings calls directly to your Google Calendar to stay on top of what’s happening.<br/><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"fgc_hero_aug2020.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/fgc_hero_aug2020.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Check out stocks, market trends and related news on Google Finance</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"fgc_watchlists_mobile_1000pxwide.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/fgc_watchlists_mobile_1000pxwide.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Create and manage your watchlists on Google Finance</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><h2>Learn as you go</h2>As you browse through stock details, you’ll find explanations and descriptions of key terms and stats to help you learn as you go.
