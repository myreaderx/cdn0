Okay, sure, it&#8217;s not even Halloween yet, but that&#8217;s not stopping Netflix from hyping up their upcoming holiday titles. One of those titles is <strong><em>Operation Christmas Drop</em></strong>, which, despite its name, is <em>not</em> related to <em>Operation Dumbo Drop</em>. In this Netflix rom-com, &#8220;While gathering evidence to support closing a tropical U.S. Air Force base, a congressional aide warms to its generous captain.&#8221; Watch the <em>Operation Christmas Drop</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641067\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Operation Christmas Drop Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTHWAQG6Gxw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Look, what&#8217;s more relatable than the story of someone trying to close a U.S. Air Force base and then falling in love with a captain? Nothing, I say. Nothing is more relatable. That&#8217;s the most relatable story in the history of storytelling, and thankfully, it&#8217;s not being used for a Netflix holiday movie. Here&#8217;s the full synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>Chasing a promotion, congressional aide Erica Miller forgoes family Christmas to travel across the Pacific at her boss’s behest. Upon landing at a beachside Air Force base, she clashes with her guide, Captain Andrew Jantz, who knows her assignment is finding reasons to defund the facility. The pilot’s pet project — Operation: Christmas Drop, a genuine, decades-old tradition where gifts and supplies are parachuted to residents of remote neighboring islands — has lawmakers wondering if his unit has too much spare energy. Despite their initial opposing goals, Erica softens once she experiences the customs and communal spirit of Andrew&#8217;s adopted home.</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>Finally, someone has made a military-industrial complex Christmas movie. Thank you, Netflix, for teaching us to laugh about love again. We are forever in your service! <em>Operation Christmas Drop</em> stars <strong>Kat Graham</strong>, <strong>Alexander Ludwig</strong>, and <strong>Virginia Madsen</strong> star in the flick, which comes from director Martin Wood and writes Gregg Rossen and Brian Sawyer. And again, despite that title, this has nothing to do with <em>Operation Dumbo Drop</em>, a Disney movie in which a bunch of soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War attempt to deliver a live elephant. I never saw that movie, but I <em>did</em> see the VHS tape at the local video store many, many times. I always thought, &#8220;Maybe I should rent that.&#8221; But I never did. Let this be a lesson to you, kids: always rent <em>Operation Dumbo Drop</em>. Or don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t care either way, honestly.</div>\n<p><em>Operation Christmas Drop</em> is part of Netflix&#8217;s extensive holiday original line-up, which you can read more about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/2020-netflix-christmas-movies-and-tv-shows/\">here</a>. Look for <em>Operation Christmas Drop</em> on Netflix starting<strong> November 5, 2020</strong>. And then watch it every single day until Christmas Eve.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/operation-christmas-drop-trailer/\">&#8216;Operation Christmas Drop&#8217; Trailer: We Regret to Inform You This is Not an &#8216;Operation Dumbo Drop&#8217; Sequel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SmwJYEM2vzQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 22:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/operation-christmas-drop-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5ca676fe655155c1ab7755414ec55c1f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn14@2020_1/2020/10/13/04-11-38-882_2e744d111bd95768.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":38100,"destBytes":25362,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/operation-christmas-drop-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn14@2020_1/2020/10/13/04-11-38-882_2e744d111bd95768.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/13/04-11-42-620_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn74@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-42-542_6008e53b5e82c044.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-59-386_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SmwJYEM2vzQ:zO8pLkLxkP8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-42-986_3a3a9fb9f24c0004.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SmwJYEM2vzQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-42-600_7946211443d1c8e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602562280283},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","title":"‘Everybody’s Talking About Jamie’ Trailer: A Teen Dreams of Being a Drag Queen in This Musical Adaptation","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641007","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641011 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/everybodystalkingaboutjamie-maxharwood-starlamp-700x296.jpg\" alt=\"Everybody's Talking About Jamie Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/everybodystalkingaboutjamie-maxharwood-starlamp-700x296.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/everybodystalkingaboutjamie-maxharwood-starlamp-360x152.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/everybodystalkingaboutjamie-maxharwood-starlamp-768x325.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/everybodystalkingaboutjamie-maxharwood-starlamp.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Over the weekend, the LGBTQ community celebrated National Coming Out Day, spreading awareness and encouraging lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer people to &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; and reveal who they really are. In honor of this special day, 20th Century Studios released the first trailer for <strong><em>Everybody&#8217;s Talking About Jamie</em></strong>, an adaptation of the stage musical of the same name about a 16-year old boy who dreams of being a drag queen, and it looks wonderful and fabulous.<span id=\"more-641007\"></span></p>\n<h2>Everybody&#8217;s Talking About Jamie Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CpOeZw7xdfI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Max Harwood</strong> plays the titular character, who is scoffed at for his ambitions, not merely because being a professional performer is a tough career for anyone to crack, but because he&#8217;s gay and wants to be a drag queen. And that&#8217;s just too much for his mostly ignorant and prejudiced town to handle, including his father (<strong>Ralph Ineson</strong> of<em> The Witch</em>) and teacher Miss Hedge (<strong>Sharon Horgan</strong> of <em>Game Night</em>).</p>\n<p>But Jamie isn&#8217;t going to let that keep him down, and neither will his best friend Pritti (<strong>Lauren Patel</strong>). And if you don&#8217;t believe him, there appear to be plenty of huge musical numbers to prove it. He&#8217;ll also get some help from <strong>Richard E. Grant</strong> as Hugo Battersby, who takes the stage as a drag queen named Loco Chanelle. That bit of casting is reason enough to check out this movie.</p>\n<p>This is exactly the kind of movie that young boys who feel confused about their identity need to see. Surely, there will be some terrible people out there who calls this some kind of indoctrination of our youth, but it&#8217;s an important and much needed film about acceptance, and it gives a voice to many who have been marginalized over and over again. Hopefully this one ends up on Disney+ at some point, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/out-trailer-disney-pixar-sparkshorts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like Pixar&#8217;s LGBTQ centric short film <em>Out</em></a>, so it&#8217;s easily accessible.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast includes <strong>Sarah Lancashire</strong>, <strong>Shobna Gulati</strong>, and <strong>Adeel Akhtar</strong>, <strong>Samuel Bottomley</strong>. The film is directed by <strong>Jonathan Butterell</strong>, who helmed the stage production and is making his feature directorial debut, with a script and lyrics by <strong>Tom MacRae</strong>. As for the songs, they&#8217;ve been written by <strong>Dan Gillespie Sells</strong>, who also composed the score with <strong>Anne Dudley</strong>. There&#8217;s also a cavalcade of producers, including <strong>Mark Herbert</strong>, <strong>Peter Carlton</strong>, and <strong>Arnon Milchan</strong>, as well as <strong>Yariv Milchan</strong>, <strong>Michael Schaefer</strong>, <strong>Natalie Lehmann</strong>, <strong>Daniel Battsek</strong>, <strong>Ollie Madden</strong>, <strong>Peter Balm</strong>, <strong>Niall Shamma</strong>, and <strong>Jes Wilkins</strong> as executive producers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Inspired by true events, New Regency’s and Film4’s “Everybody’s Talking About Jamie” is the film adaptation of the hit musical. Jamie New is 16 and doesn’t quite fit in—instead of pursuing a “real” career he dreams of becoming a drag queen. Uncertain about his future, Jamie knows one thing for sure: he is going to be a sensation.

Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Tintin</em> made good money, and for years now, the plan has been for Peter Jackson to direct a sequel. Spielberg and Jackson have sworn up and down that the sequel was coming, no, really, it is – but there has been almost no real movement on the project. And now, Spielberg and Jackson might want to start getting their act together, because it looks like someone wants to swoop in and make their own <em>Tintin</em> film. French director <strong>Patrice Leconte</strong> says he&#8217;s developing a live-action <em>Tintin</em> movie, and is said to be far along in the development process. However, there&#8217;s a catch: he doesn&#8217;t seem to have the film rights to the character just yet.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641017\"></span></p>\n<p>According to French site <a href=\"https://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/tintin-patrice-leconte-devrait-adapter-les-bijoux-de-la-castafiore-20201012\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Figaro (opens in a new tab)\">Figaro</a> (via <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/tintin-film-patrice-leconte-20201012/\">The Playlist</a>), French director <strong>Patrice Leconte</strong><strong> </strong>is hoping to make a live-action <em>Tintin</em> movie based on the story &#8220;The Castafiore Emerald.&#8221; It was the third-to-last completed <em>Tintin</em> story, and unlike most other <em>Tintin</em> tales, it doesn&#8217;t involve globe-trotting adventure. Instead, all the action takes place at Marlinspike Hall, where &#8220;an incapacitated Captain Haddock is being nursed back to health by an unwelcome visitor in the form of Bianca Castafiore, the &#8216;Milanese Nightingale&#8217; who then suffers a devastating loss.&#8221; The Milanese Nightingale character also popped-up in Steven Spielberg&#8217;s animated <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em>.</p>\n<p>And speaking of Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Tintin</em>, news of Leconte&#8217;s live-action take begs the question: are we <em>ever</em> getting that sequel? Spielberg produced the first <em>Tintin</em> with Peter Jackson, and the plan was always for Jackson to then step in and direct a sequel. For years now, Jackson and Spielberg have been claiming the sequel would happen. In 2018, Spielberg <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tintin-2/\">said</a>: &#8220;Peter Jackson has to do the second part. Normally, if all goes well, he will soon start working on the script. As it takes two years of animation work on the film, for you, I would not expect to see it for about three years. But Peter will stick to it. Tintin is not dead!&#8221; But we&#8217;ve heard next to nothing about the project since then, which might lead some to think the Spielberg/Jackson <em>Tintin</em> time is at an end, and now Lectone will step in with his live-action version.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it looks like Leconte is still dealing with rights issues. The director says negotiations with Paramount France have stalled. On top of that, Leconte is also gearing up to make his feature <em>Maigret and the Dead Girl</em>, which won&#8217;t start shooting until 2021. In other words, nothing is a done deal yet. And who knows, maybe this news will finally inspire Spielberg and Jackson to get to work on that damn sequel.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/live-action-tintin-movie/\">Live-Action &#8216;Tintin&#8217; Movie Being Developed by Director Patrice Leconte, Who Doesn&#8217;t Actually Have the Rights to the Character Yet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WZ8UWeUbIkY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 23:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/live-action-tintin-movie-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"aa577a7eda7f1a095c5124a183d7c8a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn6@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-23-361_4e3d4eac097ed1ba.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":50154,"destBytes":35034,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/live-action-tintin-movie-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn6@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-23-361_4e3d4eac097ed1ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/13/04-11-42-620_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn41@2020_2/2020/10/13/04-12-01-414_5a91cec9514241d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-59-386_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=WZ8UWeUbIkY:DXSmnJzApGQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn52@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-42-833_533f77dcefdcdf49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/WZ8UWeUbIkY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-42-524_df89d08dc49b0dc9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602562280283},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","title":"Untitled David O.

Russell</strong>, a filmmaker who continues to land high-profile work despite several accusations of abusive behavior, has a new project lined-up, and it has quite the cast. <strong>Christian Bale</strong> and <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> are already on board, and now <strong>John David Washington</strong> has joined the ensemble as well. Legendary cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki will shoot the movie. And just what is the movie about? No one knows! Well, I&#8217;m sure people involved with the movie know, but they&#8217;re not talking.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641006\"></span></p>\n<p>Director David O. Russell has made some memorable films – <em>Three Kings</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em>, <em>American Hustle</em>, and so on. He&#8217;s also been accused of being abusive on set, and beyond. Those accusations include <a href=\"https://www.clooneysopenhouse.com/t86-interview-with-playboy-june-2000\">pushing an extra to the ground and kicking them</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/movies/the-nudist-buddhist-borderlineabusive-lovein.html\">putting director Christopher Nolan in a headlock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/03/14/david_o_russell_made_amy_adams_life_a_living_hell_5_sadistic_male_directors_who_treat_their_actors_like_garbage/#.Wd0CKFsH5qY.twitter\">treating Amy Adams like garbage on the set of <em>American Hustle</em></a>, and, most disturbing of all, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-zap-ent-david-russell-groping-story,amp.html\">groping his 19-year-old transgender niece</a>.</p>\n<p>I bring these incidents up because I&#8217;ve seen many people decry that &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; is out of control, and yet – it clearly hasn&#8217;t put a dent in Russell&#8217;s career or hindered him from high-profile work. Make of that what you will. The &#8220;difficult director&#8221; is an age-old Hollywood cliche at this point, but these alleged incidents seem to go far beyond someone just being a bit of a jerk and enter into abusive territory. And yet, Russell continues to land big gigs with big stars. Case in point: John David Washington is joining the cast of Russell&#8217;s latest, which also stars Christian Bale, who worked with Russell on <em>The Fighter</em> and <em>American Hustle</em>, and Margot Robbie.</p>\n<p>There is zero information about the project beyond the cast. No logline, no title. Deadline, who broke the John David Washington casting news, says that the movie &#8220;The film will be distributed via New Regency&#8217;s deal with 20th Century Studios, and that the movie is supposed to start shooting in January in Los Angeles. I like all three leads here – Washington is fast becoming a bonafide movie star; Bale does great work all the time; and Robbie can be quite excellent with the right material. I would <em>like</em> to get excited about the prospect of a movie starring all three of these people. But it&#8217;s a little hard to do when I have no idea what the heck the movie is even about, and when I know that said movie is being directed by David O. Russell.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-david-o-russell-movie-cast/\">Untitled David O.

Reynold is not officially attached at the moment, and scheduling might end up getting in the way because Paramount wants to get the ball rolling sooner rather than later. The film is being compared to Robert Zemeckis&#8217; 1984 flick <em>Romancing the Stone</em>, which followed an adventure-romance novelist who ends up in the midst of a real adventure in the Colombian jungle.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/sandra-bullock-lost-city-of-d-paramount-1234801352/\">Variety</a>, <em>Lost City of D</em>, in comparison, follows &#8220;a romance author who discovers that a fictional city she had written about is real, prompting her to embark on a risky journey to find the city.&#8221; And I&#8217;m just going to go out on a limb here and suggest the film&#8217;s title is riffing on the excellent, underseen James Gray movie <em>The Lost City of Z</em>. Variety adds that Bullock is definitely on board the project, and will serve as producer. Reynolds&#8217; involvement appears to be the thing still up in the air at the moment, and there&#8217;s no telling if things will work out, as Reynolds is a busy guy these days.</p>\n<p>The project originated from an idea by Seth Gordon, director of <em>The King of Kong</em>, <em>Horrible Bosses</em>, and more. Oren Uziel wrote the first draft of the script, which was then rewritten by Dana Fox, writer of <em>Couple&#8217;s Retreat</em> and the upcoming Disney movie <em>Cruella</em>. Adam and Aaron Nee are on board to direct. The Nee Brothers, who are also attached to the <em>Masters of the Universe</em> reboot, directed <em>Band of Robbers</em>, a fun little modern-day riff on Mark Twain&#8217;s <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> and <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>.</p>\n<p>Having never seen <em>The Proposal</em> I can&#8217;t exactly comment on the prospect of a Bullock/Reynolds reunion. However, the world could use more movies like <em>Romancing the Stone</em>, and I was a fan of <em>Band of Robbers</em>, so there&#8217;s a lot of potential here.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lost-city-of-d/\">&#8216;Lost City Of D&#8217; Might Reunite Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/93u2TPPgu1Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:30:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lost-city-of-d-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"1e4175cf5780f0014701dc4fbbf99b33","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-30-267_27c69f28c17a53b9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":42459,"destBytes":28416,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lost-city-of-d-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-30-267_27c69f28c17a53b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/13/04-11-42-620_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn87@2020_2/2020/10/13/04-11-42-646_183b57143af4c7cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-59-386_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=93u2TPPgu1Y:jB1QV6grURA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_1/2020/10/13/04-11-42-569_b0fa996d5c0c4533.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/93u2TPPgu1Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn70@2020_2/2020/10/13/04-11-42-442_ee8779701d6ce21d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602562280280},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","title":"‘Pennyworth’ Season 2 Trailer: Batman’s Eventual Butler Looks for a Change of Scenery","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641021","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641032 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pennyworth-season-2-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Pennyworth season 2 trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pennyworth-season-2.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pennyworth-season-2-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>As you wait for Matt Reeves&#8217; <em>The Batman</em> to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-batman-release-date-warner-bros-reshuffling/\">finally swoop into theaters</a> in 2022, Epix is hoping you&#8217;ll take the time to catch up with <em><strong>Pennyworth</strong></em>, the show that chronicles the pre-Batman adventures of Alfred, the eventual Wayne family butler.

I&#8217;ve never seen an episode, but I&#8217;ve read that some crazy stuff went down in the season one finale. As alluded to in this trailer, Alfred (<strong>Jack Bannon</strong>) – or &#8220;Alfie,&#8221; as he&#8217;s referred to in this show – killed his own father to prevent his dad from assassinating the Queen of England. But that&#8217;s not all: Thomas Wayne (<strong>Ben Aldridge</strong>) was shot, and the season ended with the villainous Lord Harwood (<strong>Jason Flemyng</strong>) being locked away in the Tower of London.</p>\n<p>But much in the same way that Batman villains are always seeming to find ways to break out of Arkham Asylum, Lord Harwood breaks out of the Tower of London in season 2 and cause chaos in England. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s good that Alfie will have a little extra help this season in the form of Lucius Fox, played by <b>Simon Manyonda </b>from HBO&#8217;s <i>His Dark Materials</i>. Here&#8217;s a description of the character from an official press release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lucius Fox is a young American scientist, precise to the point of pedantry, deliberately calm, honest, and direct to a fault; he suffers no fools gladly. His friends would say he’s a man of conscience; his enemies would say he’s judgmental and dogmatic. An integral part of the DC universe, this marks his introduction to the Wayne family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also joining the action is Melanie Troy, played by <strong>Jessica de Gouw</strong> from <em>The Hunting</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Melanie Troyis a military orphan, who became a woman of the world far too young. She married a dominating older man, but with her wry intelligence and a sardonic sense of humor, she’s no submissive and gives as good as she gets. Introduced to Alfie as the wife of his former SAS Captain, the two kindred spirits have an immediate connection.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>James Purefoy </b>(<i>The Following</i>), <strong>Edward Hogg</strong> (<em>Taboo</em>), <strong>Jessye Romero</strong> (<em>Curfew</em>), <strong>Ramon Tikaram</strong> (<em>Brassic</em>), and <strong>Harriet Slater</strong> (<em>Faunutland and the Lost Magic</em>) also join the cast as series regulars in season 2.</p>\n<p>As for the release plans for <em>Pennyworth</em> season 2, the new season is set to premiere on Epix on <strong>December 13</strong>, another episode follows on <strong>December 20</strong>, and the two-part mid-season finale airs on <strong>December</strong> <strong>27,</strong> <strong>2020</strong>. The remaining six episodes will premiere sometime in <strong>2021</strong>, but the exact dates for those have yet to be revealed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pennyworth-season-2-trailer/\">&#8216;Pennyworth&#8217; Season 2 Trailer: Batman&#8217;s Eventual Butler Looks for a Change of Scenery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fXVDqX2V0gI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pennyworth-season-2-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"8fd89b62f22566590a6ba0d291d5705a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_4/2020/10/13/04-11-41-158_40c740148482ebf0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":28148,"destBytes":16444,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Pennyworth-season-2-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_4/2020/10/13/04-11-41-158_40c740148482ebf0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/13/04-11-42-620_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn53@2020_2/2020/10/13/04-11-45-868_20d3ba344c4fd1a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/13/04-11-59-386_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fXVDqX2V0gI:RGiaQ_Ndx3U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_4/2020/10/13/04-11-42-470_7968a5a1874e80e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fXVDqX2V0gI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_4/2020/10/13/04-12-08-674_39e4505447b21996.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602562280283}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:20","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 04:11:20 +0000","fetchMs":228,"handleMs":1237,"totalMs":51720,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"a673d2967a041fd98f60051496a85ec7","hostName":"us-010*","requestId":"ab0495c4c73d442eaf5866b4e3aa8508_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":160264,"bgimgsTotal":7,"bgimgsGithubTotal":7,"articlesImgsTotal":30,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":30,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx15":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx19":1,"myreaderx":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx23":2,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
