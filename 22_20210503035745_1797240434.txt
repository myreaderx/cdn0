As Insider&#39;s John Haltiwanger previously noted, the travel restriction puts <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-bans-most-travel-india-once-said-bans-dont-work-2021-4\">Biden&#39;s actions at odds with his past statements about travel bans</a>, which he previously said would &#34;not stop the coronavirus.&#34; </p><p>Effective Tuesday, the ban will not apply to US citizens or permanent residents. Certain students, academics, and journalists will also be exempt from the travel ban, the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/presidential-proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019.html\">US State Department</a> said.</p><p>&#34;The CDC advises, based on work by public health and scientific experts, that these variants have characteristics of concern, which may make them more easily transmitted and have the potential for reduced protection afforded by some vaccines,&#34; The White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/30/a-proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/\">said Friday in a statement</a> announcing the president had signed the proclamation banning travel.</p><p>Gottlieb said the US success in vaccinating its population was likely responsible for preventing the variants from having the same effect they&#39;re having on countries like India, which is reporting <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/india-first-country-to-record-400000-single-day-coronavirus-cases-2021-5\">more than 300,000 new cases</a> of COVID-19 every day.

Now a federal judge wants to talk about it.</a></em></p><h2>Morgan&#39;s work as a &#39;civil rights auditor&#39;</h2><p>Morgan traveled from Texas to attend the Capitol riot. His main source of income is tree removal which, according to his <a href=\"http://www.therovingarborist.com/About.html\">business&#39;s website</a>, he got into after struggling to keep a full-time job because of a &#34;sleep disorder.&#34;</p><p>He only became an arborist to bankroll the launch of his internet marketing career, he wrote on the website. This, so far, has been unsuccessful. Two businesses he set up now appear to be defunct.</p><p>In recent years, he has been dedicated to growing a YouTube following for his channel - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PoliticalTrance/about\">&#34;Political Trance Tribune</a>&#34; - posting &#39;civil rights audits&#39; on it for nine years. The page has nurtured a small but reasonably engaged following; 3,600 subscribers and over 100,000 views. </p><p>Civil rights auditing, or First Amendment auditing,  involves individuals recording government officials in action. Auditors go to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SpS47ppUhA\">post offices</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSUH8iRuoAw\">city council meetings</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLrBM7m5Dds\">crime scenes</a> to test how officials react when they get the cameras rolling.</p><p>If officials allow filming to take place on public property, they pass the audit. If they refuse, they fail the audit and they end up being exposed on YouTube channels. Auditors say they are there to exercise their First Amendment rights but, as the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-insane-new-path-to-youtube-fame-trigger-cops-and-film-it\">Daily Beast</a> reported in 2019, dramatic confrontations can lead to YouTube fame.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOyaFHvFeDU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>Many of the run-ins published on Morgan&#39;s channel involve tense, dramatic interactions with police officers.</p><p>Morgan, who is described in his <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/case-multi-defendant/file/1385531/download\">affidavit</a> as an &#34;independent journalist and a civil rights auditor,&#34; is often seen deliberately aggravating law enforcement officers. This aligns with his anti-cop views, as expressed in a now-deleted YouTube video seen by Insider. &#34;I happen to think we need to abolish the police,&#34; he said in the clip from January.</p><p>Other <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtFd76K4j0Q\">clips</a> show him being threatened with prosecution for provoking officers. On one occasion, Texas&#39; Montgomery County Court records show that an incident led to his arrest.</p><p>He was placed in Montgomery County Jail on June 9, 202o, for &#34;interfering with traffic control and scene securement efforts,&#34; according to an arrest warrant seen by Insider.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608bf02834af8d001859a176?format=jpeg\" alt=\"andrew jackson morgan arrest\" height=\"180\" width=\"240\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Andrew Jackson Morgan was arrested for interfering with the public duties of a peace officer on June 9, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Montgomery County Jail</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>He believes that 9/11 was an &#39;inside false flag job&#39;</h2><p>Morgan&#39;s anti-police views are part of a wider set of conspiratorial and far-right views.</p><p>On his private Facebook page, Morgan shared posts that denied the climate crisis, challenged the fact that former President Barack Obama was born in the US, and called 9/11 an &#34;inside false flag job.&#34; He also frequently shared posts by the far-right publication Breitbart News and conspiracist website InfoWars.</p><p>More recently on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PoliticalTrance\">Political Trance Tribune&#39;s Facebook page</a>, Morgan showed allegiance to QAnon - the disproven and discredited conspiracy theory. Some posts are captioned with the hashtag #WWG1WGA, which stands for the QAnon slogan &#34;Where we go one, we go all.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c2d3e34af8d001859a3a6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"post andrew jackson morgan\" height=\"960\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A post on the Facebook page for Andrew Jackson Morgan&#39;s YouTube page shows support for QAnon.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>A video of Morgan attending a rally for then-President Donald Trump in Houston in 2018 also uses this caption.</p><p>Despite attending Trump rallies, Morgan appears to have made a small donation to a Democratic cause a year later. A man of the same name and sharing the same zip code donated $5 to &#39;Friends of Andrew Yang&#39; on September 17, 2019, via left-leaning fundraiser ActBlue, according to data from the Federal Election Commission.</p><p>However, the vast majority of his posts are supportive of Trump and critical of former President Barack Obama.</p><p>Before the January 6 riots, his last post shows Morgan attending dinner with fellow civil rights auditors, several of whom are believed to have traveled with him to Washington, DC.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608bfca334af8d001859a18f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"civil rights auditors dinner\" height=\"931\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A facebook post of eight civil rights auditors having dinner together in Mobile, Alabama in December, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Unauthorized press passes are being used to mount legal defenses</h2><p>According to his affidavit, Morgan told an FBI special agent in March that he had traveled from Maxwell, Texas, to Washington, DC on January 6  to witness &#34;something unprecedented.&#34;</p><p>He claimed that he merely wanted to record the event, according to court documents.</p><p>&#34;Me and several other auditors, we were gonna go, and I said I really want to be there to report,&#34; Morgan claimed in a now-deleted video posted after January 6 and seen by Insider. </p><p>He traveled to the Capitol with five other civil rights auditors who sometimes referred to themselves as &#34;independent patriots,&#34; his wife, Sheila Morgan, told special agents.</p><p>One was Matthew Wrosch, also known as the Michigan Constitutional Crusader, who provided Morgan and several others with unofficial press lanyards before the riots.  This was to show that the men were &#34;journalists&#34; who were &#34;disseminating information to the public,&#34; he told Insider.</p><p>The passes, however, were not authorized by any recognized body and do not count as media credentials. Nonetheless, these homemade passes and claims of being journalists are being used as evidence by several defendants to mount <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-rioters-insurrection-posing-journalists-legal-defenses-ap-2021-4\">First Amendment free speech defenses in court</a>, Insider previously reported.</p><p>Wrosch said that he had no intentions of actively participating in the riots. &#34;In my eyes, we were just supposed to observe and record,&#34; he said. &#34;When it&#39;s a government unrest kind of thing, we&#39;re not supposed to say s--t. We&#39;re just supposed to watch what&#39;s happening and record it.&#34; </p><p>But while Wrosch stayed &#34;fifty feet away&#34; at all times and &#34;didn&#39;t get up close and get in the fray,&#34; Morgan joined the melee of rioters as they forced their way into one of the Capitol&#39;s entrances.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c333635c46f0018c0b9c0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"capitol riots andrew jackson morgan\" height=\"528\" width=\"705\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Footage recorded by Andrew Jackson Morgan Jr. shows rioters break a Capitol building window on January 6, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Political Trance Tribune</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In an hour of self-recorded videos seen by Insider, Morgan shows himself to be sandwiched between insurrectionists as they smash a Capitol window and fight with police officers.

Between three stimulus checks and the decline in discretionary spending that accompanied a pandemic shutdown, Americans were holding <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-excess-savings-coronavirus-pandemic-power-economy-recovery-moodys-2021-4-1030318905\">$2.6 trillion</a> in excess savings as of mid-April, per Moody&#39;s Analytics.</p><p>And that&#39;s why so many economists are predicting that a lockdown lift will see the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-stimulus-vaccines-gdp-growth-strongest-decades-fed-williams-2021-2\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"090d7a96bbec5d8e360121a8c1a981bc\">biggest boomtime</a> in a generation, potentially ushering in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economic-outlook-2020s-new-era-stimulus-vaccines-remote-work-2021-2\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"8422c75ec8cd77115075ef3d1f5fc402\">new era in the US economy</a>. Moody&#39;s Analytics expects the US economy to grow 6.4% in 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-shrank-35-in-2020-after-growing-4-last-quarter-2021-1?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shrinking 3.5% in 2020</a>. </p><p>But to power such an economic transformation, Americans need to keep spending. </p><p>BofA&#39;s head of North America Economics, Ethan Harris, wrote in March that the US&#39; economic fate will depend on whether Americans view their excess savings as wealth or deferred income. His team sees the savings being treated as the latter, which should &#34;help support exceptional growth this year in addition to the tailwinds from fiscal stimulus and an improving virus picture.&#34;</p><p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Analytics, agrees. &#34;An unleashing of significant pent-up demand and overflowing excess saving will drive a surge in consumer spending across the globe as countries approach herd immunity and open up,&#34; he wrote in a note. He sees 20% of excess savings being spent in 2021, and another 20% next year. </p><p>Credit card spending is already up, but it&#39;s just the beginning. Inflation, unequal savings distribution, and an uneven economic recovery may prove to be challenges in spending enough to fuel an economic boom.</p><h2>Spending on outdoor activities and a &#39;hot vax summer&#39;</h2><p>&#34;The snooze is over,&#34; wrote BofA&#39;s Michelle Meyer, head of US economics, in a note published on Thursday. BofA&#39;s card spending showed a massive uptick in consumer spending for the week, up 45% year-over-year and by 20% over two years previous. </p><p>The third stimulus has already impacted Americans&#39; bank accounts, per <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-and-outlays-march-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> data. As <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-income-march-spending-stimulus-economy-covid-checks-americans-biden-2021-4\">incomes climbed by 21.1%</a> last March - a record monthly income leap dating since 1946 - consumer spending rose with it, increasing by 4.2%. Americans haven&#39;t spent that much since June. Total consumer spending, not adjusted for inflation, has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels.</p><p><s></s>In consumer spending, still leading the way is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthy-americans-doing-hobbies-alone-already-reshaping-economy-2020-6\">solitary leisure</a> <strong>-</strong> solo activities that Americans turned to in the social-distancing era as previous forms of leisure, especially hospitality and entertainment, fell off dramatically. Spending on sporting goods such as golf, campground, and bike equipment, is continuing its momentum with activity above pre-pandemic norms, per BofA. </p><p>But we&#39;re also starting to see a resurgence in the activities of pre-pandemic yore. Spending on transit, restaurants and bars, department stores, and clothing have all increased by over 100% on a daily basis over the past 10 days, per BofA.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c113134af8d001859a20a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"haircut\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Beauty services are seeing a flood of bookings.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Retailers are gearing up for a &#34;peacocking effect&#34; and dress sales on the rise, while jeans are making a comeback, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/going-out-clothes-sales-rising-vaccines-retailers-vaccine-summer-2021-4\">Insider&#39;s Avery Hartmans reported</a>. Blazers, stylish tops, and brightly colored sandals are all <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/18/dresses-jeans-suits-shopping-again/\">seeing signs of life</a>. Retail CEOs everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gap-ceo-expects-sales-increase-after-covid-pandemic-2021-3\">Gap</a> to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/urban-outfitters-ceo-sees-hope-220547599.html\">Urban Outfitters</a> have noted signs of an incoming retail boon, with the latter already seeing an uptick in purchases of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/urban-outfitters-ceo-sees-hope-220547599.html\">going-out clothes</a>.</p><p>The post-pandemic beauty boom has also arrived, as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/04/pandemic-beauty-salon-spa-botox-appointments/618520/\">The Atlantic&#39;s Amanda Mull reported</a>. From eyebrow threading and hairstyling to mani-pedis and cosmetic injections, she wrote, people are booking up beauty services for their own personal glow-up. Beauty sales increased by 31% for for the week ending April 24, per BofA, compared to 2019.</p><p>The start of this spending is already making a difference. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-q1-gdp-economic-output-recovery-reopening-stimulus-vaccination-recession-2021-4\">GDP grew at a 6.4% annualized rate</a> in the first quarter, the Commerce Department estimated on a preliminary basis.</p><p>Economists have thus upped their predictions for economic growth every month of the year, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/u-s-growth-expectations-keep-mounting-with-bigger-tailwind?sref=BLKWHazc\">according to Bloomberg&#39;s latest monthly survey</a>, forecasting an annualized pace of 8.1% GDP growth in the second quarter.</p><h2>An unequal recovery and unequal savings</h2><p>While Americans have already begun swiping their cards, there are still holes in the economy to fill and challenges to overcome.</p><p>Entertainment and airline spending are improving, but still weak, per BofA. More Americans <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travel-returning-boom-airlines-hotels-restaurants-spending-vacation-2021-3#especially-the-elderly-cohort-which-has-already-been-taking-flight-2\">intend to travel</a> as the weeks go by, with some already booking vacation rentals and hotels, and airlines just saw their busiest weekend since pre-pandemic, but travel&#39;s comeback is a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travel-returning-boom-airlines-hotels-restaurants-spending-vacation-2021-3#especially-the-elderly-cohort-which-has-already-been-taking-flight-2\">gradual one</a>.</p><p>That might partly be because the economic recovery across America hasn&#39;t been uniform. BofA spending analysis finds the South and parts of Midwest are faring better economically than the West and the Northeast. That&#39;s likely because the latter regions had longer lockdowns and a slower easing of restrictions in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>Also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pandemic-widened-millennial-wealth-gap-economic-inequality-rich-poor-henry-2021-1?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unequal</a> is the share of savings built up during the pandemic. Zandi said in the Moody&#39;s note that this would limit an even bigger boom in spending. &#34;Much of the excess saving has been by high-income, high-net-worth households who are likely to treat the saving more like wealth than income, and will thus spend much of less it, at least quickly,&#34; he wrote.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fda6c93c910a400192e7e6e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"thanksgiving travel 2020\" height=\"1447\" width=\"1930\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Airline spending has improved, but is still weak.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David Santiago/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Nearly two-thirds of the excess savings in the US is by households in the top 10% of the income distribution, per Moody&#39;s data, and three-quarters is by those in the richest 20%.</p><p>Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the American economy, and half of that is from the top 10% of American households, per estimates from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, respectively. That means about one-third of US GDP comes from spending by the top 10%. In other words, the US needs spending from wealthy households the most.</p><p>But there&#39;s a side effect that may come with unleashing pent-up demand: inflation. While experts don&#39;t think the economy will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-rebound-goods-commodities-services-more-expensive-inflation-stimulus-2021-2#:~:text=It's%20a%20crucial%20next%20step%20for%20the%20US%20economic%20recovery.&text=The%20US%20economy%20is%20headed,things%20more%20expensive%20for%20Americans.&text=This%20is%20good%3B%20inflation%20like,and%20a%20healthy%20economic%20recovery.%20recovery.\">overheat like it did in the 1970s</a>, some goods and services have begun to get <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-that-could-get-more-expensive-in-2021-inflation-2021-3\">more expensive</a> amid the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-expensive-goods-supply-shortage-congested-shipping-ports-texas-freeze-2021-3\">supply shortages</a> that have come with reopening. The unpredictability of inflation could cause consumers to curb their spending.</p><h2><strong>A world with baggy jeans and remote work</strong></h2><p>In a post-pandemic world, though, America will look a little different. The point of a glow-up, after all, is transformation.</p><p>And while Americans whiled away their quarantine days <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-pandemic-shaped-millennials-adulthood-growing-up-2021-3\">baking bread and reorganizing their closets</a>, new trends emerged. Clothes are <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fin-depth%2Flife%2Ffashion%2F2021%2F04%2F18%2Fpost-pandemic-fashion-sweatpants-brighter-clothes-comfortable-shoes%2F7220342002%2F\">brighter</a>, wide-legged jeans have <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10306887/tiktok-skinny-jeans-uncool-millennials\">replaced skinny jeans</a>, side parts are <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/gen-z-middle-part-tiktok.html\">no longer cool</a>, and the &#34;ugly fashion&#34; movement has seen its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ugly-clothes-are-in-style-2018-2\">pre-pandemic popularity</a> accelerate as shoppers increasingly purchase things like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walking-shoes-millennial-gen-z-status-symbol-covid-wfh-economy-2021-3\">grandpa shoes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/crocs-are-grails-sorry\">Crocs</a></p><p>Urban areas too, will look a little different. While experts and the data are pointing to big cities like New York <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-exodus-florida-temporary-move-migration-manhattan-brooklyn-2021-4\">making a comeback</a>, they will likely function in new ways. Urban theorist Richard Florida <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economic-outlook-2020s-new-era-stimulus-vaccines-remote-work-2021-2\">previously told Insider</a> he thinks major cities will be reshaped and revived by a newfound focus on interpersonal interaction that facilitates creativity and spontaneity. He said the community or neighborhood itself will take on more of the functions of an office.</p><p>The work-from-home revolution could bolster new cities&#39; real-estate markets, as more broadly shared prosperity counteracts decades of increasing regional inequality, but spending within cities themselves could suffer. For instance, economists estimate spending in downtown areas will be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-consumer-spending-drop-cities-work-home-commute-study-2021-4\">10% depressed</a> - or more in the case of Manhattan - because of the remote-working revolution.

Yet as businesses rehire in preparation for a pickup in demand, some are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-labor-market-recovery-hiring-unemployment-crisis-stimulus-2021-4\">reporting difficulties in finding workers</a>.</p><p>While some 9.7 million Americans are officially tallied in the government&#39;s unemployment gauges, another 4.6 million workers exited the labor force during the pandemic, the team led by Joseph Song said in a note to clients. More than half of those workers will likely rejoin the labor force by the end of the year, but face a few obstacles before they do so.</p><p>For one, fears of catching COVID-19 and its more contagious variants still loom large. Those concerns are likely playing a role in<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-labor-market-recovery-hiring-unemployment-crisis-stimulus-2021-4\">keeping Americans from rejoining the workforce</a> and looking for jobs, the economists said.</p><p>Low-income Americans might also hold off on seeking work because of stimulus&#39;s disincentive effects, the bank added. The Biden administration&#39;s $1.9 trillion support package included a $300-per-week expansion to unemployment insurance through September. While smaller than the CARES Act benefit, the latest boost could be leading some Americans to stay on the sidelines for now, Bank of America said.</p><p>&#34;Our estimates suggest that those who previously made less than $32,000 would be better off in the near term to collect UI benefits than work,&#34; the team added.</p><p>Still, Bank of America expects those 2.5 million Americans will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unemployed-workers-arent-returning-to-the-labor-force-jobless-benefits-2021-4\">rejoin the workforce</a> by the fall as vaccination continues and the stimulus benefit fades. The remaining 2.1 million will take much longer to join the job market, or may not rejoin at all.</p><p>About 700,000 Americans are expected to have left the workforce due to a mismatch between their skills and available job openings. Training programs can help close the gap but bringing those workers back will take some time, the economists said.</p><p>Separately, 1.2 million workers retired during the health crisis and are unlikely to seek work once the country fully reopens. Another 140,000 workers have been lost due to COVID-19 deaths, the team estimated.</p><p>These longer-term worker shortfalls will influence economic data in two ways. At first, accelerated hiring will see the unemployment rate fall throughout the year. Tighter labor-market conditions will then lead to faster wage growth as businesses pay more to fill their openings.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608ee502f22c6b00185db2ca?format=jpeg\" alt=\"BofA\" height=\"517\" width=\"1194\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Source: Bank of America Global Research\n<p class=\"copyright\">Bank of America</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Yet those encouraging readings will rest on a less optimistic foundation.

Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can&#39;t understand why anyone else should get it before them,&#34; he added. &#34;They are saying if you don&#39;t give us the vaccine it&#39;s not going to be good. It&#39;s not foul language. It&#39;s the tone. It&#39;s the implication of what they might do if I don&#39;t comply.&#34;</p><p>The Serum Institute is the world&#39;s largest vaccine manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124#:~:text=What%20about%20Covishield%3F,60%20million%20doses%20a%20month.\">producing more than 60 million doses</a> of the AstraZeneca and Oxford vaccine every month. </p><p>At the time of his interview, Poonawalla said he&#39;d stay in England for &#34;an extended time, because I don&#39;t want to go back to that situation.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Everything falls on my shoulders, but I can&#39;t do it alone,&#34; he added. </p><p>Hours after the interview was published, Poonawalla backtracked and wrote on Twitter that he&#39;d return to India &#34;in a few days.&#34;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Adar Poonawalla  (@adarpoonawalla) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1388559173219016704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The news of his departure from India comes as the country experiences deep surges in positive COVID-19 cases.</p><p>The nation reported a record high of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/india-first-country-to-record-400000-single-day-coronavirus-cases-2021-5\">401,993 new cases of COVID-19</a> on Saturday.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-astrazeneca-vaccine-side-effects-not-as-bad-as-trials-2021-4\">AstraZeneca</a> said it could not share such technology with the World Health Organization (WHO) because it had no engineers available to assist in the technology transfer. </p><p>The comments were made by chief executive Pascal Soriot during a shareholder Q&#38;A on Friday.</p><p>The People&#39;s Vaccine Alliance, a global coalition of civil society organizations, pressed AstraZeneca on providing access to its technology.</p><p>&#34;There is no way, even if we give access to the technology and we told people &#39;here is the recipe&#39;,&#34; Soriot responded during the Q&#38;A, &#34;there is no way we could train these people to manufacture the vaccine because our engineers are flat out working with our existing partners.&#34;</p><p>He added: &#34;The solution is to increase the yield in the existing plants, not to create more plants, because we have no engineers to brief people and train them.&#34;</p><p>The CEO&#39;s response has been met with criticism. Heidi Chow, the lead campaigner at Global Justice Now, a social justice organization, accused the company of &#34;making excuses for their complicity in vaccine apartheid,&#34; after the firm dismissed efforts to join the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/covid-19-technology-access-pool\">WHO&#39;s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool.</a></p><p>The comment was &#34;utterly unacceptable,&#34; Chow said, adding that it was proof of why governments &#34;should never have trusted a small number of companies to vaccinate the world.&#34;</p><p>Katie Mellor, an Oxford vaccine trial volunteer, said she found the comments to be &#34;deeply offensive&#34; as people across the world continue to die in the absence of vaccines. </p><p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson told Insider in a statement: &#34;Vaccine manufacturing is highly complex, and accelerating production at this scale and speed requires partners around the world with capabilities to manufacture using our standard process to ensure consistency and quality of the vaccine.&#34;</p><p>The spokesperson said AstraZeneca was the first company to sign up to COVAX, &#34;for which our vaccine has provided 98% of all supply to date. The majority of doses supplied through COVAX are for low and middle-income countries.&#34;</p><p>The statement continued. &#34;To deliver on our commitment to broad and equitable access and accelerate vaccine production, we have enabled technology transfer to more than 20 different supply partners across more than 15 countries around the globe.&#34;</p><p>It added: &#34;Vaccine manufacturing is highly complex, and accelerating production at this scale and speed requires partners around the world with capabilities to manufacture using our standard process to ensure consistency and quality of the vaccine.&#34;</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call to share technology and expertise for vaccine production through the WHO&#39;s technology pool comes amid vaccine shortages in many developing countries. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countries that have been hit hard in recent weeks include <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/india-coronavirus-crisis-who-europe-head-warns-could-happen-anywhere-2021-4\">India, which has been battling an unprecedented COVID-19 surge</a> that was overwhelming hospitals and crematoria. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, India has reported more than 19 million COVID-19 cases and more than 216,000 deaths. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/astrazeneca-no-engineers-available-to-share-covid-19-vaccine-tech-with-who-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Noxd1F41LZU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 16:21:18 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/601f431acca90200129b6dce?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"30dd1bcc926600ff067ff3f00cd9620f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn50@2020_1/2021/05/03/03-57-18-688_601f7ffb87952106.webp","destWidth":1749,"destHeight":1312,"sourceBytes":26848,"destBytes":26848,"author":"ztayeb@businessinsider.com (Zahra Tayeb)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/601f431acca90200129b6dce?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn50@2020_1/2021/05/03/03-57-18-688_601f7ffb87952106.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn21@2020_6/2021/05/03/03-57-25-154_ce0606adbb87462a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn66@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-23-435_ad30d8951071e8ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Noxd1F41LZU:077rux8VaZI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn29@2020_3/2021/05/03/03-57-25-229_519b878b980a1407.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Noxd1F41LZU":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238428},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"Leading QAnon antisemite who was retweeted by Trump was hiding in plain sight as a chiropractor from Denver, says investigation","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/leading-qanon-influencer-is-denver-chiropractor-vice-report-says-2021-5","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608e8a7d34af8d001859a73a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"craig longley inevitableet qanon\" height=\"343\" width=\"457\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot grabbed from a video on Craig Longley’s YouTube channel dedicated to physical therapy.

She told Vice that she met him at a CrossFit gym in 2016.</p><p>She later signed up to chiropractic sessions with him and told the media outlet that Longley spoke to her about Jeffrey Epstein, Hillary Clinton, and the Obamas - popular boogeymen in the QAnon world.</p><p>&#34;He was effectively trying to red pill me,&#34; Maria said.</p><p>Longley has also been identified via content he shared on his QAnon accounts.

regular checks for the duration of the crisis,&#34; Bonin wrote on the petition. &#34;Otherwise, laid-off workers, furloughed workers, the self-employed, and workers dealing with reduced hours will

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/1400-stimulus-checks-already-landing-in-peoples-bank-accounts-2021-3\">$1,400</a> to eligible Americans.

Below is a summary of our conversation, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/7-mentally-tough-people-on-tactics-they-use-to-build/id1554109805?i=1000510318492\">but you can listen on Apple Podcasts</a>.</p><h2>1. David Goggins, the toughest athlete on the planet</h2><p>David Goggins grew up living in fear. At school, he experienced incessant bullying and racism. At home, he suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his own father.</p><p>By the time Goggins was in his early 20s, he had asthma, a learning disability, a stutter, and crushingly low self-esteem. He was earning less than $1,000 a month spraying for cockroaches.</p><p>One night, he came home with a 42-ounce shake from Steak and Shake and sat down in front of the TV. He stumbled upon a documentary on the US Navy SEALs  that changed the trajectory of his entire life.</p><p>Through a relentless determination and grit, Goggins went on to complete three Navy SEAL &#34;hell weeks,&#34; more than 50 endurance races, and holds the Guinness World Record for most pull-ups (4,030) in 24 hours.</p><p>He used a number of mental strategies to help him become mentally unshakeable.</p><p><strong>Create an alter ego:</strong> Goggins believes he was built, not born. He intentionally created <a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/why-the-worlds-most-confident-people\">a separate identity</a> that separated him from his past of bullying, fear, and abuse. &#34;I had to create &#39;Goggins,&#39; because &#39;David Goggins&#39; was a weak kid. So I created &#39;Goggins,&#39;&#34; he said. &#34;I wanted to be proud of who I was.&#34;</p><p>Johnson says that self-distancing is a helpful strategy in helping us manage our emotions better. &#34;When you create an alter ego, it actually feels like we have a choice, and we&#39;re not identifying with who we are in that very moment but that we have a choice to be who we want to be. When we distance slightly, we give ourselves the ability to choose.&#34;</p><p><strong>Follow the 40% rule:</strong> There&#39;s a reason why even though most people hit a wall at mile 16 during a marathon, they&#39;re still able to finish. Goggins explains it through his 40% rule: When your mind is telling you that you&#39;re done, that you&#39;re exhausted, that you cannot possibly go any further, you&#39;re only actually 40% done.</p><p>&#34;Your brain is wired to protect you,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;Most of the time our brain will show up to protect us when we don&#39;t need protecting.&#34; If you do one difficult task per day, you can increase your threshold for discomfort.&#34;</p><p><strong>Face the accountability mirror:</strong> When Goggins decided to become a Navy SEAL, he looked at his reflection in the mirror and said, &#34;You&#39;re fat, you&#39;re lazy, and you&#39;re a liar.&#34; This sounds harsh, but Goggins says that he needed to face his insecurities head on in order to overcome them. He created something he called the &#34;Accountability Mirror.&#34; He pasted sticky notes around the outside of the mirror outlining the practical steps he needed to take to achieve his goals. They would say things like, &#34;Go one day without lying for external validation&#34; and &#34;Go on a 2-mile run.&#34; If you&#39;re not happy with your reflection, Goggins suggests asking yourself, &#34;What am I going to do today to change what I see in the mirror?&#34;</p><p>Johnson says this strategy is so powerful because you are the only person in the world you can&#39;t lie to and get away with it. &#34;The same way we earn trust with others by doing the things we say we&#39;re going to do is the same way we earn trust with ourselves,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;When you talk to yourself in the mirror, it opens up your blind spots and the things you may not want to admit to yourself. It may hurt, but it&#39;s so necessary to get to that next level.&#34;</p><h2><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-courtney-dauwalter\">2. Courtney Dauwalter, the ultra-runner who personifies pain</a></h2><p>In 2017, Dauwalter dominated the headlines after she won the Moab 240, a 240.3 mile footrace through some of Utah&#39;s most challenging terrain. It took her 58 hours, and she beat the second place finisher by more than 10 hours. In 2018, she won the Western States Endurance Run, which is 100 miles, in 17 hours and 27 minutes. The list of impressive achievements goes on and on.</p><p>Dauwalter credits her success to being able to master the art of suffering. She has managed to stay calm even through bouts of severe nausea, a bleeding head injury, and temporary blindness. &#34;I don&#39;t think those types of pain and suffering are signs you should stop,&#34; she said. &#34;I mean, I troubleshoot and try to fix what&#39;s causing it, but my solution is usually to just keep going.&#34; Here&#39;s how she does it:</p><p><strong>Embrace the &#34;pain cave:&#34;</strong> Dauwalter talks about pain as an actual place: the pain cave. The reason it&#39;s helpful to personify pain is that it serves as a reminder that you&#39;re in control when you enter and equally as aware that you can leave. &#34;It&#39;s not a place I&#39;m scared to enter,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#39;s a place I&#39;m excited to find the entrance to.&#34;</p><p>Johnson says there&#39;s an important distinction between listening to yourself and talking to yourself. You should avoid the former and encourage the latter. When you listen to yourself, you hear all the negativity and all the reasons why you can&#39;t go on, she said, but when you talk to yourself, you can tell yourself the things you need to hear in order to overcome the challenge ahead of you. Johnson adds: &#34;Courtney approached it with a challenge mindset instead of a threat mindset. That&#39;s why she&#39;s performing from a place of power instead of a place of fear.&#34;</p><p><strong>Stay motivated with a &#34;carrot&#34; goal: </strong>In one ultra-race, Dauwalter&#39;s goal was to complete 200 miles in 48 hours. But she had a rough race, and another competitor passed her for first place in the very last stretch. She needed to find another reason to continue pushing her body, so her new goal became: &#34;If you&#39;re not going to get first place, then try to finish under the 50-hour mark.&#34; It became a new &#34;carrot to dangle.&#34;</p><p>Same goes for everyday life. If you fall short of a goal, you can find another carrot that will keep you motivated and get you closer to the goal for your next attempt. &#34;Be committed to the outcome that you want,&#34; Johnson said, &#34;but stay flexible in your approach.&#34;</p><h2><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-tara-westover\">3. Tara Westover, the relentless student who overcame it all</a></h2><p>Tara Westover was 17 years old when she set foot in a classroom for the first time. Born to survivalist Mormon parents in the mountains of Idaho, she grew up isolated from mainstream society. Her father had a severe mistrust of the government to the point where he forbade the family from visiting hospitals or attending school.</p><p>She taught herself enough algebra to pass the college entrance exams and became a competitive applicant to Brigham Young University. There, she studied history and learned for the first time about world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement.</p><p>&#34;For some people, education is self-determination, and that&#39;s what it was for me, and for other people, it&#39;s like predetermination and it&#39;s something that keeps them down,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#39;s like the difference of education being a ladder or being a fence.&#34;</p><p>Here&#39;s what she learned along the way:</p><p><strong>Don&#39;t mistake your reality as the only truth:</strong> When Westover was growing up, she considered her father&#39;s opinion as &#34;the truth.&#34; After she began to attend school, she realized that there is no universal, absolute truth. Our version of the world is not the only version - it is simply one of many, many perspectives. It takes strength and courage to start questioning your own family&#39;s beliefs and opinions in order to adopt ones more in line with your own path.</p><p>&#34;At first people are going to tell you that you can&#39;t do something out of their own fears,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;But the second you start doing what you want to do and you start doing it well, they&#39;re going to tell everybody how they met you.&#34;</p><p><strong>Break your patterns:</strong> When Westover used to return to her family&#39;s home, she felt herself falling right back into the same identity she once had - that fearful and insecure 16-year-old girl. As kids, some of us learn unhealthy patterns from our parents.</p><p>The second we venture out on our own, we feel liberated and changed, but as soon as we get back in that familiar environment, we repeat the same patterns. &#34;The environment is that invisible hand that shapes us, which is why it&#39;s so important to pay attention to who you&#39;re surrounding yourself with,&#34; Johnson said. Spend your time with people who challenge your existing beliefs and teach you to be more resilient.</p><h2><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-anthony-ray-hinton\">4. Anthony Ray Hinton, the man who survived death row</a></h2><p>In 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and wrongfully charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Hinton knew it was a case of mistaken identity and naively believed that the truth would prove his innocence and set him free.</p><p>But as a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He maintained his innocence through the entire duration of the 30 years he served on death row, which makes him one of the longest serving death row prisoners in Alabama history.</p><p>In his time on death row, Hinton watched 54 men walk past his cell to be executed. Another 22 took their own lives. &#34;My cell was 30 feet from the chamber, and I could smell the burning flesh,&#34; he writes. Yet he managed to maintain hope and befriend those society had given up on.</p><p><strong>Visualize a better reality:</strong> On death row, Hinton figured out a technique that was able to get him out of his tragic circumstances: Daydreaming. While in his cell, Hinton traveled the world, married Halle Berry, had tea with Queen Elizabeth, and won Wimbledon - all in his mind. &#34;I never used my mind for garbage,&#34; he said. &#34;I used it to cope through some lonely days.&#34; Hinton started a book club for fellow inmates who also wanted to experience the power of visualization.</p><p>&#34;The cool thing about visualization is that our brain doesn&#39;t know the difference between imagination and reality,&#34; Johnson says. &#34;It&#39;s the same as watching a movie - we&#39;re not part of the movie, but we&#39;re having an emotional reaction to it.&#34; Mental toughness is easy when things are going well, but the true test comes if you can train yourself to use mental strategies like visualization in moments of crisis, panic, and disaster.</p><p><strong>Find the good in the awful: </strong>It&#39;s hard to imagine you&#39;d be able to forgive those who abused the system and sentenced you to death, but Hinton sees it differently. &#34;I&#39;ve never had an apology, but I forgave those involved in my conviction long before I left prison. I didn&#39;t forgive them so they can sleep well at night. I did it so I can.&#34;</p><p>Research shows that people who are good at framing negative life events in positive ways have better mental health. &#34;I&#39;m sure there are a million things Anthony could tell you about his misery and the things that were awful and unjust,&#34; Johnson says. &#34;But when you look back and you choose to find the good in the bad, your experience of it changes. It&#39;s not for anyone else - it&#39;s for you.&#34;</p><h2>5. Emily Harrington, the climber who befriended her fear</h2><p>Emily Harrington became the first woman to free climb El Capitan&#39;s notoriously difficult Golden Gate route in under 24 hours. She attempted it in 2019, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2019/11/26/sport/emily-harrington-climbing-fall-el-capitan-spt-intl/index.html\">but it ended in disaster</a> after Harrington fell 50 feet, hit her head on a ledge, and suffered a concussion. &#34;It&#39;s definitely a mental struggle, coming over that hurdle, coming back into this year and trying again,&#34; she said.</p><p>Here&#39;s how she learned to accept fear:</p><p><strong>Learn how to accept fear:</strong> Rather than push away the things she&#39;s fearful of, she&#39;s learned to befriend them. &#34;I work through it by just accepting it and trying to understand why it&#39;s there and then taking steps to move forward,&#34; she said. &#34;In a lot of ways, we can use fear as fuel and as strength.&#34; But how can people learn not to fear the things they&#39;re afraid of?</p><p>Johnson says it&#39;s possible to think and feel one way, but act in a totally different way. &#34;Your feelings and actions don&#39;t have to match to co-exist,&#34; she said. &#34;So yes, you can feel fear and do it anyway. [Emily] is not ignoring the fact that she feels fearful, but it&#39;s accepting it and choosing to act anyway.&#34;</p><p><strong>Use mantras in times of panic:</strong> Harrington uses mantras when she&#39;s in difficult situations in order to soothe the panic in her brain. She says this to herself over and over again: &#34;Be vulnerable, accept failure, and embrace fear.&#34;</p><p>Passion is the result of identifying what makes you uncomfortable and scares you most. &#34;Feelings aren&#39;t facts. They&#39;re data points,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;Fear is often a good indication that this is something you care about.&#34;</p><h2><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-sara-blakely\">6. Sarah Blakely, the founder who used failure as a weapon</a></h2><p>Sara Blakely is no stranger to failure.</p><p>Growing up, she wanted to be a trial attorney, but then she bombed the LSAT. After college, she auditioned to be Goofy at Disney World, but she was too short to wear the costume. After a stint as an Epcot ride greeter at &#34;the happiest place on earth,&#34; Blakely returned home and moved in with her mom.</p><p>One night, she decided to wear her new white pants to a party, but her underwear left unflattering panty lines. So she cut the feet off a pair of pantyhose and turned them into a slimming undergarment. &#34;The moment I saw how good my butt looked, I was like, &#39;Thank you, God, this is my opportunity,&#34; she said.</p><p>That moment changed the trajectory of her entire life. In 2000, Blakely used her $5,000 in savings to start her company Spanx, and by 2012, she was named the youngest self-made female billionaire.</p><p>The key to her success has been that Blakely sees an opportunity in every failure or disappointment. &#34;Spanx wouldn&#39;t exist if I had aced the LSAT,&#34; she said.</p><p><strong>Learn to celebrate failure:</strong> When Blakely was growing up, her family would go around the dinner table and share their biggest failure of the week. &#34;If I didn&#39;t have something to share, [my father] would actually be disappointed,&#34; she said. The exercise re-defined failure in Blakely&#39;s mind. &#34;Instead of failure becoming an outcome, it simply became about not trying,&#34; she said. &#34;And that truly is the only failure - to not try.&#34;</p><p>In reflecting on Blakely&#39;s story, Johnson explains that we could never know how much we could achieve unless we go so far that we reach the point of failure. She adds:&#34;How will you know how far you can go if you don&#39;t risk losing it to some degree?&#34; If you frame failure as a data point, you can get a lot of great feedback on how you can improve in the future.</p><p><strong>Diffuse difficult situations with humor:</strong> Life can be heavy, Blakely said, and having someone who can lighten the mood or make you laugh is one of the most important things. For example, when she and her husband get in a heated argument, he extends his hand, and they slow dance.</p><p>Johnson explains: &#34;Sometimes we can take ourselves too seriously. When we joke and laugh, it brings us back down to reality.&#34;</p><h2><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/kobe-bryant\">7. Kobe Bryant, the player who turned greatness into an obsession</a></h2><p>One year ago, Kobe Bryant&#39;s life came to an end in a sudden and tragic manner. The 18-time NBA All-Star who had a 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020. His 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others also died in the crash.</p><p>But Bryant&#39;s legacy continues to live on. On and off the court, he was best known for his obsessive pursuit of precision and excellence, which he dubbed &#34;the Mamba Mentality.&#34; Bryant&#39;s life and career remind us that the only answer to surviving unimaginable hardship is to keep moving forward and drawing on our own resilience.</p><p><strong>Use an alter ego to summon confidence:</strong> Bryant created his &#34;Black Mamba&#34; alter ego as a way to get through the lowest point of his career. His nickname was inspired by the movie &#34;Kill Bill,&#34; in which the snake, known for its agility and aggressiveness, was used as a code name for a deadly assassin. At a time when people were chanting &#34;Kobe sucks,&#34; while he was playing, Bryant said that using an alter ego gave him emotional distance from his real self.</p><p>&#34;Kobe and the Black Mamba - both of them were him,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;But there was a time in competition when he could turn it on and use [the identity] that was appropriate for the situation.&#34;</p><p><strong>Remember that life only moves forward:</strong> To Bryant, the antidote to listlessness and defeat was drive and relentlessness. He never believed in &#34;go with the flow.&#34; Rather, he believed in moving forward with intent. Instead of shying away from adversity, bring this Bryant quote to the forefront of your mind: &#34;I&#39;m reflective only in the sense that I learn to move forward…I reflect with a purpose.&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s because he knew that action is the only thing that leads to confidence and improvement. &#34;Kobe would gain an understanding around the unknown,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;When we can prepare for something and gain competence, we actually gain confidence.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Elizabeth Warren over the wealth tax</a>. The investor, whose estimated net worth is $2.5 billion according to Forbes, also discussed his &#34;modest&#34; lifestyle choices.<br><br><strong>Here are his 10 best quotes:</strong></p><p>(1) On his bearish long-term market outlook:</p><p>&#34;Let&#39;s face it. The market is facing the fact that taxes are going up, interest rates are going up, and inflation is going up. And we have a reasonably richly appraised market. So cyclically I&#39;m engaged. But I got an eye on the exit,&#34; said Cooperman, who also told CNBC <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/leon-cooperman-stock-market-outlook-tax-rising-inflation-risk-fed-2021-4-1030371636\">the stock market will be lower a year from today.</a></p><p>(2) On inflation that could surprise the Federal Reserve:</p><p>&#34;I think that Mr. Powell will be surprised by inflation. It&#39;s not going to be as quiescent and transitory as he thinks. I think the Fed will be forced to say something before the end of 2022.&#34;</p><p>(3) On the &#34;self-correcting&#34; nature of the current market:</p><p>&#34;The market has been very self corrective, in the sense that the FAANG stocks are not expensive, but the aspiring FAANG stocks are very expensive, and they&#39;ve been corrected in a serious way. The whole slowdown in the SPAC area is self-correcting.&#34;</p><p>(4) On the fixed income market being &#34;overvalued.&#34; </p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand why someone would want to buy a bond if you&#39;re going to give away 40% to 50% of the coupon to the government and then you have inflation, you&#39;re getting your capital confiscated. I&#39;d rather take my chance on a common stock.&#34;</p><p>(5) On the rapid pace of economic growth:</p><p>&#34;If you spoke to a hundred economists today and  asked them what their view is of the potential real growth of the US economy, the response would be centered around 2%,&#34; Cooperman said. &#34;We&#39;re growing this year four to five times potential, yet the Fed is persistent in keeping interest rates at near zero. That doesn&#39;t make any great sense to me. It&#39;s just pushing people out on the risk curve.&#34;</p><p>(6) On his on-going back and forth with Sen. Elizabeth Warren:</p><p>Cooperman said he thinks that Warren&#39;s wealth tax is &#34;probably&#34; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-elizabeth-warrens-wealth-tax-constitutional-law-professors-billionaires-inequality-2021-3\">unconstitutional</a>.  &#34;I don&#39;t know her. I don&#39;t vote in Massachusetts, but I think she&#39;s very wrong-minded,&#34; he said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-economic-growth-rising-yields-credit-suisse-2021-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy these 14 high-quality stocks poised to beat the market as the economy enters a new phase of rapid growth, Credit Suisse says</a></em></p><p>(7) On the wealth tax: </p><p>&#34;I do believe in the progressive income tax structure, I do believe rich people should pay more. The wealth tax makes no sense to me, for lots of reasons. In all the countries it&#39;s been introduced, I think 14 out of 17, it&#39;s been eliminated. And there are so many better ways of going about what [Warren is] looking to accomplish.&#34;</p><p>(8) On the success of wealthy individuals:</p><p>&#34;How do you get to be very wealthy? You develop a product or service the world wants. Is the world better off or worse off because of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Bernie Marcus, Ken Langone? I think the world is better off.&#34;</p><p>(9) In defense of capitalism, and mega-cap companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook:</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m a capitalist with a heart. I don&#39;t have much use of money. I respect money. I lived very modestly, but I believe that what has made America great is our commitment to capitalism. And the fact that we are turning our back in many respects on capitalism is wrong...God knows what we would be going through if we didn&#39;t have those companies in the last few years to help us with this pandemic.&#34; Cooperman said.</p><p>(10) His view that material possessions bring &#34;aggravation.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I just bought a new car the other day and the car I traded in was a 2002 Lexus- I kept the car for 20 years! And I bought a Hyundai. I&#39;m not a collector of things.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/leon-cooperman-best-quotes-stock-market-forecast-outlook-fed-warren-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1KO6IvViGXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 14:57:22 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608c50b935c46f0018c0baf4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"38e016579fdf310a0fdedd31b3b68442","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_3/2021/05/03/03-57-21-692_20ddadfd3e2f3ae0.webp","destWidth":2668,"destHeight":1999,"sourceBytes":130578,"destBytes":130578,"author":"egraffeo@businessinsider.com (Emily Graffeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/608c50af34af8d001859a568?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn50@2020_3/2021/05/03/03-57-22-274_bfda595282546783.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-24-517_35fbef54d47cc380.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn54@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-25-290_67ef553f8f49e5ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1KO6IvViGXI:HfrNKMbt5Jo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/03/03-57-23-892_5ceab981fccb6f26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1KO6IvViGXI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-414_f6d5ff40398691a6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238435},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"Why declaring racism a public health crisis is an important step to closing racial gaps in healthcare","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/declaring-racism-epidemic-help-close-racial-gaps-health-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c3e1234af8d001859a4e1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Racism is a virus AAPI stop the hate protest\" height=\"682\" width=\"910\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Racism is as much a public health issue as it is a social justice issue.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>On April 8, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P.

It also may require all health-related professional training programs to include structural racism identification and implied bias and anti-racism strategies within the curriculum.

The most striking one has nothing to do with intelligence, diet, or job status.

Where someone lives is the greatest predictor of <a href=\"https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/interactives/whereyouliveaffectshowlongyoulive.html\">health and life expectancy</a>.

Here, a baby born today in a southern urban neighborhood will <a href=\"https://www.savi.org/report/worlds-apart/\">live 14 years less</a> than another baby born in the northern suburbs, less than 20 miles away. How a nation protects the health of its children tells you an enormous amount about that society. In the US, our infant mortality - babies who die before their first birthday - is among the <a href=\"https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2019-annual-report/international-comparison\">highest in the world</a>, with the highest rates in the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/NVSR-69-7-508.pdf\">Midwestern and Southern states</a>.

New medicines or gadgets had little to do with it. Most of those extra years came because of the protection afforded by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a5.htm\">public health system</a>. That includes clean water, a food supply that&#39;s safe, and an improved environment.</p><p>Decades of discriminatory housing practices have burdened Black communities with poverty, substandard housing, and environmental hazards. Unfortunately, most federally assisted housing is located in segregated areas at a greater risk of <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alixwinter/files/sampson_winter_2016.pdf\">lead poisoning</a>, exposure to <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk/disparities\">air pollution</a>, or lack of access to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2013.10.010\">healthy food</a>.</p><p>Nearly 18% of the US economy <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical\">goes toward healthcare spending</a>.

Harris herself has addressed the group on multiple occasions and her husband and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff even identifies as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/douglasemhoff\">member of the #KHive in his Twitter biography</a>.</p><p>But some members of Harris&#39;s digital army have also been accused of taking their loyalty too far.</p><p>Last year, a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/kamala-harris-khive-toxic-side_n_5f4fa573c5b69eb5c037473e?ri18n=true\">Huffington Post investigation</a> found nearly a dozen people who said they had been threatened or harassed by some self-identified members of the KHive.</p><p>Multiple people told the Post their personal information had been published online after some fans instigated harassment campaigns against them for previously backing Democratic candidates other than Harris.</p><p>One person claimed they were forced to temporarily move their family to a different location for fear they were in physical danger, while two women claimed that KHive members even made veiled threats toward their children. </p><p>&#34;People are ugly and disrespectful all over the internet. The KHive, in particular, simply wants to set the record straight,&#34; Chavous said when asked by Insider about the allegations.</p><p>Chantay Berry, a 34-year-old graduate student at Brooklyn College and KHive member who has previously engaged in online arguments, admitted to Insider that the online world of politics can get toxic.</p><p>&#34;Some of us do play a part in going back and forth with people.

She did not respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>But the group also aggressively targets right-wing outlets, like the New York Post, who have spent the last few 100 days frequently criticizing Harris on multiple issues, including <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-trumps-half-built-border-wall-and-ruined-landscape-2021-2\">immigration</a>.</p><p>&#34;I want to know from the right where the hell was that energy when Donald Trump basically wrecked everything in our country and wrecked everything?&#34; Berry told Insider.</p><p>&#34;We all know they&#39;re only attacking her because they know she&#39;s gonna be the president one day,&#34; she added.</p><p>Berry told Insider that the KHive has no plans to go anywhere, especially considering Harris&#39; increasing chances of becoming president in 2024.</p><p>&#34;I think that now that she&#39;s in office, we&#39;re still all stans, but now we&#39;re all stans watching for the next four years, hoping that she becomes president,&#34;

The measure follows the March passage of Biden&#39;s $1.9 trillion stimulus package and joins the president&#39;s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan as his latest step in big-government economic policy.</p><p>Republicans and some moderate Democrats have balked at the follow-up plans cost, saying the measures would dangerously inflate the government&#39;s debt pile. Yellen countered on NBC&#39;s &#34;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-janet-yellen-interview-over-the-long-run-deficits-need-to-be-contained-111205957834\">Meet The Press</a>,&#34; saying it&#39;s a better time than ever to spend on such projects.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re in a good fiscal position. Interest rates are historically low... and it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll stay that way into the future,&#34; the Treasury Secretary said. &#34;I believe that we should pay for these historic investments. There will be a big return.&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s not to say the government shouldn&#39;t <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-progressive-taxation-biden-spending-proposals-infrastructure-2021-5\">offset the multitrillion-dollar price tag</a>. The Biden administration rolled out a handful of tax hikes and stronger enforcement to cover the spending, but those proposals were swiftly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-speech-gop-response-delivered-by-sen-tim-scott-2021-4\">rejected by Republicans.</a> The GOP has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/senate-republican-infrastructure-plan-breakdown-biden-2021-4-1030334674\">criticized Biden&#39;s public-works plan and a proposed corporate tax increase,</a> calling it a &#34;slush-fund&#34; and a &#34;Trojan horse&#34; for Democratic priorities.</p><p>The economy is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/employment-outlook-stimulus-virus-fears-labor-market-recovery-participation-bofa-2021-5\">poised to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic throughout 2021</a> and, in turn, bring in greater tax revenues. That stronger growth justifies some spending, but the safest and most sustainable way to spend on infrastructure and care involves equitable tax increases, Yellen said.</p><p>Stricter tax compliance would also play a critical role.

Growth at that pace would place economic output at a new record high, surpassing the peak seen during the fourth quarter of 2019. It would also be the second-strongest rate of growth since 1978, exceeded only by the record-breaking expansion seen through the third quarter of 2020.</p><p>The central bank&#39;s nowcast is a type of projection that is updated as new economic data is published. GDPNow isn&#39;t an official forecast from the Atlanta Fed, and is instead used to narrow down where quarterly growth is likely to land. The model also ignores the pandemic&#39;s impact beyond its influence on source data <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/america-post-pandemic-glow-up-consumer-spending-shopping-2021-4\">such as retail sales</a> and global trade, according to the Fed.</p><p>The first GDPNow reading for the second quarter was published on Friday, just one day after the Commerce Department published its initial estimate of first-quarter growth. US GDP expanded <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-q1-gdp-economic-output-recovery-reopening-stimulus-vaccination-recession-2021-4\">at an annualized rate of 6.4%</a> in the first three months of the year, missing the median estimate of 6.7% but still showing a sharp acceleration from the prior period. The jump was primarily fueled by widespread vaccination, gradual reopening, and stimulus passed by former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.</p><p>To be sure, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-rebound-goods-commodities-services-more-expensive-inflation-stimulus-2021-2\">last quarter&#39;s expansion</a> came in softer than the Atlanta Fed&#39;s final first-quarter estimate of 7.9%.</p><p>Though some individual indicators have already surpassed their pre-pandemic levels and signal a strong recovery, GDP remains just below its previous peak. Following the first-quarter reading, GDP has retraced about 96% of its pandemic-era decline. With data tracking consumer spending and hiring trending higher as the economy reopens further, the US is largely expected to complete its GDP recovery in the next two months.</p><p>Economists outside the Fed also see growth accelerating through the current quarter. The consensus estimate from a survey of forecasters calls for annualized growth of just under 9% in the second quarter. The most bullish estimates see GDP expanding at a rate of more than 11%, while the least optimistic expect growth to land at about 6%.</p><p>The estimates underscore the fact that, should vaccination continue and case counts decline further, the US is on track for its strongest rate of annual growth in decades. The International Monetary Fund estimates GDP will grow 6.4% through all of 2021, exceeding global growth of about 6% and marking the fastest rate of expansion since the early 1980s. Separately, Federal Reserve officials hold a median estimate of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-economic-outlook-gdp-unemployment-rate-stimulus-vaccinations-fomc-2021-3\">6.5% growth</a> this year.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-us-gdp-growth-estimate-atlanta-federal-reserve-forecast-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/hL4VXNl3cU4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 14:11:15 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608eac4034af8d001859a767?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d4391d3c0f8a10a42a91122f25876831","destWidth":2353,"destHeight":1764,"sourceBytes":273958,"destBytes":273958,"author":"bwinck@businessinsider.com (Ben Winck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/608e9fe834af8d001859a754?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-30-299_47fc80eb06bbe509.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn59@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-23-751_aeef0e459f2642b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=hL4VXNl3cU4:tGnX7l4tEqw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_6/2021/05/03/03-57-23-945_01013ae10e79bfe0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/hL4VXNl3cU4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-25-746_5d71226a0f771337.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238430},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"The Air Force's brand-new F-15EX fighter jet is about to have its first major exercise","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-air-force-f15ex-fighter-jet-first-major-exercise-2021-5","description":"<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/604f81bed2836f0018d47bf2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force F-15EX fighter jet\" height=\"798\" width=\"1597\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   The first F-15EX is delivered to its new home at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, March 11, 2021. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force/Tech.

It&#39;s not like you have to, but you&#39;re going to want to. </p><p><strong>Jordana Herschthal:</strong> &#34;Botox is so simple, anyone can give an injection.&#34; My 2-year-old can push a plunger, but it&#39;s also very easy to mess someone&#39;s face up.</p><p>&#34;Botox will make you look emotionless.&#34; Rita, can you tell I&#39;m happy right now?</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> That&#39;s you happy?!</p><p>Hi, my name is Dr. Rita Linkner. I am a board-certified dermatologist from New York City. I spend the majority of my day doing injectables and lasers.</p><p><strong>Herschthal:</strong> Hi, I&#39;m Dr. Jordana Herschthal, and I&#39;m a board-certified dermatologist in Boca Raton, Florida, and I love talking with patients about their aesthetic goals and helping them see the full picture. And we&#39;re here today to debunk myths about Botox.</p><p>Myths from social media.</p><p>&#34;Botox is toxic to your body.&#34; This is not true, but it&#39;s good to know the history of Botox.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>Botox gets that name recognition. It was the first neuromodulator that was FDA approved, so it&#39;s a household name, like Kleenex and Xerox. And so today we&#39;re going to be referring to Botox as that umbrella term when we&#39;re discussing all of the neuromodulators that are currently FDA approved.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>So, Botox contains a purified protein known as botulinum toxin, which is derived from a bacteria that causes botulism, which is toxic to your body. However, Botox used appropriately in appropriate dosing is very safe and very effective. There are over 3,000 studies proving its efficacy and safety. The other reason it is very safe to use is we know that it stays where we inject it. So it&#39;s not like you&#39;re getting Botox in your forehead and it&#39;s going all over your body. Botox is limited to where it is injected, and it is safely metabolized and excreted by your body in a few months.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>I always tell patients if Botox was dangerous, I literally wouldn&#39;t have a pulse. I&#39;m someone who puts, like, 100 units of Botox into my face and neck every four and a half months. And I have so for over a decade.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>So, there are certain medical conditions that are contraindicated to the use of Botox. So you should have a very thorough discussion with your provider before you receive a Botox treatment.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>&#34;Botox is permanent.&#34; So, let&#39;s debunk this one. Botox is not permanent. Everybody metabolizes Botox differently.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>One of the great things about Botox is if you don&#39;t like the way it looks, it&#39;s completely out of your system in three to six months. But it&#39;s also the worst thing, because if you like the way it looks, you have to do it again.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>There is a super-Botox that&#39;s out on the horizon, though, that&#39;s looking to get FDA approved later this year. It&#39;s going for FDA approval for 11s in between the eyebrows, and I can tell you confidently that it works and it&#39;s going to have an indication that&#39;s going to be longer than three to five months.</p><p><strong>Herschthal:</strong> &#34;Some creams and serums work like Botox.&#34; This is absolutely false. Botox works at the muscular level, at specifically the neuromuscular junction, to prevent the muscle from contracting. There is currently no serum, cream, or facial that can penetrate the skin deep enough to exert action at the level of the muscle. And if it were true, it would have to have FDA approval and it would not be available over the counter.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>I completely agree. I like to tell patients, you&#39;re genetically programmed to move your muscles in a certain way, and over time you get what we call dynamic wrinkles, which are lines associated with muscle movement. And the way Botox works is it builds in resistance so that you can&#39;t overutilize those muscles anymore, you can&#39;t crease them, and it basically helps to smooth everything out.</p><p>So, next myth, &#34;Getting Botox is super painful.&#34; I would have to say this one&#39;s false.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>The pain of a Botox needle is pretty minimal, but it is similar to if you got, like, a splinter in your finger or perhaps a beesting. Everybody&#39;s experience with pain is different.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> They&#39;re insulin needles. They&#39;re as small as you can get. And it goes faster than people think, also. Though I think location on the face does make a big difference in terms of sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>And this relates to how important it is for your provider to really have a deep understanding of anatomy when you&#39;re getting any sort of injectable on your face.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>I mean, I can do a full face, a full neck of Botox in probably under four minutes. And if people are really averse to needles, you could always topically numb someone to help that pain dissipate.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>There are other little tricks, like vibration devices and also ice. And even for patients who are really sensitive, we break out the Pro-Nox, which is half-dose laughing gas, and that always calms patients down immediately and leaves your system within five minutes.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> &#34;The Botox chemical is physically addictive.&#34; I think Botox is like getting your hair colored or your nails done. This is how I like to explain it to patients who ask me, &#34;If I do this once, do I have to keep doing this for the rest of my life?&#34; It&#39;s not like you have to, but you&#39;re going to want to.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>So, I always liken aesthetic treatments like Botox, fillers, and lasers to maintaining any organ in your system. You get your teeth cleaned two to four times a year or whatever it is; you get your aesthetic treatments because you&#39;re always aging. These treatments do not stop the aging process, but these treatments will help you age the way you want to age.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> Myth experts hear the most.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>&#34;Botox is so simple, anyone can give an injection.&#34; On the one hand, giving an injection is very easy. Anyone can push a plunger, my 2-year-old can push a plunger, but it&#39;s also very easy to mess someone&#39;s face up. So it&#39;s really critical that your provider has a deep understanding of anatomy and how these medicines affect anatomy to give you reproducible, great aesthetic outcomes.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>So, Jordana and I are board-certified dermatologists. It took each of us over a decade to get to the point where we were able to put a syringe in our hands and utilize the medicine in it to create facial aesthetics. Both Jordana and I, still to this day, we take courses religiously where we&#39;re learning from the best international patients and doing dissection courses. And we&#39;re still reading every day to really be the best teachers that we can be for our patients.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>&#34;Botox and fillers are the same.&#34; I love this myth, because I probably address it at least once a day. Almost every line on your face can be addressed with filler, but not every line can be addressed with Botox. Botox works at the level of the muscle to relax muscles of contraction. It is preventing and diminishing those static lines, or lines at rest. Fillers, on the other hand, are used to address volume loss that occurs in our face as we age. So, we all have fat compartments all over our face. And as we age, they deflate and descend with time, so we use fillers to restore that lost volume and give a more youthful shape to the face.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>&#34;Botox injections need a lot of recovery time.&#34;</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>The only issue with Botox is if you get a bruise, but there really isn&#39;t downtime. There&#39;s about an hour after the procedure where you will see little bumps under the skin, and that&#39;s the solution of the Botox that was placed under the skin.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>You are taking a needle and putting it into your skin, so you just want to make sure that you&#39;re not doing anything to really thin your blood, which would increase the chances of getting a bruise. So ideally not drinking alcohol the night before or even caffeine the morning of really helps. If you have really high tendency towards bruising, it&#39;s nice to take oral arnica.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>I can always tell when I&#39;m injecting a patient. I call it the booze ooze. It&#39;s like this slow ooze after you inject, and I know that they&#39;ve had a glass of wine or a martini the night before.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> My only rule that I have for my patients when Botox goes in is no exercising for six hours.</p><p><strong>Herschthal:</strong> My only rule is don&#39;t touch the Botox, because I don&#39;t want you spreading it to a different area in the forehead or the glabella area, because you could get into trouble with dropping somebody&#39;s lid. So, the muscles that keep the brow elevated will drop, and then the patient will appear to have a heavier lid. Again, these are not permanent side effects, but they are undesirable side effects.</p><p>&#34;Botox accumulates in the body.&#34; I wish that was true, but unfortunately it does not.</p><p><strong>Linkner</strong>: Every week that your Botox is in, it incrementally decreases. It&#39;s not like it just turns off overnight. I will tell you, in this pandemic, I&#39;m noticing people are exercising more, and that&#39;s making their Botox metabolize a little bit faster. So I get that question a lot. You know, &#34;How do we make my Botox last longer?&#34; And it is dose dependent. So if you put more in, it might not look so natural for those first few weeks, but it should get you to last a couple of weeks longer than when you were using a lower dose.</p><p><strong>Herschthal</strong>: Myths from pop culture. &#34;Botox will make you look emotionless.&#34; I&#39;m hearing the hate, but I&#39;m not seeing the hate. Rita, can you tell I&#39;m happy right now?</p><p><strong>Linkner</strong>: That&#39;s you happy?!</p><p><strong>Herschthal</strong>: So, I think &#34;emotionless&#34; is a little bit of a strong word to describe the effects of Botox. If you have an open conversation with your provider about what your desires are for your Botox treatment, you can easily get a treatment that is more natural looking where you still preserve some movement in the upper face.</p><p><strong>Linkner</strong>: It&#39;s been exactly eight days since Jordana put my Botox in. It hasn&#39;t peaked out yet, but it&#39;s starting to get tighter on me every single day. Do I love how it looks? I mean, I do. Do I love how my children can&#39;t tell what I&#39;m thinking? I love that. So you really have to figure out where you want to run on that spectrum.</p><p><strong>Herschthal:</strong> &#34;Botox is only used cosmetically.&#34; So, Botox was actually first FDA approved in 1989. And that was for the use of two medical disorders of the eye, which is called strabismus and blepharospasm. It wasn&#39;t actually until 2002 that Botox got its first FDA approval for cosmetic indication.</p><p><strong>Linkner</strong>: Well, thank goodness those oculoplastic surgeons were trying to treat these overexercising eye muscles, because that&#39;s when they saw that the 11s in between the eyebrows were disappearing. So it&#39;s because of strabismus that all of us don&#39;t have lines on our face anymore.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>So, Botox has actually been around for over 30 years, and it has over 27 indications, most of which are medical.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> A very common use is for oversweating. So in the underarms, hands, and feet are places, because Botox does attack that little muscle on every sweat gland that helps you to sweat. It can turn that off so that you can decrease sweating. I&#39;ve also used it medically for migraines. The list of FDA indications for medical Botox is so long.</p><p>&#34;Only older women get Botox.&#34; Ugh! No, that&#39;s so false. I was 27 the first time that I put Botox into my crow&#39;s-feet. And I will tell you, it&#39;s something that I do religiously and have done every four and a half months for the past decade.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>So, I like to say that Botox is not gender nor is it age specific. There&#39;s also a huge increase in male patients coming in, specifically for their crow&#39;s-feet. People are wanting to look their best, feel their best. So Botox is not age and it is not gender specific.</p><p><strong>Linkner:</strong> &#34;Botox works right away.&#34;</p><p>Fiona: [sighs] It&#39;s the Botox. I can&#39;t show emotion for another hour and a half.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>So, truthfully, Botox can take, it takes a couple of days to kick in. So let&#39;s say your Botox goes in Friday; you&#39;re not going to start to really feel those results into Sunday, into Monday. It takes a full two weeks to peak out. And at that two-week period, incrementally every single week you&#39;ll gain a little bit of movement back. Everybody metabolizes this stuff differently.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>I think we look natural. I think we&#39;re doing a good job of looking natural.</p><p><strong>Linkner: </strong>We have code words with each other. So if, like, Jordana tells me the code word, then I know I&#39;ve gone to over the line.</p><p><strong>Herschthal: </strong>Yeah, we&#39;ve gone over the edge.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/dermatologists-debunk-13-myths-about-botox-and-injectables-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SX4L_NejDC4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 17:15:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6089a7ba41182b0019e8059b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7255403363efe38356cb40597690002e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn42@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-21-951_3f597a3465dc861a.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":60454,"destBytes":60454,"author":"atang@businessinsider.com (Abby Tang,Michelle Yan Huang,Ally Giannini)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/03/03-57-25-805_b0ac132085f5b82d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-24-903_c9633b9bf26bd8c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SX4L_NejDC4:9AsW8o6dr-E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn92@2020_1/2021/05/03/03-57-27-440_0246c3cfb7100219.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SX4L_NejDC4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-24-591_f37c3abc34c606ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238428},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"10 top crypto tokens, plus the rising stars of equity research","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-tokens-equity-research-rising-stars-spac-shorts-insider-investing-2021-4","description":"<p><em>Hello everyone! </em><em>Welcome to this weekly roundup of Investing stories from deputy editor Joe Ciolli.

Coined NMESIS, the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System can launch Naval Strike Missiles from the back of a modified <a href=\"http://www.military.com/equipment/joint-light-tactical-vehicle-jltv\">Joint Light Tactical Vehicle</a>, or JLTV, to destroy targets on land or at sea.</p>\n<p>Raytheon Missiles and Defense, which makes the Naval Strike Missile, announced Wednesday that the Marine Corps used NMESIS to hit a target in the water from Point Mugu Sea Range in California. The missile can take out targets from more than 100 nautical miles away.</p>\n<p>Commandant Gen. David Berger showed a photo of the test launch to lawmakers Thursday when discussing the need for funding for ground-based anti-ship missiles. He called the test the result of the \"brilliance of a couple of young officers\" and Oshkosh Defense, a Wisconsin-based company that makes the JLTV.</p>\n<p>\"The people at Oshkosh and these couple of majors thought, 'We can do this,' so they took the cab off the back and they put a missile in the back with a fire-control system,\" Berger said. \"Now, we can move this around on vessels or put it ashore and hold an adversary's navy at risk ... to ensure that the lines on the sea are kept open.</p>\n<p>\"This is the speed at which we have to move,\" he added.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608ebafcf22c6b00185db297?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System\" height=\"534\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   NMESIS can launch naval strike missiles from the back of a modified Joint Light Tactical Vehicle at targets on land or at sea. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">US Navy</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>Getting funding for ground-based long-range precision fires out of the next budget will be crucial for the Marine Corps' mission, Berger told lawmakers. He wrote in his 2019 planning guidance that the service had fallen \"woefully behind\" in the development of ground-based long-range precision fires.</p>\n<p>\"We must possess the ability to turn maritime spaces into barriers so we can attack an adversary's sea lines of communication ... while defending our own in support of the Fleet or Joint Force,\" Berger wrote.</p>\n<p>In 2021, the Marine Corps requested $125 million to buy nearly 50 Tomahawk missiles it could launch from land. Congress ultimately did not fund the move. Adm. Phil Davidson, the head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told lawmakers in March that the decision to slash those funds hurt the military's ability to deter China.</p>\n<p>The JLTV used in the test at Point Mugu is an unmanned version known as a ROGUE - or remotely operated ground unit for expeditionary - fires vehicle. The Naval Strike Missile fired from the back carries a 500-pound class warhead, according to Raytheon. The Navy uses the missile on <a href=\"http://www.military.com/equipment/littoral-combat-ship-lcs\">littoral combat ships</a>.</p>\n<p>Combined, the missile and ROGUE fires vehicle form NMESIS, which is operated by artillery Marines, Lt. Gen. Eric Smith, the deputy commandant of Combat Development and Integration, told reporters this month.</p>\n<p>Berger said using a modified JLTV and a proven strike missile gives commanders flexibility since they can fire the munition from a ship or ashore.</p>\n<p>\"It's the same missile, so as needed, the commander can move the ordnance where it's needed most,\" he said. \"... [It also] speeds up our ability to field it. It's a proven missile. ... This is not a new missile system - we know how it performs. So we're riding on the backs of something that is already developed and putting it on a platform that we're very confident in.\"</p>\n<p><em>- Gina Harkins can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:gina.harkins@military.com\">gina.harkins@military.com</a>.

It&#39;s become a badge of honor as well as a great conversation starter.</p><p>People are not only mentioning they&#39;ve been vaccinated, they&#39;re also going into detail as to which vaccine they got and whether they&#39;re half or fully vaccinated. Some even include an eye-catching 💉 emoji. </p><p>Sharing these types of details has become an easy way to convert a conversation to the next stage of the dating process. It&#39;s truly become the ultimate pre-pandemic icebreaker to say, &#34;Oh, look at us, we&#39;re both vaccinated, we should go out and celebrate.&#34; </p><p>As research continues to emerge regarding <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccines-reduce-coronavirus-transmission-early-research-2021-2\">whether or not the vaccines fully prevent transmission of the virus</a>, many singles still view someone who&#39;s been vaccinated as a safer option.</p><p>The bottom line is if they&#39;ve got two choices to date - between the unvaccinated, meaning a date who can pass on COVID-19, and the vaccinated, someone who likely won&#39;t - it&#39;s pretty obvious who looks like a more attractive candidate.</p><h2><strong>People are eager to date again without the fear they might wind up on a ventilator</strong>.</h2><p>Safety isn&#39;t the only factor though. People also want to make the best use of their time.</p><p>I&#39;ve long considered video chats a smart screening tool, as they can help determine whether the person you&#39;re talking to is worth meeting in person. It&#39;s an easy and efficient way to advance a relationship, especially now that work has been reimagined and geography is no longer restrictive for most people. </p><p>This flexibility has made people more open to searching in different markets because they no longer have to board a flight and &#34;meet&#34; for the first time blindly. Technology is evolving the long-distance dating process in that respect. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my clients was initially very skeptical about using video chat. She was excited to advance with someone and meet him in person, saying &#34;I think I like this one. He looks great.&#34; However, I told her she couldn&#39;t like him because she didn&#39;t even know him, and encouraged her to have a video chat first. A few days later, I got a text saying, &#34;Dodged a bullet with that one. Thank you!&#34;</p><p>While video chat features were available long before the pandemic, they were often underutilized. Since COVID-19, more people have come to understand their value, and I believe video chats are now here to stay.</p><p>At the end of the day, singles invest a lot of time, effort, emotions, and resources when it comes to dating, so when they aren&#39;t successful in terms of finding a match, it can leave them feeling frustrated and defeated. </p><h2><strong>After being isolated the past year, some singles are throwing their pre-COVID-19 requirements out the window.</strong></h2><p>People are ready to get back out there with a more open mind. Many didn&#39;t miss the pain points that come along with dating, but know they can&#39;t completely take themselves out of the market because they still want to meet someone. These types are re-entering the dating world with the mindset that dating is less of a priority than before. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my clients who had a lot of pre-COVID requirements clearly reconsidered as she wound up telling me, &#34;If he&#39;s over six feet and vaccinated, count me in!&#34;</p><p>The pre-COVID-19 style of dating is still kind of a novelty at the moment. These early days and attitudes around dating will most likely be different six months from now or even by Labor Day, as people begin to make adjustments to their lifestyle and mindset.</p><h2><strong>Based on my work, while rejection may sting, the consensus is that singles would rather know a connection isn&#39;t moving forward than be ghosted. </strong></h2><p>It&#39;s typically the ambiguity and precariousness of dating that takes up a lot of brain space and creates anxiety. If you know the door is shut, your brain stops ruminating, the loop is closed, and you can move on. There&#39;s a lot to be said for closure.</p><p>The fact is, while many dating apps do their best to match people, they don&#39;t address common dating pain points, such as helping to provide appropriate feedback, a lack of manners, and a desire for closure.</p><p>After being a dating coach for more than five years, I decided to create a dating app called <a href=\"https://darmadating.com/\">Darma</a> that allows people to connect while also offering users the opportunity to receive confidential feedback and closure, something no other app does. Dating feedback can often reveal blind spots in dating or validate that you&#39;re doing everything right. Either way, it&#39;s helpful for a person to know.</p><p>If a single provides a cell number for their date, Darma follows up and asks for feedback from a series of pre-selected options ranging from your date&#39;s table manners and punctuality to their attire and personal hygiene. There&#39;s even a handy &#39;closure&#39; button that allows you to fire off a preselected note rather than ghost someone. </p><h2><strong>Everyone wants more matches on a dating app because matches create opportunities.</strong></h2><p>The dating industry will still evolve post-COVID-19, and while not everyone can afford to hire me or another dating coach, not everyone needs to. I&#39;ve learned through my work that many of the problems with dating can be easily solved with the assistance of technology.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/dating-industry-dating-coach-apps-post-covid-pandemic-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/GFyZb6Tlf4k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faeaa124652d400197443a9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f8baaeaf2c58e4c87c1d8c11c1580025","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn69@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-18-675_291e6769772d22d5.webp","destWidth":3051,"destHeight":2288,"sourceBytes":98078,"destBytes":98078,"author":"insider@insider.com (By Meredith Golden, as told to Jenny Powers)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5faeaa124652d400197443a9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn69@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-18-675_291e6769772d22d5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn25@2020_3/2021/05/03/03-57-22-202_8b43973e67563c75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn78@2020_6/2021/05/03/03-57-26-710_c9ab3f01518a2ef4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=GFyZb6Tlf4k:O5qk25ft-lY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn62@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-22-434_2160f054e75700fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/GFyZb6Tlf4k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn17@2020_1/2021/05/03/03-57-22-901_0e58b00ae3639d81.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238432},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"Facebook puts ad agencies under the microscope","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/insiders-top-advertising-and-media-stories-for-may-3-2021-4","description":"<p>Hi and welcome to Insider Advertising for May 3.

So these shoppers take matters into their own hands, downloading the Walmart app and scanning items&#39; bar codes directly to find hidden deals. </p><p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608c649634af8d001859a5d9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Walmart clearance\" height=\"666\" width=\"826\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Screenshot from Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>The Clearance Shoppers Facebook group is run by Kendall Motzny, who uses the name &#34;The Freebie Guy.&#34; Motzny is one of several administrators of the group. They enforce the rules - no selling, no calling corporate, no spam - and set the tone for the legions of bargain shoppers. </p><p>Shoppers share their deals and congratulate each other in Motzny&#39;s group, which is a surprisingly collaborative effort. Posters often share the codes for their items so that other shoppers can check availability in their own stores using the website <a href=\"https://brickseek.com/\">BrickSeek</a>, which tracks deals and inventory at major retailers like Walmart, Target, and CVS Pharmacy. </p><p>Another Facebook group run by Mama Deals has nearly 400,000 members and a similarly active community of bargain hunters - extreme coupons for the digital age. </p><p>Heather Robbins, a Walmart clearance shopper based in Kansas, recently left her job in a hospital to care for her children. </p><p>&#34;Between going through a pandemic, my husband working swing shifts, and myself staying home with the children all day, I needed a hobby,&#34; she told Insider. </p><p>She heard about the hidden clearance hunting through The Freebie Guy&#39;s social-media platforms. &#34;So, I decided to give Walmart hidden-clearance hunting a try, and turns out I&#39;m actually really good at it,&#34; she told Insider. </p><p>Her favorite finds are typically blankets, though she&#39;s also proud of snagging a crib that was originally $299 for $25. Even if she can&#39;t use an item right when she buys it, she&#39;ll donate it to someone in need or save it for a holiday gift.  </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608af9dd35c46f0018c0b4cf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Walmart hidden clearance\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The clearance aisle at a Walmart in Philadelphia, PA\n<p class=\"copyright\">Annabelle Williams/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What it&#39;s like to hunt for hidden clearance deals</h2><p>I went to Walmart in Philadelphia to check out exactly how the process works for myself. Once there, I made a beeline for the clearance section. All you need is a smartphone with a camera, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fwalmart-app%2F1087865\">Walmart app</a>, and a bit of patience. Then, you want to scan, scan, scan. </p><p>Robbins had told me a bit about her strategy.</p><p>&#34;I look around on the Walmart app, I pay attention to the hidden clearance pages, and I scan the items when I&#39;m in the store. Once you get going and understand the process more, it&#39;s a lot easier to figure out,&#34; Robbins said.</p><p>The Walmart I went to was somewhat daunting - it had one small clearance aisle, but the deals weren&#39;t confined just to that area. Armed with the Walmart app and the BrickSeek website, I looked around for deals and scanned bar codes on my phone. Thankfully, turning on location services in the app allowed Walmart to register I was inside the story, which came in handy when looking for inventory.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608af9de34af8d0018599f86?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Walmart hidden clearance\" height=\"1792\" width=\"828\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>When I entered the store and opened the Walmart app, it registered immediately.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Screnshot from Walmart app</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/04/29/walmart-hidden-clearance-is-a-treasure-hunt/\">report from Click2Houston</a> that spoke to Kendall Motzny, a.k.a. &#34;The Freebie Guy,&#34; Motzny advises shoppers to focus on items on the top shelves, or tucked away on the sides: it&#39;s easiest for workers to miss these tags with price updates. From there, it&#39;s something of a game of chance.</p><p>The clearance aisle had good deals - and ones that were cheaper than the retailer&#39;s website, but I didn&#39;t spot any mismatched labels. Some labels, particularly those on the top shelves, didn&#39;t scan. When they did scan, the app came up with a price and a location in the store.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608af9df34af8d0018599f88?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Walmart hidden clearance\" height=\"1792\" width=\"828\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>After scanning items, the information populated in the app.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Screenshot from Walmart app</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>So I followed the deals on BrickSeek, which led me to the jeans section. The Levi Strauss Signature jeans were priced at $21.94, but when I scanned them, they came up as $15 - not a life-changing steal, but a small victory nonetheless. </p><p>When I moved to candles and homeware, which BrickSeek listed as one of the most heavily discounted sections, I found that many of the deals were very specific: a particular scent of a candle, but not the whole line, or one color of a knife set. </p><p>Shoppers in the Facebook groups say that every trip isn&#39;t always a home run: some go to multiple stores to track down deals they&#39;ve heard about from fellow clearance shoppers. But the community is very collaborative, and the atmosphere in the Facebook groups is both congenial and helpful - shoppers celebrate each other&#39;s finds and share tips of their own to maximize savings.</p><p>&#34;It has been so addicting to get into,&#34;

But none of us could have imagined how tragic the following weeks would be. </p><p>There is not enough room in this column to do justice to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/16/us/mass-shootings-45-one-month/index.html\">45 mass shootings</a> we have experienced in the United States over the past six weeks. This outbreak of violence <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth\">started in Atlanta</a> and the shootings have not abated since then. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting\">Eight people</a>, including four members of the Sikh community, were killed in Indianapolis on April 15. On April 6, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/phillip-adams-kills-5-then-himself-south-carolina-aaf71f2618f139ab3781592634c8e37c\">respected community doctor and his family were killed</a> in South Carolina. On March 26, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/27/boulder-shooting-king-soopers-58-minutes-how-unfolded/\">10 people</a> were murdered while grocery shopping in Boulder, Colorado. The list goes on, and on, and on. </p><p>So far, our lawmakers have provided the usual pablum. The Republicans have, as usual, offered their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepBoebert/status/1374118705701941248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1374118705701941248%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Flauren-boebert-boulder-colorado-mass-shooting_n_6059968bc5b6bd95117fbc0fbc0f\">thoughts and prayers</a>, while offering nothing substantive besides <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/24/democrats-press-national-gun-control-republican-states-expand-firearm-access/6966823002/\">making it easier to obtain a gun.</a> While Democrats from various states have proposed and <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/04/19/colorado-gun-bills-safe-storage-lost-or-stolen-guns-bills-signed-boulder/\">even passed</a> gun control measures in the wake of these shootings, and Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-gun-violence-public-health-epidemic/\">released a list of proposals</a> to help curb the violence, nothing has been done to truly end the epidemic of gun deaths ravaging this country. </p><p>What level of tragedy would finally force this country to make real change?</p><h2><strong>What&#39;s it going to take?</strong></h2><p>Since the first modern mass shooting at Columbine High School, the US has failed to move in a substantial way on gun safety. While there have been <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/14/columbine-high-school-shooting-gun-control/\">red flag laws passed</a> in some (mostly Democratic) states, just as many states have loosened their firearm laws to allow for open and concealed carry. Federal legislation has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/19/18412627/columbine-anniversary-gun-control-mass-shootings\">gone nowhere</a>, and the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/what-supreme-courts-latest-second-amendment-ruling-means-future-cases\">has ruled in the District of Columbia vs. Heller</a> that Americans have a fundamental right to possess firearms. </p><p>We&#39;ve had Newtown, Parkland, and many others - anyone of which should&#39;ve spurred us into action. We have had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/us/ten-years-of-school-shootings-trnd/\">180 shootings in schools alone over the past 10 years</a>, with 356 victims who all had long and happy lives ahead of them. Yet we have done nothing. And there is no reason for hope that the Supreme Court will make our children any safer as it pledges to take on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/politics/supreme-court-second-amendment-case/index.html\">a new Second Amendment case.</a></p><h2><strong>The opportunity of crisis</strong></h2><p>As people across the US have started to get vaccinated against COVID, the veneer of protection against gun deaths is fading and there is no vaccine-like solution on the horizon.</p><p>And much like misinformation that drove up the case and death toll during the pandemic, the increase in mass shootings and corresponding inaction of Congress tie directly back to the rise of the extreme right media on cable and social media.</p><p>Tucker Carlson <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-gun-control-disarm-trump-voters\">claimed that Biden wants to take guns away from law-abiding citizens</a>, which is a claim more at home at a Republican rally than a purported news site. The GOP&#39;s official position is that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/23/politics/background-checks-republican-resistance/index.html\">background checks are outrageous</a> and evil, despite <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/10/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling/\">84% percent of Americans supporting them</a>. There is hardly an issue in 2021 that most Americans agree on, but expanded background checks is one of them. Yet Republicans continue to stand in the way. </p><p>Other countries don&#39;t have the same problem. After a horrific mass shooting in 1996, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/02/20/australia-gun-control-success/\">Australia outlawed assault-style weapons</a>. Despite what Republicans might have you believe, Australia has not turned into a despotic dictatorship over the intervening 25 years. In fact, most every other country on Earth has fewer guns and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/05/743579605/how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries-in-deaths-from-gun-violence\">fewer gun deaths</a> than the United States.</p><h2><strong>Now or never </strong></h2><p>President Joe Biden has juggled a number of crises in his short time in office, but he has not prioritized gun safety. He <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/28/joe-biden-urge-action-gun-bills-address-congress/4865622001/\">urged Congress</a> to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, which like background checks is very <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/07/poll-most-voters-support-assault-weapons-ban-1452586\">popular with voters.</a> Perhaps he can come up with a different, uniquely American solution to this uniquely American problem. </p><p>It is understandable that Joe Biden doesn&#39;t want to lose his frighteningly narrow majorities in Congress, but his party must take action now while they have the opportunity to get it done. The Democrats have the ideas, they have the public&#39;s support, and they have numbers. The only thing, it would seem, that they are missing is the political will to make a change. </p><p>After a full year of one kind of devastating tragedy, we have been faced with a month of another. One that in some ways feels more tangible than a virus. In the 100 days since Biden&#39;s inauguration, he has shown he is up to the task of fighting the invisible killer that has been plaguing America for the past year. Now he must step up and fight the killer that has damaged and taken the lives of thousands of Americans for the past 30.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Some 64% of respondents view the administration as having a positive impact on the global economy. Six in 10 believe the White House&#39;s policies will support global markets.</p><p>Roughly 57% of investors and business owners said the Biden administration has benefitted their personal finances, and 54% of business owners said the policies benefitted their companies.</p><p>In just the first 100 days of his time in office, President Joe Biden has embarked on one of the most ambitious policy strategies in modern history. The president <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-biden-signs-trillion-covid-relief-package-checks-direct-payments-2021-3\">passed a $1.9 trillion stimulus measure</a> - the second-largest in history - on March 11 and has since unveiled <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-takeaways-biden-economic-spending-infrastructure-package-2021-4\">follow-up packages</a> that include roughly $4.1 trillion in additional spending. Economists have largely linked soaring retail sales and stronger economic growth to the stimulus measure.</p><p>To be sure, President Joe Biden&#39;s policies aren&#39;t the only cause for optimism. New COVID-19 cases in the US sit at their lowest seven-day average since October, and state and local governments have been slowly rolling back lockdown measures for weeks. And while the vaccination rate has slowed, it still sits at an average 2.5 million doses per day. At the current rate, the US will reach herd immunity over the next three months, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/\">Bloomberg</a> data.</p><p>In the US specifically, seven in 10 investors expressed hope about the path of the economy. That compares to just 52% three months ago and makes US investors the most positive globally, UBS said.</p><p>The share of US investors growing positive toward stocks rose to 71% from 59%. The shift underscores a broader move toward riskier assets as investors ditch the safe havens they held at the start of the pandemic and position for a swift recovery.</p><p>The responses join other sentiment gauges that have turned stronger in recent months. The University of Michigan&#39;s consumer sentiment index rose to a fresh pandemic-era high in April, according to a Friday <a href=\"http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu\">release</a>. That level is the highest since March 2020. Separately, the Conference Board&#39;s consumer confidence measure rose to its highest level since February 2020 as the healing labor market and latest round of stimulus checks boosted outlooks.</p><p>UBS interviewed 2,850 investors and 1,150 business owners around the world from March 30 to April 18. Responses were sourced from 14 markets including the US, the UK, Mexico, mainland China, Japan, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-boom-stimulus-economic-policy-investor-business-owner-optimism-ubs-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SHWHaziE8Tg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 May 2021 16:09:36 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/608eb62d34af8d001859a770?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4a2b6d49c3e4a02c2a7af39e5595017a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn81@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-21-683_a81d49cb8b628b3d.webp","destWidth":2666,"destHeight":2000,"sourceBytes":162692,"destBytes":162692,"author":"bwinck@businessinsider.com (Ben Winck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/608eb63bf22c6b00185db292?format=jpeg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-26-516_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn44@2020_2/2021/05/03/03-57-23-700_db43c98492c85777.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn84@2020_5/2021/05/03/03-57-25-149_f772057df42a7c35.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn68@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-24-468_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=SHWHaziE8Tg:Nx2K5YzLJMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn55@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-26-240_deeb999bf45b1260.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/SHWHaziE8Tg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn97@2020_4/2021/05/03/03-57-22-722_aa13e5ac0f6cd9a8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620014238428},{"createdTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","updatedTime":"2021-05-03 11:57:18","title":"A pilot and an architect try answering the Google job interview brain teaser","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-boeing-747-brain-teaser-pilot-architect-answer-2020-9","description":"<div style=\"position:relative; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%\">\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/wErUsYK4-jZbcmOYf.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute;\" allow=\"fullscreen\"></iframe>\n</div><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/s?q=tech+companies\">Tech companies</a> like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/s?q=google\">Google </a>and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/s?q=facebook\">Facebook</a> have had a history of asking impossible questions during job interviews. </li>\n<li>We wanted to see how two experts in completely different fields would answer one such question.</li>\n<li>Pilot Anna Battison and architect Samantha Josephat both answered a brain teaser Google used to ask job candidates: How many golf balls fit into a Boeing 747? </li>\n<li>With their different professional backgrounds, the two experts approached the question in very different ways.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider&#39;s homepage for more stories.</a></li>\n</ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Anna Battison:</strong> Well, I hope that&#39;s accurate. I feel like I should maybe ask somebody.</p><p><strong>Samantha Josaphat:</strong> Um, wish me luck. </p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> So, how many golf balls can you fit in a Boeing 747? I... I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> How many tennis balls? Oh, golf...wow. Wow. My first step is to dimension the size of a golf ball, which I actually don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> A golf ball is, I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> I&#39;ve never played golf before.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> If you play tennis, a little bit smaller than a tennis ball. Josaphat: I&#39;m gonna predict that a golf ball is 4 inches by 4 inches in diameter.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> And a headrest is probably, I don&#39;t know. Here&#39;s my head. So let&#39;s say it&#39;s that big and maybe that thick. And now I&#39;m just trying to break down the seat to figure out how many golf balls are in it. So, in this headrest, there are about 15. I&#39;m gonna say that there are three rows of three headrests that can fit in the back portion of it. And then I&#39;m gonna say there&#39;s two rows of three for the bottom part. Then that gives us three, six, nine on the top, six on the bottom. 15 times 15 golf balls in each headrest. There are 15 headrests in the seat. That gives us 225 golf balls per seat.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> I&#39;m now attempting to draw a plane. I&#39;m such an architect. It&#39;s like, I gotta get it right. Oh, gosh! I&#39;m sorry. That looks horrible. Can I just line up my wings?</p><p><strong>Battison: </strong>This is very bad. So, you have the cabin, which is like, X1, X2 is, like, where the passenger goes with all the seats. Those are what the seats are. And then X3, which is, like, the undercarriage, which might be down here, and, you know, just where all the luggage goes.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> When I first think about the plane and plan, what is a variable that I can replicate numerous times? And that&#39;s the seat.</p><p><strong>Battison</strong><em>: </em>In a 747, primarily have two seats here, two seats here, an aisle, an aisle, and three seats in the middle. So that&#39;s seven seats across in each row.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> I will assume a Boeing 747 has about 80 rows.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> So if there are 366 seats, so 366 seats in a Boeing 747, that means that 366 divided by seven would be about 52 rows.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> Now, if I were to say a typical chair for a person is about 18 inches wide and a Boeing 747 has three aisles of seating with potentially four seats in the middle, three seats on either end, how many seats are in just one row?</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I&#39;m gonna add two seats per row because there&#39;s an aisle here where I can add a seat, hypothetically. So if I&#39;m adding two seats per row, that would give me 104 extra seats that I could fit in for that first layer across the bottom. There&#39;s 470 seats on the bottom layer times 225. That gives me 105,750 golf balls.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> So we have, six and four is 10. So we have 10 times 18. That gives us 180 inches. Then we multiply that by 80 rows. That&#39;s 14,400 inches. That&#39;d give me 1,200 feet. So now we would have to incorporate circulation.</p><p><strong> Battison:</strong> Now, you gotta think about, those golf balls are really small. I&#39;ve got so many gaps in between each seat.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> So, if I were to relate circulation to an airplane, that would mean the aisles that go from the front and the back of the plane, the space in between the seats so that everyone can get to their seat comfortably. Battison: I&#39;m gonna seriously ballpark this. So, across, I&#39;ve got seven seats. Let&#39;s say there are seven gaps where 100 golf balls can fit. That&#39;s seven gaps in each row. So seven times 52 rows is 364. So 364 times, let&#39;s say in each gap, 100 golf balls can fit, 36,400.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> And, like, a typical building, in New York City&#39;s Standard of Quality Housing, you need about 30% of circulation in a space. So what&#39;s 30% of 1,200 feet? That&#39;s 360 feet. That&#39;s 360...square feet. I just realized it&#39;s not just feet. 1,200 square feet plus 360 gives us 1,560 square feet. So that includes seats and circulation.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> So, now I&#39;m gonna picture how many layers of seats can I stack on top of each other in that gap in the cabin. I&#39;m gonna say maybe three rows, just &#39;cause the seats are high. So then I&#39;m gonna do that number times three, 317,250 golf balls. That&#39;s how many golf balls I have in three layers of seats. And that comes out as being 353,650.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> Now we have to think about the cockpit, where the pilot is, as well as areas for meal prep and the bathrooms.</p><p><strong>Battison: </strong>X2 is very big, right? It&#39;s, like, 52 rows plus the space on top. So I&#39;m gonna say there&#39;s, you know, gotta be at least 10 that&#39;ll fit in there. Now, maybe that&#39;s a little bit overestimating, but I think I underestimated for the amount of golf balls anyway. So let&#39;s just go with that.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> So, I&#39;m just gonna estimate 40%. &#39;Cause typically in a building, you have to think about, 40% of the space goes to infrastructure, like mechanical systems and plumbing.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> So if there are 353,650 golf balls that fit into the cabin, there would be 10 that fit in there, so that number divided by 10. That&#39;s gonna be 35,365.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> What&#39;s 40% of 1,560 square feet? So now we&#39;ll do 624 plus 1,560, and that&#39;ll get us 2,184. So now we have the floor plan covered. And now we have to think about it in volume.</p><p><strong>Battison</strong><em>: </em>The X3 is what we have left.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> Typical height in an apartment in New York could be around 8 to 10 feet high. And then the height of the carry-on luggage. So we&#39;ll say 11 feet head clearance, and then we&#39;ll add an additional two feet for the material of the plane. And so that&#39;s 13 feet height.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I don&#39;t actually know exactly how big a 747 is, but I would imagine very, very big.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> Now, if we have to consider the space below where the baggage claim is, typically, someone can actually walk in that space to grab luggage.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I would say that it&#39;s roughly the same size as the cabin or maybe even bigger.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> And so I will just double that height and make that 26 feet. Now I will multiply 26 feet by 2,184 square feet.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> The grand total is now 35,365 plus 353,650 plus 353 again, 650, equals 742,665. So that&#39;s our grand total for a 747 that does not actually have the 366 seats.</p><p><strong>Josaphat</strong><em>: </em>So, my last step would be to divide the total cubic feet of the plane by the cubic feet that I&#39;ve figured out for the golf ball.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> But if we have an airliner, we do have those seats that can&#39;t hold the golf balls.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> 56,784 cubic feet divided by 12 cubic feet. That total answer would be 4,732 golf balls<em>. </em></p><p><strong>Battison: </strong>If it has 366 seats, 366 seats times however many golf balls can fit into each seat, we said was 225. So 366 times 225 would give us 82,350.</p><p><strong>Josaphat</strong><em>: </em>That really does not feel real. I&#39;m not comfortable with that answer.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> So I&#39;m going to do this number minus this number to get our grand total for an airline 747. Gives us 660,315 golf balls.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> Oh, I know what the problem is. I did 12 cubic feet, not 12 cubic inches. So there&#39;s actually another step. That would be multiplying by 12. Oh, that&#39;s funny. Which would give me 56,784 golf balls. Final answer.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I have a gut feeling that that&#39;s way too little.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> It may be a little bit low still. I mean, I&#39;m gonna have to trust the math at this point.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I thought I would come out to a number that was maybe a million or so. I think I told you, a headrest is about, like, this big.</p><p><strong>Josaphat:</strong> So if I were to go back, I&#39;d probably tweak the size of the golf ball.</p><p><strong>Battison:</strong> I think far more than 15 golf balls can fit into there. Maybe more along the range of 25 or 30 golf balls. In aviation, they always want you to refer back to, you know, facts. You&#39;re always supposed to follow your checklist in an emergency. You&#39;re supposed to rely on your instruments.</p><p><strong>Josaphat</strong><em>: </em>It did bring back the inner third grade in me, where it&#39;s like, oh, you gotta stay up all night and figure out this math problem. Battison: Do you have an actual answer?</p><p><strong>Alex Appolonia:</strong> Well, not exactly. We found a lot of different answers to this brain teaser.

Yes.

The SEC this week <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/sec-bitcoin-etf-vaneck-june-decision-application-cryptocurrency-listing-cboe-2021-4-1030359563\">delayed rendering a decision</a> on a bitcoin ETF from asset manager VanEck that, if cleared, would be <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-etf-btc-van-eck-cboe-files-for-approval-sec-2021-3-1030141735?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">listed by CBOE Global Markets</a>. The Commission <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2021/34-91695.pdf\">said it was &#34;appropriate&#34;</a> to take more time for consideration. <br><br>The arrival of a bitcoin ETF in 2021 would follow this month&#39;s start of trading in shares of <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/coin-stock\">Coinbase</a>, the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public, as well as expanding acceptance of bitcoin as payment methods by companies including <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tweets-you-can-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">electric vehicle maker Tesla</a>. Meanwhile, investment bank JP Morgan is preparing to introduce its first <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/jpmorgan-bitcoin-fund-wealthy-clients-access-summer-actively-managed-crypto-2021-4-1030346164\">bitcoin fund for wealthy clients.</a></p><p>These and other bitcoin developments may signal the increased likelihood that a bitcoin ETF will gain approval, but the SEC <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-etf-crypto-commissioner-sec-refusal-has-created-a-challenge-2021-3-1030224597\">has rejected other attempts</a>.</p><p>Institutions &#34;are getting in from hedge funds on Wall Street to PayPal, to Venmo, to Visa. So [the SEC] can&#39;t really ignore this because the market is deciding that they want to be involved,&#34; Ian Balina, founder and CEO of Token Metrics, a data-driven cryptocurrency investment research platform, told Insider. </p><p>Here are three hurdles and tailwinds that experts say stand in front of the first US bitcoin ETF:</p><p><strong>1) Bitcoin volatility</strong></p><p>The world&#39;s most widely traded digital asset is well-known for its wild price swings, with gains or losses of 10% during a session not uncommon.</p><p>&#34;The SEC has a difficult job balancing the clearly overwhelming desire for the market to have access to BTC via an ETF versus the inherent volatility that the asset class has at this stage in its life cycle,&#34; George McDonaugh, co-founder of digital asset investment firm KR1, told Insider.  &#34;Volatility would be one of the major considerations. Bitcoin is very scarce and comparatively still a very young asset class. The volatility should dampen over time but that might be long after the market loses patience waiting for [a bitcoin ETF].&#34;</p><p>Price volatility has declined in recent weeks and such moves make <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-outlook-volatility-attractive-institutions-supports-price-target-jpmorgan-2021-4-1030270274?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">bitcoin more appealing to institutions, according to JPMorgan</a>. </p><p>Liquidity in the bitcoin market had also been a factor under consideration by the SEC. <br><br>&#34;I think it&#39;s less of a concern now [than] in the early days … and a lot of that is tied to institutional players coming into and creating depth and breadth in the market,&#34; Matteo Dante Perruccio, president international of Wave Financial, a US-regulated digital asset manager, told Insider. &#34;If it&#39;s 90% retail investors in an asset and you open it up to a bigger universe of retail investors, I think that&#39;s a really hard decision to make as a regulator. But it helps you have substantive institutional investors trading and involved in investing in it.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/binance-ceo-interview-profile-how-he-built-largest-crypto-exchange-2021-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao breaks down how he built the world&#39;s largest crypto exchange in 180 days - and shares why he&#39;s keeping most of his assets in Bitcoin and Binance Coin</a></em></p><p><strong>2) Market maturity</strong> <br><br>&#34;It&#39;s fair to say if you look at the denials for the last several ETFs, you can see that there was concern among several of the commissioners that the bitcoin market was not sufficiently regulated and, in their view, was susceptible to manipulation,&#34; and &#34;when I say that I mean that manipulation would show up in prices,&#34; Amy Doberman, a partner in the securities department at law firm WilmerHale, told Insider. <br><br>&#34;I think what you&#39;re going to see with the pending requests for approval is an argument that the market is far more developed than it was four or five years ago and that there&#39;s a lot more price discovery available than there was even just a few years ago so that there will be the ability to reference actual trades and sufficient information to develop accurate prices,&#34; said Doberman.</p><p><strong>3) What&#39;s on the SEC&#39;s plate </strong></p><p>The US lags behind other countries in approving bitcoin ETFs, with <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/canada-approves-first-bitcoin-etf-btc-hopes-sec-us-cryptocurrency-2021-2-1030078644\">Canada this year approving</a> the first publicly traded bitcoin ETF in North America, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, as well as ethereum ETFs. Brazilian regulators have reportedly <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazilian-stock-exchange-approves-two-new-crypto-etfs-in-latin-america\">approved two bitcoin ETFs</a>. </p><p>&#34;People underestimate the Canadian approval,&#34; said Wave Financial&#39;s Perruccio, characterizing as &#34;close cousins&#34; the SEC&#39;s relationship with the Canadian securities regulator. &#34;The regulators have got to be talking a lot and ... you always feel more comfortable in company when you are making these bold decisions,&#34; and Canada&#39;s regulator is considered as well-respected, he said. For a US bitcoin ETF, &#34;I feel like it&#39;s inevitable. It&#39;s no longer &#39;if&#39; but &#39;when&#39; and I think the question of when is probably in 2021. That&#39;s my prediction,&#34; said Perruccio.</p><p>While bitcoin ETF applications pile up, the SEC and its new chairman Gary Gensler have a range of other issues they are working on. Gensler, who was confirmed as chairman earlier this month, is seen by some bitcoin ETF proponents as a cryptocurrency advocate stemming in part from his teachings at MIT on the subject.</p><p>Gensler &#34;will have to decide what he wants to prioritize,&#34; said Doberman. He&#39;s &#34;obviously very knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies and hopefully will bring an additional level of sophistication and appreciation for the currency to the table,&#34; she said.</p><p>During his confirmation hearing, Gensler said the SEC under his watch would review issues surrounding <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sec-nominee-gensler-gamestop-reddit-payment-order-flow-robinhood-trading-2021-3-1030142124\">protection and fairness for retail investors</a> in the backdrop of &#34;gamification&#34; on trading apps and platforms. </p><p>The agency is reportedly considering stricter rules to rein in <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sec-spac-growth-projections-ipo-regulation-crackdown-rein-blank-check-2021-4-1030359061\">projections made by special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs,</a> and reportedly has opened a preliminary investigation into leveraged trades at the Archegos Capital Management <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/sec-opens-investigation-into-archegos-trades-that-sparked-rout?sref=GUP2BhaG\">hedge fund that collapsed in March</a>.</p><p>While he&#39;s well-versed in the subject of cryptocurrencies, Gensler, who served as a chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under the Obama administration, will not just wave through bitcoin ETFs applications without scrutiny, said Noah Hamman, CEO of AdvisorShares, a firm that offers actively managed exchange-traded funds through its AdvisorShares Trust.</p><p>Gensler will be in the role &#34;of looking at the rules and regs and deciding if either, one, something fits or two, do the rules and regs need to be modified to allow it to fit because it makes sense and it&#39;s the right thing to do,&#34; said Hamman. AdvisorShares does not have a bitcoin ETF filing with the SEC.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

abuse.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/podcast/29609/the-myths-and-realities-of-the-chinese-digital-currency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Trend Lines podcast this week</a>, WPR&#39;s Elliot Waldman discussed the implications of China&#39;s new digital currency with <a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/people/yaya-j-fanusie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yaya Fanusie</a>, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.</p><p><strong>WPR: By now, most everyone is familiar with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized. And of course, digital payments have become pretty much ubiquitous. But I think it&#39;s fair to say that the concept of a central bank digital currency has yet to seep into the mainstream. So could you first enlighten us about how China&#39;s new digital currency works - what it is and what it&#39;s not?</strong></p><p><strong>Yaya Fanusie:</strong> As you said, people are used to Bitcoin and people know a lot about digital payments, because we all pay for things digitally. But a central bank digital currency is something a little bit different. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that no one controls; it&#39;s independent of any government and anyone can participate.</p><p>Digital payments, as we know them, basically involve private banking infrastructure where private banks have central bank money, and then they allow you to transact, but it&#39;s really their infrastructure that you&#39;re participating with. So, you have a relationship with that private bank. You don&#39;t really have a relationship with the central bank.</p><p>But now, with the advancement of technology, governments see Bitcoin and are expressing interest in it, because Bitcoin solves some interesting problems around how to move value digitally. Central bankers also see that private companies are really involved in people&#39;s commerce and everyday transactions.</p><p>This is especially the case in China, which has wanted to figure out a way to have a digital currency that was run by the central bank. So, not like Bitcoin, which is independent and decentralized.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-digital-payments-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beijing was concerned about the digital payment space</a>, which you may know is very big in China. The central bank has felt that private digital payment companies are way too powerful. So years ago, they started to think about how they could create infrastructure where the money is actually digital, but it is run by the central bank. Now, what does that look like? We don&#39;t know the details.</p><p>In fact, the central bank has been pretty clear that a lot of this is still being worked out. But what we do know the general framework: The People&#39;s Bank of China is going to create the digital currency, and then it&#39;s going to distribute it to banks and to private companies. Those banks and companies will basically have wallets, they&#39;ll have software, and people will transact with the digital currency through those wallets.</p><p>But the big difference is that unlike regular digital payments, the thing that they&#39;re transacting with is going to be the central bank money itself, digitally. Not just the applications that they were transacting with through the private companies.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608f35a4f22c6b00185db2e6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages 1293705147\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Signage for the central bank-backed digital yuan, or E-CNY, at a coffee shop in Beijing, December 29, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">VCG/VCG via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>WPR: How far along is China&#39;s digital Yuan relative to similar initiatives in other countries? Because this isn&#39;t something that China is alone in working on, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Fanusie:</strong> Lots of governments are actually looking at <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/the-rise-of-central-bank-digital-currencies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exploring and researching the idea of a central bank digital currency</a>. They&#39;re looking at the pros and the cons, but China is probably the foremost of big economies in terms of actually developing something. They started researching back in 2014, and then roughly a year or so ago, they actually got to the point of doing trials.</p><p>What they&#39;ve done over the past few months is they&#39;ve distributed this digital currency via a lottery system to certain citizens in certain cities. And they&#39;ve given them the equivalent of, let&#39;s say, 31 US dollars in the digital yuan, or digital renminbi. They have actually just done these trials - I think it&#39;s maybe half a dozen or more cities that are participating - and I think <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">millions of dollars worth of this currency has transacted</a> over the past few months.</p><p>They&#39;ve also taken certain municipal government workers and they&#39;ve allowed them to get some of their salaries paid in this digital currency.</p><p>So, I&#39;d say it&#39;s relatively far along, but the key milestone that China is looking at is the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing next February. The government is saying that they would like to roll out more of this digital currency by then. Not that it will be out universal, but that&#39;s certainly a milestone that they&#39;re looking towards.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607d4f8544f45400192075d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Digital yuan red envelope\" height=\"2453\" width=\"3680\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A consumer uses a digital yuan red envelope in a mobile phone to buy goods at a digital yuan cashier&#39;s desk.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>WPR: I believe I&#39;ve read some testimonials of people who have been selected for this lottery, and they&#39;ve said that the currency is pretty easy to use and that they like the utility of it so far.</strong></p><p><strong>Fanusie:</strong> Yeah, I think so. And that&#39;s probably because it&#39;s not that different than mobile payments that they&#39;re already using, since most people in China are not using cash that much. They&#39;re already using digital payments, so it&#39;s possible that for them, it doesn&#39;t make that much of a difference. But for the central bank, it makes a big difference.</p><p>You may wonder, if it&#39;s not so different for the consumer, why would the central bank want to do this? Well, the reason is that it&#39;s really about data, and there are a couple of ways to look at this. One is maybe a very positive way, and one is a little bit more cynical.</p><p>When you have a central bank digital currency, if you&#39;re a central bank, what this means is that if you create the currency, as people transact, you can actually observe the data. You can have insight as to when people are spending and what&#39;s happening. How much is this currency circulating? What happens when you implement a certain monetary policy? How does that change consumer spending?</p><p>The data is available, because people are using the currency that is connected to your infrastructure. In today&#39;s digital payments, that access doesn&#39;t exist. Let&#39;s take an example from the US, with Square or Venmo. All of those transactions are happening, but the government here in the US doesn&#39;t have access to that data immediately. There&#39;s a multilayered process where companies would report back to the government.</p><p>But in China, the digital currency is going to allow for a lot more collection of data, which goes with the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s desire to have a more data-driven economy, to collect more data and to use it for monetary policy, but to also to use it for analysis and even surveillance.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5db65a11dee019097f2516b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: People walk past the China Bank headquarters building in central Beijing October 15, 2008.

What kind of new data do you think Beijing would be able to collect with this digital currency?</strong></p><p><strong>Fanusie:</strong> Some of it is new data, but probably most of it is not necessarily new. It is the efficiency of collecting the data. What is different is that we&#39;re talking either real time or near-real time observance of people&#39;s spending. In the current system, obviously the Chinese government is strong, and it can go to companies - and it does - and say, &#34;Hey, show us the transactions of person X, or company X, and hand over this information to us.&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s how the government gets its access to financial data now. But what would be different is that the government wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to go to all these different banks and all these different companies to compel them to hand over the information. The payment instrument that people would be using would be within their data house, in a sense.</p><p>The Chinese government is now saying that it&#39;s going to anonymize this data, which I wouldn&#39;t take at face value. But even so, the big plus for them is going to be that they&#39;ll be able to see all of these transactions happening, even individual wallets. Whoever is using this, their activity will be seen in at least real time, or maybe relative real time. This is access that doesn&#39;t exist anywhere.</p><p>As much as people think about big brother, and they think that they&#39;re always being watched by their government, it&#39;s honestly just not possible technologically for governments to track everyone&#39;s digital payments in real time. because the infrastructure is set up in such a bifurcated way. So this is a huge barrier breaker in terms of collecting financial transaction data.</p><p>One thing I should probably also mention is that what this also does is it gives the Chinese government more levers to pull. If the government has access to this digital currency and it&#39;s held with the central bank, you&#39;d be transacting with it, but it&#39;s really a central bank instrument that you&#39;re holding and that you&#39;re transacting in.</p><p>If you think a few steps in advance, I think what this means logically is that it would be easier for the central bank to turn off access to that. Right now either the government has to go to companies and say, &#34;Block off this person, close their account.&#34;</p><p>But I think the way this is going to work is that they&#39;ll have centralized access. They&#39;ll be able to say, &#34;All these digital Yuan, let&#39;s make them inactive.&#34; Or, &#34;Let&#39;s stop transactions from being able to go into these particular wallets,&#34; or &#34;these particular digital bank nodes are going to be null and void.&#34;</p><p>Logically, I think that&#39;s what this infrastructure is going to lend itself to. It then gives the government maybe more power to influence citizens, to take punitive measures and to even look at party members and see exactly how they&#39;re spending. There are lots of implications for domestic control that this technology lends itself to.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/512fee39eab8ead276000023?format=jpeg\" alt=\"China Renminbi\" height=\"2654\" width=\"3894\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://pictures.reuters.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult_VPage&#38;VBID=2C04WNV8GNTAG&#38;SMLS=1&#38;RW=1291&#38;RH=809#/SearchResult_VPage&#38;VBID=2C04WNV8GNTAG&#38;SMLS=1&#38;RW=1291&#38;RH=809&#38;PN=2\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>WPR: It wasn&#39;t long ago that digital payments and digital currencies were being viewed as maybe one of the best tools to fight corruption in the world, given that with each payment, there was a digital footprint that could be traced. But I don&#39;t remember anyone at the time saying, hold on a second, let&#39;s take a step back and imagine what might happen if one centralized authority is able to collect and monitor all of this data at the same time around people&#39;s payments.</strong></p><p><strong>Fanusie:</strong> It&#39;s funny, because that sentiment has actually been growing in private circles, especially in the tech community, because of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. These decentralized cryptocurrencies are usually public, and all of the transactions can be read and accessed on a public online ledger.</p><p>So even though it&#39;s pseudo-anonymous, people can look at a Bitcoin wallet or a Bitcoin address and they can see all the transactions. There&#39;s really no barrier, they just don&#39;t necessarily know who is making the transactions.</p><p>For a while, a lot of people have been concerned that if you attach identities to the Bitcoin blockchain, then that could really ruin privacy. Because if you know my address, now you can look and you can see how much I&#39;m spending. You could see how much is in my account. So, there&#39;s actually been a push for privacy within the cryptocurrency community.</p><p>What&#39;s interesting is that now that central banks are thinking of a digital currency, even though it&#39;s not going to be public, there is maybe even more of a concern about privacy. If a central bank has a digital currency and all these transactions are on a record, then that central bank could track and maybe see your transactions forever, depending on how you&#39;re going to design this and what privacy safeguards you put in place.</p><p>There are all these concerns that the government could have access to someone&#39;s past, present and future transactions, depending on how they design privacy in a central bank digital currency. So, this issue is not going away.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Although it is wheeled, it has a tank turret and functions as a light tank, conducting close combat, counterattacks, and direct-fire infantry support.</p><p>Armed with a 105 mm rifled gun and weighing just 26 tons, the Type 16 can operate safely on Japan&#39;s entire road network and be carried in Air Self Defense Force aircraft.</p><h2>A new southern threat</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608a0fe535c46f0018c0b28a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Japan Self-Defense Force Type 16 Maneuver Combat Vehicle\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Type 16 during a live-fire exercise in Japan, May 23, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/POOL/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Adopting lighter tanks may seem counterintuitive, but it actually fits perfectly within the force the JSDF is building - one capable of dealing with the new threat posed to Japan&#39;s southwest by China.</p><p>&#34;As we got farther from the Cold War and different threats arose, Japan started to shift overall defense thinking about where the real threat is emanating from,&#34; said Jeffrey Hornung, an expert on Japanese security and foreign policies at the RAND Corporation.</p><p>&#34;It starts to crystallize, really in the last decade, decade and a half, [to] where it&#39;s the China threat,&#34; Hornung told Insider.</p><p>That threat is primarily <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2574.html\" target=\"_top\">in the air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-coast-guard-ships-worrying-japan-scrambling-to-keep-up-2021-2\" target=\"_top\">at sea</a>, and centers on the Senkaku Islands, which Japan administers but China claims, calling them the Diaoyu Islands.</p><p>Japanese leaders believe that since China is not trying to export global revolution like the Soviet Union and is focused on just the Senkakus, a large-scale ground invasion of its home islands is unlikely.</p><p>&#34;They don&#39;t anticipate China doing any sort of amphibious invasion of Japanese territory, and so in that environment they don&#39;t see a need for the heavy artillery and tanks.&#34; Hornung said.</p><p>&#34;Instead, they see that you have all these islands in the southwest island chain that if the GSDF are going to be involved in, they have to rapidly get there, and they have to have the capability to fight in that environment,&#34; Hornung added.</p><h2>A need for rapid deployment</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608a0d694fac4f0018de865f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages 2447119\" height=\"1337\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Japanese troops exit an armored vehicle during an exercise, August 30, 2003.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Koichi Kamoshida/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Tanks would still be essential if China were to attack Japan&#39;s larger offshore islands, where thousands of people live.

The majority of its soldiers and hardware would also likely need to be deployed by ship, especially if they are headed to Japan&#39;s outer islands.</p><p>The only vessels capable of such tasks that Japan&#39;s Maritime Self-Defense Force has are its three Ōsumi-class tank landing ships.
