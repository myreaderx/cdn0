Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article, about the best William Castle horror movies, is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>William Castle</strong> is one of cinema&#8217;s greatest showmen. He got his start working for Columbia Pictures in the 1940s, in large part thanks to his ability to promote the hell out of anything. In the early part of his career, Castle worked as a dialogue director before getting the opportunity to make his own films, starting with a couple of documentary shorts before his feature debut with the adventure-comedy <em>The Chance of a Lifetime</em>. Castle would continue to direct low-budget studio fare for the next few years with the occasional odd job here and there &#8212; he was an associate producer on <em>The Lady from Shanghai</em> &#8212; before deciding he wanted more.</p>\n<p>Castle left the studio life to make it on his own as an independent filmmaker. It was during this period that Castle established himself and earned a reputation for his use of gimmicks. Going to see a William Castle picture was about more than watching a movie; it was about the experience. Castle made the audience active participants, meaning no two shows were likely to be the same. At least that&#8217;s what Castle would like you to believe.</p>\n<p>For some, Castle is simply remembered as a schlock director who relied on parlor tricks and cheap exploits to make a quick buck. But there&#8217;s no disputing his long-lasting impact, and a case could be made that he is one of the most important and influential director-producers cinema has ever seen. John Waters credits Castle for being the director that made him want to direct. Robert Zemeckis has called him a personal favorite and co-founded Dark Castle Entertainment with the sole purpose of remaking Castle&#8217;s work &#8212; doing so twice with <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/house-on-haunted-hill-trick-rr-treat-bluray-review-scream-factory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>House on Haunted Hill</em></a> and <em>Thirteen Ghosts</em>. Joe Dante has long been an admirer, and in 1993 he paid homage with his B-movie love letter <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/matinee-joe-dantes-atomic-hustle-25-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Matinee</em></a>.</p>\n<p>FSR&#8217;s resident Boo Crew (<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacob Trussell</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a>, and myself) understands the importance of Castle, and this Halloween season we pay our respects to the B-movie legend by ranking his ten best films as director. Be warned, though: this is a frighteningly scary list, and those with a fear of spine-tingling horror are advised to proceed with extreme caution. Towards the end of this list, we will offer a &#8220;fright break,&#8221; and those who are too scared to continue may exit via the &#8220;Coward&#8217;s Corner.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">10. The Old Dark House (1963)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358532 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Old-Dark-House-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Old Dark House\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Old-Dark-House-1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Old-Dark-House-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Old-Dark-House-1-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Old-Dark-House-1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>J. B. Priestley’s <em>The Old Dark House</em> was <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-old-dark-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first adapted by James Whale in 1932</a>. The original works as an effective chiller and tongue-in-cheek comedy that parodies stories about haunted houses and things that go bump in the night. Castle was no stranger to splashing his scare fare with humor, which made him the perfect director to reimagine the story in 1963.</p>\n<p>Or was he? Critical hindsight hasn’t exactly been kind to Castle’s effort, with many comparing it unfavorably to its predecessor. While this version does lack the original’s spooky atmosphere, it more than makes up for it with plenty of laughs and an abundance of endearing charms. Castle wasn’t out to recreate what came before, and that’s a good thing. Because, in the end, film fans got two very entertaining movies that boast their own unique flavors. (Kieran Fisher)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">9. Macabre (1958)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358533 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Macabre.jpg\" alt=\"Macabre\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Macabre.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Macabre-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Macabre-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Macabre-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Macabre</em> isn&#8217;t the best William Castle film &#8212; obviously, hence its ninth-place ranking &#8212; but a case could be made that it is his most important. This dark thriller about the daughter of a doctor being kidnapped and buried alive marked the first time Castle used his signature gimmicks. Theater attendees were given a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy upon entrance, just in case they died during the show. The shtick proved to be a success, making <em>Macabre</em> a box office hit and opening the door for future stunts to follow.</p>\n<p>As for the film, it gets a little slow in the middle but is bookended by opening and closing scenes that are more than worth the price of submission. Thirty seconds in and a child&#8217;s coffin has been stolen? Hard to get grimmer than that. (Chris Coffel)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">8. I Saw What You Did (1965)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358534 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/I-Saw-What-You-Did.jpg\" alt=\"I Saw What You Did\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/I-Saw-What-You-Did.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/I-Saw-What-You-Did-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/I-Saw-What-You-Did-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/I-Saw-What-You-Did-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>In 1965, Castle worked with Joan Crawford for the second and final time with <em>I Saw What You Did</em>. Teens Libby and Kit are bored one evening and entertain themselves by making relatively innocent prank phone calls to random numbers. Every time someone answers, they repeat, &#8220;I saw what you did, and I know who you are.&#8221; Unfortunately, one of their random dials ends up calling a man (John Ireland) who just murdered his wife. Determined not to get caught, the man attempts to track the girls down to keep his secret safe.</p>\n<p><em>I</em><em> Saw What You Did</em> is a more straightforward thriller than one may expect from Castle, playing like a low-budget Hitchcock &#8212; a humorous turn of events since it was Castle&#8217;s films that inspired Hitchcock to direct <em>Psycho</em>. A gimmick involving seatbelts for audience members who may be &#8220;scared out of their seats&#8221; was referenced in early trailers for the film but eventually scrapped.

Shanks (1974)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358543 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shanks.jpg\" alt=\"Shanks\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shanks.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shanks-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shanks-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shanks-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat surprising that one of Castle&#8217;s most disturbing films is also among his least seen. That said, it&#8217;s easy to understand why audiences didn&#8217;t (and don&#8217;t) take to this grim slice of madness as easily as they do movies about haunted houses and more traditionally portrayed psychopaths.</p>\n<p><em>Shanks</em> follows a deaf puppeteer named Malcolm (played by Marcel Marceau, a world-renowned mime who doesn&#8217;t speak as Malcolm but does talk in another role) whose abuse at the hands of family and strangers alike coincides with his growing ability to &#8220;reanimate&#8221; the dead like string-less marionette puppets. The bodies pile up, he animates more and more of them back to life, and it all erupts in a debacle of violence when a motorcycle gang crashes Malcolm&#8217;s party &#8212; which he was enjoying with a teenage admirer.</p>\n<p>Weird how Castle didn&#8217;t employ some of his usual good time marketing shenanigans with this one&#8230; (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">6. Let&#8217;s Kill Uncle (1966)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358544 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lets-Kill-Uncle.jpg\" alt=\"Let's Kill Uncle\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lets-Kill-Uncle.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lets-Kill-Uncle-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lets-Kill-Uncle-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lets-Kill-Uncle-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>An irredeemably bratty, combat-obsessed orphan named Barnaby inherits a fortune after the death of his father (a silent cameo by Castle). Until he reaches the right age to collect, Barnaby is sent to live on a remote island with his uncle Kevin, a former British intelligence commander who has literally written a book about how good he is at killing people.</p>\n<p>While, yes, we’d all like to push the impossibly annoying orphan off a cliff, in theory, Uncle Kevin’s motives are less petty, and therefore, more serious. He wants that estate, baby. And the only thing standing between him and all that money is this very frustrating child. A failed first attempt at murder cascades into a back-and-forth of assassination attempts between a military veteran and a child.</p>\n<p><em>Let’s Kill Uncle</em> is somewhat dated and paced like molasses, but it’s still glowing with that characteristically hokey charm of a William Castle picture. Even though it&#8217;s definitely a ridiculous attempt at “family horror,” you can’t deny that camp factor.

Our lives may no longer be scheduled around small screen programming, but that doesn’t mean we should forget the necessary sanctuary of Saturday ‘toons. In this entry, we champion the restorative might of the frenemy dynamic at the heart of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.</em></p> \n<hr /> \n<p>I love you. Those three words were an impossible combination for me as a child. Mom and Dad were free with them. They never let a day escape without letting me know. I am loved.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, for most of my childhood and early adulthood, I only gave lip service to “I love you” and often put a button of “too” on it. To be preemptive with such words was emotionally foolish. They’re a risk to utter; the thought of rejection forever clouding the possibility of acceptance. Best to keep quiet.</p> \n<p>I wish I grew up with <strong><em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</em></strong> on television. If I had, maybe I would have been more open with love and to love. Maybe fear would not have driven me away from certain friendships and partnerships. The Netflix series offers tools to chip the doubt away from your heart. It’s a guiding light for the romantically curious and excited. Don’t wall yourself away. Stand tall and present the you that you are and not the you that you struggle to imagine.</p> \n<p>Developed under cartoonist and producer <strong>Noelle Stevenson&nbsp;</strong>in 2016, <em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power </em>immediately removes itself from comparisons to the original ’80s cartoon spinoff. He-Man, where are you? Nowhere. <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/masters-of-the-universe-netflix-kevin-smith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go enjoy your own reboot, Adam</a>.</p> \n<p>Stevenson’s <em>She-Ra</em> is fronted predominantly with a female cast of characters and purposefully diversified. The series refuses to present any single shade, whether in reference to skin color, sexuality, point of view, or emotional stability. There are good folks, and there are bad folks, but more often than not, the good fall into bad ways of thinking, and the bad fall into good ways of thinking.</p> \n<p>Nowhere is this better personified than in the relationship between Adora and Catra. These orphans were raised from birth to sever the Horde as soldiers, but when Adora stumbles upon the enchanted Sword of Protection that transforms her into the mythical Princess of Power, her eyes are opened to the evil she’s endorsed. Hordak and his Horde mean to make slaves of Etheria’s population.</p> \n<p>The rebellion is justified. Adora turns traitor, but Catra can’t join her. The soldier can’t shake her upbringing.</p> \n<p>Adora’s action obliterates their friendship and sours Catra’s soul. Unable to perceive Adora’s decision, Catra allows the confusion to harden her personality. Anger and frustration become her deciding motivator.</p> \n<p>Thirty years earlier, a pilot episode decided the boundaries of characters. In the ’80s, Catra would remain imprisoned to her rage and Adora to her courageous reversal. Autobots vs. Decepticons. G.I. Joe vs. Cobra. Blue lasers vs. red lasers.</p> \n<p>Stevenson permits the characters of <em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</em>&nbsp;to fluctuate. Over five seasons, a myriad of questions burns within Adora and Catra. Are they on the right track? Can they go back to the way it was before? The perceived answers seem impossible and act as stumbling blocks for resolution.</p> \n<p>As the fifth season reached its climax, the chance of a free Etheria seemed unlikely. Cosmic and dimensional shenanigans required Adora to shatter the Sword of Protection as it was a key to a kill-crazy superweapon. Without access to her She-Ra self, Adora fought alongside the resistance as any other would: on a hope and a prayer.</p> \n<p>Revelations regarding Hordak’s genetics originating from Horde Prime (the <em>She-Ra</em> answer to The Emperor) place Catra under his care and claw. She should be relishing his capture of Glimmer, the newly appointed Queen of Bright Moon, but she finds herself swayed by conversations with the prisoner. Their chatter sparks blissful memories of Catra and Adora as soldiers of the Horde.</p> \n<p>Once upon a time, Adora proclaimed her friendship with Catra to be eternal. The thought finally sends a shiver through Catra’s system. She’s on the wrong side. There’s no time like now to change your path.</p> \n<p>Catra takes up arms against her masters and frees Glimmer from her shackles. <em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</em> concludes its epic run with Adora and Catra united against Horde Prime. Catra professes her love for Adora, and she is accepted. The two embrace, kiss, and inject their championing spirits against the villain.</p> \n<p>Watching Catra internally debate her actions for five seasons was exhilarating. The frenemy relationship is an intoxicating and delectably soapy dynamic. Will they? Won’t they? The viewer craves affirmation as well, but television can be a cruel game of denial.</p> \n<p>Too many shows take pleasure in guiding their audiences right up to the edge of their desire before coldly denying them. It’s why shipping is the great fanfic past-time. If you don’t give us what we want, then we’ll go out and do it ourselves.</p> \n<p>Catra and Adora was not an obvious outcome, or at least, not for this boy who grew up on two-dimensional representations of cartoon romance. It’s sorta painful, but also thrilling, to imagine the teenager and young adult I would have become if I had these two for a beacon of intimacy. Watching Adora fight for Catra, and Catra fight for herself and against herself must be revelatory for a developing person.</p> \n<p>These are the heroes we should make our instructors. You’re not born bad. You’re not born good. Every day is a fight to mold your identity. The you that you are today is not the you that you were or the you that you will be.</p> \n<p>You take time. Every day is a chance to course-correct.</p> \n<p><em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power </em>is an epic saga of love: romantic, platonic, familial. The Horde, swords, and unicorns are the dressing to gain your interest, but after an episode or two, or at the most, a single season, the viewer returns for Adora and Catra. What a blessing that Stevenson and Netflix had the audacity to deliver when such a possibility is frequently reserved for the realms of fandom’s fantasy.</p> \n<p>Say, “I love you.” Be Catra. Take a risk. The agony lies in the waiting.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/aWPXJwd-Tho\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 11:16:15 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0b8e78eae52a81fb103e4bea8fee2c7f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/aWPXJwd-Tho":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-14-092_e054c435cd6214ea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040515177},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","title":"The Ending of ‘The Matrix’ Explained","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358397","description":"<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/ending-explained\"><em><strong>Ending Explained</strong></em></a><i> is a recurring series in which we explore the finales, secrets, and themes of interesting movies and shows, both new and old.

It questions our reality and if there is such a thing as free will, a horrifying realization that questions our very existence. Full of phenomenally choreographed fight sequences and fascinatingly complex lore, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matrix</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at first seems like a surprisingly positive film about saving humanity from the shackles of the system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The film</a>’s hero is Thomas Anderson (<strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>), later known as Neo. He leads two lives: one as a talented computer programming and the other as a hacker for hire. However, he discovers that he is the One, the person destined to save humanity from the program known as the Matrix. It is foretold in a prophecy told by the Oracle (<strong>Gloria Foster</strong>), an all-seeing entity aware of her place in the system. The world that he perceives as real is actually a computer simulation created by autonomous machines that use humans as biologically batteries. The actual real world is a barren wasteland full of fields of humans waiting to be harvested. Neo learns of the prophecy that he will liberate humanity from the machines. But first, he must recognize his potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neo fulfills his destiny at the film’s end as he is able to fight the evil Agents, three suit-wearing &#8220;men&#8221; (Hugo Weaving, Paul Goddard, and Robert Taylor) that are actually sentient computer programs trying to protect the Matrix. Neo is able to match their superhuman strength and speed, throwing ridiculously fast punches, stopping the trajectory of bullets, and even punching through an Agent’s entire body.

Neo fulfills his destiny and is able to do what no one else could. He is a beacon of hope and he has finally realized that. Humanity may have a chance of survival. However, despite the embracing of his identity, Neo never had any autonomy or his transformation into the One. While much of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matrix</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is about revolution and freedom, Neo is in fact stuck in a cycle of control which continues through the following two films.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neo is offered choices all throughout the film. Will he follow the instructions of the resistance leader Morpheus (<strong>Lawrence Fishburne</strong>) to escape the Agents? Will he take the blue or red pill? Will he participate in training and prove what all expect: perfection? These choices give an illusion of control, but really he is being groomed to fit into the mold Morpheus has made for him. Neo is constantly told from the beginning that he is the One, as Morpheus throws his entire life behind Neo’s fate. With that pressure of potentially being a Chosen One, Neo is placed in a position to not only make a choice for himself, but for the fate of the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there is the prophecy and the mind games of the Oracle, who proves that the future is predetermined and that despite the desire for choice, it is nonexistent. Her series of prophecies lead not only Neo down a predetermined path; Morpheus and Trinity (<strong>Carrie-Anne Moss</strong>), Neo’s eventual love interest, also become entwined in the prophecy. She is why Morpheus dedicates his entire life to finding Neo. Trinity bases her relationships on the Oracle’s words, as Trinity’s told she will fall in love with the One. Not only is Neo’s role as savior predicted, but his interpersonal and romantic relationships are, as well. These three characters become inextricably linked by a single belief: Neo will save them all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best example of the Oracle’s manipulation is when Neo visits her home. She presents herself as a kind old lady who is baking cookies and casually predicting the future. As they talk in her kitchen, the Oracle reveals that Neo is not the One and that he should free himself from those expectations. Yet, she later reveals that she just told Neo what he needed to hear. She alludes to his looming death and resurrection, saying that he’ll perhaps be the One in another life. Neo is shot, killed, and then his consciousness rejects that death. So, he has been born into another life where he can embrace who he is. While she seems to brush off Neo’s destiny, she knows exactly what will happen. He needs to truly believe in himself rather than merely being handed answers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Neo does finally accept his fate as the One and seems to relish being the savior of humanity, his place in humanity’s narrative is further revealed in the next two films of the trilogy, </span><strong><i>The Matrix Reloaded </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><strong><i>The Matrix Revolutions</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He must accept what rests on his shoulders and his inevitable demise. Even in his eventual sacrifice, the cycle of humanity continues, as not all humans are set free. The Matrix still exists as a series of programs that let people live oblivious lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of freeing himself, Neo has merely entered another cycle of control in disguise. Yes, he is aware of his subject position within the Matrix and knows the truth about humanity. But it was already predicted. Despite being offered a series of choices, the prophecy foretells who he is and he will inevitably fall into his role. While the end of this first film seems to speak to the power of discovering your true self, it really speaks to the struggle with fate and the weight of existing in a world where everything is predetermined. </span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/OB-OGFAzpGU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 20:16:10 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2823307ebc1bde94a8498d47cccfab3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/OB-OGFAzpGU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn56@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-18-569_d3942271fa76a049.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040515176},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","title":"Jack Lord Has a Devil of a Time in ‘The Name of the Game Is Kill’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358569","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-prime-sublime/\"><strong>The Prime Sublime</strong></a>, a weekly column dedicated to the underseen and underloved films buried beneath page after page of far more popular fare on Amazon’s Prime Video collection. We’re not just cherry-picking obscure titles, though, as these are movies that we find beautiful in their own, often unique ways. You might even say we think they’re sublime… and this week we&#8217;re rewinding to the late 60s for a cautionary tale about bad Samaritans called The Name of the Game Is Kill!</em></p>\n<p><em>“Sublime /səˈblīm/: of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe”</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The moral of far too many thrillers seems to be that strangers can&#8217;t be trusted, especially when they appear to be acting out of kindness. Don&#8217;t take rides from passing strangers, don&#8217;t accept invitations to spend the night with them, don&#8217;t hook up with more than one sister&#8230; you know, the usual themes and cautionary tales about stranger danger. This week&#8217;s Prime Sublime pick fits that bill, but it does it with a slightly atypical conclusion. It&#8217;s enough to make it stand out from the pack despite no one having seen it in decades&#8230;</p>\n<h2>What is &#8216;The Name of the Game Is Kill&#8217; about?</h2>\n<p>Symcha Lipa (<strong>Jack Lord</strong>) is a Hungarian man wandering the dry roads of the American West when a kind woman named Mickey (<strong>Susan Strasberg</strong>) stops to offer him a ride. He accepts, but her end destination is a town that&#8217;s no more than a speck on the map. With no other options, he accepts her extended kindness and offer for a place to spend the night. She lives with her two sisters, Diz (<strong>Collin Wilcox</strong>) and Nan (<strong>Tisha Sterling</strong>), and their mother (<strong>TC Jones</strong>), and while they&#8217;re leery of the European, he&#8217;s the one who should probably be worried.</p>\n<p>Another man who recently spent some time with the family was murdered, Diz is lying about it, Nan is a bit too affectionate towards her pet rattlesnake and tarantula, and mom? Well she has a secret of her own. Of course, Symcha is no angel as he&#8217;s very insistent while coming on to Mickey. Next thing he knows, the poisonous snake is loosed in his bedroom and a car runs him off the road and over the side of a bridge. Someone&#8217;s playing a game, and the name of the game is&#8230; murder.</p>\n<h2>What makes &#8216;The Name of the Game Is Kill&#8217; sublime?</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Gunnar Hellström</strong> (<em>The Powers of Matthew Star</em>, 1982) and writer <strong>Gary Crutcher</strong> (<em>Stanley</em>, 1972) deliver a straightforward B-movie with <em>The Name of the Game Is Kill</em>. The stakes are made clear right up front &#8212; the opening scene sees some poor schlep getting beaned with a small Venus de Milo statue &#8212; but the decision to make Symcha sketchy in his own right makes for an unusual blend of antagonists. Crutcher originally wrote the film as a play at the age of nineteen before seeing it catch the eyes of Hollywood producers, and its journey to the screen teases a &#8220;what if?&#8221; scenario with some far bigger and better known talents.</p>\n<p>Roman Polanski was briefly attached to direct, and Rock Hudson was set to be his leading man. When that fell apart, Curtis Harrington came on board to direct with George Hamilton ready to play Symcha alongside Tuesday Weld as Mickey and Gloria Swanson as the women&#8217;s mother. That last bit is most interesting to anyone who&#8217;s seen the movie as Swanson couldn&#8217;t have pulled off the reveal in the film&#8217;s third act which suggests it wasn&#8217;t always a part of the narrative.</p>\n<p>Crutcher&#8217;s script has plenty more darkness and questionable behaviors to offer, though, and they find footing well beyond the expected &#8220;crazy family&#8221; dynamic. &#8220;You&#8217;re the first girl who ever invited me to rape her,&#8221; says Symcha, when he returns to the women&#8217;s home and confronts Mickey &#8212; after being run over and told by the local sheriff that they just might be murderers &#8212; and it&#8217;s made immediately clear that none of these people are exactly innocents. Who do you root for when the characters are all bananas in their own ways?</p>\n<p>Unlike something like <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/all-the-kind-strangers-tv-horror/\"><em>All the Kind Strangers</em> (1974)</a> which sees a Good Samaritan fall into a deadly trap, here we&#8217;re embedded with a bad man and four women suffering varying degrees of delusion. Each member of the family tells Symcha a different version of what happened to their father ranging from suicide to murder to abandonment and self defense. Nan&#8217;s tale of how her dad left the family was reportedly built around Sterling&#8217;s own personal trauma &#8212; her father, actor Robert Serling (<em>Show Boat</em>, 1951), abandoned the family when she was still a child.</p>\n<p>Each of them acts out of madness now and then, and it works to shape the mystery as to whom among them &#8212; or is it all of them? &#8212; are responsible for the murders both completed and attempted. The end reveal is pretty interesting, and depending on what you think you know about the mom throughout the film, the conclusion challenges preconceived notions and expectations framed by years of thrillers (including a few Alfred Hitchcock movies). Is it progressive? Maybe, maybe not, but it&#8217;s definitely a different kind of dark, downer finale.</p>\n<h2>And in conclusion&#8230;</h2>\n<p><em>The Name of the Game Is Kill</em> is a B-movie through and through. There&#8217;s a top tier version of the film that never was, but the movie we got still entertains with its characters, thrills, and over the top ending. The journey there is low-key more often than not, but the growing mystery finds some highlights in the form of murder and groovy dance scenes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-prime-sublime/\">Want more sublime Prime finds?

In this edition, we jump to the far future to find the &#8216;Star Trek: Discovery&#8217; crew tasked with keeping Gene Roddenberry&#8217;s vision aflame as Season 3 attempts yet another bold new direction.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Star Trek</em></strong><em>: </em><strong><em>Discovery</em></strong> refuses to be any one thing. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/star-trek-discovery-review-premiere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Season 1 began</a> as a dark confrontation with Starfleet and Federation history, made all the more grim thanks to some nasty interference from the Mirror Universe. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/star-trek-discovery-season-2-hope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The second season</a> seemed to speak directly to the fanbase portion concerned with canon discrepancies and tone by bending over backward to erase the ship from the timeline and Federation records. Propelled nine-hundred and forty years into the future, where no person, especially those doubting cross-armed Trekkies, has gone before, Season 3 aims to finally find space for its characters.</p>\n<p>The mission is right there in the title: &#8220;That Hope is You Part 1.&#8221; Landing in a reality unlike anything previously experienced, Michael Burnham (<strong>Sonequa Martin-Green</strong>) must adjust quickly to a universe minus the Federation. Apparently, hundreds of years before her arrival from the past, the Dilithium crystals that power starships suddenly exploded. This catastrophic event, called &#8220;The Burn,&#8221; cost billions of lives, transformed the fuel source into a rare, sought after commodity, and eradicated the Federation.</p>\n<p>Just as last year&#8217;s <em>Star Trek</em>: <em>Picard</em> centered itself on <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/picard-explained-episode-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the mystery of Data</a> and the replicant Martian massacre, <em>Star Trek: </em><em>Discovery</em> Season 3 ponders the hows and whys of a defunct Starfleet. However, before Burnham can start playing Sherlock Holmes, she has to get her footing and find her shipmates that supposedly followed her through the wormhole. First things first, make nice with the handsome courier &#8212; that is, space pirate &#8212; Cleveland &#8220;Book&#8221; Booker (<strong>David Ajala</strong>).</p>\n<p>On a hunt for a comms array that will allow her to contact <em>Discovery</em>, Burnham follows Book to Requiem, a town populated primarily with scum and villainy. He tells her that her antique Starfleet tech should fetch them a pretty penny from the Andorians and Orions who generally hire his services. She goes along with it until he tricks her into walking into a stasis field, where he can rob her blind and score the riches for himself.</p>\n<p>Just like Han Solo, whenever a dollar appears, so does another thief to snatch it. Book has an additional space pirate gunning for his coin purse. As Burnham, hopped up on crime syndicate truth serum, attempts to talk her way out of capture, Book ignites a gunfight in Requiem&#8217;s streets. Burnham elects to follow the least scuzzy dude in the room and tags along as Book teleports off-world using a handy-dandy personal transporter (future upgrade!).</p>\n<p>When it&#8217;s not throwing topsy-turvy timeline exposition at you, the <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> Season 3 premiere jams as much action as possible into its runtime. From shootouts to standoffs to giant henchman-chomping slugs, the series is chasing the energy of J.J. Abrams&#8217; <em>Star Trek</em>. You could get annoyed if you weren&#8217;t beaming from ear to ear. Martin-Green is clearly having an absolute blast, and she&#8217;s taking you with her.</p>\n<p>While you&#8217;re holding your breath and bouncing to the rhythm of BIF BAM POW, you might actually miss that this is the first <em>Star Trek</em> episode not to feature a single caucasian human. Fifty-four years after its launch, Gene Roddenberry achieved the Vulcan IDIC (infinite diversity in infinite combinations). It&#8217;s delivered as it should be, as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>The CBS All Access <em>Trek</em> era is determined to deflect America&#8217;s post-2016 despair. Season 1 of <em>Star Trek:</em> <em>Discovery</em> ended with a crew pronouncing itself as the embodiment of Starfleet ideals despite certain members within their ranks expressing the opposite. <em>Star Trek</em>: <em>Picard</em> dragged our favorite captain through the mud, stripped him of his rank, and forced him to stand tall while the Federation corroded under xenophobic fear.</p>\n<p><em>Star Trek</em> is not a uniform or a flag. It&#8217;s you and me, fighting for a future brighter than the present. When we get there, the fight continues. Tomorrow can always be better, and if we&#8217;re not careful today, tomorrow could be a whole lot worse. This grim frontier is not final; it merely needs a moral mow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That Hope is You Part 1&#8221; does one better than <em>Star Trek</em>: <em>Picard</em>. The Federation is not broken; it&#8217;s shattered, and a distant memory remembered only by old cooks. <em>Star Trek:</em> <em>Discovery</em> does not coddle to the needs of those viewers stubbornly awaiting the return of recognizable <em>Trek</em>. That&#8217;s why fan films exist. Get to work.</p>\n<p>How strongly do you believe in what you believe? That&#8217;s what the new season is asking of its heroes. When everyone around you says, &#8220;No,&#8221; do you dare to have the strength to say, &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the premiere comes to a close, Burnham is painfully, horridly alone. After the Temporal War (see <a href=\"https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Cold_War\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em></a>), time travel is no longer a possibility. Burnham destroyed her suit upon the first few seconds of landing in the future. Her ship did not immediately follow her behind. We know the crew will return (we&#8217;ve seen the commercials), but for now, Burnham must carry the dream in isolation.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe not totally in isolation.</p>\n<p>During the episode&#8217;s cold open, we meet Aditya Sahil (<strong>Adil Hussain</strong>). Stationed aboard an old Federation relay, the man waits in deafening silence. Every day he wakes up, beams his teeth clean, dresses sharply, and checks the star charts. Like his father and grandfather before him, he carries the torch of the Federation. He believes that all species can come together for the good of all.</p>\n<p>Some day. One day. Why not today?</p>\n<p>In walks Michael Burnham, an impossible person who shares the same impossible dream. Burnham practically blesses Sahil, commissions him into office, and the two begin their long work together. Book hangs back. Whether he likes it or not, they&#8217;ve conscripted the scalawag.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to march in an army. To walk alone is to walk in shadow. In <em>Star Trek</em>: <em>Discovery</em> Season 3, Burnham is stumbling in a dark she never considered, but she&#8217;s bumped into a fellow traveler. Sahil is enough to steer her thoughts away from madness and maybe educate Book in the possibilities of galactic unification.</p>\n<p>When her crew eventually spills forth from its wormhole, Book&#8217;s cynicism won&#8217;t stand a chance. Han Solos can&#8217;t deny a rebellion. To fight the power is fun, and there might be some money or credits to be earned.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/M_WEOYm3ag4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 13:16:58 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b783636f321d58c375088313b0fd9d64","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/M_WEOYm3ag4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-04-612_b9181ff64d43edbc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040515176},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:55","title":"With ‘Siberia,’ Abel Ferrara Pushes New Boundaries","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358456","description":"\n<p>In May 2015, <strong>Abel Ferrara</strong> stood on the rooftop terrace of David Lynch’s pop-up nightclub, Silencio, in Cannes and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/abel-ferrara-and-willem-dafoe-need-your-help-to-make-their-next-movie-523793e4187e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new film: <strong><em>Siberia</em></strong>. In return for their donations, Ferrara promised, <em>Siberia</em> would mark a “throwback” to the uncompromising “physical” cinema with which he made his name: films like <em>Body Snatchers</em>, <em>Ms. 45</em>, and <em>King of New York</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This return to form would only be possible, Ferrara argued, because crowdfunding would allow him to work entirely uncompromised, no longer at the mercy of vision-censoring Hollywood producers whose financial backing of his work had been tapering off since the late ‘90s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early 2000s, that waning support prompted a move to what Ferrara considered the more auteur-friendly Europe, where he has since shot several movies funded by Italian, French and German backers: <em>Go Go Tales</em>, <em>Pasolini</em>, and last year’s <em>Tommaso</em>. In the end, that was how <em>Siberia</em> was made, too – after failing to reach its Kickstarter goal, companies from Mexico and Europe swooped in to bankroll the production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to imagine a film as experimental as <em>Siberia</em> ever receiving funding in the US. Inspired by psychiatrist <strong>Carl Jung</strong>’s <em>The Red Book</em>, the film incorporates psychoanalysis of its star (Willem Dafoe) and the recurring nightmares of its director to produce a hallucinatory trip through the mind. Scenes of Dafoe as a barman self-exiled to the movie’s freezing namesake segue into surreal sequences in Bedouin camps, magic forests, and interrogation rooms, the jarring transitions explained only by the unpredictability of dream logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Ferrara <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww-RqXPCUW4&#38;t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched <em>Siberia</em></a> to the public at a venue named for the otherworldly club in <em>Mulholland Drive</em> is apt, given that the director here shares Lynch’s obsession with the oneiric. <em>Siberia</em> is a dream-like odyssey deep into the unconscious, in which Ferrara rejects easy coherence and linearity in his pursuit of the intangible. “Reason is an obstacle to some knowledge and secrets,” <strong>Simon McBurney</strong>’s magician tells Clint (Dafoe), a line that would appear to have been Ferrara’s guiding principle on set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a distinctly Jungian ethos. The Swiss psychologist theorized that a person could only realize their full potential if they had complete self-knowledge, which requires uncovering their unconscious through a process (“individuation”) that relies on dream analysis. In the Jungian view, all dreams, no matter how bizarre, contain meaningful symbols that demonstrate an attempt by the unconscious mind to communicate with the conscious. For Siberia, screenwriter and psychologist Christ Zois applied Jung’s process of dream decoding to Dafoe, resulting in a smorgasbord of nightmarish images peppering the film: Hebrew-talking fish, aggressive death metal concerts, and glaring suns floating above cave pools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adapting dense psychological theory into a movie is a risky premise: without an explicit frame of reference, intense personal introspection tends to have little appeal for anyone other than the subject. Through his concept of the “collective unconscious,&#8221; Jung’s theories offer Ferrara a potential angle for engaging audiences, although the director sensibly doesn’t bank too much on viewers tapping into that common mental language of primitive instincts and images that Jung believed all humans inherit at birth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Ferrara invokes the general spirit of that theory, one shared by cinema itself: that there is great potential for universality in the specific. Siberia doesn&#8217;t place too much emphasis on its peculiar details, focusing its efforts instead on establishing an emotional portal through which viewers can find familiarity in, if not the exact contents of Clint’s journey (his bear phobia, daddy issues, and unresolved trouble with an ex), then the general shape of them (fear, insecurity, guilt).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy, then, is at the core of <em>Siberia</em>. It would be easy to lose that heart amidst the film&#8217;s barrage of perplexing visuals, but – while intuitive editing and a simple lunar phase-inspired structure certainly help ground the film – Dafoe anchors it. Acclaimed for his versatility, the actor&#8217;s name has nevertheless been most closely associated with a handful of unforgettable bad guy parts &#8212; the Green Goblin in <em>Spider-Man</em>, Bobby Peru in <em>Wild at Heart </em>– perhaps because of a particular physiognomic reading that was neatly summarized in Sergio Leone’s reaction to seeing <em>The Last Temptation of Christ</em>: “This is the face of a psychopathic killer, not the face of Our Lord.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, however, Dafoe has been quietly reminding viewers of his dexterity. In roles in <em>The Florida Project</em>, <em>At Eternity’s Gate</em>, and Ferrara’s own <em>Tommaso</em>, Dafoe is generously open, inviting not just admiration but deep affection for his low-key portrayals of vulnerable artists and everymen. His work in <em>Tommaso</em> as a fictionalised version of his friend Ferrara was especially impressive, with Dafoe winning a difficult plea for empathy in his deeply sensitive presentation of the notoriously brash New Yorker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the talky <em>Tommaso</em>,<em> Siberia</em> is a film of few words, although Ferrara&#8217;s muse doesn’t need them to pull off the same effect. An experimental actor by training, he’s working in his favorite register here, using his extraordinary expressive abilities to channel a similar level of emotional nakedness in Clint&#8217;s navigation of his midlife crisis. That <em>Siberia</em> doesn&#8217;t disintegrate into a formless, abstract mess is largely thanks to its star, who builds a solid humanistic springboard from which to explore difficult questions of the soul. Whether getting down to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S13mP_pfEc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘60s pop classics</a> a la <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5FfHzwuDhA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Christopher Walken in <em>King of New York</em></a>, frolicking around a maypole, or confronting childhood traumas, Dafoe imbues the film with a natural warmth that keeps the threat of cold intellectuality at bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no doubting Siberia is a strange watch, but it’s also strangely watchable. Thanks to Dafoe’s energy and Ferrara’s sincerity, a premise you’d expect to be esoteric in practice actually feels profoundly empathetic, in keeping with the general trajectory of the director’s recent work. In the last decade, Ferrara has abandoned pulpy plunges into greed and drug-fuelled moral decay for continued meditations on guilt, redemption, and fresh concerns like sobriety and parenthood. His protagonists are no longer interested in defensively burying themselves under vice and violence – at mid-life, they’re ready to confront their deepest self. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In films like <em>Tommaso</em> and <em>4:44 Last Day on Earth</em>, the humanism that lurked in Ferrara’s early exploitation-heavy movies began to assume center-stage, but in <em>Siberia</em>, it comes into full, earnest bloom. Its ambitious subject matter and audacious form suggest Ferrara is digging his heels in on this approach, marking him as less willing than ever to court easy commercial projects or settle into middle-aged complacency.

Thirteen Ghosts (2001)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357856\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thirteen-Ghosts-2001.jpg\" alt=\"Thirteen Ghosts\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thirteen-Ghosts-2001.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thirteen-Ghosts-2001-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thirteen-Ghosts-2001-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thirteen-Ghosts-2001-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>What a dick move. Here we go promising a list of the best old dark house movies only to start it with a brightly lit film set in a high-tech home with glass walls. A new bright house if you will. Of course, that&#8217;s part of what makes <strong>Steve Beck</strong>&#8216;s remake of William Castle&#8217;s 1960 original so damn entertaining and memorable. How can a modern smart house with see-through walls and illuminated floors be creepy?</p>\n<p>The multitude of non-standard door locks certainly help, as do the ominous collections of geared creations, but it&#8217;s the prison cells in the basement that really tip the scales. Ghosts! They hold ghosts, and once the angry undead are out and roaming the halls &#8212; visible only to those with special glasses, naturally &#8212; the film&#8217;s adrenalized terror ramps up alongside the fun. Gone are the usual hiding spaces for jump scares and thrills, and in their place sits a collision of glass, metal, ectoplasm, and flesh. Welcome home. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9. The Old Dark House (1932)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357857\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Old-Dark-House-1932.jpg\" alt=\"The Old Dark House\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Old-Dark-House-1932.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Old-Dark-House-1932-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Old-Dark-House-1932-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Old-Dark-House-1932-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>When trapped in a thunderstorm, any potential shelter should come with relief. Of course, not if that shelter is the Femm estate <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-old-dark-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with its Boris Karloff butler and family of mysterious psychotics huddled within</a>. Sometimes, the cure is worse than the disease. The titular Old Dark House looks like any other country home you&#8217;ve seen on postcards. It&#8217;s a collection of passages and tiny boxes, but hidden behind every door is a secret where whispers echo like screams.</p>\n<p><strong>James Whale</strong> knew how to bend a set toward terror, and the tricks he learned on <em>Frankenstein</em> solidify with <em>The Old Dark House</em>. The director weaponizes lighting and sound design, transforming his studio sets into nightmares of shadow and incoherent rustling. The Femm house will have you nostalgically dreaming of the luxury and comfort of Bavarian castles. (Brad Gullickson)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. House (1985)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357858\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-Movie-1985.jpg\" alt=\"House Movie\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-Movie-1985.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-Movie-1985-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-Movie-1985-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/House-Movie-1985-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><em>House</em> is a haunted mansion flick with more on its mind than creaky floorboards and things that go bump in the night. The supernatural elements serve as a metaphor for PTSD, though the film is packed with too much humor to work as a truly effective examination of the condition.</p>\n<p>That said, where the movie does succeed is in its ability to balance the laughs with horror elements that are truly menacing at times. More than anything, though, the movie is just pure bonkers and constantly entertaining. The practical effects work is delightfully ghoulish as well, but that’s just a small part of <em>House</em>’s many spooky charms. (Kieran Fisher)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>7. The Others (2001)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357859\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001.jpg\" alt=\"The Others\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Others-2001-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>You don’t need direct sunlight to be able to see that the old manor in <em>The Others</em> is one of horror’s best decrepit houses. It’s got all the hallmarks of a spooky English estate: rolling fog, stuffy furniture, and vast, unexplored corridors. This is all made even more ominous by Nicole Kidman’s pitch-perfect performance as a paranoid mother hellbent on keeping her children, who have a sensitivity to light, away from the damaging rays at all costs.</p>\n<p>From the foreboding gated entrance to the shadowy interiors, every inch of this Jersey property instills doom and gloom. Even before ghosts enter the picture, this is clearly the perfect location for a haunt. (Anna Swanson)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. The Innocents (1961)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357860\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Innocents-1961.jpg\" alt=\"The Innocents\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Innocents-1961.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Innocents-1961-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Innocents-1961-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Innocents-1961-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Crafting the perfect haunted house is a magic trick. For <em>The Innocents</em>, most of what you see of Bly Manor exists on the sound stages within Shepperton Studios, while a facade was constructed on the lot. For the larger exterior shots, director <strong>Jack Clayton</strong> selected the old gothic mansion that stood defiantly atop Sheffield Park in East Sussex.</p>\n<p>Lit and shadowed by Freddie Francis (who wouldn&#8217;t shoot another film until David Lynch came calling for <em>The Elephant Man</em>), Bly takes on the life of a fist. As Deborah Kerr slinks through its corridors, the audience can sense the walls tightening. There are secrets in this fabrication; dark truths better left unsaid, but are definitely, purposefully doomed to reveal themselves.

Welcome to&#160;<strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/great-performances/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Great Performances</a></strong>, a bi-weekly column exploring the art behind some of cinema’s best roles. In this entry, we look at Patricia Tallman&#8217;s Barbara in the remake of Night of the Living Dead</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>I totally understand why someone would write off the <strong>Tom Savini</strong>-helmed remake of Night of the Living Dead. How do you replicate the genre-defining influence of <strong>George Romero</strong>’s seminal film, or begin to convey the same social commentary it had in 1968? Regardless of what <a href=\"https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/interviews/george-romero-sight-sound-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Romero said he intended</a>, he made a statement by casting Duane Jones, a Black actor, as the co-lead in a movie released at the end of the Civil Rights Movement. It’s a poignancy that’s sewn into the fabric of the original film, and part of what turns it into a work of art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why the hell remake a work of art? Because even masterpieces have imperfections that can be improved upon, and the one in <em>Night of the Living Dead </em>is far from minor. Romero and co-writer John A. Russo created a complex ensemble of characters, but they didn’t give emotional depth to one of the most important roles in the movie: the audience surrogate, Barbara (<strong>Judith O’Dea</strong>). The fear we experience in the opening scenes, as well as the relief when we meet Ben (Jones), are told purely through Barbara’s perspective. Yet once she arrives at the farmhouse, rather than staying with Barbara and exploring her post-traumatic stress, Romero and Russo disconnect the character from the action, fading her into the background through a tangled mess of weepy clichés.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Romero didn’t intend to break racial stereotypes with Ben, he likely also didn’t intend to reinforce gender stereotypes with Barbara. Any agency the character had in the film’s opening moments are ripped away as Romero and Russo force Barbara to rely on the male survivors to make life-and-death decisions for her. When Romero revisited his original screenplay in 1990, and <strong>Patricia Tallman</strong> took over the role from O’Dea in Savini&#8217;s remake, Barbara was finally allowed to realistically process her trauma and channel her emotions into a resiliency to survive that&#8217;s as engaging as it is thrilling to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two different Barbara’s begin their waking nightmare in the same way: by watching their older brother get bludgeoned to death by a zombie. The trauma from this shocking moment becomes the character’s bedrock. Whoever Barbara was before, no matter how demure she may have been, clutching to her brother for emotional support, in this moment she instantly changes. It’s a trial by fire that forces her into action by pulling the emergency brake on her car and narrowly escaping a graveyard filling up with ghouls.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens next is where the two different characters diverge. Both are shocked into silence, but for O’Dea’s version, that&#8217;s conveyed by Barbara reverting to a childlike fugue state as a coping mechanism. Romero and Russo aren’t interested in investigating the character’s trauma below surface level, so they just let her inaction be nothing more than a frustrating impediment for other characters, including Ben, who are allowed to process the gravity of their situation. Barbara spends the rest of the film disengaged from the story as an obtuse wilting flower, glued to a couch, unwilling to lend a hand.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Barbara finally does snap out of her reverie in the end, her action is used as an ironic plot device rather than a moment of her overcoming her fears. She sees her zombified brother for the first time, and Romero and Russo drop any agency Barbara just had as they let her easily succumb to her brother and the throng of walking dead. They didn’t want to offer Barbara any kind of character arc; they just needed a cynical setup for her inevitable demise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romero gave more color to his female characters through the &#8217;70s and ‘80s &#8212; especially in his occult ode to female empowerment, <em>Season of the Witch</em> &#8211;but none are more refined than Tallman’s take on Barbara in 1990. The performance turned Barbara into an Ellen Ripley-esque heroine, full of bravura and bravery, a complete subversion of Romero and Russo’s original creation. Her swing from weeping willow to action star was an idea <a href=\"https://dailydead.com/exclusive-interview-tom-savini-directing-1990s-night-living-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Savini offered</a>. “I had seen Sigourney Weaver as this great woman hero, in <em>Alien</em>,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I wanted Barbara to become [one], too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tallman had actually worked with the creative team previously on Romero’s 1981 cult classic <em>Knightriders</em>, as well as a Savini-helmed episode of the Romero-produced <em>Tales from the Darkside</em> television show, before going on to perform stunts in Romero’s 1988 killer chimp flick, <em>Monkey Shines</em>. Needless to say, they knew she had chops, but it’s a statement in and of itself about this version of Barbara that Romero and Savini cast an actress who was a prominent stunt woman. It categorically tells the audience: this isn’t the same character we met twenty-two years before; this is a woman of action, quite literally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romero’s updated script still uses a tight word economy to represent Barbara’s shock after watching her brother die, but Tallman doesn’t make the character weak because she isn’t given much to initially say. Where O’Dea’s Barbara is vacuous and detached, physically shrinking away from conflict, Tallman’s Barbara grows more confident and self-assured, pulling herself together after a pep-talk from Ben (played by Tony Todd<strong> </strong>in the remake), and finding inner-strength, something the original film never cared about doing. Tallman masterfully shows this mix of shock and fortitude through a haunted, piercing stare that keeps her connected to the action, giving Ben someone to talk with rather than talk at. This isn’t the catatonic character from the original; Barbara gets to actually share in Ben and the other survivor’s unrelenting desire to live through the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her drive to action isn’t just a mechanism for the story either, but part of the arc that sees Tallman’s Barbara become the most intelligent character in the film. In the third act, as she becomes exasperated by the male survivors squabbling over who gets a gun and who gets to barricade themselves in the basement, she points out something the audience has been yelling at the screen about the entire movie: why don’t they just walk around these slow-ass zombies? If they&#8217;re careful, they can very easily flee to safety. When she shares this master plan, we&#8217;re left gobsmacked; Tallman’s Barbara has outsmarted us. We never expect a horror character to make such an obviously sensible decision, but because she does, we root for her even more. It&#8217;s a singular moment that exemplifies Tallman and Romero&#8217;s thoughtful reimagining of this major character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emotional intelligence Tallman and Romero give Barbara is the perfect recompense for how woefully underdeveloped she was in the original, but this isn’t a perfect remake in its own right. A vastly superior budget provided by B-movie impresario Menahem Golan robs the remake of a powerful sense of verité realism that the original embodies. In giving Barbara her overdue agency, Ben’s own is scaled back, which douses water on the fire Duane Jones originally gave the character. It’s a shame that Tony Todd’s Ben was diminished as Tallman’s Barbara was revitalized, as both could have coexisted and made the film even stronger.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how you feel about remakes, the characterizations given to Barbara in the 1990 version of <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> rectify the weakest link of the original masterpiece.&#160;Tallman’s stoic portrayal of a woman fighting through shock, trauma, and hordes of the undead to find her own resilience is a total about-face to the shrinking violet that Romero and Russo had originally conceived. If you must remake a movie, do it for a good reason. And I can’t think of a better one than giving this character the depth she always deserved.&#160;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/YxFlEEHOTEg\" height=\"1\"
