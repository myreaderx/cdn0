Wakelet allows people to easily save, organize and share content from across the web—and educators, especially in these challenging times, have used the integration as powerful tool for their remote learning toolkit.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Building off this momentum, we are excited to announce a new capability in the Wakelet app in Teams, where you can now bookmark links from your Teams channel by saving them directly into your Wakelet Collections!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Whether you are an educator gathering resources for your students or a marketing team sharing research content, it’s now easier to save and share content from your conversations in Teams. With just a few clicks, bookmark sources from within your channel so they are accessible in your Wakelet profile.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Stay engaged in discussions, while simultaneously ensuring no important links get lost.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture1.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/188728iF375D9FB8EAA9403/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture1.png\" alt=\"Picture1.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Need help with bookmarking links?

This post provides details on the retirement plan, a brief explanation of why we’re making this announcement now, and a summary of what we’re doing to help customers migrate to Teams.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>What is the Skype for Business Retirement plan?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Skype for Business Online will be retired on July 31, 2021, and after that date the service will no longer be accessible. Between now and then, current Skype for Business Online customers will experience no change in service, and they’ll be able to continue to add new users as needed. However, starting September 1, 2019, we will onboard all new Office 365 customers directly to Teams for chat, meetings, and calling. Please note that the Skype Consumer service and Skype for Business Server will both be unaffected by this announcement.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Why are we making this announcement now?</STRONG></P>\n<P>In 2017 we launched Microsoft Teams as “the hub for teamwork” in Microsoft 365. Teams combines chat, video, calling, and document collaboration into a single, integrated app – and enables an entirely new way of working. Over the last two years, we’ve worked closely with customers to refine Teams, and we now feel we’re at the point that we can confidently recommend it as an upgrade to all Skype for Business Online customers. Customers who have already made the move tell us that Teams not only has helped them improve collaboration generally, it has also provided a rare opportunity to rethink the way work gets done in their organizations. Using Teams, companies across the world are becoming more agile, shortening cycle times, improving the efficiency of key workflows, and cutting out unnecessary overhead. Teams isn’t just an upgrade for Skype for Business Online, it’s a powerful tool that opens the door to an entirely new way of doing business. But don’t take our word for it! Learn more about the potential benefits of Teams for your organization with the recently published Forrester white paper “<A href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Total-Economic-Impact-Microsoft-Teams.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Total Economic Impact of Microsoft Teams</A>.”</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>What is Microsoft doing to help customers migrate to Teams?</STRONG><BR />For all of the benefits of moving to Teams, we recognize that the migration will require time and effort – and we’re here to help.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>First, we’re making product investments to address feature requests from current Skype for Business Online customers, including:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><STRONG>Dynamic 911</STRONG>. A feature of Microsoft Teams Phone System, Dynamic E911 automatically uses the caller’s current location to route to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) call center operated by the local government.&nbsp; Dynamic E911 will be delivered in Teams for the United States by the end of this calendar year.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Shorter Retention Periods</STRONG>.

Lists are simple. Lists are everywhere. A bucket list, a grocery list or a to-do list in personal lives; and lists to track customer issues, software bugs or job candidates in our work lives. They scratch the itch our brains have for categorization and processing information. As a <A href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-list-of-reasons-why-our-brains-love-lists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Yorker journalist puts it</A> – processing information in list form feels - “a bit like sipping green juice instead of munching on a bundle of kale”.</P>\n<P>But lists themselves can become overwhelming especially when the number of items in the list and people collaborating on the list becomes larger – two things which are unavoidable in the modern workplace.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>The challenge</STRONG></P>\n<P>That is what was happening internally amongst the Teams engineering team, and we decided - as per usual - to scratch our own itch first <img class=\"lia-deferred-image lia-image-emoji\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/html/images/emoticons/smile_40x40.gif\" alt=\":smile:\" title=\":smile:\" /> and that is how this List Search app template was born.</P>\n<P>As of mid-2019, <A href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-says-teams-now-has-13-million-daily-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 13 million users across 500,000 organizations used Teams</A>. This exponential growth made the lives of Teams team (we know.. we know) hard to stay on top of customer asks. The team had created SharePoint list to manage high level customer asks and issues.</P>\n<P>The data in this list was uber-important to almost everyone – from PMs who would write feature specifications based on asks, to developers who would take the context and turn them into actual features, to finally ‘Customer PMs’ who would work with customers to ensure their rollout is successful and meets the needs of each customer. However, collaborating on individual list items was cumbersome.</P>\n<P>Feedback came from everywhere and folks needed access to data quickly. Often, we’d see posts from people wanting to speak about a particular customer issue and having a discussion around it but getting stuck at knowing which folks to @mention in their post and we’d end up with so many posts like below, with much time spent finding the right information let alone acting on it.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left\" image-alt=\"Capture.PNG\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/126278iB037F03FAD86CC2F/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"Capture.PNG\" alt=\"Capture.PNG\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>The solution</STRONG></P>\n<P>That’s when listening to our own internal customers we decided to work on the List Search app template. What if all these people could self-help and get unblocked? What if, while writing a post about the customer issue, they could search and share the relevant information from within the context of the chat box itself? And that’s what we did.</P>\n<P>So now, folks can get to the crux of the matter faster and have more productive conversations. After running a pilot internally we’re happy to bring this app template to you so you can also enable such experiences within your organization.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"ContosoListSearch.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/126281i05CEE0F25BBE3D67/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"ContosoListSearch.gif\" alt=\"ContosoListSearch.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Finally, the beauty of this <A href=\"http://www.aka.ms/TeamsAppTemplates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app template</A> is that it is not restricted to bringing customer list data contextually into a chat context – it works with literally any business context put on a SharePoint list.</P>\n<P>For example, each organization has its fair share of obscure acronyms that often trip even the veterans let alone new employees. While acronyms can’t be done away with, they <I>can</I> be made more accessible to everyone by re-skinning this ‘List Search’ app template to a ‘Glossary Search App’.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"dilbert.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/126282i28821DFB1B389096/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"dilbert.png\" alt=\"dilbert.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;Source: <A href=\"https://dilbert.com/strip/1994-05-18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dilbert.com</A></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN>A&nbsp;few&nbsp;other&nbsp;examples include software bug tracking&nbsp;and&nbsp;SKU lookup where having a conversation around individual items within the list often becomes&nbsp;contextual.</SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN><STRONG>How to enable List Search in your organization ..</STRONG></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>So, go on - give this app template a try and let us know what list scenario you made more contextual for your users.

Microsoft Ready brings our sales, marketing, services, and technical fields together to connect, collaborate, and celebrate as One Microsoft community. This is Microsoft’s way of making sure the diverse employee base across continents can leverage each other’s perspectives and upskill in the process. Handling such a huge contingent comes with its own set of challenges.</P>\n<P><BR />For each attendee, the schedule is packed with learning sessions and labs. As a result, meeting people outside of their immediate work groups becomes a challenge. This year, the Customer Success Ready organizing team decided to do something new. <BR />Kim Cowman, Senior Community and Events Manager, in charge of planning Ready for Customer Success was looking for ways to help attendees make the most of their trip – when she thought of an interesting idea. <BR />She had collaborated with her peers earlier to run an experiment for an internal community using a Teams bot and wondered if the same bot could also be used drive viral engagement for the conference attendees in her community. The idea was simple - create a Teams Team and install the bot to the team. Every Monday at 10AM this bot will randomly pair each team member for a meetup. What’s even better – it will suggest times that are free for both parties (all thanks to Office 365 AI chops).</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"IcebreakerScheduling1.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/125171i9A4804E7A7636CED/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"IcebreakerScheduling1.gif\" alt=\"IcebreakerScheduling1.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Kim worked with her conference organizing committee peers to deploy a version of that bot for the Customer Success Ready conference attendees. They figured it’d be great to have the attendees be paired up every day, given they were there for only a week and wanted to meet as many people as possible. What was so cool about this bot was that creating a custom version of it was a few minutes worth of work and didn’t require a developer!<BR />Monday morning Kim and team were nervously watching the team to see if people would engage and like the experiment. To their joy, the floodgates opened. The team was buzzing with activity. Throughout the week there were posts like below drumming up excitement.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Heba icebreaker.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/125172iD5DF6BEC00734DFF/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Heba icebreaker.png\" alt=\"Heba icebreaker.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>Heba Yacout, Customer Success Manager traveled all the way from United Arab Emirates to meet her colleagues from the world over.

We are excited to share a ton of new features that have come to Microsoft Teams in the past month of September, from improvements to the calling experience to new, intuitive ways to filter your chats.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>What’s New: Chat &amp; Collaboration</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P><STRONG>Filter through your chats</STRONG></P>\n<P>Having many simultaneous conversations is the norm in today’s work and social culture but can make finding the right thread at the right time difficult. The new filters added in <STRONG>Chat</STRONG> and <STRONG>Teams </STRONG>help you filter more than just your activity. In chat, type a person’s name to filter for every group, meeting, or one-on-one chat you have with them. Then select <STRONG>More</STRONG> options to add more filters – like unread messages. Or type a keyword to filter by group chats that have names. Similarly, filter your teams list by typing a keyword to find a specific team or channel by name.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"filter.png\" style=\"width: 503px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/134040i0F307284D72BD4FA/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"filter.png\" alt=\"filter.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Turn down the noise in channels</STRONG></P>\n<P>Shh!

With secondary ringer functionality, those wearing plugged in headsets will still be able to hear an incoming call ring their computer. This is a crucial feature that helps Teams users to not miss any incoming calls.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Enhancements to <U>Cloud Voicemail</U> &nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P>Several updates have come this month to improving your Cloud Voicemail experience. First, users will now be able to directly transfer a call to Cloud Voicemail. And several enhancements enable end users to directly configure features themselves in the Teams settings options, including: configuring call answer rules, choosing the greeting language, customizing the TTS for the standard greeting and the ‘out of office’ greeting, and choosing when you want your ‘out of office’ greeting to be played. Learn more <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A> about setting up Cloud Voicemail and configuring your settings.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Know who is calling, even when they are not a Teams user using <U>reverse number look up</U></STRONG></P>\n<P>“Hello?” Vs. “Hello!” We are all used to “caller ID”, where we are shown the identity of our caller before we answer the phone. But if you receive a call in Teams from a PSTN Caller, how do you know who is trying to reach you? Now, when a user receives a call, Teams will display the PSTN Caller’s name based on Azure Active Directory data and/or the Telco provided display name. Available now on the desktop, and coming soon to Teams mobile.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Chrome now has calling! </STRONG></P>\n<P>If you’re using Teams on the web, you can now add Google Chrome to your list of browsers that support making calls from your web browser. If you’re on Chrome, try it out today. Go to <STRONG>Calls </STRONG>on the left side of Teams, or type <STRONG>/call </STRONG>in the command bar at the very top of Teams.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Phone System updates for Microsoft 365 GCC (Government Community Cloud)</STRONG></P>\n<P>Several updates have made their way to Microsoft 365 GCC this month! New capabilities include: Call Handling Enhancements, Teams Calling improvements for VOIP users, Group Call Pickup (GCP), phone number blocking, Multiparty Calling without Conference License, Call Park (CP), and Shared Line Appearance (SLA). Together, these features represent a significant milestone in how calls are handled by Microsoft Teams for GCC users.

No invite required. </STRONG></P>\n<P>Not all meetings can be scheduled in advance; some happen spontaneously.

All you need to do is go to Calendar on the left side of Teams, then select Meet now in the top right corner and add the people to the meeting. No calendar, no scheduling, no fuss.

In Meetings First, users schedule and meet in Teams while continuing to use Skype for Business for chat, calling, and presence.&nbsp; There is no overlap of modalities between Teams and Skype for Business.&nbsp; Chat, calling, and presence are on in Skype for Business and off in Teams.&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Who should consider Meetings First?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Meetings First was designed for organizations who require the enterprise voice workloads of Skype for Business Server but want a superior meetings experience with Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;

Teams private chat, calling, and self-presence are not exposed in Meetings First, enabling the deployment and adoption effort to fully focus on meetings.</LI>\n<LI>“Better Together” with Teams and Skype for Business:\n<UL>\n<LI>Automatic hold: When in a meeting in Teams, getting in a call in Skype for Business will place the Teams meeting on hold, and vice-versa. This prevents users from having their private calls overheard by the meetings participants.</LI>\n<LI>Presence reconciliation: Activity in Teams is reflected in the user’s presence, which is the Skype for Business presence since chat and calling are in Skype for Business. Specifically, when Meetings First users are in a Teams meeting, their presence will be updated to reflect that. When they present their screen, their presence will be updated to show Do Not Disturb (based on their settings in Skype for Business).</LI>\n<LI>USB device HID control reconciliation: The HID controls are honored by Teams while in Teams meetings and by Skype for Business in all other circumstances.</LI>\n</UL>\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Why host your meetings with Microsoft Teams?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Meetings are more crucial now than ever before and are very different than in days past.&nbsp; With people spending nearly 80% of their time in collaborative work, meetings play an essential role in the way we connect.&nbsp; Teams meetings bring people together to meet and collaborate in new ways.&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Leveraging the power of the Microsoft Cloud for security, AI and cognitive services, Teams transforms the entire meeting experience, bringing value before, during, and after a meeting.&nbsp; And Teams meetings are infused with AI, making them more innovative and inclusive.&nbsp; Whether offering insights, capturing action items, or transcribing meeting notes, AI in Teams aims to make your meetings more productive.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Get started today</STRONG></P>\n<P>We are pleased to offer our Skype for Business Server customers the opportunity to move their meetings workload to Teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional information on how to get started today, check out our <A href=\"https://aka.ms/MeetingsFirst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meetings First</A> support article.&nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 16:01:39 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/129024i2B46054C897A6EFA/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"cf1d519c8b04f949241937361c00c841","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-56-43-622_e962522f02d40eca.webp","destWidth":999,"destHeight":666,"sourceBytes":288856,"destBytes":34794,"author":"James Skay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/129024i2B46054C897A6EFA/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-56-43-622_e962522f02d40eca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401928},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"New capabilities for Teams Management | July 2020","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/new-capabilities-for-teams-management-july-2020/ba-p/1530282","description":"<P>New management features and capability improvements for Microsoft Teams rolled out in July.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Device management enhancements in the Teams Admin Center to manage your Teams devices in one location</STRONG></P>\n<P>This month we introduced <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/one-place-to-manage-all-your-teams-devices/ba-p/1527766\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new capabilities for device management in the Teams Admin center</A>, enabling customers to manage their <STRONG>Teams devices from one location</STRONG>, now including <STRONG>Microsoft Teams Rooms</STRONG>.

Microsoft Teams gives brings capabilities that your users already enjoy with Skype, like messaging, calling, managing contacts, or hosting online meetings, but it goes beyond to deliver all of this in a single hub for teamwork that can connect to your favorite apps and enhance productivity. Of course, some of the biggest differences between Skype and Teams are under the covers. Teams is built on a modern platform for audio and video and uses the latest cloud infrastructure on Azure for optimized global coverage, which brings several performance and networking benefits. For example, meetings get started faster and user ratings show that call quality in Teams.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN> <SPAN>For an IT Admin this means you can expect fewer helpdesk calls related to meeting experiences and calling.&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></P>\n<P>Also, because Teams is cloud-native, it benefits from ongoing innovation such as whiteboard sharing, background blur and in-line translation, which allow for a more inclusive collaboration experience. Best of all for you in IT, we give you a comprehensive admin experience for day to management, security and compliance. We covered more on this in previous Essentials episodes at <A href=\"https://aka.ms/microsoftteamsforit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aka.ms/MicrosoftTeamsForIT</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO width=\"600\" height=\"338\" size=\"large\" vid=\"https://youtu.be/1HKWEq_uyYU\" align=\"center\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1HKWEq_uyYU/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<H1>Choosing your path to Microsoft Teams</H1>\n<P>Another good reason to start your upgrade to Teams now is that whether you are coming from Skype for Business Online or Skype for Business Server on-premises, with or without Enterprise voice, we have a number of robust options to help in your journey to Teams. If you follow our guidance as you make the transition, you trust that no user will miss a chat message and meetings will always be accessible either from Skype or Teams. Here are some pointers on the top things to get started:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>1. You may not need to do anything at all:&nbsp;</STRONG><SPAN><BR /></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>For smaller organizations that do not have hybrid or on-premises dependencies and are using Skype for Business Online only, Microsoft offers an automated upgrade for your Office 365 tenant. We will notify you in advance in the message center and via email if your tenant has been selected for this automated upgrade. This is a great benefit if you don’t have dedicated IT staff. Learn more about this at <A href=\"https://aka.ms/TeamsAutomaticUpgrade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aka.ms/TeamsAutomaticUpgrade</A>. </SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>2. Upgrading from Skype to Teams is more than just a technical upgrade: </STRONG><STRONG><SPAN><BR /></SPAN></STRONG>Aside from specific architectural considerations, the rate at which users adopt Teams will impact your timeline and influence the success of your upgrade the most. Managing change across your users is imperative to any successful adoption strategy. Your roll out team needs extend beyond IT to incorporate the right sponsors and stakeholders such as executive sponsors; a project lead to help instigate and keep track of training and roll-out milestones; and various champions that can share user feedback. We explain this in more detail in our video.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>3. Microsoft Teams comes with built-in upgrade options and interoperability:&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P><SPAN>This applies whether you are coming from Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business Server on-premises, have a hybrid configuration, or have an enterprise voice plan. </SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN><STRONG style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: &amp;quot; segoeui&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lato&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot;,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">4. </STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>We allow you to incrementally get your organization on board: <BR /></STRONG>Skype and Teams can coexist during your upgrade. This way, while you gradually onboard users or groups of users to Teams, you have flexibility to ensure the pre-requisites are in place with SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange, Azure AD synchronization, and network optimization requirements.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: &amp;quot; segoeui&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lato&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot;,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"><STRONG style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">5. </STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>There are two main upgrade paths to choose from:</STRONG></P>\n<OL>\n<LI>The first path has <STRONG><EM>overlapping capabilities</EM></STRONG> across Skype and Teams and is enabled with “Islands mode”. This is our recommended path to start with. Note that by default, this will be the coexistence mode for your tenant. Because chat, meetings, and VoIP calling are available in both clients, your users can get familiar with Teams while still being able to access all the features from Skype at the same time.</LI>\n<LI>The second path is where you can pick <STRONG><EM>select capabilities</EM></STRONG> selecting from two interoperability modes. <STRONG><EM>“Skype for Business with Teams Collab and Meetings” </EM></STRONG>mode, also known as our \"meetings-first approach\", allows to have chat and calls initiated and received in Skype while scheduling and collaboration capabilities are handled by Teams. Otherwise, you can keep chats, calls and meetings in Skype while collaboration capabilities remain unique to Teams with team conversations, file sharing, and co-authoring enabled with <STRONG><EM>“Skype for Business with Teams Collab” </EM></STRONG>mode.</LI>\n<LI>Once your organization is ready, you can turn on <STRONG>Teams only mode</STRONG>, which means all incoming calls and chats land in the Teams client. In fact, if you have PSTN calling configured, users will receive all incoming voice calls in Teams, and PSTN connectivity is enabled with a calling pad that lights up in Teams.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: &amp;quot; segoeui&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lato&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot;,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"><STRONG style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">6. </STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>You can mix and match your coexistence modes:</STRONG></P>\n<P>Modes can be set organization-wide or for specific users in the Teams Admin Center or using PowerShell. You’ll want to use PowerShell if you have a large number of users that you want to assign specific modes to, and we have a range of cmdlets that enable you to perform bulk actions, such as setting modes with or without user notifications. This allows you for example to have subsets of users still on Skype for Business with select capabilities, or on overlapping capabilities, or just Teams only based on the upgrade strategy for your organization.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>7. A hybrid configuration is required if you are coming from Skype for Business Server on-premises:</STRONG></P>\n<P>User accounts in Skype for Business Server need to also be present in Skype for Business Online for interoperability with Teams to work. If you are already using Office 365, you probably have this in place already. Also, a hybrid configuration with Skype for Business Online needs to be in place to ensure that chat and calling traffic between Skype and Teams is automatically transferred via our gateway service. You’ll need to use PowerShell for that, and you can learn more about the steps at <A href=\"https://aka.ms/TeamsSfBHybrid\" target=\"_self\">aka.ms/TeamsSfBHybrid</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>8. There are two voice options to enable integration between your PSTN or Voice over IP services:</STRONG></P>\n<P class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-30px\">• A Microsoft calling plan: If you are using a phone system and a Microsoft calling plan where Microsoft provides your phone numbers directly, once you enable Teams only mode traffic is routed to Teams automatically, or<BR />• Direct Routing, which can be configured in a few ways.. If you have an on-premises Session Border Controller device that connects directly with your PSTN trunk line from your telecommunications provider or ISP, you’ll need to route the connection to your Microsoft 365 tenant. Or, if your Direct Routing is done off-site by your telecommunications provider via their Session Border Controller, you will need to work with them to direct PSTN traffic to your Microsoft 365 tenant.</P>\n<P class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-30px\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>9. There are tools to help you to track organizational readiness:</STRONG></P>\n<P>You can track Microsoft Teams usage in your environment with built-in usage reports and dashboards available in both the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams Admin Center. We also recommend circling back with your onboarding team and conducting regular end-user surveys using Advisor for Teams. This will help you to capture user feedback and sentiment and ensure you have a comprehensive perspective on the readiness of your organization to upgrade to Teams.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>10. Your users’ contacts and upcoming meetings can also be upgraded to Teams:</STRONG></P>\n<P>The migration of your data and meetings, like interop, for the most part happens behind the scenes. There are options to automatically upgrade upcoming Skype for Business meetings across all your users’ calendars to Teams.</P>\n<P><BR />If you want to learn more, I encourage you to watch our <A href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FmQL2i2yyoHE&amp;data=02%7C01%7CNydia.Cavazos%40microsoft.com%7C63660ab138cc4c1d244208d7bcbcced2%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637185391419316189&amp;sdata=HpJ%2FCZL0Z%2F1mf8TpmheOiE4RbwM%2FhE%2BlhIQw1VL5cY0%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">Skype to Teams Upgrade Tutorial.</A> Also keep checking back to <A href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMfDB7VenWuA%26list%3DPLXtHYVsvn_b_JeDjgD5XdkyHTDXdYgPGn&amp;data=02%7C01%7CNydia.Cavazos%40microsoft.com%7C63660ab138cc4c1d244208d7bcbcced2%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637185391419316189&amp;sdata=krSrmqx7Xj2hrIdqFBrjHMkNMIsR3g%2BBcI4NwDgCARE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/MicrosoftTeamsforIT</A> for our next Essentials show on best practices for getting your organization to adopt Teams broadly.

In the solution design phase, getting to the best outcome requires keeping an open mind, getting feedback as broadly as you can, and then systematically evaluating and iterating towards the best solution. Towards this end, bringing stakeholders together into a room to brainstorm, sketch ideas, or do sticky-note exercises to gather feedback can be useful for getting a bigger picture. In a remote working environment, many software tools can provide similar support, with the additional benefits of being digital – and that includes being connected with conversations and closely available within Microsoft Teams. As you tackle projects in a remote working environment, experiment with different tools to collect and operationalize ideas, brainstorming, and feedback.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Start up a quick whiteboard</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>Sometimes teams need a space to go back and forth and share ideas – and you need a free-form space to draw and ideate. A digital whiteboard can deliver that experience, coupled with the ability to save and share your drawings forever. Microsoft Whiteboard can provide whiteboard services within meetings. Additional applications can provide specialized whiteboard features and spaces for idea visualization.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>InVision offers platform for design and development teams to collect ideas, prototype digital experiences, streamline handoffs, and share feedback – including a free whiteboarding experience in Teams known as Freehand. With <A href=\"https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/office/wa104381362?tab=overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freehand</A>, you can replicate the feel of a marker on a whiteboard for fast ideation or create something more polished with simple shape selection, color, and alignment tools – all of which make it easy for anyone to contribute, no matter their drawing talent. Everything in Freehand is shared in real-time, meaning multiple team members can draw and add images simultaneously. This makes it a great space to bring the team together, even when you are far apart.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"1.png\" style=\"width: 930px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/188269i7708699059F0AE51/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"1.png\" alt=\"Freehand by InVision helps with whiteboard and brainstorming\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Freehand by InVision helps with whiteboard and brainstorming</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><A href=\"https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381626?tab=Overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MURAL</A> is another whiteboarding application integrated within Microsoft Teams that enables visual collaboration through digital sticky notes, drawings, and diagrams.

Update","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-teams-devices-for-shared-spaces-july-and-august-update/ba-p/1604833","description":"<P>To enable powerful meeting experiences across the hybrid workplace, we’ve been working to deliver new features and experiences across our shared space devices. Updates for these device experiences are available now on the Windows store - Microsoft Teams Rooms app version 4.5.37.0, collaboration bar app version 1.0.94.2020062501, and Surface Hub version 0.2020.84.1970.</P>\n<P><BR />Included below are additional details for new experiences enabled through these app releases:</P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Coordinated Meetings for Microsoft Teams Rooms and Surface Hub</STRONG><BR />With Coordinated Meetings, people can drive inclusive, collaborative meeting experiences between remote and in-person attendees like never before. Now, users can leverage the power of both Microsoft Teams Room and Surface Hub devices in the same meeting, through a coordinated experience. Using proximity or one-touch join, both devices join the meeting simultaneously with Teams Rooms running audio and video, while Surface Hub is automatically muted to avoid any distracting feedback. During the meeting, users can maximize screen real estate by using the front of room display to show attendees in the meeting gallery, while the Surface Hub is used to show content or to conduct a collaborative whiteboarding session. With the whiteboard experience on Surface Hub and Microsoft Whiteboard in Teams, people can draw and ink together on the same savable canvas, no matter their location. For more information on how to enable this coordinated meeting experience, read our <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/coordinated-meetings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guidance</A>.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/213829iAA87AE1AA2DBAAF1/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms.png\" alt=\"Coordinated meetings with Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Coordinated meetings with Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Pin attendees on Surface Hub</STRONG><BR />Control the view in-room attendees see on the Surface Hub with the pin feature. Like the Teams meeting experience on the PC, users can pin a participant’s video to the gallery view, holding the view in place regardless of who is talking. This feature will begin rolling out later this month. <BR /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Microsoft Teams video meeting.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/213833i47CC3823695F4BB0/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Microsoft Teams video meeting.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Teams video meeting on a Surface Hub featuring a pinned video\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Microsoft Teams video meeting on a Surface Hub featuring a pinned video</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Proximity-based meeting join, now available for Surface Hub</STRONG><BR />The simplicity of proximity-based meeting join for Microsoft Teams Rooms is now available on Surface Hub. Using proximity join, a person’s laptop or mobile device can be used to identify a nearby, available Surface Hub and add it to the meeting from the pre-join screen. The personal device will automatically join the meeting in content-only mode with mics and speakers muted, allowing the Surface Hub to provide audio and video for the meeting, without echo or feedback. By default, an invite to the meeting will appear on the device. However, customers can change the settings on the Surface Hub to enable auto accept.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Microsoft Teams pre-join screen.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/213835i87EA8ACFBB42D526/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Microsoft Teams pre-join screen.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Teams pre-join screen with Surface Hub available as another join option\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Microsoft Teams pre-join screen with Surface Hub available as another join option</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Live captions are now available for collaboration bars</STRONG><BR />Live captions make meetings more inclusive by providing an alternative way for attendees to follow along and engage in the conversation. For people in noisy environments or with different levels of language proficiency, live captions can people follow along more easily.

This functionality is available to all Teams Rooms devices configured with a single display (TV or projector) in the room. This layout is useful for moments when customers want to focus on participants in the meeting or for room configurations with always-on external devices connected via HDMI Ingest. We look forward to delivering additional layouts in the future.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Changle layout on Teams console.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/213841i4E6338199B02F331/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Changle layout on Teams console.png\" alt=\"Change layout selection window on the Microsoft Teams console\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Change layout selection window on the Microsoft Teams console</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Raise hand support for Microsoft Teams Rooms, collaboration bar, and Surface Hub</STRONG><BR />We <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-june-2020/ba-p/1489142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</A> the Raise Hand feature for Teams desktop in June, and are excited to announce that it is now available on Teams Rooms, collaboration bar, and Surface Hub. During a meeting, participants can raise a virtual hand to let people know they want to contribute without interrupting the conversation. To engage this feature, just tap Raise Hand in the meeting controls. Meeting participants will see a notification on the display and the console, that a hand is raised. Once the participant is done speaking, they can tap on the control again to lower their hand.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Raise Hand in Teams.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/213844iF15CEA57B6001912/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Raise Hand in Teams.png\" alt=\"Raise Hand view on the Microsoft Teams Rooms console (left) and on the Surface Hub (right)\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Raise Hand view on the Microsoft Teams Rooms console (left) and on the Surface Hub (right)</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Adjust default volume for in-room speakers</STRONG><BR />Microsoft Teams Rooms support a wide variety of audio peripherals that can be used across all space sizes.

Customers will now be able to manage their Teams Rooms in the same place as their collaboration bars and Teams phones. Additionally, we added new features enabling IT admins to simplify, customize, and automate Teams device management. Admins can now perform all the device management tasks, including enrollment, inventory management, software updates, and inspecting device health from a single location. For customers who rely on partners for device management, they can now delegate administration directly through the Partner Center, while ensuring secure authorized device access.

Incentives App template for Teams lets you gamify Adoption &amp; Change management activities.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>You might be asking why we are talking about gamification with regards to organizational change management. When rolled out properly, gamification could provide a structure to your users for the new skills they need to learn. Any new process or system rollout requires employees to unlearn some old behaviors and learn new behaviors and skills, but the traditional rollout and training activities gives them the perception that a change is being forced upon them. Gamification gives them the control to make those behavior changes at their pace. A sense of “competition” with their peers keeps them engaged and motivated.</P>\n<P><BR />The ability to be recognized for their achievements (however big or small) is universal. The recognition may be a position on the leaderboard, small monetary rewards (gift cards, free coffee, etc.), or perhaps lunch with a dynamic leader of the organization. <STRONG>Incentives Power App</STRONG> can be used for rewarding employees for learning new skills to be more productive, which ultimately impacts the entire organization.</P>\n<P><BR />We are happy to share that we have rolled out an <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#incentives-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Incentives Power Apps based template</A> that allows management and tracking of incentives to encourage employee participation in desired activities. As with all the other <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app templates</A>, this is an open-source production-ready app template that can be deployed quickly to complement your adoption and change management activities.</P>\n<P><BR />Using the Incentives app template in Microsoft Teams, admins can establish adoption activities with points, assign points for completion, create rewards, and specify required eligibility point levels for rewards.&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"1_Incentives_CreateNewIncentiveCode.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/186729i5D8E5761F1DE3EE4/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"1_Incentives_CreateNewIncentiveCode.gif\" alt=\"1_Incentives_CreateNewIncentiveCode.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Employees can use the app to view their accumulated points, track their position on a leaderboard, and upon reaching eligibility, request and claim rewards.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"2_Incentives_CollectPoints.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/186730i29692AD593EA3D66/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"2_Incentives_CollectPoints.gif\" alt=\"2_Incentives_CollectPoints.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As an example, let’s say you use this for rolling out Microsoft Teams within your organization. You can create activities like “Attend a local roadshow”, “Join a live event (townhall) about the upcoming changes”, “Attend a training session on effective meetings in Teams” and so on… On completion of each activity users can collect points and compete for a position on the leaderboard.</P>\n<P><BR />I used MS Teams rollout as an example but as you have envisioned by now, the same app could be leveraged for coordinating any other system or process change like a new HR system, switching to new project management templates or perhaps as part of your go-green initiatives. Key is to remember this is a tool that can be used to setup the activities and behaviors you want to encourage. Don’t forget to provide the right level of motivation (leaderboard, physical gifts, recognition amongst executives etc.) for your employees.</P>\n<P><BR />The app is built using Power App with SharePoint as the backend. All ofAll the activity and rewards configuration is stored in SharePoint lists. The “Admin” view within the app provides the ability for program owners to setup the activities and rewards directly from within the App. Since this is built using our no-code/low-code Power Platform, it lends itself really well to branding or functional changes.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>The App draws its inspiration from the <A href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-platform-phil-barnett/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engagement App</A> built to support the transformation program and get employees excited about the changes at Europe’s largest managed medicine services provider.</STRONG> A big shoutout to Phil Barnett (Account Technology Strategist) for building the initial prototype of this app for Nova Healthcare.</P>\n<P><BR /><FONT color=\"#333333\"><FONT size=\"4\"><EM>“The NOVA Engagement PowerApp is one of the first fruits of that partnership and has proved very popular with colleagues.

The list below notes some of the Connector’s more noteworthy limitations, but this list should not be considered exhaustive:</P>\n<OL>\n<LI><STRONG>Calculated Columns – </STRONG>DirectQuery connectors in general have limited support for calculated columns in Power BI. While some calculated columns may work with the Connector, these should be considered exceptions. As a general rule, calculated columns will not function.</LI>\n</OL>\n<OL start=\"2\">\n<LI><STRONG>Aggregations – </STRONG>The CQD data model is built on a cube model, meaning that aggregations are already supported in the form of measures. Attempting to manually add aggregations to different dimensions or changing the aggregation type of a measure will not work with the Connector, and it will generally result in an error.</LI>\n</OL>\n<OL start=\"3\">\n<LI><STRONG>Custom Visuals – </STRONG>While the Microsoft Call Quality Power BI Connector does work with a range of custom visuals, we are unable to guarantee compatibility with all custom visuals. Many custom visuals rely on the use of calculated columns or imported data, neither or which are supported by DirectQuery connectors.</LI>\n</OL>\n<OL start=\"4\">\n<LI><STRONG>Referencing Cached Data – </STRONG>Power BI currently does not support referencing cached data from a DirectQuery connector in any way. Any attempt to reference the results of a query will result in a new query.</LI>\n</OL>\n<OL start=\"5\">\n<LI><STRONG>Relative Data Filtering – </STRONG>Is supported in the Call Quality Power BI Connector, but only with the <EM>Start Time</EM> and <EM>End Time</EM> dimensions. Although the <EM>Date</EM> dimension may be the obvious choice for relative date filtering, <EM>Date</EM> is not stored as a date time object and thus does not support relative date filtering in Power BI.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>Please note, although the Connector is in preview, these limitations are unlikely to change with the final release of the Connector. Most of these issues are either restrictions to DirectQuery connector design in Power BI or fundamental to the design of the CQD data model.</P>\n<P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>Error Codes</STRONG></P>\n<P>Because the Microsoft Call Quality Power BI Connector is less restricted than the browser app in terms of kinds of queries you can construct, you may occasionally encounter a number of errors while building your queries. In the event that you receive an error message of the type “CQDError. RunQuery – Query Execution Error”, reference the list below with the ErrorType number provided in order to troubleshoot the possible issue with the query. The following are the most common Error Type codes you may encounter with the CQD Power BI Connector:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><STRONG>ErrorType 1 - Query Structure Error: </STRONG>A query structure error is typically caused by the Connector failing to build a properly formatted query. This happens most often when using unsupported functionality, as specified in the Limitations above. Double check that you are not using any calculated columns or custom visuals for that query.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>ErrorType 2 - Query Building Error: </STRONG>A query building error is caused by the Call Quality Power BI Connector being unable to properly parse the query you are attempting to build. This happens most often when using unsupported functionality, as specified in the Limitations above. Double check that you are not using any calculated columns or custom visuals for that query.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>ErrorType 5 - Execution Timeout: </STRONG>The query has reached the maximum possible runtime before timing out. Try adding more filters to the query in order to limit its scope. Narrowing the data range is often the most effective way to achieve this.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>ErrorType 7 - No Measurements Error: </STRONG>CQD queries require a measure in order to function. Double check that your query includes measure. Measures in the Call Quality Power BI Connector are denoted by the aggregation (sum) symbol before their name.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>If you encounter any additional errors outside of this scope, please notify the CQD team so that we can help troubleshoot the issue and update the documentation as appropriate.</P>\n<H3 id=\"best-practice\">Best practice</H3>\n<P>Call Quality connector queries should be designed with drillthrough functionality in mind. Instead of trying to load all the data at once, and then slicing down with filters, start with broader, low-cardinality queries and drill down to high-cardinality queries. For instance, when attempting to diagnose which subnets contribute most to quality issues, it's helpful to first identify those regions and countries which contribute to the problem, then drill down to the subnets in that region or country. The Call Quality connector templates have been designed in this manner in order to act as an example.</P>\n<P><STRONG>Other useful best practice links:&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P><A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/power-bi-optimization\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/power-bi-optimization</A> <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/directquery-model-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/directquery-model-guidance</A>&nbsp;</P>\n<H2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently asked questions</H2>\n<H3 id=\"why-does-the-connector-seem-slower-compared-to-advanced-cqd-in-the-browser-what-can-i-do-to-improve-performance\">Why does the connector seem slower compared to Advanced CQD in the browser? What can I do to improve performance?</H3>\n<P>Query performance for the various templates is actually the same in both the browser and in the connector. Just like any other standalone app, Power BI adds its authentication and rendering time to our performance. In addition, the difference comes in the number of concurrent queries being run. Because the in-browser version of CQD had less well-developed and information-dense visualization options, most of our reports were limited to loading 2-3 queries at a time. On the other hand, the connector templates often display 20+ concurrent queries. If you wish to build reports that are just as responsive as the older ones you were used to, try creating reports with no more than 2-3 queries per tab.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Footnotes</STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG><SUP>1 </SUP></STRONG>Certain processes and apps (e.g. OneDrive) may cause your Documents root folder to change; make sure that the <EM>Power BI Desktop\\Custom Connectors</EM> directory is placed inside of the current root folder Documents folder.</P>\n<P><STRONG><SUP>2 </SUP></STRONG>The login credentials you use for CQD <EM>do not</EM> need to be the same credentials you use for logging into the Power BI Desktop app itself.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"1\">Copyright 2020 Microsoft Corporation</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT size=\"1\">Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT size=\"1\">The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT size=\"1\">THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It helps organizations build and refine product strategy and focus their energies on innovation that addresses a need or a challenge. The importance of customer feedback cannot be overstated and yet there aren’t many businesses that capture this feedback systematically.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could capture actionable feedback in real time when the customer was in your store and understand what they liked or didn’t like? Would it be helpful if you could capture feedback from a passenger that rode the 5 PM train to get home or the person that walked into your store looking for a laptop but left without making a purchase? And who better to capture that feedback than your Firstline staff that works directly with your customers? Your Firstline workers – retail associates in your organization, service technicians, flight crew members, guest services etc. – are the backbone of your organization and the voice of your customer. With almost 80% of the global workforce comprised of Firstline workers, that is a huge untapped resource that can be leveraged to glean insights that can help grow your business.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The new <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#associate-insights-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Associate Insights App template</A> for Microsoft Teams helps you empower your employees to capture customer opinion &amp; sentiment quickly and securely. Built using our low-code/no-code Power Platform, this app offers an easy way for your Firstline staff to capture customer feedback. The collected data can be shared with your Executives &amp; strategy teams for product or service improvements so you can focus on the right thing – delighting your customers and providing them with an exceptional experience.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As a Teams Admin, you can pin this app for everyone to Teams App bar using <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Setup policies</A> or set it up to show as a Tab in your store Team. This gives your workers an easy access to the app. Built with your Firstline workers in mind, the app has a mobile friendly layout. Once they complete their customer transaction or at the end of their shift, the app allows them to capture key customer feedback quickly.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"1.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190124i1D6982327BA94C96/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"1.png\" alt=\"1.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The app uses SharePoint as the backend.

Built by Voice of Customer and Operations team at Microsoft Stores, it provides an opportunity to gain deep customer insights by tapping into the direct connection of 3500+ retail associates with our customers. A big shoutout to Gopal Ravi and Jeff Gvillo, from the Microsoft Store team, for bringing this app to life.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-30px\"><EM>“Prior to this app, the process of capturing customer feedback was email-based.

And remember to close the loop with your staff. The process works only if your staff knows that the feedback is being acted upon. So, work with your staff and train them appropriately on data collection and overcommunicate on insights collected and actions taken.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As with all the other <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app templates</A>, this is an open-source production-ready app template that can be deployed as-is quickly or rebranded and adapted to meet your business needs easily.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Test drive the app template <A href=\"https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-associateinsights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A> and check out the full catalog of production ready app templates <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We would love to hear how you plan to leverage this app within your organization and look forward to your feedback!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 11 May 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190124i1D6982327BA94C96/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"e96296c53f478a0b7511567069729137","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-43-946_72542644876e7687.webp","destWidth":999,"destHeight":562,"sourceBytes":166997,"destBytes":24952,"author":"Pawan Gulati","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190124i1D6982327BA94C96/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-43-946_72542644876e7687.webp","https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190126iCDE4F4E2540FDDCE/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-57-11-469_aef711619e9511fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401921},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"Four more reasons to love apps in Microsoft Teams","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/four-more-reasons-to-love-apps-in-microsoft-teams/ba-p/1119114","description":"<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Microsoft Teams can help you streamline your productivity tasks and critical business processes when you integrate your apps and workflows – whether that’s tracking student grades, re-stocking supplies, or giving employees the tools and resources they need to manage their careers.&nbsp; We are constantly working to improve the apps experience – from finding the right app to making it readily accessible when you need it –&nbsp; and are excited to share four more reasons to love apps in Teams!</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">1.&nbsp;Easily find the apps you need</FONT></STRONG><BR />Thanks to the integrated search in the app store flyout, it has never been easier to find the exact app that you’re looking for.&nbsp; When you click the “…” on the Teams app bar, you’ll see a grid of apps and can simply type the app name that you’re looking for into the search bar.&nbsp; You can also search apps that support <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">messaging extensions</A> by clicking the “…” in the message bar , and searching for your app - only those apps that support message extensions will appear here.&nbsp; <BR /></FONT></DIV>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Microsoft Teams/1.

One key trend has been the rise of virtual meetings, as companies look to maintain their rhythm of business and keep human connections while working remote. However, as the volume of meetings increase, teams face challenges with management, efficacy, and engagement. To overcome some of these challenges, we’ll highlight a few popular Teams app integrations that can help you drive effective meetings while working remote.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Streamline agenda preparation and meeting management</FONT></STRONG><BR />Effective meetings require more than corralling a group together to discuss – it requires thoughtfulness around agenda preparation, clarity on objectives, and defined sets of action items. An easy path to plan a successful meeting is to consider apps that streamline the agenda preparation and meeting management process.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>SoapBox</STRONG> simplifies the agenda preparation and management process by allowing teams to build, collaborate, and action team meeting agendas without leaving their workspace in Teams. Using its bot and tabs, teams have a single integrated workspace where they can build agenda items, capture meeting minutes, and monitor resolution of action items – removing the administrative hurdles typically experienced with meeting management.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"soap2.gif\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197046iDF94C0352CF346B7/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"soap2.gif\" alt=\"soap2.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Collaborate with shared meeting agendas</STRONG><BR />Build agendas collaboratively by adding items to a shared agenda – reinforcing teamwork and helping ensure each attendee is fully aligned and aware of the scope and objectives of the meeting. You can also access an inventory of suggested agenda items that can be used as a supplement. Teams notifications are surfaced each time agenda items are added, closed, and reminders are sent for upcoming meetings to ensure accountability across the team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Manage your meetings, capture minutes, and assign action items</STRONG> <BR />As your meeting gets underway, tick off agenda items as you cover them, so that you know what items remain outstanding. Any agenda items not covered automatically roll over into your next meeting in the series, as needed. You can also capture meeting minutes and action items from within the app, so that team members have a central repository in Teams to access.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Access AI-powered insights from the conversations you’re having with your team</STRONG><BR />Using machine learning, SoapBox can decipher the topics you’re discussing most (and least) frequently across all your meetings. Based on your meeting insights, it will serve up suggested questions and reading materials that will help you better prepare and balance future meetings.</P>\n<P><BR />Learn more about <A href=\"https://soapboxhq.com/integrations/microsoft-teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoapBox for Teams</A> and its offering plans and how it can help you plan and manage effective meetings!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Increase engagement and human connection with visual communication</STRONG></FONT><BR />Keeping your teams engaged and connected can be a struggle – especially with a screen taking the place of a person. <STRONG>Prezi Video</STRONG> helps address these challenges by letting you overlay your visuals directly on screen next to you, making meetings engaging and bringing back the human connection element that’s missing in remote work. By putting you and your content together on the same screen – you create a natural, human interaction with your audience and make the meeting more impactful.</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO vid=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S8ZxxCFcg8&amp;feature=emb_title\" align=\"center\" size=\"large\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_S8ZxxCFcg8/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Maintaining the human connection with your team</STRONG><BR />Meetings are effective when attendees are engaged and have a connection with the presenter. When you remove that engagement by speaking behind material, you lose that human connection and begin to lose your audience’s full attention. With Prezi Video, you strengthen that connection with your team by keeping you and your content together on the same screen for a powerful presentation experience. Attendees remain engaged throughout the live video meeting and can engage in real-time collaboration – creating an effective presentation experience for the entire team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Send useful pre-recorded, asynchronous updates</STRONG> <BR />When live meetings aren’t needed or aren’t feasible, you can create a quick video update to share directly in your Teams channel, helping your team stay up to date without interrupting their workflow with asynchronous communication. Easy integration of your must-have information and graphics into your video screen means that team members can share and discuss key data at a time that works best for them.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Balance time and productivity</STRONG><BR />Without requiring a designer, you can create stunning videos with pre-made templates and high-quality images available on Prezi Video and save precious meeting time for more impactful discussions or even cancel a meeting entirely by sending a video and having the discussion in your team's channel instead, saving everyone time.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Learn more about <A href=\"https://prezi.com/video/works-with/ms-teams-business/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-teams-integration&amp;utm_content=pv-msteams-bus-landing-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prezi Video for Teams</A> to get started for free and see how it can help you create powerful visual communications!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Energize your meetings with interactive challenges</FONT></STRONG><BR />Sometimes meetings just need a jolt to keep attendees engaged. Consider introducing short interactive challenges in the middle of a meeting to inject some energy. <STRONG>Kahoot!</STRONG> is a game-based learning platform that makes it easy to create, share, and play learning challenges (kahoots). Whether it’s business-focused or for fun, you can gamify the meeting experience to increase attention and engagement. With its recent integration with Teams, meeting hosts can present live kahoots during meetings or assign self-paced challenges after meetings.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Kahoot MS Teams.gif\" style=\"width: 600px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197047i72100EAD54567E66/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Kahoot MS Teams.gif\" alt=\"Kahoot MS Teams.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Launch a live challenge in your Teams meeting</STRONG><BR />Host live kahoots during a meeting to keep your attendees engaged and energized. Whether you’re looking to kick off the meeting with an ice breaker, facilitating Q&amp;A, or gathering feedback – you can quickly access your kahoots within Teams and share your screen to allow participants to join. You can also import your PowerPoint slides into your kahoot to gamify your existing presentations.

You’ve probably seen it by now; everyone is united in a virtual space as if in a theater instead of being separated in boxes.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>On one level, Together mode is a simple approach to making meetings feel better during the pandemic, however there’s also a deeper level that touches on our latest scientific understandings of cognition, social perception, and communication.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode has a unique look, but it also has a unique feel. People typically become more relaxed, more attentive to one another, more playful, and yet more focused on shared goals. The design offers unique benefits: less fatigue from frequent video meetings, better sense of connection with others, and more effective meetings.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Here are my thoughts on how to get the most of Together mode.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"MicrosoftTeams-image (8).png\" style=\"width: 557px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/204963iAB3CB6691D4EC01E/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"MicrosoftTeams-image (8).png\" alt=\"MicrosoftTeams-image (8).png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">When to use it:</FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>The initial design has been optimized to help people during the pandemic. For now, Together mode is ideal when each person is in front of a webcam in a different location. We are exploring how the design can evolve to support conference rooms and other situations.&nbsp;</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Together mode is especially well-suited to calls in which multiple people will speak; we find that it’s easier and more comfortable for people to find moments to enter a conversation.</LI>\n<LI>Together mode helps when you must go to a lot of video meetings. Most users report less meeting fatigue.</LI>\n<LI>Together mode is helpful when a group might have trouble staying attentive, for instance in education settings.</LI>\n<LI>Together mode supports presenters who need to “read the room” or get energy from attendees.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>When to not use it:</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>If you need to show physical content in your environment, such as a physical whiteboard, then Together mode is not the best choice right now, because it only brings you, not your environment, into the shared space.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The first version of Together mode isn’t optimized to share the screen with PowerPoint presentations. If a PowerPoint presentation is the main event and will take up the entire time of a meeting, Together mode might not be helpful.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Works best when users are not walking around or otherwise moving the camera or screen during the session. It looks weird, like you’re jumping around in your seat.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode is more engaging than a typical video chat, and therefore more distracting from potentially unsafe tasks like driving. You might think, why even bother urging people not to video chat while driving? I wish I could say that I never see people trying to do it! Don’t, please.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The initial release of Together mode supports up to 49 people at a time optimally. Together mode might still be the best choice for a meeting with more than 49 participants, but that will depend on many details about how the meeting is conducted. Best practices for large meetings in Together mode are still emerging.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>An itsy-bitsy introduction to the science behind Together mode:</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>People in Together mode know where others are in a shared virtual space. That means your brain can keep track of what other people are signaling or emoting in a natural way, relying on social/spatial perception; people can intuitively signal each other nonverbally. In a grid, you don’t know where other people are on the screen, relative to you, from their point of view, so natural glances and other subtle cues are impossible.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode creates a shared space in which people are not separated by barriers. Being in overlapping space can lead to silly behavior, as when people “high five”, but there is also a significant benefit. People pay attention to each other more and can gain a better sense of a shared stake in the situation and a shared journey. Constructive behavior signals a level of commitment that isn’t signaled when goofy behavior isn’t even possible.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode creates a usable illusion that the eye contact problem has been mitigated. (Eye contact is a classic problem in video conferencing; people appear to be looking in the wrong direction.) The illusion is based on the unique geometry; everyone is looking at the whole group through a big virtual mirror. The geometry feels natural, yet it turns out that the human brain isn’t great at tracking where someone else is looking within it. Once direct eye contact errors become hard to detect, people intuitively position themselves to look as if they are reacting to one another appropriately.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Best Practices for using Together mode:</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>It might seem strange to see yourself in the group at first, but that is what allows for the improved understanding of interpersonal signals. Don’t turn off your camera! For example, being a teacher seated with your students might look odd at first, but you’ll probably find that you understand the students better and they pay more attention to you when everyone can see the attention signals passing between all present.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>While the initial release works best when everyone has the camera turned on, we are working to support voice only participants at an equal level as well as all types of ability.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>But what if you’re shy, and prefer to leave the camera off? I’m often shy too. I ask you to keep an open mind and experiment at whatever pace is comfortable. In our early research, we are seeing people leave the camera on more often in Together mode than in traditional grid designs, and they report that the experience was pleasant. One thing to keep in mind is that when people become more able to interact expressively, then appearance matters proportionately less. If people are paying more attention to what you say and indicate non-verbally, then they’re paying less attention to how you look.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>When a group tries Together mode for the first time, or even when someone sees a picture of it for the first time, the first reactions are often light-hearted. Would playfulness get in the way of people understanding that there are important benefits to the design? After all, Teams is for productivity. It isn’t Xbox.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>After observing and analyzing many sessions, I’ve come to a new opinion. Playfulness is not a waste of time, even for adults. It is not a bug in human nature, but rather a fine-tuned process crafted over deep evolutionary time that transcends species. It is how we learn to interact with new people, how we build trust and comfort, and how we investigate our environment (consider Together mode as a new part of our environment.) I have stopped trying to get newbie groups to get right to business. Instead I wait for them to get initial, playful reactions out of their systems, and then meetings go wonderfully. It’s not that simple, actually; I sometimes still chastise them during the playful phase because it’s fun to watch people rebel against my exhortations.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>What about the physical setup: the monitors, cameras, and so on?</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>Together mode works fine if you’re sloppy about where the camera, screens, and windows are placed, but here are some tips on how to get the most out of it.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The feature shows you how you present to others, and how you interact with them. People might see your head turn subtly to respond to them, for instance. If you put Together mode in a little window off to the side on a big monitor, then people will see you looking to that side a lot, which can look out of place; that means that they will not get as much in the way of appropriate head turning cues from you. Therefore, Together mode works best if the window containing it is placed straight ahead, in front of you, and takes up all or most of your screen.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode works great on big monitors. I love using it on a Surface Studio. Some people have built up impressive multi-monitor setups for working from home. If you’re one of those people, please place the Together mode window on the same screen where the camera is centered and try to put boring content on your other screens during your meeting. If you look over to the side at a different monitor a lot, it can look a little off. If you want to track mail or text chat during a session, try placing the Together mode window at the top of the screen, centered under the camera, with other windows below it. Then people will see you looking down instead of to the side, which works better.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Together mode works best on a screen that is at least as big as a tablet; it is not optimized for phones right now, although they can work if you prop them up to face you at a head-on angle and aren’t moved around during the meeting. If you use a phone, please try to get the phone and you positioned so that other people can see you looking straight ahead, into the camera, through the duration of the meeting. Once again: much better if the phone is stationary.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Best if the camera is centered, which is true for almost all built-in cameras on laptops and PCs. Together mode looks bigger on tablets when the tablet is positioned horizontally, but then the camera is often off to the side, depending on the tablet’s design, so you might want to position your tablet vertically. Then the view will be smaller, but you won’t be seen looking to the side as much,</P>\n<P>The first release of Together mode doesn’t have a reserved seating feature, so if you leave the meeting, you might come back in a different seat, which will disorient other people who thought they knew where to find you. This might not sound important, but the process of spatial/social perception is not entirely conscious, so the disruption can be jarring. Please try to stay in the call the whole time instead of dipping in and out. The design of Together mode will evolve - as will these tips - as new use scenarios are supported.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Because people intuitively adjust themselves to look like they fit well in the virtual space, you might find that you can use Together mode to trick yourself into having better posture. Just tilt the camera - or the camera+screen, if they are the same device – up a little. Then you might find that you raise your frame to look properly seated in Together mode.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We are learning a lot from customers about how to make meetings more engaging and effective; we have many more ideas. We would love for you to try out the first release of Together Mode and let us know what you think to help us shape what comes next. We are in this together.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>I know I speak for the many people at Microsoft who have contributed to Together mode when I say we hope you find increased well-being and productivity as you use the new Teams, and maybe even a little fun during difficult times.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>-Jaron Lanier</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 04:56:33 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/204963iAB3CB6691D4EC01E/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"881bbb591d930a2b9ca388ffd50564de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-43-921_e0f2c367a5c02ac6.webp","destWidth":557,"destHeight":367,"sourceBytes":394060,"destBytes":26802,"author":"JaronLanier","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/204963iAB3CB6691D4EC01E/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-43-921_e0f2c367a5c02ac6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401919},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"What’s New in Microsoft Teams | April 2020","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-april-2020/ba-p/1347929","description":"<P>As businesses and schools around the world prioritize remote work for the safety and well-being of their employees and students, Microsoft Teams is playing a critical role in helping them stay connected through video meetings, calls, and chats.

Suffolk employees can easily monitor updates on the latest guidance concerning the virus and provide valuable feedback to leadership.

Not everyone is interested in everything and it becomes tricky to find the information quickly. This forces employees to switch context between applications or deal with the specialists / subject matter experts directly which causes frustration for both.</P>\n<P>An FAQ bot can solve the problem and with <A href=\"https://www.qnamaker.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft’s QnA Maker tool</A> it is simple to create a powerful chatbot rather quickly without writing a single line of code. However, there are two areas of opportunity to better the experience for employees:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><STRONG>Meet employees where they live</STRONG><STRONG>:</STRONG> The best place for providing support is in the moment when one needs help. When employees spend most of their time collaborating and working within Teams – it makes sense to surface that information within Teams so that there is no costly context switching.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Bring in a human in complex scenarios:</STRONG> Employee needs for information are so varied that it is impossible to handle every scenario. It negatively impacts employee experience when the bot fails, and the employee doesn’t have anywhere else to go to. Therefore, there needs to be an easy way to bring a human in the loop when that happens.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>We’re excited to bring to you the FAQ Plus app template that capitalizes on both the areas of opportunities above to deliver a rich employee experience. In addition, creating your own employee facing bot using the template requires no coding and deploys in minutes.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Here’s how it works:</P>\n<P>Let’s say you’ve used the template to create a Teams adoption bot that answers all employee questions on using Teams while you’re rolling Teams in your organization.</P>\n<P>Now the employee has a question about a new Teams feature and needs instant help. It is as easy as asking a friend through a quick chat message.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"FAQ Plus End user.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/130358iFF25FE703AC80C62/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"FAQ Plus End user.gif\" alt=\"FAQ Plus End user.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Change of any kind is hard and it requires careful hand-holding and human support. With this template it becomes simple to bring a human in the loop when the bot can’t help. If the employee has a question that the bot couldn’t help with – instead of having a dead-end with the bot – it is able to bring a human in the loop seamlessly! It posts a real time notification in the Team of subject matter experts using which the experts can directly provide help in the moment.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"FAQ Plus Experts View.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/130359i08BAECABE5CEECAA/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"FAQ Plus Experts View.gif\" alt=\"FAQ Plus Experts View.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>What’s so powerful about this experience is that one – it delights employees by providing help when and where they need it; two – by posting real time in the experts team, it is helping the team get real time feedback and gets the process on the path of continual improvement without requiring expensive and cumbersome context switching for experts – a true win-win.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Finally, as a bonus, there is lightweight ticketing built within the experts’ team experience so managing incoming influx of requests becomes easy and contextual. For example, I can quickly see a list of requests assigned to me or look at all unassigned request – all within the same team, without having to go to a separate application.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>There are so many ways this template can be used to deliver delightful employee experiences. A few that we believe are particularly suitable include HR FAQs, IT Helpdesk and Change management for new internal initiatives.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As with all app templates, these are open-source production ready apps that don’t require writing any line of code, deploy to Teams in minutes and are easily customizable in branding and functionality.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"3\">We’d love for you to give this a try – Build your powerful bot today by following this <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#faq-plus\" target=\"_self\">link</A> and share with us your feedback <A href=\"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2_7qFm_lcZAr4eqEhnLsZ9UMVZGT1lCT0FXUDdZMUM0RkpBS1BESTAwWC4u\" target=\"_self\">here</A>.</FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Also see:</STRONG></P>\n<P><A href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2FmsUVXyhg&amp;t=39s\" target=\"_self\">Demo video of FAQ Plus App Template</A></P>\n<P><A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates\" target=\"_self\">Other useful App Templates for employee productivity scenarios</A></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2019 19:06:59 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/130358iFF25FE703AC80C62/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"268086008000ba4b0157d2b0e55494bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-54-388_5b929d67721e418c.webp","destWidth":999,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":397424,"destBytes":320198,"author":"NidhiShandilya","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/130358iFF25FE703AC80C62/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-56-54-388_5b929d67721e418c.webp","https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/130359i08BAECABE5CEECAA/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-59-02-278_41faa6c8f4eaa4e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401928},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"Teams and Skype Inter/Op now available","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/teams-and-skype-inter-op-now-available/ba-p/1469083","description":"<P>As noted in the <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-may-2020/ba-p/1423015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What’s New in Microsoft Teams | May 2020</A> blog, we recently started rolling out Teams and Skype Inter/Op. Today we are happy to share the roll out is complete – Teams users can now chat and call millions of Skype users around the world.</P>\n<P><BR />We know there is a large ecosystem of small and medium businesses using Skype as their collaboration tool. Many of our Microsoft 365 customers value being able to do business with this ecosystem. Scenarios such as securely communicating with vendors, suppliers, contractors, project managers and HR interviews are just some of the reasons why this is important. Usage is growing with thousands of messages being sent every day.</P>\n<P><BR />Remote workers using Teams will also be pleased to know we support this on a variety of devices: mobile (Android and iOS), Web, Windows, and Mac. For an optimal Skype experience, we recommend version 8.58 and later. We also are targeting support for Teams Phones by the end of June.</P>\n<P><BR />Let’s understand the capabilities that are supported.</P>\n<P><BR /><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Teams Users searching for Skype Users</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>It starts with Teams or Skype users wanting to collaborate together directly. Teams users can invite a Skype colleague by using the search bar or simply start a chat. The Skype user then accepts the request and both users can chat, call or share video. Alternatively, the Skype user can also block the request if they so choose.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"1.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199104i2B7A390AB7C1CD60/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"1.jpg\" alt=\"1.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Skype users searching for Teams users</STRONG></FONT><BR />Skype users can reach out to collaborate by sending a request. The Teams user is warned this is an external user and then they can accept or block.

It is encrypted at rest and in transit so both parties can securely communicate. Today simple text is supported but we are looking at enhancing that based on feedback. And it’s easy to add audio and/or video to the chat for a full collaborative calling experience.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"3.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199106i337F131664BCF980/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"3.png\" alt=\"3.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Easily Managed by Users and Admins</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P><STRONG>Individual Teams users</STRONG> can easily block any requests with a simple right-click. This lets them control which Skype users they will collaborate with.</P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Teams Administrators</STRONG> can also easily control usage at the tenant level. A single switch can be set to off and block all Skype users from communicating with tenant users. And for admins who prefer PowerShell this is easy to configure as well.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"4.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199108i638152615ECE2E9C/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"4.png\" alt=\"4.png\" /></span></P>\n<P><BR />If you have Teams deployed in your organization and need to provide access to Skype users, please give it a try.

Teams is where people come together to plan, collaborate, share, discuss, decide and take action on things that matter to their businesses and productivity. Teams as the collaboration hub also plays a central role in enterprises today among strategy and planning group members who keep a close eye on all facets of the business including competition.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Recalling what Peter Thiel says “All failed companies are the same: They failed to escape competition.” - in today’s post let’s explore how Microsoft Teams and Power Automate (erstwhile Microsoft Flow) when put together allows strategy teams in an organization keep a close eye on competition’s stock prices – a leading metric of how Wall Street perceives their progress.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>First Things First</STRONG></P>\n<P>Imagine the strategy team in Contoso (our favorite imaginary company) is collaborating on Microsoft Teams using their private workspace as follows. Among other things, Competitive Info is a channel where they keep a close watch on their named competitors, track compete news, discuss impact, market perception etc.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"Vishrut Shukla_0-1582037157214.png\" style=\"width: 270px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/171669i410F2DC661C044E1/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Vishrut Shukla_0-1582037157214.png\" alt=\"Vishrut Shukla_0-1582037157214.png\" /></span></P>\n<P><STRONG><BR />The Objective</STRONG></P>\n<P>Strategy team often checks ups and downs in their competitors’ stock prices.

Finance</A> and preparing a report for the rest of the team to consume. One of the strategy team members (that’s me!) wants to automate this repetitive task and imagine a world where periodic tracking of compete stock prices happen, essentially getting notifications about stocks once every 12 hours.<BR /><BR /></P>\n<P>I intend to use Power Automate flow inside Microsoft Teams for the same.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Identifying the basic ingredients</STRONG></P>\n<P>Contoso team identifies the following as pieces of this automation puzzle:<BR /><BR /></P>\n<OL>\n<LI><STRONG>List of compete stocks to track</STRONG>: The list of stock symbols to track is maintained in a simple Excel file which can be edited by anyone in the team making it effortless to add/remove competitors from the stock tracking mix.

But beyond this - by providing many ways that apps can integrate, Microsoft Teams is designed to be highly tailored. It can become a customized digital home for your team, well suited for remote work scenarios. Many teams are now fully working remotely. As they adapt, it’s important to keep experimenting in customizing the mix of communication styles and applications to find the right balance for your team.</P>\n<P><BR />Many of the app integrations for Microsoft Team focus on connecting with the apps you’re already using, like ADP or Adobe Creative Cloud. As you design and iterate on remote working to further keep your team culture together and integrated, many solutions within the Microsoft Teams Store are specifically designed to help keep teams working together.</P>\n<P><BR />Over the following weeks, we’ll highlight several categories of applications across whiteboarding, design, development, learning, and more that you can use to keep connected. This week, we’ll cover pulse surveys as a communication style.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Taking a pulse of the team</FONT></STRONG><BR />In-person work provides many informal ways to connect and keep connected – from hallway conversations and watercoolers, to 60 person team meetings where you can ask for formal Q&amp;A. 1 to 1 and group chat can facilitate many of these opportunities, but you may want to consider additional tools to ensure every voice is heard.</P>\n<P><BR />One technique is to consider pulse surveys – small one or two question surveys that are easy to fill out. In v-team meetings that can involve many, a quick poll can provide a low impact way to get the sense of your team – providing the virtual equivalent of taking stock of a room.</P>\n<P><BR />Partner applications integrate with Microsoft Teams capabilities including chat and team spaces to make creating a poll possible in as few as three clicks. Through the compose bar within Microsoft Teams, you can add a quick poll for your team, within you channel and meeting conversations. A quick, non-intrusive poll will frequently elicit responses a normal chat conversation may not. Common applications for quick polling functionality can include Polly, SurveyMonkey, Open Agora, TinyPULSE, and more.</P>\n<P><BR />These applications are becoming more tailored for gathering quick feedback in real-time – SurveyMonkey, for example, has released several updates recently to make their surveys, polls and quizzes even more dynamic and accessible within Microsoft Teams. With multiple question types and live previewing during survey creation, users can launch surveys seamlessly and with the flexibility they need. In addition to powerful analytics within the SurveyMonkey app, you can now access results within Teams channels.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Resultscard.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185112iFF9C07C40A0326D1/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Resultscard.png\" alt=\"Pulse surveys from SurveyMonkey within Microsoft Teams\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Pulse surveys from SurveyMonkey within Microsoft Teams</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Polly also makes it easy to get started with a pulse survey habit – simply add the Polly app to an existing site. Within the compose bar, you can gather quick feedback within your team using Polly.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"teams_weekly_pulse.png\" style=\"width: 841px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185113iD5DAF4F859D88CC1/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"teams_weekly_pulse.png\" alt=\"teams_weekly_pulse.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Staying connected to your team is more important than ever. As with meetings, you can use Polly’s pulse surveys to regularly check in with your team in-channel – for example, a weekly pulse survey at the start or end of week that captures the week’s goals and overall sentiment.</P>\n<P><BR />One common suggestion is to use a rotation of common “pulse” questions for your team, including:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>How are you feeling?</LI>\n<LI>What’s your primary focus this week?</LI>\n<LI>Is anyone blocked in taking their next step?</LI>\n<LI>What are folks doing to learn and grow more this week?</LI>\n<LI>Are there any challenges you’d need help with?</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>The simplest kind of pulse survey is one that simply asks for peoples’ outlook and perspective – for example, Are people are feeling Great/Good/OK/Bad. When asked consistently, week over week this can help provide a perspective around “changes in temperature”.</P>\n<P><BR />Qubie is one application that provides a concise and focused team feedback experience along these lines. Its design as a Team Coach app focuses on delivering a concise input experience – just pick from a status emoji – and channels that feedback into overall team assessments with details and analytics for team leaders.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"qubie.png\" style=\"width: 976px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185114iC2BC51149000A40D/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"qubie.png\" alt=\"qubie.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Whether you are designing your own weekly polls within polling applications, or using an app like Qubie, these questions can be rolled into a weekly assessment for your team, to help foster a habit around team connection and overall feedback assessment.</P>\n<P><BR />As part of connecting teams together, get started in your meetings and team channels to take the pulse of your team. This will help you get a better sense of how your team is doing, and provide ways to collect input from all voices on the team. Within Microsoft Teams, several applications – including SurveyMonkey, Polly, and Qubie – provide a streamlined path to quick Q&amp;A. The diversity and power of these applications will make it easy for you to find just the right style of communication with your team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Learn more!</STRONG></P>\n<P>If you would like to learn how to better use apps in Teams to enhance remote work, see our <A href=\"https://aka.ms/teamsrwapps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remote work Teams apps</A> site with more use cases and ideas, and take advantage of the free virtual training events each week.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>For Teams end-users:</STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>See more related <A href=\"https://aka.ms/teamsrwapps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remote-work apps and scenarios</A> available from our Teams store.</LI>\n<LI>Check out our guide to <A href=\"https://aka.ms/teamsappguide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remote work apps</A></LI>\n<LI>Join a <A href=\"https://aka.ms/LearnTeamsApps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live, instructor-led training session</A> called “Learn to Use Apps in Microsoft Teams.” We’ll show you how to find, install, and leverage the full functionality of some of our most popular apps.</LI>\n<LI>&nbsp;</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><STRONG>For Teams Admins: </STRONG></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Join our <A href=\"https://microsoftteams.eventbuilder.com/ChalkTalksApps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chalk Talk series</A>, where members of Teams engineering walk through the security, deployment, and management of third-party integrations.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185112iFF9C07C40A0326D1/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"2f37ecc97e4f25c1b9a75b7f37014673","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-56-43-521_bc8d089be3232e3c.webp","destWidth":998,"destHeight":610,"sourceBytes":128477,"destBytes":22290,"author":"Mike Ammerlaan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185112iFF9C07C40A0326D1/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-56-43-521_bc8d089be3232e3c.webp","https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185113iD5DAF4F859D88CC1/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-57-22-152_f67033da9d4a92fc.webp","https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/185114iC2BC51149000A40D/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn51@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-57-16-553_a89f672e95fd52fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401922},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"Strengthening team culture – It’s the little things that count","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/strengthening-team-culture-it-s-the-little-things-that-count/ba-p/1015917","description":"<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Technology has the ability to bring people together and build great solutions, and the new Icebreaker bot helps making connections even easier.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The Icebreaker bot is basically a ‘getting to know you’ tool that proactively suggests meet ups between colleagues. People interested in joining these meetings join a group in Teams, and the bot pairs up random people every Monday morning. And then, if you need it to, it can search both your calendars to find mutual available meeting times.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>After having <A href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-teams-new-icebreaker-bot-pairs-co-workers-random-get-know/\" target=\"_self\">read about</A> the Icebreaker bot, Chief Technology Officer Ruan Viljoen at BroadReach Consulting decided to experiment with the <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#icebreaker\" target=\"_self\">Icebreaker bot</A> in his organization. What sparked his attention was that it held the promise to build more personal connections between employees.</P>\n<P>BroadReach has a very diverse and eclectic workforce.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>He therefore decided to run an experiment within the head office, with about 150 employees situated over various floors, to see if it could help break silos. The leadership team is not only focused on performance, but building a culture of growth, innovation and inclusion. If the bot worked, it could help to facilitate a greater sense of team cohesion. So, he deployed it, and invited a few employees to the open Team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"clipboard_image_0.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/157790iF90C7F6CCAAA7C37/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"clipboard_image_0.png\" alt=\"clipboard_image_0.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>Ruan Viljoen, CTO, BroadReach Consulting</P>\n<P><EM>“It was so simple to get started with Icebreaker in Teams! It’s amazing to see how a small initiative deliver big meaningful impact.”</EM></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The experiment was a roaring success. Within a week most employees had joined simply by word of mouth. Ruan himself had a positive experience – he was paired with his direct report, and they realized that they’d not had a chance to grab lunch recently, so they scheduled one. This meeting helped to foster a deep connection.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Other employees within the region were having similar experiences. One employee remarked that at first, he was a bit hesitant to meet the person he’d been paired up with, as they were from different departments and they seldom worked together. However, after the meet-up his outlook changed, and he was pleasantly surprised by the happy and engaged conversation they had.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>An employee from the marketing department met with a colleague from administration that they thought they knew quite well – but the casual nature of this meeting (they decided to go for a walk outside) revealed some interesting tid-bits they didn’t know about each other. This one-time ice breaker walk has evolved into regular walks to get out of the office, get moving and take a break and has snowballed into a lunchtime ‘<EM>walk n talk</EM>’ group!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Given the success of Icebreaker, the team at BroadReach Consulting is now excited to try the rest of the App Templates to make collaborating with team members more fun.

You may be used to protecting email and files in Microsoft 365 and on your mobile devices, but how should you approach security and compliance as you add Teams to the mix? Did you know, for example, that Teams keeps persistent records of chat conversations by default?</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As we enter the new year, we’ll help you answer these top-of-mind questions starting with the latest episode in our Microsoft Teams for IT series on Microsoft Mechanics, dedicated to security and compliance.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO size=\"large\" vid=\"https://youtu.be/91lHNKVVvQ4\" align=\"center\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91lHNKVVvQ4/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Make Microsoft Teams part of your information governance approach </STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>If you’re new to how persistent chat works in Teams, the good news is that you have control over <EM>how</EM> <EM>persistent</EM> chat conversations are. Retention thresholds for chat to can be set to time period as short as 24 hours. In fact, there are a multitude of security and compliance controls that you can apply to Teams chat, meetings and calls. For example, you can <STRONG>disable screen sharing</STRONG> for specific users, or with <STRONG>information barriers</STRONG> via PowerShell, you can prevent illicit communications between different segments of users. In regulated sectors such as Finance, where you may be required to prove the right measures are in place to prevent insider trading, this capability can come in handy.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As you protect your files and emails in Microsoft 365, we help you make Teams another endpoint in your overall security and compliance strategy. This allows the policies that you set universally, inherited from services like SharePoint, OneDrive, and Exchange, to apply to Teams and take advantage of capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention, Advanced Threat Protection, organizational search and in-place hold with eDiscovery, or Communication Compliance to monitor and prevent inappropriate behaviors. You can discover Microsoft 365 controls available to you by reviewing the security and compliance scores for your tenants, which recommend controls that could help increase your scores.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Microsoft makes sure the Microsoft Teams service is secure and compliant in regard to data flow. Data within Microsoft data centers is encrypted at rest and in transit. We keep a robust control framework of more than 1,000 controls to meet the requirements of some of the most rigorous industry regulations and continuously review and add controls as new requirements emerge. In fact, you can find 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party auditor reports for Microsoft 365 and Teams services in the Service Trust Portal at <A href=\"https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aka.ms/STP</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>These are just some of the top ways we keep you secure and compliant with Teams and in this Microsoft Mechanics episode, I’ll walk you through your options and more details.</P>\n<P>You can follow our full playlist at <A href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfDB7VenWuA&amp;list=PLXtHYVsvn_b_JeDjgD5XdkyHTDXdYgPGn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aka.ms/MicrosoftTeamsforIT</A>, which starts with an overview of Microsoft Teams for IT Admins, and with upcoming episodes that will cover how to configure security and compliance controls for Teams, upgrading from Skype for Business, and how to scale end-user adoption.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>If you are in a government cloud service such as the US Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense, and don’t see some of these capabilities available yet, rest assured we are working on it, and you can stay updated at <A href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=DoD%2CGCC%20High%2CGCC%2CMicrosoft%20Teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aka.ms/TeamsGovRoadmap</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Please give us your feedback on other questions you may have or other topics you’d like us to cover and enjoy the new year!</P>\n<P>Nydia</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 17:04:26 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3d556bc7b12651eb21890f60b49fd2f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nydia Cavazos","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401925},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"What’s New in Microsoft Teams | July 2020","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-july-2020/ba-p/1551561","description":"<P><FONT color=\"#000000\">We announced a new set of features earlier this month that make <A href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/reimagining-virtual-collaboration-future-work-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual interactions in Microsoft Teams more engaging and inclusive</A>, along with new capabilities announced at <A href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/21/meeting-experiences-teams-security-capabilities-microsoft-365/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Inspire 2020</A>.

We want you to be able to join these meetings from your Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. At Ignite 2019, we <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-amp-cisco-partner-to-simplify-meetings-and-calling-for/ba-p/971835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</A> a direct guest join capability that would enable meeting room devices to connect to meeting services from other vendors via embedded web technologies. We are excited to announce Direct Guest Join has reached general availability and is available through the latest Microsoft Teams Room app, version <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-release-note#45350-07232020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4.5.35.0</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Through an embedded web experience, you can now use your Teams Rooms devices to join a Cisco Webex meeting. Leveraging this experience, you can use the Teams Room console to interact with the Cisco Webex app and control in-room audio and video devices. Similarly, the Microsoft Teams web experience is also available on web-enabled Cisco Webex devices allowing you to join a Microsoft Teams meeting from a Cisco Webex Room device. While no web experience can offer the same robust feature set as a native Teams meeting experience on a native Teams device, this will reduce the friction you experience when trying to join calls from external partners or clients who may not be using the same meeting service. The direct guest join feature will also be enabled for Zoom Meetings in Microsoft Teams Rooms and Teams Meetings in Zoom Rooms, and is currently in preview.

A common reaction is to shift all rituals and meetings, like the daily standup, online – however, this is a missed opportunity to make full use of the situation to determine 1) whether the meeting was effective in the first place, and 2) whether there are other approaches and tools to enhance the process to fit the current environment and future.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Microsoft Teams and partner app integrations give agile teams the opportunity to experiment with several tools and approaches so they can build an intentional process that fits the needs of their workforce and accomplishes the principles and purpose of a standup.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Using apps in Teams to rethink daily standups</FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>Daily standups even when times were “normal” were difficult to manage – e.g., finding a convenient time to meet, keeping it brief/efficient, and keeping everyone focused and informed. Now add the challenge of managing a completely remote team and you’ve got yourself a tricky situation. Before you shift your standups online, consider experimenting with new ways to make them simpler to manage, more flexible and valuable to your team. Teams and partner app integrations make it easy to experiment and discover what works best for your team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>An asynchronous standup is a great example of an opportunity to explore when your team is remote. Rather than a fixed time each day to sync, members provide their daily update when they can – providing flexibility and time to focus on doing work, as well as a record for tracking. Popular apps like AgilePolly and ScrumGenius automate the coordination, tracking, and reporting of asynchronous standups – making it easy for your teams to stay informed and progressing.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><A href=\"https://www.polly.ai/agile-polly-for-microsoft-teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><STRONG>AgilePolly</STRONG></A> makes it easy for teams to stay in the loop, keep organized and save time by automating standups and team check-ins all while working inside Teams. AgilyPolly handles scheduling the standup series and takes care of sending out questions, collecting/consolidating updates, and displaying progress. Whether using AgilePolly for real-time standups, asynchronously, or both – you will waste less time gathering information and more time problem-solving.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture1.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190768iD628263F8556CA74/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture1.png\" alt=\"Picture1.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><A href=\"https://scrumgenius.com/platforms/microsoft-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ScrumGenius</A></STRONG> enables teams to perform asynchronous remote standups – all without leaving Teams. Check-ins are collated and played back to team members, while the ScrumGenius bot tracks their responses for progress on tasks, goals for the day and blockers. Insights are sent in an email summary report to the team and stakeholders and stored on the dashboard accessible in your Teams tab. From the dashboard, filter historical standup results by individuals, check-in status, or even keyword, to gain a rapid overview of team engagement. ScrumGenius also integrates with popular agile tools such as JIRA, GitHub, and Azure DevOps to match code pushes and issue changes from each team member seamlessly.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture2.png\" style=\"width: 718px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/190769i955FD6ACFD8FF23C/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture2.png\" alt=\"Picture2.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Integrate your task boards directly into your Teams channel</FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>Another key consideration when exploring new opportunities of optimizing your standup is having your task boards available to your team in the place where they collaborate.

While physical meeting rooms may not be a focal point for many right now, there are still organizations and industries whose essential workers continue to rely on these spaces during this time. We also recognize the vital role Microsoft Teams Rooms will play when organizations return to work. To this end, we want to share the latest update for Microsoft Teams Rooms, app version 4.4.41.0, now available on the Windows store and coming to every Microsoft Teams Room over the next few weeks.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This release contains the following features:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Modern authentication support</STRONG></P>\n<P>Microsoft Teams Room administrators can now configure Microsoft Teams Rooms to use modern authentication to connect to Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Skype for Business services. Although Microsoft Teams Rooms already communicate over encrypted channels (such as TLS 1.2), using modern authentication reduces the need to send passwords over the network, leveraging tokens provided by Azure Active directory. To help reduce the potential attack surface, Microsoft Exchange Online will disable basic authentication in the future, as announced in the blog “<A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/improving-security-together/ba-p/805892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Improving Security – Together</A>”. Modern authentication support for Microsoft Teams Rooms will help ensure business continuity for your devices connecting to Exchange Online.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>In light of COVID-19, and to reduce potential impact for existing on-premises customers who may need time to plan and implement hybrid modern authentication, turning on modern authentication will be manual. To learn more about how to set up and use modern authentication, follow the guidance published in <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-authentication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Authentication in Microsoft Teams Rooms</A>.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture1.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/191467i438304CE7F2E2BD5/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture1.png\" alt=\"Picture1.png\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Application splash screen</STRONG></P>\n<P>The new application splash screen improves the startup experience when a Microsoft Teams Room device wakes up from an idle state or the device reboots.

You will be prompted with an option to join on the web, download the Teams client, or join with the native Teams client. We are gradually rolling this out over the coming weeks, and in the interim, you may continue to see this and the former experience.\n</P> \n<P>\n <span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture1.png\" style=\"width: 889px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/194970i0603E909D0CA62E2/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture1.png\" alt=\"Picture1.png\" /></span>\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Easily access meeting options during a Teams meeting\n </STRONG> \n <BR />We are making it easier for meeting organizers to quickly and easily change their presenter and lobby settings once a meeting has started by providing a link directly in the participants pane. This new functionality is available for both scheduled and “Meet Now” meetings.\n</P> \n<P>\n <span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture2.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/194972i65760CB99DAACCB5/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"Picture2.png\" alt=\"Picture2.png\" /></span>\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Download a participant report in a Teams meeting\n </STRONG>\n <BR />Meeting organizers, especially teachers, often need to know who joined their Teams meetings. You can download a participant report, found in the roster view that includes join and leave times for participants. Available in the roster view, meeting organizers can download the report that includes those users who joined while the organizer was present. This feature is only available within the meeting while the meeting is active. Available on desktop (Windows and Mac) and the web.\n</P> \n<P>\n <span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture3.png\" style=\"width: 392px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/194973i3F670DA3FFF8D883/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"Picture3.png\" alt=\"Picture3.png\" /></span>\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Set tenant-wide default selection for \"Who Can Present\" in meetings\n </STRONG>\n <BR />Tenant admins can now update their Teams meeting policies to allow for a new default selection when choosing who can present in new Teams meetings (everyone, people in my organization, specific people, or only me). Today, the default selection is “everyone” unless the meeting organizer selects otherwise through the meetings option configuration. To start, organizations can set this policy via a PowerShell cmdlet, and soon after we will have this policy configurable in the Admin portal.\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Set background effects policy at a user-level\n </STRONG>\n <BR />Tenant admins can soon assign a user-level policy to control how users engage with background effects in Teams meetings. Options include: offer no filters; background blur only; use background blur and default provided images; and all, which includes the ability for users to upload their own custom images.\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Better policy controls over screen sharing from chats\n </STRONG>\n <BR />Screen share from chat allows you to immediately start sharing your screen in a 1-1 chat or group chat. This entry point was previously governed by the AllowPrivateCalling policy. If this policy is disabled, users are not able to screen share from chat. The option to start a screen share from chat will now be governed by the ScreenSharingMode policy. Further, the ability to \"add audio\" to a screen share from chat session (if you want to talk to someone while screen sharing) will be governed by a user's AllowPrivateCalling setting. This ensures that users who have AllowPrivateCalling disabled cannot start audio calls via screen share from chat.\n <BR />\n <span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture5.png\" style=\"width: 763px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/194975i636E3661D7E8C212/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture5.png\" alt=\"Picture5.png\" /></span>\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Teams and Skype Interoperability\n </STRONG> \n <BR />Teams and Skype interoperability will enable collaboration with more partners, customers, and suppliers who rely upon Skype for Consumer (SFC) as their communication app. On either platform, customers will be able to discover users via email search, then chat or call using audio/video. Clients supported include Desktop, Web and Mobile (iOS/Android). Admins will be able to control user access to this feature from The Teams Admin Center.\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Reverse Number Lookup (RNL) Enhancements\n </STRONG>\n <BR />In the past, the caller name sometimes did not show when they called you. Back in October 2019 we released the feature to make it easier to identify the caller. With the latest enhancements to RNL, the Telco display name will now also show up in your Activity Feed, Call History, and Voicemail as well.\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Microsoft Teams Rooms, app version 4.4.41.0 now available\n </STRONG>\n <BR />While physical meeting rooms may not be a focal point for many right now, there are still organizations and industries whose essential workers continue to rely on these spaces during this time. We also recognize the vital role Microsoft Teams Rooms will play when organizations return to work. The latest update, app version 4.4.41.0, is now available on the Windows store and is coming to every Teams room over the next few weeks. New features include: Modern authentication support, New application splash screen, Ability to project content to a single display when using a HDMI cable in a dual display configuration, Support for dynamic emergency calling, and more.

Moving forward, we will restrict the ability to start a meeting to only those users who have been assigned a policy to create a meeting within their organization. Meeting attendees without the ability to create a meeting will see a pre-join screen indicating that the meeting hasn't started. These individuals will be automatically admitted into the meeting once a user with permissions joins and starts the meeting. For example, where teachers are assigned a policy that enables them to create meetings, but students are not: if a student clicks on a Teams meeting not yet started by a teacher, they will be admitted into the meeting once a teacher has started a meeting.\n</P> \n<P>\n &nbsp;\n</P> \n<P>\n <STRONG>\n  Keeping distance learning engaging and secure\n </STRONG>\n <BR />With many school and universities closed for the foreseeable future, Teams supports faculty, educators, and students to connect, engage, and learn.

We are constantly on the go, getting work done from coffee shops, the airport, the couch, and while commuting. And for those in certain lines of work, like retail, healthcare, or many service industries, your phone may be your primary or only device! This is why the Teams experience on your phone is just as crucial as the experience you have on your desktop. We have a whole team at Microsoft focused on optimizing your Teams mobile experience and building features to make your busy lives easier.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>And it’s not just us who love the Teams mobile app. Not to brag… but Teams is a top-rated productivity app on both the <A href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-teams/id1113153706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App Store</A> (4.8) and <A href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp; Play store</A> (4.6). There are <EM>many </EM>reasons to love Teams mobile, but here are a few of our favorites.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>1. Quiet hours &amp; quiet days </STRONG></P>\n<P>It is important to set personal boundaries and optimize your work hours in the way that works best for you and your job. But when we work with teams of people who are spread across time zones, and have different work styles and job duties, there is often someone on our team who is working at all hours of the day. On Teams mobile, you can set “Quiet Hours” (for example, 7PM to 7AM) and “Quiet Days”(for example, Saturday and Sunday) This feature helps you take control over your after-work time and can help relieve stress.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"quiet hours mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 201px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135139i5F70A19A442550C8/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"quiet hours mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"quiet hours mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>2. Share content in a meeting from your cell phone</STRONG></P>\n<P>This feature is a lifesaver when you are away from your desk but still need to present content in a meeting or call. On Teams mobile you can present PowerPoint slides, videos, photos, or even share your phone screen to show someone exactly what you are looking at on your phone.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"share content mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135142i1F69CD602D213BEC/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"share content mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"share content mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>3. Transfer a call from your laptop to your phone</STRONG></P>\n<P>Have you ever had to drop off an important conference call in order to rush to your next appointment, or make sure you would be home in time for dinner? Teams makes it a seamless experience to transfer a call from your PC to your mobile device (or vice versa) without interrupting the flow of your meeting, so you can finish your work while also getting where you need to go (feature coming soon).&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"transfer call mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135144iE56EB76081A51F65/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"transfer call mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"transfer call mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>4. Audio messages </STRONG></P>\n<P>The ability to send audio messages in a chat is a fantastic alternative to typing and is often preferred by people in regions where multiple dialects are spoken. You can send a message when you are on the go, walking or are even cooking. And unlike text, a voice message can help lend your unique personality and tone to the message.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"audio messages mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 201px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135147i2DC9D0CF52F2F0D1/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"audio messages mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"audio messages mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>5. Dark mode</STRONG></P>\n<P>Like the much loved “dark mode” in Windows File Explorer, Office applications, and Teams on your desktop, the Teams mobile app is available in dark mode! Dark mode is a great option for low light environments, reduces strain on some people’s eyes, and is a great battery saver.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"darkmode mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135149iF409E77658174C6B/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"darkmode mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"darkmode mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>6. Integrated Office lens <BR /></STRONG>Using our phones to take and share pictures is already a powerful tool but using the <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-office-lens-f5f6b88d-356f-4037-b7e8-49f34be86db3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Office Lens</A> through Teams takes it to the next level. The Office Lens recognizes when you are taking a photo of a whiteboard or a document and optimizes the picture for that medium— even straightening out the document, or making the whiteboard writing show up more clearly. And you can annotate images with text or by drawing on the image with your finger.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"office lense mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 201px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135151i3ADC0A3F79B9557B/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"office lense mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"office lense mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>7. Re-ordering the bottom bar</STRONG></P>\n<P>Today, our phones often feel like an extension of ourselves; and the ability to customize how your phone is set up is crucial. You can customize your bottom navigation bar with the tools that make the most sense for you, to give you ready access to the tools you need.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"reorder 2 gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135490i8DDF2CB021B14896/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"reorder 2 gif.gif\" alt=\"reorder 2 gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>8. Share Location </STRONG></P>\n<P>The beauty of using Teams on your mobile device is that you can truly be productive while on-the-go and in between working locations. When you are on-site with a customer or en route to a job site you can easily share your physical location with your manager from your Teams mobile app. This is especially important for those in service roles or who need check-in documentation to certain job sites. And since this is done through the Teams mobile app it is secure and compliant.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"share location mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135155iE78AC2463D5CB5A8/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"share location mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"share location mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>9. Triage your notifications with a quick swipe </STRONG></P>\n<P>It’s great to be able to get a jump start on our day before you even get into the office, which is why we love the ability to swipe to mark messages and notifications as read/unread with one easy gesture. Because as we know, there is a big difference between a casual chat conversation that you read on your way into work, and a notification with several items you will need to follow up on.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"activity feed mobile gif.gif\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/135157i1458F6568E18A592/image-size/medium?v=1.0&amp;px=400\" title=\"activity feed mobile gif.gif\" alt=\"activity feed mobile gif.gif\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>10. Easily swap shifts with a co-worker from your phone </STRONG></P>\n<P>When you are a Firstline Worker, something as simple as figuring out your weekly schedule can be a major headache. Instead of having to take a picture of a paper schedule in the break room, manually add your shifts to your own calendar, and then track down the phone number of your co-worker you need to swap shifts with, use Shifts in Teams to manage your schedule and keep in touch with your team! Whether you are a manager creating your team’s schedule, or just trying to remember when you are scheduled to work this week, Shifts in Teams has you covered.

This partnership aligns with both Microsoft and Cisco’s dedication to openness, interoperability and customer choice. It includes three new initiatives to help our customers to get more out of their current investments:<BR /><BR /></P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Cloud Video Interop (CVI)</FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>This partnership enables&nbsp;Cisco&nbsp;Webex&nbsp;video devices to connect to the Microsoft Teams meeting services.&nbsp;Cisco Webex will introduce an interop solution that will be certified as a Microsoft&nbsp;Cloud Video Interop (CVI)&nbsp;solution. This offer&nbsp;will allow Cisco Webex Room devices and SIP video conferencing devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings with a reliable interop experience. This will benefit customers who have asked for Cisco and Microsoft to provide a reliable interop solution to enable their existing Cisco video devices to join Microsoft Teams meetings in a seamless way.&nbsp;This solution is expected to GA in early CY20.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Direct guest join, for meeting room devices</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>Cisco and Microsoft are working together on a new approach that enables meeting room devices to connect to meeting services from other vendors via embedded web technologies. Microsoft and Cisco will be enabling a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>direct guest join capability</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>from their respective video conferencing device to the web app for the video meeting service. This capability will be supported on latest generations of meeting room devices like Microsoft Teams Rooms and Cisco Webex Room devices, which can run embedded web technologies. This solution is expected to GA in early 2020.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Cisco-join-final.gif\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/152740iD4B7EB6587F40F5A/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Cisco-join-final.gif\" alt=\"Microsoft Teams Room joing Cisco Webex Meeting via direct guest join\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Microsoft Teams Room joing Cisco Webex Meeting via direct guest join</span></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Direct Routing for Phone System</STRONG></FONT></P>\n<P>Direct Routing, a feature of Microsoft Phone System, allows customers to choose and then directly connect their telecom provider to Teams. At the heart of this solution is an essential component known as the Session Border Controller (SBC). It provides a wide variety of services which improve the experiences and security for users making calls. Many customers also use Cisco Networking technology including SBCs and want both companies to provide joint solutions that do not require replacement of key infrastructure. Today we are excited to share that<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Cisco</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>has joined our certification program for Session Border Controllers.

Every day millions of people around the world rely on Teams to communicate better through meetings, calls and chat. In this series, we share best practices and highlight new communication features in Teams designed to help you and your teams stay connected and accomplish more together.</EM></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Meetings have always been a cornerstone of teamwork. In fact, meetings are so vital that 37 percent of employee time is spent in meetings and many attend over 60 meetings a month.<A href=\"https://e-meetings.verizonbusiness.com/global/en/meetingsinamerica/uswhitepaper.php#INTRODUCTION\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><SUP>1</SUP></A> But are we getting the most out of every meeting?</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>All too often, people come to meetings unprepared because it takes too much time to find and review pre-meeting materials. During the meeting, it’s often a struggle, especially for remote participants, to fully engage and feel included, especially if they’re struggling to see or hear what’s being discussed. Afterwards, the value of meetings further diminishes when important insights—like decisions and action items—fall between the cracks from one meeting to the next.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>To help get the most out of meetings, we need to change the way we think about meetings. Today, a meeting is treated as a stand-alone event, and the phone and video conferencing tools many people use are designed to support that event. But our extensive user research tells us two things: first, meetings are rarely discrete events, but a series of collaborative connections; and secondly, great meetings are not just about what happens during the meeting, but also before and after.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Microsoft Teams was built with this holistic approach as the central guiding principle for developing meetings. We treat meetings as an ingredient of collaboration that relies on a series of connections until the project is complete. Teams keeps all the relevant meeting content and discussions in one place so that participants can spend less time hunting down information and stay focused and engaged before, during and after meetings. Here’s what this looks like in practice:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG>Before</STRONG><BR />A lot of meetings prep is about content, context and conversation. This is now made simpler because every Teams Meeting comes with a persistent conversation. Microsoft Teams surfaces this information easily and conveniently in the context of your meeting. People can have discussions about the meeting beforehand and bring those conversations into the meeting without losing context. And since Teams is the hub for teamwork in Office 365, your Teams Meetings are held where your chats and files live, naturally bringing this context into your meeting.</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG>During</STRONG><BR />Once the meeting begins, people can use a variety of features that help focus attention, drive engagement, and foster inclusion. These include high-fidelity audio and video, <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/What-s-New-in-Microsoft-Teams-July-2019/ba-p/779946\" target=\"_self\">live captions</A>, rich real-time <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Document-collaboration-and-co-authoring-EE1509B4-1F6E-401E-B04A-782D26F564A4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-authoring with Office 365 apps</A>, <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/whiteboard-in-a-teams-meeting-d9210aa2-876a-40f0-8ca0-5deb2fc11ca6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital whiteboard</A>, and <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Blur-your-background-in-a-Teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">distraction-free backgrounds</A>. Teams also makes it easy to bring in participants outside your organization, even if they don’t have an Office 365 account. They can join using the Teams app or through most web browsers because Teams has full WebRTC support for meetings and calling. For those that may not have a fully supported browser, Teams offers a <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/What-s-New-in-Microsoft-Teams-September-2019/ba-p/881539\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lightweight meeting join experience</A>.&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG>After</STRONG><BR />After the meeting, all the related assets – including the <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-a-meeting-in-Teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recording of the meeting</A>, chat, <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/take-meeting-notes-in-teams-3eadf032-0ef8-4d60-9e21-0691d317d103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meeting notes</A>, <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/whiteboard-in-a-teams-meeting-d9210aa2-876a-40f0-8ca0-5deb2fc11ca6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital whiteboard</A>, transcript, and shared files are saved in a persistent conversation that helps the team continue the discussion and drive work forward.

It’s difficult to remember every member of a project team, the owner of a process, or the appropriate expert. Searching through old emails, looking through paper lists of names, or asking other people to find the right contact can be time-consuming and frustrating. With targeted communication using tags in Microsoft Teams, you can now organize users within your Team based on attributes such as role, skill, or expertise. Once tags are applied, you can quickly and easily reach the right people. &nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Create and use tags in Teams </FONT></P>\n<P>To get started with tags, find a Team on the left-hand side of the screen, select <STRONG>More options …,</STRONG> and choose <STRONG>Manage Tags</STRONG>. Here&nbsp;you can create tags:</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"CreateTagZoomed.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/184048i3F86771AD1F6747E/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"CreateTagZoomed.png\" alt=\"Create a new tag\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Create a new tag</span></span></P>\n<P>Once a tag is created, you can use the tag to reach people either with a chat or in a Channel post. In a Channel, you can @mention the tag so that the tag members will be notified.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"UseTagZoomed.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/184049i7FB500071CDE4634/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"UseTagZoomed.png\" alt=\"Using a tag in a channel post\" /><span class=\"lia-inline-image-caption\" onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\">Using a tag in a channel post</span></span></P>\n<P>Here are some situations where tags might be able to help your group communicate and collaborate more efficiently.</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><STRONG>Role-based work</STRONG>: In organizations where people often know the role of the person they need to reach, but they don’t know their name, tags can provide the right context to find them. For example, if I work in a role where I pass specific types of issues to a support team, I could create a <EM>CustomerSupport </EM>tag. Then, I could post a customer issue to a Channel Post and include <EM>@CustomerSupport</EM> so that the right people get notified.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Large Teams:</STRONG> Within large Teams, tags are middle ground between @mentioning an individual and @mentioning a Channel. For example, if I work in a retail store with a bunch of departments, I could create a <EM>Footwear</EM> tag for employees assigned to that department. Then, when I create a channel post to let the whole store know that two displays are going to be reorganized and include @Footwear to make sure employees in that department get the message.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Cross-functional project teams</STRONG>: For special projects where the members may not frequently work together, tags can be used as a light-weight way to create a project group. This is especially useful for short-term projects. For example, if I’m working on a new product design concept with some people from Marketing, Merchandising, and Branding, I could create a <EM>ProductAlpha</EM> tag for our group.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Identifying an expert or owner</STRONG>: Tags can also be helpful to identify an expert or a single point of contact. For example, if I work in a manufacturing plant, I might want to tag people with a specific safety certification.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P><FONT size=\"6\">Learn more and upcoming tagging capabilities</FONT></P>\n<P>When using tags, here are some other things to keep in mind:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Pick a name that all members of the Team can easily understand.</LI>\n<LI>Remember, Tags are only accessible to people who are members of the Team where the tag was created.&nbsp;</LI>\n<LI>There is currently a limit of 100 tags per Team and 100 members per tag. Each user can be assigned a maximum of 25 tags.</LI>\n<LI>Tags can be disabled by the IT Admin or changes to tags can be controlled only by the Team Owner.

The new CQD comes packed with exciting new capabilities, features, and reports. The addition of these new latest enhancements represents a major update for CQD. The new reports enable administrators to actively troubleshoot system and individual user issues.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Powerful New Capabilities</FONT></P>\n<P>In order to provide new insights, CQD is also adding new capabilities to support them. Even those Teams administrators who choose not to make use of the new reports will see improvements in CQD thanks to these capability enhancements.</P>\n<CENTER>\n<P style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</P>\n</CENTER>\n<P><STRONG>Near Real-Time Data</STRONG> - CQD is now available on average in 30 minutes! Admins can quickly receive feedback on the success or failure of their troubleshooting efforts helping improve satisfaction across the board. In the past, Call data used to take 24 hours on average to become available and admins making changes to the network configuration meant waiting 1 or more days before confirming success.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG><FONT color=\"#333399\"><EM>“With 350 million monthly audio minutes and 16 million monthly video minutes, we need the right quality data to support Accenture’s more than 200,000 Microsoft Teams and 400,000 active users. The updated version of CQD, with new drill down capabilities, user-level data and latency data, is a game changer. Data from the CQD enables us to pinpoint isolated problems versus enterprise-wide issues and respond quickly to users.” Bill Schulz, Accenture</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>EUII Data</STRONG> (End User Identifiable Information) gives Teams admins the ability to zoom all the way down to the user level. Available fields include the users full IP address, MAC address, BSSID, user IDs, Machine Endpoint Name, the user’s verbatim feedback, and Object ID. (For compliance reasons, PII/EUII data is only stored for 30 days.)</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Helpful Features</FONT></P>\n<P>Making the most of these new capabilities, these updates to CQD are also adding a host of features to enable entirely new workflows.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Improved Date Controls</STRONG> add new Trend and date parameters to CQD. Rolling Trends allow for the generation of reports that show data for the last 5, 7, 30, 60, or 90 days. New date parameters also allow Teams admins to view the data starting from any given date, as opposed to the previous full month resolution.<BR /><BR /><STRONG>Drill Down Fields</STRONG> enable quick analysis by allowing the report user to narrow down on a field and automatically filter on a value across multiple queries. Drill down fields can dramatically speed up the “guess and check” process that is common to most troubleshooting.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG><FONT color=\"#333399\"><EM>“The new version of CQD has enabled us as a company to do effective root causing of incidents. Saving us time. The critical missing item in our [previous] approach was the ability to drill down to the user level.” - FrieslandCampina</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>In addition to these changes, we’ve made various quality-of-life improvements and introduced smaller new features like multi-select filters, dashboard-level filters, and greatly improved building data upload speeds. New Dimensions and Measures, such as Call Counts (versus Stream Counts), have also been added in response to customer requests. These are only some of CQD’s new features and the one we’re most proud to introduce, but for a complete listing of the changes, please review our <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updated documentation</A>.</P>\n<CENTER>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n</CENTER>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Insightful Reports</FONT></P>\n<P>By combining all this new functionality, CQD is now also able to provide all new insights. Teams administrators can now investigate problem calls almost as soon as they’re finished, and even analyze issues on a user-by-user basis. Exposing these new insights, CQD now includes several new standard reports, to include the following:</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG><EM><FONT color=\"#333399\">“Our partnership, in the development and maturity of CQD portal, has enhanced our ability to quickly define end user issues and promote actionable fixes, in an environment with over 120K users and 100M audio minutes a month. The ability to drill down, within an incident, to an individual’s specific challenge expedites our resolutions and increases user experience scores. What used to take 2-3 days for a report is now readily available, near real-time. My team has switched to advanced CQD, a long-time ago!.” – Sridhar Reddy, Johnson &amp; Johnson</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT color=\"#000000\"><STRONG>Quality Drill Down</STRONG> makes extensive use of drill down fields and EUII data, allowing Teams administrators to slice and review their call quality data by date, region, hour, specific location, specific subnet, and even by user.</FONT></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Failure Drill Down</STRONG> follows a similar workflow as the Quality Drill Down, but with a focus on call failures. As with the Quality Drill Down, an admin could use this report to identify which specific locations, subnets, and users contribute most significantly to Teams’ issues.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Rate My Call</STRONG> is similar in workflow to the above reports but differs significantly in that it allows admins to measure and evaluate the subjective experience of their users. Rate My Call draws on direct user feedback to help identify those locations and users who feel as though they are encountering the most issues.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><STRONG><EM><FONT color=\"#333399\">“We used CQD to identify sites that require WLAN infrastructure upgrade and confirm the success of the changes. One of the most vivid examples was a large site in EU, that was affecting call quality stats for the whole region. We recently finished WLAN upgrade and as a result [Poor Call Quality] went down from 6.7% to 0.3% in a month!” – Ivan Lukyanov, Mars</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Help Desk</STRONG> reverses the pattern of most other reports by starting from the user and working backwards to identify specific issues. By leveraging the new EUII data in CQD, admins can now find a specific user or call and work from there to identify the issues that affected their call experience.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Client Version</STRONG> allows administrators to view session and user counts for each client version. Administrators supervising large or highly dispersed networks will find this report especially useful, as it helps to identify sources of poor call quality resulting from older or out-of-date client versions. Drilling down to the user level will enable those admins to identify the responsible users in order to help keep everyone up to date across their entire network.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Endpoints</STRONG> provides information on machine endpoints by make and model of device, in order to help identify problem platforms. In order use this report, customers must upload endpoint data in a manner similar to building data. More information on that process can be found <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard#upload-tenant-data-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A>.</P>\n<P><BR /><FONT size=\"5\">What’s Next?</FONT><BR />As large as these changes are, the updates on the horizon are even more exciting.

At the same time, we know there is a large Jira Server community looking for a similar integration – and we could not ignore this huge market need. We are pleased to answer this demand with our new Jira Server version of the Jira integration for Microsoft Teams.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>One of our key priorities is to keep parity between Jira Server and Jira Cloud integrations as a main goal, and share the best functionality whether you are using cloud or on-premises Jira.

Attendees can watch the event, ask questions, and share in conversation with each other.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Hosting a live event in Microsoft Teams enables you to schedule and produce events for large online audiences. Live events use video and interactive discussion to host organization-wide employee briefings or host a virtual council meeting, and can be as simple or as sophisticated as needed. Up to 10,000 attendees can participate in real-time from anywhere, across devices, or catch up later with the event recording that features automatic transcription and search.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>So, how do you setup a live event?</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Step 1: Plan the live event</STRONG></P>\n<P>Just like an in-person gathering, a live event works best when properly planned ahead of time. Based on your needs, you can consider hosting a lightweight event using a simple laptop and webcam setup and invite the presenters to participate using their own devices, or opt to use professional camera and sound setup. Further, to ensure a seamless experience for your attendees, you should proactively assign roles to various participants. Some roles to consider are:</P>\n<OL>\n<LI><STRONG>Organizer</STRONG> - schedules a live event and ensures the event is set up with the right permissions for attendees and the event group, who will manage the event.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Producer</STRONG> – manages a live event, making sure attendees have a great viewing experience by controlling the live event stream. Responsible for starting and stopping the live event, and switching between presenters. Having a person dedicated to the producer role makes sure that presenters are not burdened with managing the event, and allows presenters to leave the event after they are finished presenting.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Presenter</STRONG> - shares audio, video, or a screen to the live event.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Moderator</STRONG> –joins the event in the “presenter” role to moderate and monitor questions and answers (Q&amp;A). Having a designated moderator ensures timely attention to the questions asked by the attendees and makes for a better attendee experience.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Step 2: Schedule a live event from Microsoft Teams</STRONG></P>\n<P>After you have planned the event and assigned roles, you are ready to schedule you event! You can schedule a live event just like any other meeting, using the calendar in Microsoft Teams. First, you will enter event information, including the title, date and time, and assign people to roles.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Depending on the audience for your event, you can create a Private or a Public event. Public events are a great option to consider for events such as public townhalls, or council meetings. If an event is public, anyone who has the link can attend without logging in.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"1.JPG\" style=\"width: 893px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/182066iE191F3A934CE0E45/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"1.JPG\" alt=\"1.JPG\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Next, you will select a People and Groups, Org-wide or a Public event. If an event is public, anyone who has the link can attend without logging in, making public events ideal for town hall or council meetings.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"2.JPG\" style=\"width: 604px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/182067iA3BC94717AE4D500/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"2.JPG\" alt=\"2.JPG\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>If you want to create a public event but do not see an option to create one, contact your IT administrator. The ability to create a public event is controlled centrally and, by default, users are not granted permission to create a public event. Your administrator can modify the policy for live events in the Teams Admin Center.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"3.JPG\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/182069iAB1616C39010BD2C/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"3.JPG\" alt=\"3.JPG\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Step 3: Invite attendees to the meeting</STRONG></P>\n<P>As a live event organizer, one of your responsibilities is to invite attendees. When you schedule a live event in Teams, it automatically sends the calendar invite to producers and presenters. From the calendar entry in Teams, you can get a link to the event and send it out to attendees.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"4.JPG\" style=\"width: 871px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/182071i70500B4B8873FE06/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"4.JPG\" alt=\"4.JPG\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Step 4: Go live</STRONG></P>\n<P>When you want to start the live event, select “Join” from the invite. You will enter the event in setup mode. In this mode, you can add content and video you want to go live with.

Busy people can sometimes fill their days with meetings and appointments and forget to schedule time to focus on their work without any outside distractions. <A href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/business/myanalytics-personal-analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyAnalytics</A> helps you explore your own work patterns and learn ways to work smarter – including AI powered suggestions for setting aside “focus time” on your calendar (i.e. when it notices your week is filling up with meetings). When you schedule “focus time” through MyAnalytics, Teams will automatically help you stay focused by: changing your presence to “focusing” and silencing all notifications during the focus period (based on your priority access settings).

For the best adoption results, we recommend an incremental and measured approach across three phases: Start, Experiment, and Scale.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<OL>\n<LI><STRONG>Start</STRONG>: As we’ve covered on previous episodes, once you have the technical prerequisites for Teams in place and your users licensed, it’s time to establish a multi-disciplined team to assess your organizational readiness at both a technical and user level, as you roll out Teams. It’s not enough to pilot Teams in IT before you roll it out broadly.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>\n<P>In working with thousands of organizations of all sizes, we’ve seen that recruiting a number of critical roles can help accelerate progress. These include:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI>An executive sponsor to get others on board and excited about using Teams,</LI>\n<LI>Someone on point to make sure that your user and business stakeholders are happy, and that works with you to set deployment goals and oversee the rollout, and</LI>\n<LI>Multiple “Champions” across departments to help evangelize and help others build their skills in Teams.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>Depending on the scale of your roll-out or the size of your organization, the same person on your roll-out team may serve multiple roles. What’s more important is that you plan for these specific functions, as well as for formal training based on your assessment of organizational readiness. To help with your planning, we’ve created a number of training and communication assets, available at <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Microsoft-Teams\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/SuccessWithTeams</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>How ready your organization is to move to Teams can be evaluated by meeting with the leaders in your organization and by conducting surveys leveraging tools like the questionnaire template in the free <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/use-advisor-teams-roll-out\" target=\"_blank\">Advisor for Teams</A> tool. This is also an area where your help desk can assist by tracking the most common user issues and questions recorded during the pilot or test phase.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Taking your time to get this feedback is worth it, as it will help you understand if different levels of effort are required for different user profiles, departments, or groups. In addition, this feedback will help you craft the right content timelines, and online and in-person strategies for training. You’ll also be able to identify which groups of people are more suited to be part of the first phase of your roll-out. The free <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/use-advisor-teams-roll-out\" target=\"_blank\">Advisor for Teams</A> tool can also help you select the workloads that you want to deploy from Chat, Teams, Channels, Apps, Meetings and Conferencing, along with your specific project teams for each. It also helps you track against milestones with an integrated step-by-step project plan.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<OL start=\"2\">\n<LI><STRONG>Experiment: </STRONG>With your core team in place and baseline information about your organization’s readiness, you can move on to building the foundation for piloting Teams services to specific groups or business units. This is where you’ll want to make sure that you have the right policies and governance models in place. As we covered on our very first <A href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfDB7VenWuA&amp;list=PLXtHYVsvn_b_JeDjgD5XdkyHTDXdYgPGn\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams for IT episode</A>, you’ll want to think about how you plan to manage Teams over time. Some things to consider include:\n<UL>\n<LI>Who has permissions to create teams? You may for example, want to limit team creation of teams to managers or project leaders to avoid over-provisioning teams</LI>\n<LI>How long should teams last? Set expiration policies to manage teams overflow</LI>\n<LI>Should teams be standardized? Setting standard naming conventions for new teams may allow for more consistency and easier discoverability</LI>\n<LI>Which apps do you want approved for use within Teams? Consider the many apps already integrated with Teams and how they would add value to your users</LI>\n<LI>Do you need any controls for information protection and retention? Check out my Teams Essentials episode on <A href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lHNKVVvQ4&amp;list=PLXtHYVsvn_b_JeDjgD5XdkyHTDXdYgPGn&amp;index=3\" target=\"_blank\">Security and Compliance</A> for more on this topic.</LI>\n<LI>Do you need overlapping capabilities across Skype and Teams? For broader guidance on this topic please watch my <A href=\"https://youtu.be/1HKWEq_uyYU\" target=\"_blank\">Skype to Teams Upgrade episode</A>.</LI>\n<LI>Are you enabling desktop and mobile Teams apps? To drive the best adoption results, we recommend that the desktop and mobile versions of Teams are made available to users, and that you configure them to AutoStart to help users discover them.</LI>\n</UL>\n</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>As you set pilot and go/no-go decision goals, remember to incorporate measurable business outcomes that you can rally your project team around. The best way to derive these goals is to ask stakeholders about what business processes are critical for them, and where they have opportunities for improvement. You should have gone through this in the Start phase.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Communication is also a critical part of your pilot phase. Try to start with an email from your executive sponsor to explain why Teams is being deployed, how it opens up remote work opportunities, the advantages to improve productivity, &nbsp;and how users can start to get familiar with it. It’s a good idea to include links to self-training resources and frequently asked questions. You could combine this with a kick-off call or short group event over breakfast or lunch to increase excitement, get direct feedback, and share the details of your early adopter program.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<OL start=\"3\">\n<LI><STRONG>Scale: </STRONG>With the early adopter program running during the Experiment phase, you gathered the experiences and skills to broaden your deployment of Microsoft Teams. When expanding to a broad roll-out, you’ll also need to expand your stakeholder groups and implementation team. Consider thinking about potential updates to your governance policies as you add more departments or regions to your roll-out. You’ll also want to set organization-wide goals by working with your roll-out team and your executive sponsor to identify the right metrics to measure success at a company level. Example metrics include driving outcomes tied to your work culture as the basis for teamwork, for example: how often do employees work remotely, as well as tangible or measurable improvements like: reducing time spent joining meetings, or optimizing travel budget.</LI>\n</OL>\n<P>While usage goals are one thing, in parallel make sure to set realistic milestones to get your IT environment ready. For example, adding PSTN calling to Teams as you phase out Skype may extend your deployment timeline and require specific end-user training.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The feedback and reporting channels established at the Experiment phase, along with your Champions, will continue to play an important role as you scale your deployment. Here you can also continue to take advantage of the built-in reporting in Microsoft 365 and the Teams admin center to help you to track end user adoption.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As you scale, it’s also important to plan for driving broader internal awareness campaigns with materials like posters, digital signage and events, which you can download from <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Microsoft-Teams\" target=\"_blank\">here.</A> You can also provision Microsoft 365 learning pathway templates into your Intranet, and you can learn more at <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/m365LP.</A></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>These three phases and additional guidance for getting your organization on board with Microsoft Teams are covered in more detail in <A href=\"https://youtu.be/BQ7kVacSAt0\" target=\"_blank\">today’s essentials episode.</A></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>I hope that you’ve enjoyed the guidance and tips from our Microsoft Teams for IT series so far.

For these new customers, files uploaded to a Teams channel will be stored in SharePoint Online, and files uploaded through 1:1 chat will be stored in OneDrive for Business in-country for all new customers. For existing customers, customer data in Teams continues to be stored in its current location.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Teams customer data residency in South Korea, as well as our other Office 365 customer data residency commitments in the data centers located in South Korea, help organizations with data residency requirements to onboard to Teams and Office 365.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This rollout furthers the in-country data residency capabilities of Microsoft Teams. As of this release, the Microsoft Teams services described above store data at rest in the following locations:<BR /><BR /><STRONG>• NEW! South Korea data centers in Seoul and Busan</STRONG><BR />• France datacenters in Marseille and Paris <BR />• Australia: datacenters in New South Wales and Victoria<BR />• Japan: datacenters in Tokyo (Saitama) and Osaka<BR />• APAC [Asia Pacific]: datacenters in Singapore and Hong Kong<BR />• EMEA [Europe, Middle East, and Africa]: datacenters in Dublin &amp; Amsterdam<BR />• AMER [Americas – North, and South]: datacenters in Bay, CA and Boydton, VA<BR />• UK: datacenters in Cardiff and London<BR />• India: datacenters in Chennai and Pune<BR />• Canada datacenters in Quebec City and Toronto<BR />• South Africa datacenters in Cape Town and Johannesburg</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Where your Teams data is stored<BR />The data you provide through your use of Teams is stored differently depending on the content type. Please watch the Ignite Breakout session on Microsoft Teams architecture for an in-depth discussion.<BR /><BR /><STRONG>Core Teams customer data</STRONG>: If an organization provisions its tenant in Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, India, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or the United States, Microsoft will store the following customer data at rest only within that location: (1) Microsoft Teams chats, team and channel conversations, images, voicemail messages, and contacts, (2) SharePoint Online site content and the files stored within that site, and (3) files uploaded to OneDrive for Business. Below is additional information on which Microsoft platforms and applications store Teams data.</P>\n<P><BR />•&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Chat, channel messages, team structure</STRONG>: Every team in Microsoft Teams is backed by an Office 365 group and its SharePoint Online site and Exchange Online mailbox. Private chats (including group chats), messages sent as part of a conversation in a channel, and the structure of teams and channels are stored in a chat service running in Azure. The data is also stored in a hidden folder in the user and group mailboxes to enable Information Protection features.</P>\n<P>•&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Voicemail and Contacts</STRONG>: Voicemails are stored in Exchange Online. Contacts are stored in an Exchange Online-based cloud data store. Exchange Online and the Exchange Online-based cloud store already provide customer data residency in each of the worldwide datacenter geos. For all Teams, customers voicemail and contacts are stored in-country for Australia, Canada, France, India, Japan, UK, South Korea, South Africa, and the US. For all other countries, files are stored in the US, Europe, or Asia-Pacific location based on tenant affinity.</P>\n<P>•<STRONG>&nbsp; Images and Media</STRONG>: Media used in chats is stored in an Azure-based media service that is deployed to the same locations as the chat service. (One exception is Giphy GIFs which are not stored, but are reference links to the original Giphy service URLs; Giphy is a non-Microsoft service)</P>\n<P>•<STRONG>&nbsp; Files</STRONG>: Files (including OneNote and wiki) that somebody shares in a channel are stored in the team’s SharePoint Online site. Files shared in a private chat or a chat during a meeting or call are uploaded and stored in the OneDrive for Business account of the user who shares the file. Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business already provide customer data residency in each of the worldwide datacenter geos. So, for existing customers, all files, OneNote notebooks, Teams wiki content, and mailboxes that are part of the Teams experience are already stored in the location based on your tenant affinity. Files are stored in-country for Australia, Canada, France, India, Japan, UK, and South Korea. For all other countries, files are stored in the US, Europe, or Asia Pacific location based on tenant affinity.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Please note that customers that allow users to store files with a third-party storage provider are dependent on the third-party's choice of storage location of those services and should, therefore, review the location of data at rest for those services separately. Some uses of third-party storage include: <BR />1. <STRONG>Tabs</STRONG>: Tabs allow users to pin information from apps and services to a channel. Thus, it varies by type of the tab where the data is stored. The tab itself does not store any data within Teams. For example, a SharePoint Online tab will store data based on where the SharePoint Online site collection was provisioned. A tab that includes information from a partner will store the data directly in the system used by the partner and only present a view of it in Teams.</P>\n<P>2. <STRONG>Other partner apps</STRONG>: Microsoft does not provide any data residency support for apps and services from partners that you might be using within the Microsoft Teams experience. Please review information from those solutions directly to learn about where their data is being stored.<BR />We will continue to roll out Microsoft Teams to more local datacenters aligned with the Office 365 customer data residency strategy.<BR /><BR /><STRONG>FAQ</STRONG><BR /><STRONG>Which workloads in addition to Teams provide data residency in South Korea?</STRONG><BR />Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business also provide customer data residency in South Korea.</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"image.png\" style=\"width: 624px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/125672i09F349D74604E650/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"image.png\" alt=\"image.png\" /></span><BR /><BR /><STRONG>Where exactly in South Korea is this data stored?</STRONG><BR />Teams chat and media data will be stored in the Korea Central and Korea South datacenters located in Seoul and Busan respectively. <BR /><BR /><STRONG>What does this mean for new customers in South Korea?</STRONG><BR />From July 9th, 2019 (“Launch Date”), customers from South Korea who have never previously logged into Microsoft Teams (i.e. no user in their tenant has ever accessed teams.microsoft.com or signed into any Teams client app) will have customer data residency in South Korea.<BR /><BR /><STRONG>What does this mean for existing customers in South Korea?</STRONG><BR />Customers who are already using Teams will continue to have data residency for their content stored at rest in the APAC location. Soon, Microsoft will provide a migration feature to enable data migration for these existing Teams customers. We do not have a specific date at this point.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>If I have more questions, who should I talk to?</STRONG><BR />Please do not hesitate to contact your Account Team or FastTrack if you have more questions about Teams deployments and how the availability of data residency in South Korea affects your timelines to deploy. Based on your requirements, they will recommend the best approach for you.<BR /><BR /><STRONG>What is the roadmap for data residency in other countries?</STRONG><BR />Our goal is to provide data residency for Teams in all the Office 365 country-based datacenters.<BR /><BR />Thanks again for your time in reading this, and for all the support you’ve shown towards Microsoft Teams.<BR /><BR />Varun Sagar<BR />Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Teams</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Aug 2019 21:20:41 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/125672i09F349D74604E650/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999","linkMd5":"91c229bc3bb79ab304dfdd763a661713","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-42-559_1df29b27a620af10.webp","destWidth":624,"destHeight":351,"sourceBytes":73882,"destBytes":16814,"author":"Varun Sagar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/125672i09F349D74604E650/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-56-42-559_1df29b27a620af10.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401929},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"Microsoft Teams highlights from Ignite 2019","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-teams-highlights-from-ignite-2019/ba-p/1034812","description":"<P>We hope you had as much fun at Microsoft Ignite 2019 as we did!

What are best practices for governance, specifically around team creation, naming, and retention?&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">To assure the best experience for end users, Teams provides IT organizations with a variety of governance controls. If you require strict controls on how teams are named and classified, whether guests can be added as team members, and who can create teams, you can configure each of these areas in the Groups management section of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG>Team Creation:</STRONG> We don’t recommend limiting the ability to create teams, as this might negatively impact productivity. However, some organizations need to have strict control over every team that is created, or allow only a subset of users to create groups and teams. <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/manage-creation-of-groups?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><U>Configure who can create teams using Azure Active Directory or PowerShell</U></A>.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>\n</DIV>\n<DIV><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"2.png\" style=\"width: 667px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/181474iC1CC317DFBC096E4/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"2.png\" alt=\"2.png\" /></span></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG>Team Naming:</STRONG> Administrators can choose to enforce a specific naming convention for Microsoft Teams using the Groups management interface in Azure AD. You can use prefix or suffix naming conventions which will allow to add or append fixed strings or supported user attributes to the team names. Blocked words can avoid (intentional or unintentional) misuse of teams. <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/plan-for-groups-governance?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Configure naming policies using Azure Active Directory or PowerShell</A>. </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG>Team Channel Messages &amp; Chat Retention:</STRONG> Retention policies can be used to define a range of days after which all content will be deleted or a range of days during which content cannot be deleted – or both. Retention can be set independently for chat messages and channel messages. Channel and chat message policies can be applied globally or per team or user. Team files use the existing retention policies set for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. <A href=\"https://aka.ms/teams-retention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Configure Team retention in the Office 365 Compliance Center</A>. </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture3.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/181421iF1768AAA43EDCC28/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture3.png\" alt=\"Picture3.png\" /></span></FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Before putting all of the above controls in place, it is important to first determine your organization’s governance requirements.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>\n<UL>\n<LI><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Ask yourself the right questions to <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/plan-teams-governance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">determine your governance requirements</A> and how to meet them. </FONT></LI>\n<LI><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Use this <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-adoption-governance-quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Governance quick-start checklist</A> as you are starting out with Microsoft Teams. </FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV id=\"outside\">&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG>3. Can I collaborate with people outside my organization (i.e. external access/federation)? How is this different from guest access?</STRONG> </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">With Teams External Access (federation), users from other domains can participate in your 1:1&nbsp; chats and calls. You can also allow external users who are still using Skype for Business to participate. To configure External Access, go to the Microsoft Teams Admin Center, select Org-wide settings &gt; External Access.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">External Access is different than Guest Access Microsoft Teams. Enabling Guest Access allows an Administrator to add individual users from outside of the organization to teams and channels in Microsoft Teams. With Guest Access, a guest can access resources, such as channel discussions and files, for a specific team, and chat with other users in the team they have been invited to. With External Access, only 1:1 federated chat and calling is allowed with external users. No access to other content, such as files, is granted. Tenant admins can choose between the two communication options depending on which level of collaboration is desirable with outside parties. Administrators can choose either approach or both, depending on their organizational needs, but we recommend enabling guest access for a fuller, more collaborative Teams experience. </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>\n<UL>\n<LI><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Here is a <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/let-your-teams-users-communicate-with-other-people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">step-by-step guide</A> on how to turn on external access </FONT></LI>\n<LI><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Learn the <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/communicate-with-users-from-other-organizations#compare-external-and-guest-access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">differences between external access and guest access</A>&nbsp; </FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><FONT size=\"2\">* Guest Access in Microsoft Teams is not yet available within or across GCC High &amp; DOD clouds.&nbsp;</FONT> </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><FONT size=\"2\"><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture4.png\" style=\"width: 692px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/181422iFFE7CF3684A040E8/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture4.png\" alt=\"Picture4.png\" /></span></FONT></FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><FONT size=\"2\"><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Picture5.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/181423i3D7C1A94BC81CD2D/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Picture5.png\" alt=\"Picture5.png\" /></span></FONT></FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV id=\"function\">&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT size=\"4\"><STRONG>4. </STRONG><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><STRONG>What Microsoft Teams functionalities do I get if I am not fully on Office 365?

When Microsoft Teams Rooms is part of a meeting, it can display the Microsoft Whiteboard for all attendees in the meeting room to see.

This version of Whiteboard allows you to interact with remote attendees of Microsoft Teams meetings and do real-time diagramming or sketching.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">To enable the interactive Whiteboard on a Microsoft Teams Rooms device, you need to meet the following requirements:</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">1.) A Touch enabled display device. Microsoft does not certify touch-enabled monitors or TV’s for Microsoft Teams Rooms. However, any touch-enabled display device that is certified for Microsoft Windows will work with Microsoft Teams Rooms. The USB cable out of the monitor or TV connects to the compute unit of Microsoft Teams Rooms.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">2.) Make sure that Windows recognizes that the display device is touch enabled. On Microsoft Teams Rooms, this will require <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-operations#admin-mode-and-device-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signing in to the device as a local administrator</A>.&nbsp; Once signed in as a local administrator, search for “Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input”. This will bring up the Table PC setting screen. If everything is set up correctly, you will see that your display device is properly recognized as a touch display.&nbsp; In the image below, the selected display has “Full Windows Touch Support”.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"Tablet PC Settings.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/183064i377D1F8F689F43E2/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Tablet PC Settings.png\" alt=\"Tablet PC Settings.png\" /></span></P>\n<P> </P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">Touch-enabled display devices will still work even if they have limited or single touch support. You can read more about the difference <A href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141125-00/?p=43543\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A>.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">If your display does not show up as touch-enabled, you may need to install display drivers from the monitor or TV manufacturer. You also may need to configure the device first for pen and touch support by clicking on the <STRONG>Setup… </STRONG> button on the Tablet PC Settings screen. Also, verify that the USB cable from the display device is properly connected to Microsoft Teams Rooms.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">3.) Make sure your Office 365 tenant has Whiteboard enabled. To check this, sign in to the <A href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft 365 Admin Center</A>. Within the admin center, navigate to <STRONG>Settings</STRONG> and then to the <STRONG>Settings</STRONG> sub-menu. From here, scroll down until you get to Whiteboard. Click on Whiteboard and verify that <STRONG>Turn on Whiteboard for everyone in your org</STRONG> is enabled.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center\" image-alt=\"Turn_On_Whiteboard.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/183065iCC2486A63CE295AF/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Turn_On_Whiteboard.png\" alt=\"Turn_On_Whiteboard.png\" /></span></P>\n<P> </P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">See <A href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-microsoft-whiteboard-for-your-organization-1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article</A> for more information on enabling Whiteboard.</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">4.) Your Microsoft Teams Rooms device needs to be on at least version 4.0.105.0 which was released in July 2019. If you are following best practices by allowing the Microsoft Teams Rooms devices to automatically update themselves, you should be on a much more recent version of the Microsoft Teams Rooms app .</P>\n<P align=\"left\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P align=\"left\">Finally, this feature is only available when joining a Microsoft Teams meeting.

Here are some of their recommendations for driving Teams adoption, successfully managing change, and sticking to your plan.&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"tip-focus-on-teams-adoption.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197048iA512190481A8D300/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"tip-focus-on-teams-adoption.jpg\" alt=\"tip-focus-on-teams-adoption.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>At <A href=\"https://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dentsu Aegis Network</A>, the vastness of our user landscape relative to capability and geography required us to focus initial energy on driving Teams adoption and usage. Working closely with a Microsoft partner, we built a targeted campaign consisting of drumbeat and t-minus countdown communications, videos, posters, and user guides. We also harnessed the power of Teams to hold remote training and drop-in sessions for more tailored run-throughs. This 'change toolkit' was shared with local IT teams to facilitate their respective moves to Teams Only and received positive feedback across the board.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"tip-identify-low-hanging-fruit.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197049i92F4C8BA0AB1B2D9/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"tip-identify-low-hanging-fruit.jpg\" alt=\"tip-identify-low-hanging-fruit.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the scale of the task of upgrading an organization like Dentsu Aegis Network, with our global footprint of over 45,000 users across multiple regions and markets. So we answered the question of, “Where do we begin?” by focusing on the low hanging fruit. We spent time building our understanding of our user base, identifying opportunities where engagement was high and technical complexity was low. By getting these groups over the line first, we were able to prove to the more reluctant teams that this could be done with ease. Engagement levels improved the more we delivered, and the programme team was equally buoyed by all the progress being made.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"tip-design-a-change-management-program.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199237i9B27876B611CFA4F/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"tip-design-a-change-management-program.jpg\" alt=\"tip-design-a-change-management-program.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>As a leading retailer in Portugal, <A href=\"https://sonaemc.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonae MC</A> has a diverse workforce, each team with unique needs for communications and collaboration tools. From the start, our strategy has been to get Teams in the hands of different types of users in order to approach training and awareness with a broader vision. We used focus groups and continuous feedback – technical and functional – to design a change management program easily understood by teams from Finance to Logistics to Store Management. Measuring the success of the change management program, such as teams created, mobile app usage, meetings online versus offline, and quality of service has been crucial to understand the effectiveness and impact of our efforts to drive Teams adoption and usage.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"tip-believe-in-your-end-goal.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199238iD2A9AA4371D7621C/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"tip-believe-in-your-end-goal.jpg\" alt=\"tip-believe-in-your-end-goal.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P><A href=\"https://www.solera.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solera</A> has a global workforce, each with unique needs for communications and collaboration tools. For us, Teams provided a surface for not only basic collaboration via chat and phone, but also provided a user-friendly interface into SharePoint. With this in mind, and the fact that our Skype for Business implementation had challenges over the years, we decided to go all-in on Teams.</P>\n<P><BR />From an IT perspective, the killer feature was being able to ‘shutter’ Skype after go-live, but keep it running in a limited mode for any legacy meetings. In the background, we’d silently pushed Teams via SCCM &amp; InTune. This meant that on go-live, any disruption was minimized, and everyone knew what was going on. Although we’d set-up a hotline and various support channels, the issues were minimal, easily making this the most successful overnight platform migration we’ve ever done. Fast forward to today’s challenges, and Teams has been completely instrumental in allowing people to work from home, while staying productive and connected.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"tip-pull-out-all-stops-for-awareness.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199239i53B44C05A1C394F9/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"tip-pull-out-all-stops-for-awareness.jpg\" alt=\"tip-pull-out-all-stops-for-awareness.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>Getting the attention of the user community has always been a challenge, and Solera’s upgrade to Teams was no different. This time around, our Messaging and Collaboration Team decided to just make a nuisance of ourselves, and really go overboard with communicating the change, nearly all via email. We had a few posters put up, and of course some t-shirts, but our entire objective was for nobody to be surprised when we did the big bang migration from Skype for Business to Teams.</P>\n<P><BR />We planned the email campaign and started sending to the entire company one month prior to go-live. In the first week it was just a teaser email, the second week had a couple more teasers and download links, and basic getting-started tips. Weeks three and four featured daily emails, with a countdown, download link and a mix of content featuring tips and new features (a big play on GIFs!). When people started complaining of getting too many emails, we knew we were on the right path.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"upgrade-planning-workshops.jpg\" style=\"width: 990px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199240iEFBD2300B7E752DF/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"upgrade-planning-workshops.jpg\" alt=\"upgrade-planning-workshops.jpg\" /></span></P>\n<P>Need additional guidance planning your upgrade to Teams?

If you've ever played a smartphone game or consider yourself a fitness enthusiast, you may have experienced the opportunity to earn badges that symbolize your achievements and growing skills.

Once awarded, recipients and other team members are notified about the awarded badge, and award details can be viewed by simply tagging the badge recipient within the channel conversation.&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"OpenBadges1.jpeg\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/184386iC2101B400A8B8DE5/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"OpenBadges1.jpeg\" alt=\"OpenBadges1.jpeg\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Additionally, all team members have the option to select badges from a complete list and award recognition to one another; team owners have the unique ability to create new badges.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Open_Badges_02.jpeg\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/184388iFBD0C2593B46B99F/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999\" title=\"Open_Badges_02.jpeg\" alt=\"Open_Badges_02.jpeg\" /></span></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The Open Badges app template has been built on top of <A href=\"https://info.badgr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Badgr's robust achievement platform</A>, which currently supports over 20,000 organizations around the world and their valuable communities of practice. Therefore, every badge awarded through the Open Badges App is more than a digital sticker; badges awarded through this exciting app are open, publicly-verifiable, and portable.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>For example, in K-12 education – teachers may extrinsically motivate their students to excel by issuing badges within their communities in Teams for standard protocols such as classroom participation, attendance, or academic performance.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>In higher education, students may showcase these digital badges as verifiable credentials to their prospective employers. Similarly, faculty or members of school administration may compile these awards into a more actionable, skill-aligned portfolio for future employers, thereby leveraging the inherent portability of digital badges and their unique ability to illustrate a granular and personalized learning journey.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>In corporate settings, the opportunity for private companies to recognize and capture micro-achievements (commonly referred to as the \"skills gap\") can be addressed through the use of digital badges. For example, an employee who went over and beyond to deliver a superior customer experience can be spotted and celebrated. Or, a team member who helped their colleagues achieve more can be rewarded, sending necessary cultural signals throughout your organization.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This app template was an effort of collaboration between the Microsoft Teams Platform and the team at Badgr.&nbsp;<SPAN style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Wayne Skipper, Founder/CEO of Concentric Sky, the makers of Badgr, remarked about this successful collaboration:</SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"wayne.PNG\" style=\"width: 198px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/184389i3ADD4FD0E05B987D/image-size/small?v=1.0&amp;px=200\" title=\"wayne.PNG\" alt=\"wayne.PNG\" /></span></P>\n<P>\"We really enjoyed working with Microsoft to enable organizations to embed Badgr into Microsoft Teams.

Out of the many reasons for uploading the data file, one key piece of information relied upon is this delineation between internal networks (deployed and managed by organization IT admin) and external networks (managed by end-users or a private entity, such as: coffee shops).&nbsp; Knowing the call volume, call quality &amp; reliability on the organization network (wired or WiFi) is important, as this is within the organizations sphere of control. Uploading a building data will expedite the organization IT admin in locating where problems occur in a specific region/site/location/building/floors of interest during call quality and reliability troubleshooting. External networks are managed by home users or private entity (such as a coffee shop owner). There is little action to occur on this front, other than providing recommended connectivity practices to the end users.</P>\n<P>In keeping with the spirit of “Empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more” Microsoft has undertaken an effort to help those organizations currently lacking a building data file.

By design, Teams is built on top of a mature and secure collaboration foundation backed by SharePoint, OneDrive and Exchange Online, to deliver the hub for teamwork.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>As an IT professional, we know you care about productivity, manageability and security, and we want you to have control over how Teams is configured for your organization. This means not only meeting your security, compliance, and day-to-day operational needs, but being able to manage and customize communication preferences. As an example, you can enable or disable the use of popular giphys, or decide if guest participants can leverage screen-sharing.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Today we are launching a brand-new series on <A href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/mechanics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Mechanics</A> called: Microsoft Teams for IT. We built this for you, the IT Admin, in order to help you navigate through the various decision points you will encounter while assessing, deploying, or scaling Teams. Our goal is to get you up to speed on the latest capabilities for manageability, security, and compliance, and to share efficient ways to accelerate user adoption while minimizing helpdesk calls.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO width=\"600\" height=\"338\" size=\"large\" vid=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfDB7VenWuA&amp;list=PLXtHYVsvn_b_JeDjgD5XdkyHTDXdYgPGn\" align=\"center\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MfDB7VenWuA/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>The series: Microsoft Teams for IT</STRONG></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Over the next few months, we’ll chronicle step-by-step guidance on how to implement Microsoft Teams.

Fortunately, Teams and <A href=\"https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_teams/microsoft-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Power Automate</A> work seamlessly together to simplify how you and your team work – whether you’re on the Sales team, the Product team, the HR team, or just the office ping pong team.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Power Automate allows you to create low-code workflow automation for yourself and your entire team using logic-based building blocks, starting with a trigger that sets one or more actions in motion. The new <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/trigger-flow-teams-message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"for a selected message\"</A> trigger is unlocking new ways to drive business processes, starting from a message in Teams. Below are four examples of how teams are doing this, but the possibilities are endless. Templates are now available for each of these scenarios to help you get started right away!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">1. Sales teams: Convert a chat to a Sales opportunity</FONT> </STRONG><BR /><A href=\"https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/galleries/public/templates/c0fe09ea131549f0ae6ace75605db470/create-an-opportunity-from-a-message/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Create an opportunity from a message\" template</A><BR />Creating a customer opportunity is a critical step in any Sales process, and often that opportunity starts with a conversation. Now Teams users can create an opportunity right from the conversation where it began.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>When you build the workflow below using the “for a selected message” trigger, anyone in your team can easily create a Sales opportunity just by clicking the “…” on the right side of a message and selecting “Create Sales Opportunity”. Simply fill out a custom form, and the information you enter is automatically sent to your CRM system.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Microsoft%20Teams/1Dynamics-gif.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">2.

Once the flow has been created, users can add critical data to their list right from a chat – for example, when they learn that a project deliverable has been received.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Microsoft%20Teams/2-sharepoint-create.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>3.

Now it’s easy to remind yourself to follow-up on an important message from a colleague at a later time, like after your Teams meeting or once you’ve finish working on an important document.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Building a simple “follow-up” flow will allow anyone on the team to create a custom message reminder just by clicking the “…” on the right-hand side of a message and specifying when they want to be reminded.

We’ve discovered some of the benefits of this new world through more than 30 research projects here at Microsoft, and by learning from our customers and partners. These benefits range from, increased fluidity between work and life activities, allowing people to move between the two more easily, to increased empathy between teammates, and several other benefits detailed in our latest <A href=\"https://aka.ms/Wtrend2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Work Trend Index Report</A>. We’ve also seen the emergence of new challenges. That same blend of work and life can be difficult to balance, home offices without distractions are rare, remote collaboration can feel more difficult than in-person, and access to reliable networks and equipment isn’t available for everyone. While distributed remote work has its rewards, there are certain advantages to in-office collaboration as well. Through these learnings it has become clear – the workplace of the future will not be one location or the other, but a fluid experience across the two.</P>\n<P><BR />To help our customers navigate this new, hybrid working environment, today we’d like to share some new and reimagined capabilities in Teams-enabled meeting rooms that offer touchless experiences, support inclusive collaboration between remote and in-person attendees, and help remind teams to practice social distancing in meeting rooms.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Touchless experiences on Microsoft Teams devices for shared spaces</STRONG></FONT><BR />Today, people in the meeting room can join a Teams meeting from their Microsoft Teams Room and collaboration bar devices, share content and collaborate using their personal PC or mobile device, all without ever having to touch the shared device display. Later this year, we’ll enable these capabilities on Surface Hub as well. Additionally, Surface Pro X users can use their pen across Surface devices, including Surface Hub 2S, further limiting the contact with the shared device display in a meeting room. As the need for additional touchless experiences grows, we’re expanding these features to allow people to control more aspects of the meeting. In the future, people will be able to choose how they want to interact with their shared space devices, using touch, controls on their own personal devices, and through voice commands.</P>\n<P><BR />Soon, in-room participants will be able to control their Teams Room and collaboration bar devices from the Teams mobile app. From the new <STRONG>room remote</STRONG> experience, users will be able to mute and unmute the room, adjust audio volume, turn cameras on and off, and exit the meeting. We’ll also enable <STRONG>wireless casting</STRONG> to any Teams Room, collaboration bar, and Surface Hub for quick ad-hoc connections that don’t require remote participation. Beginning later this year, <STRONG>voice assistance</STRONG> will be enabled for Microsoft Teams Room devices, allowing in-room participants to ask Cortana to join and leave a meeting, and add a phone number or participant from the address book to a meeting.*</P>\n<P><BR />When the meeting is over, people can simply leave the room, allowing the Teams Room or collaboration bar to <STRONG>automatically exit</STRONG> the meeting. This feature allows room administrators to designate a period of zero-activity after a meeting is scheduled to end, after which, meeting devices are automatically ejected from the meeting.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Proximity_Join.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Proximity join</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Personal_Remote_App.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Room remote</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Casting_3.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Wireless casting</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Voice_Commands.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Cortana voice assistance on Microsoft Teams Room</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Coordinated meetings with Teams Room and Surface Hub</STRONG></FONT> <BR />Teams Room is the premier solution for delivering Teams meeting room experiences with a focus on high fidelity audio, HD video, and seamless content sharing capabilities. Surface Hub delivers unmatched co-creation experiences in meetings, featuring premium pen and inking capabilities, with access to must-have Microsoft apps and Office 365 files. Soon, users will be able to leverage the power of both devices, in the same meeting, through a coordinated experience. Using proximity or one-touch join, both devices join the meeting simultaneously with Teams Rooms running audio and video, while Surface Hub is automatically muted to avoid any distracting feedback. During the meeting, users can maximize screen real estate by using the front of room display to show attendees in the meeting gallery, while the Surface Hub is used to show content or to conduct a collaborative whiteboarding session. With the whiteboard experience on Surface Hub and Microsoft Whiteboard in Teams, people can draw and ink together on the same savable canvas, no matter their location. With this new coordinated device capability, people can drive inclusive, collaborative meeting experiences between remote and in-person attendees like never before.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Coordinated_Meetings.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Coordinated meetings with Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Room</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>Meeting room capacity notifications</STRONG></FONT><BR />As organizations plan their transitions back to the office, many are looking to implement new in-office policies to adhere to local safety guidelines. Some of these recommendations include social distancing practices in shared spaces like meeting rooms. To aid our customers in these efforts we’ll soon enable a way for room administrators to automatically notify in-room meeting participants if a room is over capacity. Today, administrators can define meeting room capacity for the room account. Soon, we’ll enable IT to use the data from meeting room cameras with people-counting technologies to identify how many people are in a room, and alert in-room meeting participants if it is over-capacity based on the capacity data defined in the room account. The notification will be displayed as a banner that appears across the top of the screen at the front of the room. In the future, administrators will receive an alert in the Teams Admin Center, allowing them to track room usage to help inform space planning decisions.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/Room_Capacity_Notifications.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>Meeting room capacity notifications</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Helping people connect across workspaces has never been more important. With Teams meetings and Teams-enabled devices, people can engage in collaborative and inclusive meetings from anywhere.</P>\n<P><BR />View our collection of Teams certified devices at the <A href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devices Showcase</A>.

The new “raise hands” feature in Teams allows meeting attendees to identify that they wish to speak, making it easier to actively participate in large meetings.

We are excited to announce real-time noise suppression, a new feature in Teams that will automatically remove unwelcome background noise during your meetings.</P>\n<P><BR />We will soon bring real-time noise suppression to Teams meetings and calls, and we are excited to announce that beginning soon, noise suppression will be&nbsp;<A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-stream-blog/now-generally-available-background-noise-suppression-mobile/ba-p/1221048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generally available for recorded video content in Stream</A>. Now it’s easy to eliminate distracting background noise in training videos or communications, so you can focus on the person speaking, not what’s happening around them.</P>\n<P><BR />Noise suppression works by analyzing an individual’s audio feed and uses specially trained deep neural networks to filter out noise and retain only the speech signal. While traditional noise suppression algorithms can only address simple stationary noise sources such as fan noise, our AI-based approach learns the difference between speech and noise, and is able to suppress all forms of noise including non-stationary sources that we commonly encounter in our meetings such as typing, eating chips, and road noise, just to name a few.</P>\n<P><LI-VIDEO vid=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57mZhr-Tir4&amp;feature=youtu.be\" align=\"center\" size=\"medium\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" uploading=\"false\" thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57mZhr-Tir4/hqdefault.jpg\" external=\"url\"></LI-VIDEO></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The new Satin codec makes the Teams meeting and calling experience even better</STRONG><BR />With our new Satin codec as part of Teams, you can do more with less.

The Galaxy XCover Pro with Microsoft Teams simplifies and empowers Firstline Workers and their organizations to communicate and collaborate using just one device and one platform.</P>\n<P><BR />The functionality, built natively into Teams, reduces the number of devices employees must carry, and lowers costs for IT. Unlike analog devices with unsecure networks, customers no longer have to worry about crosstalk or eavesdropping from outsiders. And since Walkie Talkie works over Wi-Fi or cellular data, it can be used across geographic locations. The capability will be available in the Teams mobile app and integrate with the newly unveiled Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, a device built for workers on the front lines of any industry.</P>\n<P><BR />The XCover Pro will be available through Microsoft retail stores starting in mid-April, and Walkie Talkie in Teams will be available starting July.

Teams is enhancing the user experience for offline (no Internet connection) experiences and for low-bandwidth network environments. We are happy to announce that the first phase of multi-phase rollout is complete. Teams users will now be able to open Teams even when no network is available. You will be able to create and read messages, browse previously viewed channels, and to view calendar summaries. Pinned chats, pinned channels, and recently visited chats and channels will always be available offline.</P>\n<P><BR />Teams is also now optimized to work in a low- or poor-performing network scenarios. For example, users will now be able to send messages even with sub-optimal connectivity. If conditions are too poor to send a message, Teams will notify users of this and then save the message until the user has returned to a functioning network. This functionality is coming to Teams in the next few weeks.</P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Include up to 10,000 users in an individual team </STRONG></P>\n<P>We have raised the upper limit on individual team membership from 5,000 to 10,000 users. We are excited for this increase in team membership to power collaboration and process scenarios especially for large teams and organizations that rely on firstline workers. This limit will start rolling out to customers next month.&nbsp;</P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Group chat with up to 250 people</STRONG> <BR />Sometimes you need to kick off a big project chat with a large group, or organize an ad-hoc discussion with staff at an event, but it is unnecessary to start a new team; perhaps you don’t all work together on a regular basis, or maybe you need a communication channel with a large group of people at an event. Group chats will be able to accommodate up to 250 users! This limit will start rolling out to customers soon.</P>\n<P><BR /><STRONG>Teams &amp; Skype Consumer chat and calling interoperability</STRONG> <BR />Teams users will soon be able to find and communicate with users on the Skype consumer service, allowing businesses using Teams to engage with customers and colleagues on the iconic communications platform, across all clients including iOS and Android.</P>\n<P><BR />This new interoperability will allow Teams and Skype consumer users to chat and make calls using Voice over IP (VoIP) initiated by either client using an email address (phone number or Skype ID searches are not supported at this time.) For safety and security, Teams users can accept or decline first-time conversations with Skype users, and may block and unblock contacts.</P>\n<P><BR />This highly anticipated feature begins rolling out in Teams by the end of March.

We’re making it available in this way partly because in the near future, we’ll turn the experience on by default. Eventually, the setting to turn it on and off will go away. At that time, the experience of meetings in separate windows, with the meeting controls at the top, will become the norm. So we want you to have ample time to get familiar with it.</P>\n<P class=\"lia-indent-padding-left-60px\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P>That’s our overview and how-to for this new meeting and calling experience. We hope you’ll try it. Remember to check for updates and restart the Teams client after you turn it on.

As the number of smaller meeting spaces continues to grow, our customers need videoconferencing solutions purpose-built for smaller meeting spaces like focus rooms, huddle spaces and conference rooms designed for one to five people.

That’s why Microsoft Teams offers consistent, intuitive meeting experiences across all our shared space devices. Scheduling a room and joining a meeting is simple - just add the room to a meeting invitation using Outlook or the calendar app in Teams. When it’s time to join the meeting, use the familiar <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-microsoft-teams-rooms-updated/ba-p/323848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-touch or proximity join experience</A> to get started.

This integrated device brings together microphones, speakers, a camera and a native Teams experience to deliver a solution that is easy to deploy and less to manage. These Android-based collaboration bars have fewer cables and can be mounted on a display within minutes.

While these tools are meant to help teams solve complex problems and convey information quickly in a way that comes naturally, they can sometimes create their own barriers. Switching between numerous tabs and continuously logging in to all of your accounts quickly becomes monotonous and time-consuming.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where Lucidchart’s enhancements to its Microsoft Teams app with new platform capabilities can help. Last year, </SPAN><A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/New-Improve-collaboration-with-visuals-using-Lucidchart-for/ba-p/299180\" target=\"_blank\"><SPAN style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidchart launched an app</SPAN></A><SPAN style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made it possible to edit and share documents without ever leaving Teams, making it easy to convey complex ideas and collaborate all in one location.</SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latest enhanced capabilities from Lucidchart break down these barriers even further making it easy to grant access and edit documents in Teams. Lucidchart is a visual workspace that combines diagramming, data visualization, and collaboration to accelerate understanding and drive innovation. Users can easily create and collaborate on flowcharts, ERDs, BPMN diagrams, wireframes, mockups, network diagrams, org charts, etc. in real-time.</SPAN></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><SPAN style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these new capabilities, you can easily reference specific documents, preview documents you share and grant appropriate editing access to documents.

It started with the conference at Enterprise Connect and recently Gartner noting that Microsoft is a Leader in the <A href=\"https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-1OF9RXYC&amp;ct=190826&amp;st=sb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magic Quadrant for Worldwide UCaaS</A>. We are excited to close out 2019 with new user experiences for Microsoft Teams Phone System, Powerful admin configuration options for Direct Routing, and expanding partnerships to build new capabilities on the Teams calling platform. It’s a great time to use calling in Teams. Please read on to learn about the additional value across Phone System, Direct Routing, and new Partner integrations.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Enhanced Calling experiences</FONT><BR />We are excited to announce that a special <STRONG>15% discount for Phone System</STRONG> will be available early next year for volume licensing customers with Software Assurance who are upgrading from Skype for Business Server to Teams and Phone System during their agreement renewal. It is the right time to begin your cloud collaboration journey. <BR /><BR />When emergency services are needed, every minute counts. <STRONG>Dynamic Emergency Calling</STRONG> enables the sharing of a user’s current location, emergency calls to be routed, and help dispatched. Available now in Calling Plans and support for Direct Routing is planned before the end of the year.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Knowing who is calling and having your delegates properly screen and route these calls is key to a productive day. Recently we made available <STRONG>Reverse Number Lookup</STRONG> to display a caller’s name based on multiple sources. This includes caller ID in history and voicemail ensuring you always know who has called. We are also <STRONG>Enhancing Delegation</STRONG>. Delegates now have further control over call settings for those whose calls they manage. They can add additional delegates or even change call forwarding settings. These 2 enhancements will ensure that the right calls reach you at the right time.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Callers on hold appreciate knowing if they are still connected. <STRONG>Music on Hold</STRONG> helps by playing music for your outside callers while they wait.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>United States Government agencies such as the Department of Defense have very stringent security needs for cloud software. Microsoft has been working to meet these high standards – and we are announcing <STRONG>Phone System</STRONG> is now available for our <STRONG>Government Community Cloud (High)</STRONG> customers and the <STRONG>Department of Defense</STRONG>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Auto Attendant and Call Queues</STRONG> has many new enhancements including extension dialing support from Auto Attendant, shared voicemail, call analytics, longest-idle Call Queue routing, add and order Individual agents to a Call Queue, and improvements to call answering latency. This builds on the previously released improvements such as Hybrid Number Support, Multinumber assign, and Round Robin routing options in Call Queue.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>When you need to troubleshoot a call, having quick access to the latest data is key to closing that support ticket. The latest enhancements to <STRONG>Call Quality Dashboard</STRONG> has many new features including near real-time data availability. Call data on average will be available in 30 minutes which is a great improvement from earlier versions.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Phone System administration</STRONG> is now available in the Teams admin center. Calling Plan customers will be able to search, acquire, and assign phone numbers to end-users. Admins will also be able to create and assign emergency addresses for those end-users. Additionally, customers will be able to create / test / manage custom dial plans, configure Dynamic Emergency Calling, and use the improved configuration options for Auto Attendants and Call Queues.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>And all of above features are targeted to be generally available before the end of year.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>This builds upon all of the other great work that has landed earlier this year. Key items include Phone System updates for Government Cloud Customers, Secondary Ringer, Answer from Anywhere, Voicemail settings in the Teams client, Audio Calling in Chrome, Call Park, Group Call Pickup, Shared Line Appearance, and Softbank Calling Plans for Japan.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">New features in Direct Routing address customer needs</FONT></P>\n<P>Direct Routing continues to grow around the world. We are now seeing usage in over 80 countries. And as it grows, our customers uncover new configuration needs. Take a look at our latest developments and if you are attending Ignite – visit our calling sessions to learn more about these and other developments.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Our largest customers have complex networks and sometimes the default configuration does not match their network needs. Customers can now choose which <STRONG>Microsoft Cloud Media Processor/Relays</STRONG> they will use by default. This will improve performance for those organizations.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Direct Routing allows the routing of calls to 3rd party systems. Occasionally this would generate a “false positive” missed call in Teams. We now can <STRONG>suppress unwanted missed call messages</STRONG> which provides a better experience for calling users. Read more about the feature <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/direct-routing-call-notifications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>SIP tester</STRONG> - PowerShell scripting is now available to test Session Border Controller (SBC) connections in Microsoft Teams. Get feedback on your configuration right away.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>The <STRONG>Ringback Bot</STRONG> helps with unexpected silence when call setup is delayed. 2 distinctive audio signals are played to the caller. The first indicates that Teams is in the process of establishing the call and the second is played after the call is established.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Direct Routing Usage Reporting</STRONG> allows administrators to see additional calling details. The information can be used for planning, investigation and troubleshooting. These reports can also be exported as an Excel file.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Survivability and Call Quality using SD-WAN</STRONG> is top of mind for customers and we could not agree more. This enables dynamic call rerouting to alternate links if the main connection is not available and also improves calls by routing new calls between links based on quality telemetry. We are working with Oracle now to enable SD-WAN solutions such as these for Phone System and Direct Routing. Expect more news early next year.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\">Partner News at Ignite</FONT><BR />Direct Routing relies on certified session border controllers to enable Microsoft and our partners to ensure a better overall calling experience and streamlined customer support. Today we are excited to announce new partnerships with Cisco, <STRONG>Ericsson</STRONG>, <STRONG>Nokia</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Metaswitch</STRONG> that expand on our base of supported systems from existing partners such as Audiocodes, Oracle, Ribbon, TE-Systems (Anynode), and Thinktel. We encourage customers to reach out to any of our SBC partners to learn more about how they can enhance Direct Routing - deploying calling in Teams has never been easier.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Building on our Direct Routing announcements, Microsoft is also working to ensure that Teams integrates seamlessly with industry leading <STRONG>cloud contact center</STRONG> providers. We’re pleased to see partners announced earlier this year such as Five9, Genesys, and NICE inContact are <STRONG>on track to deliver their solutions for broader availability in early 2020</STRONG>. We’re also excited to share that we are expanding to additional partners as part of our <STRONG>new Certified for Microsoft Teams program for connected contact center solutions</STRONG>. These connected contact center solutions will enable customers to leverage the full power of the partner offering, while making it easy for agents to seamlessly find and consult with subject matter experts who are using Teams. When combined with new experiences leveraging the Teams Platform, customers will benefit from every user in their organization being able to more collaboratively connect with customers and leverage Teams as a hub for internal and external communications.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Earlier this year we announced engagements with ASC, NICE, and Verint as initial providers for compliance recording solutions for Teams calling and meetings. Today, we’re pleased to see those partners <STRONG>on track to deliver their solutions for broader availability in early 2020</STRONG>, and we’re excited to share that we are engaging additional partners as part of our <STRONG>new Certified for Microsoft Teams program for compliance recording solutions</STRONG>. Certified for Microsoft Teams solutions for compliance recording will provide customers with secure, scalable, and automated recording capabilities for every Teams call and meeting, with flexible provisioning and administrative control.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Many of our enterprise customers are already taking advantage of Teams calling experiences. We will continue delivering innovative capabilities and expanding our partnerships to make Teams Calling a great fit for all customers. It’s the right time for customers to <A href=\"https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upgrade</A> from their PBX to gain the benefits of cloud calling as part of their unified Teams experience.</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:00:01 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"07baded069a584f6acc156bbeeb2f8c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Paul Cannon","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401927},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"Updated Adoption Assets for Microsoft Teams & Remote Work","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/updated-adoption-assets-for-microsoft-teams-amp-remote-work/ba-p/1236300","description":"<P>Our <A href=\"https://aka.ms/DriveAdoption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Driving Adoption community</A>&nbsp;here in the Tech Community is focused on supporting organizations and employees who are using all of Office 365, but especially during these unprecedented times, Microsoft Teams.&nbsp; I wanted to personally invite all of you to that forum and the resources we have there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Today we <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/driving-adoption-blog/updates-to-adoption-assets-for-microsoft-teams/ba-p/1235135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced updated guidance</A></STRONG> assets for Microsoft Teams and remote work including those detailed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Next week on March 25th</STRONG> we'll have our <A href=\"https://aka.ms/O365ChampionResources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monthly community call</A>.&nbsp; We will move our regularly scheduled topic and discuss instead remote work scenarios and guidelines for hosting virtual events which I think is timely.&nbsp; Please share information about this call broadly so we can support as many people as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Click through to our <A href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/driving-adoption-blog/updates-to-adoption-assets-for-microsoft-teams/ba-p/1235135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post</A> in that community to see a detailed listing of our downloadable assets, our Customer Success Kit and our Teams Quick Start playlist that includes the excellent video from&nbsp;<LI-USER uid=\"22236\"></LI-USER>&nbsp;that details our core best practices for rapid adoption of Microsoft Teams.&nbsp; Make sure to bookmark the short URL to our Teams Toolkit (<A href=\"https://aka.ms/TeamsToolkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://aka.ms/TeamsToolkit</A>) to ensure you are getting to the updated version that includes pages on remote work best practices from across Office 365.&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>It is also in that community that you will get updates about our Microsoft 365 learning pathways training solution.&nbsp; We are working on the multi-language release and content update for that free, customizable solution.&nbsp; You can learn more about the existing, generally available template at <A href=\"https://aka.ms/M365LP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://aka.ms/M365LP</A>&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>It is our sincere hope this assets will support you and your employees during this time while you are working remotely.&nbsp; Please give your feedback in the Driving Adoption community conversations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 20:38:14 +0000","feedId":8350,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"437b36492d3b0205fcc09ac6a09751ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Karuana Gatimu","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598313401923},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:56:41","title":"10 ways shift workers can use Teams","link":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/10-ways-shift-workers-can-use-teams/ba-p/1102194","description":"<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Microsoft Teams is the only platform with tailored capabilities to connect everyone in your company, from the C-suite to the firstline, in one digital workspace.

Connect everyone in your organization with several options for communication</FONT></STRONG> <BR />Alongside communication features such as chats, video calls and conversations organized by topic (aka channels), <STRONG>Walkie Talkie</STRONG> is a new push-to-talk experience in Teams that enables clear voice communication over the cloud, turning employee or company-owned smart phones and tablets into a walkie talkie. </FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">This native capability consolidates the devices and apps that Firstline Workers use daily, and reduces the need for purchasing, provisioning and managing costs for IT. Walkie Talkie already works with the teams and users that you’ve already configured, and this feature securely eliminates cross-talk or eaves-dropping from outsiders. And since Walkie Talkie functions over Wi-Fi or cellular, this capability can be used across geographic locations.

These advancements encompass new powerful features, allowing IT admins to simplify, customize, and automate Teams device management. With these new capabilities, not only can admins now rely on Teams Admin Center to view all their Teams devices, they can also perform all of the device management tasks there, in a single location.</P>\n<P><BR />We are empowering admins by surfacing the data and controls that enable proactive device management, automating procedures, consolidating all management settings, configurations, and troubleshooting to help admins manage their devices with greater granularity and efficiency. <BR />These capabilities are starting to roll out to customers now.</P>\n<P><BR />Let us take a closer look at the new features.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Simplifying Teams device setup</FONT> </STRONG><BR />After unboxing the device, plug in the cables, and power it on. Depending on the device and its usage, users will login using either their personal corporate Teams credentials or those assigned to the device as a resource account (click to learn more on <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-configure-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">configuring Meeting Rooms</A>).</P>\n<P><BR />Once the device is signed in, people can start using it right away. Simultaneously, the device is <STRONG>automatically enrolled</STRONG> into Teams Admin Center, so administrators can begin managing it immediately. For IP phones and collaboration bars, this same process enrolls the device into Microsoft Endpoint Manager as well (with the account Intune license).</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Microsoft%20Teams/signintoteams.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><FONT size=\"5\"><STRONG>One place for granular device management</STRONG></FONT><BR /><A href=\"https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teams Admin Center</A> is the admin’s single portal to manage all their Team devices and ensure they are always up to date and ready for use, admins can use the Teams Admin Center to <STRONG>track and manage their inventory</STRONG> for a scaled management operations.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Admins can organize their view using filters, see device details and current device health status, or view in-depth activity and call quality data, as well as take necessary actions for any device.<BR />They can also take actions like export the entire list for offline analysis, download logs, change device settings, and perform or schedule tasks as restarting a device.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>We’ve also added the ability to <STRONG>automatically update</STRONG> phones and collaboration bars, ensuring software remains up to date. Previously, when Microsoft released a certified update through the Teams Admin Center, administrators would manually push the update to devices deployed in their tenants. To make this even easier, we’ve given admins the option to allow devices to automatically receive and apply updates. You can define how an update is managed for each device individually, by adjusting its auto-update settings in the Teams Admin Center.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/admin1.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>To help admins save time and efficiently roll out a fleet of devices, they can use the Teams Admin Center to perform <STRONG>bulk actions</STRONG> like applying device settings and restarting devices.</P>\n<P><BR />Bulk tasks become more efficient with the new <STRONG>tagging</STRONG> capability, giving admins the option of adding tags to group devices by categories like department, location, or any other grouping context used in their organization. Tagging simplifies device management by granting admins the ability to filter devices by any tag or combination of tags, and complete tasks for multiple devices at once.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/admin2.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Proactively inspect device health</FONT></STRONG><BR />To ensure a meeting will run successfully we want to make sure every device is powered on and available for use. For this purpose, the Teams Admin Center provides device health status. From the device inventory view, admins can easily <STRONG>inspect the health status</STRONG> for any device and filter easily to find the devices that need attention. Additionally, for Teams Rooms, admins can also inspect if any peripheral device, like a camera or display is disconnected, right from within Teams Admin Center. Admins now have the insight they need to take proactive actions so that user productivity is not impacted.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/admin55.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>Another key element to ensure a meeting will run successfully is the call quality of the meeting participants’ devices. To help identify call quality issues and resolutions, Admins can now view call quality data for the meeting. From device inventory view, click on any device to see details of the call quality for last 7 days. Admins can also drill into individual meetings where the call quality was poor by going to Activity tab in details page.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/lithium/Teams/admin4.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG><FONT size=\"5\">Secure device management access and delegate administration to partners</FONT></STRONG><BR />Managing devices in Teams Admin Center is designed to be simple and intuitive; however, we understand some of our customers rely on outside support.
