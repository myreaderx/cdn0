{"code":1,"isDone":false,"toInsertArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","title":"Samsung’s got a new budget 5G handset and a fitness tracker with a two-week battery","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039317","description":"<p class=\"p1\">Yesterday’s overflow Galaxy Unpacked event was about one thing and one thing alone: the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/samsungs-new-galaxy-fold-arrives-september-18-for-2000/\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>. Honestly, it was a bit anticlimactic after its predecessor found Samsung unveiling five new devices. But the singular focus wasn’t for lack of new stuff to show off. In fact, the company just unleashed <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-marks-a-new-era-of-innovation-with-virtual-experience-life-unstoppable\">a whole slew of new products</a> across a wide range of categories, including a gaming monitor, charging pad, refrigerator and washing machine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are two in particular I’d like to break out here, however: the new Galaxy Fit 2 band and A42 5G handset. The latter in particular is worth highlighting, given the company’s huge push into 5G this year. Samsung is betting big on pushing early and hard on the next-generation wireless tech.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Early this year, the company announced that it would be standardizing 5G across its flagship products. The company has also made a major push toward embracing the tech on its budget devices, including the A7 and now the A42. 5G hasn’t quite turned out to be the market correction the industry was banking on, due in no small part to a slowdown in sales from the pandemic. Certainly few banked on that. But while <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has yet to announce a 5G iPhone (give it a month or two, mind), Samsung’s already loaded up.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">And importantly, the A42 looks like it may be Samsung’s cheapest 5G offering (though we’re still waiting on exact pricing). Honestly, Samsung wasn’t particularly chatty about the device during an IFA-tied event. Though we do know there’s a quad-camera system and a 6.6-inch display. Honestly, one of the most remarkable things about 5G is how quickly affordable devices have hit the market, thanks in part to the efforts of component makers like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualcomm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"qualcomm\">Qualcomm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2039320\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039320\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039320\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039320\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Galaxy Fit 2 is notable mostly for the inclusion of a 15-day battery (per Samsung). It can autodetect five different kinds of workouts and monitors sleep. It’s nice to see Samsung still offering something up to the dwindling tracker market, even as its (and the world’s) focus has clearly shifted over to smartwatches.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 21:36:50 +0000","feedId":1800,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg","linkMd5":"fd92054364d35ea614c5247940efa43f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-30-09-369_3e81a22fd5e99872.webp","destWidth":4500,"destHeight":3000,"sourceBytes":1906970,"destBytes":128766,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LifeUnstoppable_pr_dl5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-30-09-369_3e81a22fd5e99872.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-31-32-560_0618c2fad5fcd754.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=pq4XvprRnlU:qBZn6lg-5K4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn29@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-31-32-585_2982419e770385be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-31-32-608_8bd070eb6d7b3a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287408467},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","title":"FB Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky is coming to Disrupt","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2036717","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/stan-chudnovsky\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"stan-chudnovsky\">Stan Chudnovsky <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/chathead-of-product/\">last spoke at Disrupt</a> in 2016, so we&#8217;ve got a lot to catch up on.</p>\n<p>Chudnovsky remains in charge of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Messenger — his current title is VP of Messenger — so he can tell us more about how the product has evolved at this year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=fbmessenger&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=fbmessenger&#38;display=TRUE\">Disrupt 2020 on September 14-18</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/facebooks-social-zoom-competitor-messenger-rooms-goes-live-globally/\">the launch of Messenger Rooms</a>, a service that allows you to start and join video calls from within Facebook or Messenger (and eventually other Facebook products). The product&#8217;s appeal is pretty easy to see in a time of social distancing, but Facebook still has a long way to go if <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/facebook-updates-messenger-rooms-as-zoom-sits-at-top-of-the-app-store/\">it wants to challenge Zoom</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;ve also seen increasing scrutiny about the role that messaging apps can play in spreading hate speech and misinformation.

It’s not for lack of hype, of course. Years of prelude punctuated by Samsung’s own breathless expectations provided plenty of build-up, but in the end, the device felt like a partially baked disappointment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A number of early units broke for a variety of reasons. Samsung recalled the foldable, went back to the drawing board and released it on a delayed timeline. I ran into issues with my second sample pretty quickly. At the end of the day, the device just demanded a level of gingerliness most users can’t really afford with a day-to-day mobile device.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xrPStPEVPN\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/my-galaxy-fold-display-is-damaged-after-a-day/\">My Galaxy Fold display is damaged after a day</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;My Galaxy Fold display is damaged after a day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/my-galaxy-fold-display-is-damaged-after-a-day/embed/#?secret=xrPStPEVPN\" data-secret=\"xrPStPEVPN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Galaxy Fold Z 2, which was the centerpiece of today’s Unpacked annex event, is largely devoted to addressing the biggest complaints about the original. Given the issues with the original, that’s about as admirable a goal as any. We were all aware that the Galaxy Fold was going to be a learning process for Samsung — and certainly there’s a certain degree of throwing caution to the wind — but relative to the company’s other device, it just didn’t feel finished.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038031\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038031\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038031\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038031\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We certainly didn’t feel comfortable advising people to purchase the device for $2,000. The Fold Z 2 is priced the same (which is to say still prohibitively expensive for most), but it could be the product the first gen should have been. I’m going to wait until we’ve had sufficient review time to say anything definitive about the device, but in Samsung’s defense, the company does seem to have addressed most of the major issues with the original — thanks in no small part to some advances introduced with Flip last year.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ca1zBuQRMX\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/living-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip/\">Living with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Living with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/living-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip/embed/#?secret=ca1zBuQRMX\" data-secret=\"ca1zBuQRMX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The biggest update here is the addition of what the company calls “Ultra Thin Glass” to the primary foldable 7.6-inch display. That was one of the largest pain points of the original — as cool as the technology is, it’s not worth a lot if the touchscreen can’t withstand touches. The technology here is more or less the same as what Samsung introduced with the Flip.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038072\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038072\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038072\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The same goes for the new “sweeper” technology, which builds in a brush to wick away particles that might otherwise fall into the phone. This was another issue with the original — crap was getting behind the screen, causing damage when pressure was applied to the front by the user. This is the third-generation of the feature, according to Samsung, sporting a thinner brush than the original. Per the company:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">To achieve this, Samsung developed new innovative sweeper technology to achieve the same level of protection in a smaller space. The Galaxy Z Fold2 Hideaway Hinge features revolutionary slim cutting technology, modified fiber composition and adjusted fiber density.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s a fancy way of saying they made thinner bristles. The hinge has also been improved to allow the device to stand at a variety of angles. That’s going to be an important point as the company looks to compete directly with the likes of Microsoft’s Surface Duo and any other dual-screen devices coming down the road. That’s augmented by Flex Mode (another Flip addition), which reconfigures the screen to make the best use of the partially open display.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038026\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038026\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-7.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038026\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other big update here is the addition of a much larger front-facing screen. At 6.2 inches, the front of the device is actually a serviceable display for use while the device is closed. Last time around, the front-facing screen had a weirdly long aspect ratio and wasn’t really great for anything but notifications. The company seemingly took something away from Huawei’s first dip into the foldable category.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Fold has 5G support, of course — that’s now standard across the company’s flagships, along with some mid-tier devices. That’s coupled with a beefy 4,500 mAh of battery life (split in two, each behind a display), 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There’s only one memory/storage option for the device for the States, which will run $2,000.</p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2038073,2038072,2038071,2038070,2038069,2038066,2038065,2038064,2038063,2038052,2038051,2038050,2038034,2038036,2038041,2038042,2038039,2038037,2038053,2038054,2038055,2038057\"]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That entitles the buyer to the Galaxy Z Premier service, which includes on-demand support for the phone and a one-time replacement after accidental screen damage. There’s also a bunch of other perks thrown in, like Founders Card membership and access to golfing, or dinner at a Michelin-star restaurant. I would have preferred a pair of Galaxy Buds, to be honest, but Samsung’s really pushing the luxury angle here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is up for pre-order September 2, and starts shipping on the 18th.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 14:00:04 +0000","feedId":1800,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif","linkMd5":"2277aa900de416058136e0e989315fda","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":73357696,"destBytes":1797122,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif":null,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn88@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-31-33-616_ca920ffb051a00d0.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-7.gif":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-31-32-623_e7fecbd1573fd4ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn94@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-31-32-611_bc1f64732078fe24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-31-32-608_8bd070eb6d7b3a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599287408467},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:30:08","title":"OrCam Technologies co-founder Amnon Shashua to speak at Sight Tech Global","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039140","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If the measure of progress in technology is that devices should become ever smaller and more capable, then <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/orcam-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"orcam-technologies\">OrCam Technologies <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is on a roll.

Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, the single-largest acquisition of an Israeli company ever. This year, Shashua received the <a href=\"https://www.dandavidprize.org/laureates/2020/future-artificial-intelligence/prof-amnon-shashua\">Dan David Prize (Future Category)</a> for his work in artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Shashua started OrCam at the prompting of his aunt, who was losing her sight and hoped that her technologist nephew could apply his prodigious talents as a scientist and AI expert to help. With that goal in mind, he started OrCam in 2010 with co-founder <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mr-ziv-aviram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mr-ziv-aviram\">Ziv Aviram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.

At $3900 per device in the U.S., the OrCam MyEye is far from affordable for most people, but the firm says the device price will come down as production increases.</p>\n<p>At the start of a new era for assistive technology, OrCam’s approach with the lightweight, offline-operating OrCam MyEye is nothing if not thought provoking (the device was recognized as a <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2019/5733047/orcam-myeye-2/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2019/5733047/orcam-myeye-2/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1599117470022000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHi749dV-HgyJFKrZkdtKATJbFUEg\">TIME Best Invention of 2019</a>). Will miniaturization of sophisticated sensors and electronics lead to unobtrusive sensor arrays as the foundation of assistive tech? Will the AI-based natural-language processing lead to an all-purpose, customizable personal assistants that work with abilities as needed?</p>\n<p>“In OrCam’s roadmap,” says Shashua, “the ultimate AT must have the right balance between computer vision and natural language processing. For example, the “smart reading” feature recently launched harnesses NLP (natural language processing) in order to guide the device to which text information to extract and communicate to the user. NLP allows the user to specify precisely what he/she needs to know. For example, the “orientation” feature recently launched allows the user to prompt the device to describe the objects in the scene and to provide audible guidance to those objects. We see the “orientation” feature growing with respect to vocabulary, with respect to search (e.g., “notify me when you see a Toilet sign”), and with respect to obstacle avoidance (where is the free-space in the scene). The technological challenge in bringing these desires into reality critically depends on the progress of compute and algorithms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By &#8216;compute,'&#8221; says Shashua,  &#8220;I mean the ever-growing trend to miniaturize processing power enables more sophisticated algorithms to reside on smaller and battery-powered footprint. By “algorithms” I mean the ever-increasing sophistication of deep-tech to mimic human intelligence. Combining the two creates a powerful impact on the future of assistive tech for people who are blind and visually impaired.”</p>\n<p>Shashua received a B.Sc in mathematics and computer science from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tel-Aviv University\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel-Aviv_University\">Tel-Aviv University</a> in 1985 and his M.Sc in computer science in 1989 from the <a title=\"Weizmann Institute of Science\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizmann_Institute_of_Science\">Weizmann Institute of Science. </a><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"></sup>He received a Ph.D in brain and cognitive sciences in 1993 from the <a title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), while working at the <a title=\"Artificial intelligence\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/\">Sight Tech Global</a> is a virtual event on December 2-3 and attendance is free. <a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/conference-registration/\">Pre-registration is open now. </a></p>\n<p>Sight Tech Global <a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/sponsorship-opportunities/\">welcomes sponsors</a>.

CEO Maryam Ghahremani told me that the founders&#8217; idea — using smartphones to stream live video journalism — made them &#8220;very, very much ahead of their time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, being ahead of your time isn&#8217;t always a good thing, and Ghahremani that the company has also struggled with having &#8220;too little capital&#8221; (although it <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/about/press-center/nasdaq-stockholm-welcomes-bambuser-first-north\">publicly listed on Nasdaq First North</a> in 2017) and also with turning its technology into a great product and a scalable business model.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>So Ghahremani was brought on to change all that two years ago. She told me she soon saw an opportunity in the growth of live video shopping, particularly in China, with potential clients starting to ask whether Bambuser had any products for this.

The company&#8217;s offering has been used by brands including H&#38;M, Motivi, Moda Operandi, Frame, LUISAVIAROMA and Showfields, and it says that in Q2, net sales were up 669% year-over-year.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038503\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038503\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2038503\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Bambuser CEO Maryan Ghahremani\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bambuser CEO Maryam Ghahremani (Image Credits: Bambuser)</p></div></p>\n<p>While e-commerce and social media platforms are expanding their support in this area, Ghahremani said brands are turning to Bambuser because they want to offer a live shopping experience while still owning the brand experience, the customer data and the transaction itself.</p>\n<p>She also emphasized that Bambuser is focused on being a business-to-business product, rather than a consumer shopping platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are trying to create not another Instagram or Facebook or marketplace, because we believe other [companies] are already doing that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not even interested in going into that battle.

Back in June of last year, the company said that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/facebook-watch-140-million-daily-users-1203239304/\">720 million people</a> were watching at least one minute of Watch content every month.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Rajwat noted that while Watch is built on &#8220;the social layer of Facebook,&#8221; with videos shareable across Facebook&#8217;s many products, the views are happening on Watch itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is super critical for us to have a destination,&#8221; he said, keeping videos from popular creators and publishers separate from the core Facebook experience of interacting with friends and family. &#8220;The moment we mix them together, it becomes a completely different product for people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rajwat added that the company isn&#8217;t just looking at overall audience size. He argued that when you look at &#8220;the reactions and comments and shares&#8221; you can see that &#8220;the content we have is working.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/facebook-watch-growth-stats-questioned-by-advertisers.html\">Advertisers have wondered</a> about the true extent of audience engagement on Facebook Watch.)</p>\n<p>Last year, as tech and media companies were all investing heavily to launch their own streaming services,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/facebook-watches-how-its-done/\"> we argued that Facebook&#8217;s efforts with unscripted shows and older content</a> seemed pretty lackluster in comparison. But it sounds like the content that&#8217;s working on Watch isn&#8217;t the kind of thing you&#8217;d find on Netflix or Disney+ — as Rajwat put it, &#8220;The angle we&#8217;ve taken is to focus more on content that is around social topics to drive conversations.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2039566\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039566\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2039566\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?w=340\" alt=\"Facebook Watch\" width=\"340\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Watch_EN.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>\n<p>For example, there&#8217;s &#8220;Red Table Talk&#8221; from Jada Pinkett Smith and family, a talk show that <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/jada-pinkett-smith-brought-herself-to-the-red-table-as-1844341004\">made headlines over the summer</a> for bringing Will Smith and Jada together to discuss their marital issues. Facebook plans to launch another version of Red Table Talk in October, &#8220;Red Table Talk: The Estefans,&#8221; with Gloria Estefan, her niece Lily and her daughter Emily.</p>\n<p>As another example of a successful original Facebook Watch show, Rajwat pointed to &#8220;Returning the Favor,&#8221; an Emmy-winning program where host Mike Rowe showcases everyday heroes.</p>\n<p>Rajwat said that live programming has increased significantly during the pandemic. That includes live sports, with 13.7 million people watching the UEFA Champions League final, making it the most popular football broadcast ever on Facebook Watch.
