I&#8217;ll walk you through how to easily get started with that here.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a security expert or server guy, so this was both an interesting exercise for me, as well as documenting it so anyone else can quickly do it as well. Including some hiccups, it only took me 20-30 minutes in total.</p>\n<h2>Getting a certificate</h2>\n<p>There are a number of authorities selling certificates, but in my experience, the easiest one to get started with is <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>. It&#8217;s also free, and has a number of major sponsors behind it, such as Mozilla, Chrome, Akamai and Cisco.</p>\n<p>Fastest way of generating a certificate for your web site, through Let&#8217;s Encrypt, is using <a href=\"https://www.sslforfree.com/\">SSL For Free</a>. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can choose Automatic FTP Verification or Manual Verification.</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.sslforfree.com/\" title=\"SSL verification\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1444/25920396823_7c8349895b_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"111\" alt=\"SSL verification\" class=\"align-center\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSL Certificate for your site</li>\n<li>Private key for your certificate</li>\n<li>CA/Chain Certificate</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installing the certificate</h2>\n<p>Then, depending on your hosting provider, type of service you have or if you&#8217;re hosting it on your own, there are varying approaches. In my case, I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https://mediatemple.net/\">Media Temple</a> for this web site, and they were very helpful on Twitter and in their online support chat to point me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>All I needed to do was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Account Center for my web site. Just as Media Temple has one, I&#8217;m sure it applies for most of your hosting options</li>\n<li>Choose to import a SSL Certificate, adding the SSL Certificate, Private key and CA/Chain Certificate I got before.</li>\n<li>Success!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok, no. 3 is kind of a lie. When I entered my key in step 2 I just got an error saying my Private key was invalid. Exasperated as you can only get when you work with computers, I panicked a bit and then reached out to see what the issue might be. Then Media Temple&#8217;s support gave me the excellent pointer to <a href=\"https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/error-adding-cert-invalid-private-key/5167\">Error adding cert, Invalid private key</a> discussion on the Let&#8217;s Encrypt forum.</p>\n<p>Turns out you need to convert your private key to RSA format, which is swiftly done in a terminal using this line:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml\">sudo openssl rsa -inform pem -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem -outform pem | less</pre>\n<p>Naturally, chance domain and paths above accordingly. Then copy the output and put in/save as your private key.</p>\n<h3>More advanced setups</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running your own server, or a VM somewhere or just don&#8217;t have the simple account center options for your host, I recommend taking a look at these articles for a manual install:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://timkadlec.com/2015/12/taking-lets-encrypt-for-a-spin/\">Taking Let&#8217;s Encrypt for a Spin</a> by Tim Kadlec</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/articles/7435\">Switching to https</a> by Jeremy Keith</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Validating your certificate installation</h2>\n<p>Once installed, a simple way of validating your certificate is using the <a href=\"https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html\">SSL Checker</a> to find out about any potential issues. Then when you visit your web site using <code>https://</code> everything should show up fine and be secure. That&#8217;s seldom the case in real life, though. Watch out for mixed content, i.e. serving some of your content over <code>https://</code> and some over <code>http://</code>. None of the content over <code>http://</code> will show up.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong> Do NOT use relative paths/protocol-relative URLs, i.e. <code>/css/style.css</code>. It opens up for possible Man-on-the-side attacks, and besides, from <code>http://</code> you can always request <code>https://</code> assets, but not vice versa.</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertnyman/26523272555/in/dateposted-public/\" title=\"SSL padlock, Chrome Mobile\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1705/26523272555_d35e0d13e1_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"506\" alt=\"SSL padlock, Chrome Mobile\" class=\"align-center\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Once secure, in all web browsers, you should also see the padlock icon next to your URL in the address bar. If that doesn&#8217;t show, use the great service <a href=\"https://www.whynopadlock.com/index.html\">Why No Padlock?</a> to figure out what your issues might be. My bet is that you&#8217;ll spend 1% of the time changing your own internal references to <code>https://</code>, then the remaining 99% figuring out about third-party content and how to securely include that.</p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertnyman/26250418370/in/dateposted-public/\" title=\"SSL padlocks, Chrome, Firefox &#38; Safari\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1663/26250418370_6011bda986_z.jpg\" width=\"322\" height=\"640\" alt=\"SSL padlocks, Chrome, Firefox &#38; Safari\" class=\"align-center\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h2>Forcing SSL/HTTPS for all requests</h2>\n<p>Once your web site is secure and safe and running HTTPS smoothly, there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t make sure that all requests go through SSL.</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"http://www.besthostratings.com/articles/force-ssl-htaccess.html\">Force SSL/https using .htaccess and mod_rewrite</a>, here&#8217;s a snippet to add to your <code>.htaccess</code> file to ensure that:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml\">RewriteEngine On \nRewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 \nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.example.com/$1 [R,L]\n</pre>\n<p>Happy HTTPS-ing! It&#8217;s totally worth it. 🙂</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=EJs-6UocxWk:p8k5pYXJoPs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=EJs-6UocxWk:p8k5pYXJoPs:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=EJs-6UocxWk:p8k5pYXJoPs:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=EJs-6UocxWk:p8k5pYXJoPs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 14:00:24 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1444/25920396823_7c8349895b_z.jpg","linkMd5":"52c2437253a785e103bbc50e6ba6a114","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn62@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-12-51-199_3f4adb7e88434b45.webp","destWidth":638,"destHeight":111,"sourceBytes":29399,"destBytes":9656,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1444/25920396823_7c8349895b_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn62@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-12-51-199_3f4adb7e88434b45.webp","https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1705/26523272555_d35e0d13e1_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-13-11-901_3c53528cd72ff42b.webp","https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1663/26250418370_6011bda986_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn29@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-13-10-980_6507b57f68aa33b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=EJs-6UocxWk:p8k5pYXJoPs:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn56@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-13-12-982_bf4a23452ecda68f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170814},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"7 Google products with 1 billion users, AMP, The Physical Web, VR Symposium & more – Latest From Google #16","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2912","description":"<p>I&#8217;ve taken a little hiatus from writing here, so here goes with the first post of the year!

Developer Advocate! &#8220;Wait, I thought you already were that?&#8221; is the most common reaction. Allow me to tell my story.</p>\n<h2>How the Google journey began</h2>\n<p>Google recruiters had reached out to me over the years, and in Aug 2014 – if my memory serves me right – they queried about my interest in becoming a Developer Advocate for the Web at Google. I expressed my interest and we started Google&#8217;s detailed and granular assessment and hiring process. In my first call with HR, though, they informed me that this role was full-time in London. Not having an interest, nor possibility, to move to London I said that I couldn&#8217;t relocate but I would be happy to travel there every second week and work there then. I was met with &#8220;Unfortunately that&#8217;s not going to work out, you have to be based in the London office full-time&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Having worked remotely at Mozilla for close to 4 years at the time, and working with something like Developer Relations and having over 100 travel days per year for the (now) latest 8-9 years, to me personally it felt a bit off, and not necessary, with that requirement. Google can be pretty strict with its rules around this, though, and at least I appreciated that they were open with this at the outset of our discussions. I still don&#8217;t agree with that kind of requirement for this kind of role – working in an office together is great, but at the same time, working remotely is just fine as well – it rather depends on your team and manager. It is what it is, though. I respected Google&#8217;s decision and we stopped the process for becoming a Developer Advocate when it was clear that I wouldn&#8217;t move to London.</p>\n<p>Three weeks later, however, Google reached out and said they had an opening for a Program Manager doing Developer Relations for the Nordics (Sweden, Norway, Denmark Finland) for all developer-facing products, and that I could do it from the Stockholm office. Being still interested and wanting to get in at Google, I decided to go for the opportunity. Granted, it wasn&#8217;t for the web platform (only) but I figured it would be a good experience and an in.</p>\n<h2>Program Manager</h2>\n<p>I worked about 14 months as a Program Manager within Developer Relations, doing outreach around Android, Android TV, gaming, VR, startup coaching, web development and more. It was indeed an interesting experience, and to mainly meet Android developers to see what they were interested in; what the similarities were with web development, and where it were quite different. Most common questions, by far, from all types of areas where these two that I got almost daily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you please get me featured in the Play Store?</li>\n<li>Can you please sponsor my [conference/event/meetup/work/dog/something else]?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mostly it was great where I could help developers in any capacity. I realized that helping developers being successful, learning and overcoming hurdles is worth more to me than necessarily the platform. That said, at occasion I did feel useless since I don&#8217;t know Android development – I do know most other things around development and connecting the right people, though.</p>\n<p>One part that was cool was helping the VR team on a 20% basis, meeting really cool people and trying exciting experiences at GDC, Slush and more, and meeting top partners to Google in expensive hotel suites with VR rigs set up to show off their not-yet released games.</p>\n<p>In February 2016 I was going to go to London for a YouTube VR Symposium, and learned that the Web Developer Relations team at Google would have an offsite there just the day before. I had contemplated ways of moving into the Web DevRel team for a while –&#160;kind of finding my way home to the web and what my role had been as a Technical Evangelist at Mozilla for 4 years prior – so I rebooked my flight to London to arrive one day earlier so I could meet them.</p>\n<p>I remember standing outside a pub in London in the rain for about an hour, pitching to Ben Galbraith and Dion Almaer why I should move over into the Developer Relations team.</p>\n<h2>Moving to Web Developer Relations</h2>\n<p>Ben and Dion agreed with me, and a little over three years ago I moved into the Web Developer Relations team. When I moved, my new manager Paul Kinlan and I talked about possibly becoming a Developer Advocate or continuing as a Program Manager (everyone else on the team were Developer Advocates or Developer Relations Engineers). We looked at the descriptions for both work ladders, and at my level they seemed to be mostly about driving strategic initiatives and similar, so we decided I&#8217;d continue as a Program Manager.</p>\n<p>I spent about three years as a Program Manager, focusing on creating and driving various Programs for developer outreach. I got really good ratings and got promoted to the next level in my ladder – I&#8217;m quite organized and like control, so that side of Program Management was something I could relate to and deliver on.</p>\n<p>The role Program Manager is a peculiar one, though, and different from company to company. At some companies, I&#8217;ve learned, it&#8217;s more akin to being a Product Manager. At Google, I would say the focus is generally much more of an administrative one: creating and running processes, working with spreadsheets till you&#8217;re blue in the face, creating trackers, herding people and teams and more. For instance, for Chrome Dev Summit November 2018 I worked with representatives from 55 different teams, organizing the Forum space…</p>\n<p>Over time, though, I felt that my relation-building skills and developer outreach were less appreciated by the Program Manager ladder than the focus on processes and structure. Since my main drive and interest is communicating with and inspiring developers, I felt that got lost a bit along the way. So, I decided to, finally, explore what a move to a Developer Advocate would entail.</p>\n<h2>Becoming a Developer Advocate</h2>\n<p>Paul Kinlan – my manager –&#160;and I started exploring the paths to go through a so-called Ladder Transfer. There were a couple of ways that would apply, and what it resulted in was that I needed to list all the things I&#8217;ve done in the last three years which would match the Developer Advocate ladder: artefacts, evidence, results and impact. This was almost as much work as going for Promotion as Google (those who know, they know). I put together a 13-page document with all the things I&#8217;ve worked on since 2015, the results, and how each and everything in turn matched my level on on the Developer Advocate work ladder.</p>\n<p>When I had completed that doc, Paul Kinlan needed to write a statement about me and I needed Google supporters verifying the value and meaning of my work: those people were Addy Osmani, Dion Almaer, Ilya Grigorik and Paul Bakaus. Once I had all of that in place, all of this went to Google&#8217;s Hiring Committee – being transferred at Google is basically getting hired, again. The Committee look at all the materials and support statements, and then decide if they want to hire me in the new role as a Developer Advocate.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, all of these steps took a little while, but finally it went to the Hiring Committee who agreed I had proved my competence and impact, and I&#8217;m now a Developer Advocate at Google. Yay! &#x1f389;</p>\n<p>Thank you to Paul K, Addy, Dion, Ilya and Paul B for your help and support throughout all of this, and also to the various HR representatives who has guided me along the way.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go make the web better together!</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Vrc4aOKkLXQ:yElEZWBUvHk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Vrc4aOKkLXQ:yElEZWBUvHk:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=Vrc4aOKkLXQ:yElEZWBUvHk:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Vrc4aOKkLXQ:yElEZWBUvHk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 15:09:03 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA","linkMd5":"69e06fe8770ba7b0f36a43ada06d97b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1053,"destBytes":410,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=Vrc4aOKkLXQ:yElEZWBUvHk:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn73@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-13-10-845_dc9af9d596c00659.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170812},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"Travel in 2016","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2954","description":"<p>Travel.

In 2016, I traveled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>121</strong> days</li>\n<li><strong>203,078</strong> km</li>\n<li><strong>19</strong> countries</li>\n<li><strong>25</strong> cities</li>\n<li>On <strong>16</strong> trips</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know I am extremely fortunate to get to do all of this, and while I naturally miss my loved ones a ton when I&#39;m away, at the same time it is an enormous opportunity.</p>\n<p>When I travel I sleep very little. Because between work, conferences meetings, local transportation and more, I see it as my responsibility to see and do as much in the place I get to go to. To both show respect to the local people, culture and sights, but also to spread the word about the amazing humans and sights there are out there in the world.</p>\n<p>So, between lots of work and sleep deprivation, people mostly get to see the nice pictures I post on Facebook and elsewhere (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robnyman\">please add me as a Facebook friend if we know each other</a>). And I humbly hope that they inspire you to go and explore more of this fantastic world as well!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/339/31699528800_3215d2308e_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/575/31926469922_cd87b7235d_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/392/31233579834_996d5be889_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"3\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/419/31699528420_c0a5dbae96_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"4\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/453/31957054701_50d6985295_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"5\"></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=4wTWggXMyLA:9WjwTy0puys:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=4wTWggXMyLA:9WjwTy0puys:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=4wTWggXMyLA:9WjwTy0puys:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=4wTWggXMyLA:9WjwTy0puys:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 03 Jan 2017 12:19:56 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/339/31699528800_3215d2308e_z.jpg","linkMd5":"4466218811f2c35c2d2fa7f0bece5156","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-12-51-142_fe3cb4edf7be530d.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":36141,"destBytes":12464,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/339/31699528800_3215d2308e_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn85@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-12-51-142_fe3cb4edf7be530d.webp","https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/575/31926469922_cd87b7235d_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn50@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-13-11-076_46e1f3d906919f3f.webp","https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/392/31233579834_996d5be889_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn5@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-13-12-034_8979f08c63e4a754.webp","https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/419/31699528420_c0a5dbae96_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn22@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-13-10-998_fb6bc6b8d2b1c32a.webp","https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/453/31957054701_50d6985295_z.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn25@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-13-12-008_37449f5b87a17fa9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=4wTWggXMyLA:9WjwTy0puys:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-13-10-804_08541de4dd2715de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170813},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"All main announcements and videos from Google I/O 2016","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2943","description":"<p>Last week we held our big <a href=\"https://events.google.com/io2016/\">Google I/O developer conference</a>, and I thought I&#8217;d share links to the main announcements and links to the talks.</p>\n<h2>Main announcements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/io-building-next-evolution-of-google.html\">Google Assistant &#38;

So, with that in mind, I need to start this blog post with saying that it doesn&#39;t reflect the opinions of my employer, Google, but are all my own.\n</p>\n<p>Ok, now that that&#39;s out of the way, I want to talk about the state of the web, and what it&#39;s like for developers, and I do hope to bring some nuance and perspective to the discussion.</p>\n<p>My background is that I&#39;ve worked almost 20 years on the web now, blogging here since 2005, creating and contributing to open-source projects, being a part of the Mozilla Community and working there for three and a half years, and now being one of the members of the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board\">MDN Product Advisory Board</a> and working at Google with Developer Relations around the web. I have given presentations in 42 countries and spent the last decades working with developers, communities and companies all over the world.</p>\n<p>And the reason I&#39;m telling you this is that I believe I have a fairly good insight into what developers are struggling with, and the trends I&#39;m seeing. And what I see is that there is a big knowledge gap and split between top developers and all the other regular developers, which I think is bigger than ever before. Building really good experiences on the web has become gradually harder for each year that has gone by.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s this mindset that it&#39;s supposed to &#34;be hard&#34; to build things. You should earn your scars, it should hurt like a b… rowser. And talking about browsers, you should know the ins-and-outs of everything in them and how they render things to be a truly good developer. And any tool, if it&#39;s not technically excellent in the eyes of the elite, is frowned upon and mocked. From FrontPage to Dreamweaver to WordPress to jQuery to [current framework fights]… you name it. I&#39;m not pretending that I&#39;ve been any better in this aspect. For instance, when a Swedish travel site with not the best technical results won the Sweden&#39;s Best Web Site award <a href=\"https://robertnyman.com/2007/12/05/vingse-being-swedens-best-web-site-i-think-not/\">I said I should emigrate</a>…</p>\n<p>But I just don&#39;t agree with that anymore. I think if you are in the top 1% and know all of those details and have worked on the web for 20 years, great! But I think it is critically important for anyone else who doesn&#39;t have that experience &#8211; or time, team resources or privileged environment to gain that knowledge &#8211; to have just as big of a chance to offer good experiences and do business on the web as well. We have to make sure the web offers an even playing field for everyone.</p>\n<p>I see way <em>way</em> too many examples from all over the world where the web is disregarded because it&#39;s too slow, too hard to build for, too hard to get started, and where closed platforms like Facebook or well-lit paths for native app developers instead becomes what they opt for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"amp\">AMP</h2>\n<p>Which leads me to AMP (<em>&ast;gasp&ast;</em>). I&#39;ve had the same general concerns as many other people about the Google URL and the Search carousel featuring, but knowing that team well and discussing with them on a regular basis, and seeing what they are working towards, I believe they have the best of intentions. With the URLs, as outlined in <a href=\"https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/improving-urls-for-amp-pages/amp/\">Improving URLS for AMP pages</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/963421066956820480\">statements from Malte Ubl</a> (the creator of AMP), I see this as a matter of time before it is sorted. And with the announcement of <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html\">Using page speed in mobile search ranking</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/953677965388275712\">Malte&#39;s discussion on it</a> I personally believe it&#39;s all moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I&#39;m really interested in the positive technical benefits AMP has offered developers and companies around areas like ease of developing and ensuring a really fast user experience. In particular, companies with small teams and/or not a super deep technical expertise are suddenly able to ship and build businesses! They can focus on the gist of what they want to create and communicate, and not get bogged down in granular API discrepancies, image optimization, feature detection and continually more and more complex tool chains.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve also seen a lot of data for developers having built AMP experiences which are a lot faster and help them make a lot more money than before. And that is something I believe is good for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking forward</h2>\n<p>So, looking forward, I just don&#39;t think we should think about how to make it easier for everyone on the web, I believe it is <em>our fundamental responsibility</em>. There will always be room for expert carpenters and wood workers, but that doesn&#39;t take away the fact that most people will be happy with IKEA, and it will offer all they need.</p>\n<p>And I don&#39;t know if AMP will be one of the solutions going forward, or if it will be something completely different, but I do believe we need to acknowledge what opportunities AMP has brought developers and seriously consider how we can offer that on the web as a whole.</p>\n<p>We can&#39;t be experts in our ivory towers with tons of hard-earned expertise, we need to listen to developers from everywhere and all kinds of different contexts, to truly learn what <em>they</em> need and not what we want to build.</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope that as we move forward we create a web that it is easy and inclusive for anyone to develop for, taking all varieties of needs and challenges people face into account.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=FJpahwbnCmg:H4jEypyh79o:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=FJpahwbnCmg:H4jEypyh79o:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=FJpahwbnCmg:H4jEypyh79o:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=FJpahwbnCmg:H4jEypyh79o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:20:36 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA","linkMd5":"bde412c4bca71f58e2cda2ea92a16e6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1053,"destBytes":410,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=FJpahwbnCmg:H4jEypyh79o:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-13-12-976_df3b9850b44ac61f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170812},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"YouTube Red  announced, what’s new in Android M for developers, New York Times delivers one million Cardboard – Latest From Google #11","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2887","description":"<p>YouTube Red subscription announced, what&#8217;s new in Android M for developers, New York Times delivers one million Cardboard and more!</p>\n<p>This is part 11 in the <a href=\"http://robertnyman.com/category/latest-from-google/\">Latest from Google series</a>.</p>\n<h2>YouTube Red</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1GjWklp\">YouTube Red was announced</a>!

Therefore, when I see or am part of initiatives that I think will help developers and the web platform out there, it makes me very excited! And last week I got very reminded about how good that thing can be.</p>\n<p>In October last year the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board\">MDN Product Advisory Board</a> was <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/18/mozilla-brings-microsoft-google-w3c-samsung-together-create-cross-browser-documentation-mdn/\">announced</a> together with its <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board/Membership\">charter</a>, and it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve discussed a long time. How we browser vendors and standards organization can all work together, combine our knowledge, experiences and resources, to help all web developers across the board with clear documentation and information through <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">MDN Web Docs</a>.</p>\n<p>To me, it&#8217;s not only a good thing to do, it&#8217;s the <em>right</em> thing to do. I genuinely believe that through sharing information to everyone, inspiring and helping people and building communities, we do our best to try and make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>And MDN Web Docs have an amazing reach with developers and engagement from contributors. In 2017 it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reached <strong>45%</strong> of the estimated global developer audience</li>\n<li>Had <strong>80,000</strong> content edits</li>\n<li>Had <strong>8,000</strong> contributors</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"london-january-2018\">London, January 2018</h2>\n<p> Since the Board was announced, we&#8217;ve had one video meeting &#8211; since we&#8217;re spread out all over the world &#8211; and set up a mailing list and Slack. The thing I was really looking forward to, though, was being able to get together in-person. The members of the list all have extensive experience working on the web, with most people on the board having successfully contributed to it for almost 20 years each. What happens when you get all these people in the same room? What will the chemistry and group dynamic turn out to be; will we have good discussions but no concrete outcome? Etc.</p>\n<p>Back at home again a few days after the meeting, I&#8217;m still on an optimistic high! I was so happy to see that we all got together really well, no one taking too much space, dominating the conversation or only pushing their ideas, but rather a fantastic level of jointly sharing a vision and goals I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. This, together with the amount of respect making sure everyone got heard, really listened to and respected for his/her opinions was something that made me very glad!</p>\n<p>It sounds like something you want to take for granted, but truly seeing and experiencing how everyone helped each other and offered their time and expertise to drive a topic or challenge forward is something you should always appreciate and hold on to.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1801/MDN-Advisory-Board-collage.jpg\"></p>\n<p>So, a big personal thank you to everyone on the Board for this!</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>Based on the discussions we had and planning we set up, we&#8217;re just in the process of going through and syncing our notes, to then continue with clear actions about improving MDN for everyone.

It means anything from Android to Cloud to Web to anything else that might be interesting. That was also paired with working with start-ups through various Google programs, and with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/experts/\">GDEs</a> (Google Developer Experts) and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/groups/\">GDGs</a> (Google Developer Groups) and developer communities in general.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a very interesting last 15 months and it has given me a lot of perspective about technology as a whole, web &#38; native, startups and what they&#8217;re working with, challenges for developers and what new developers choose to develop for and with.</p>\n<p>Two things I&#8217;ve missed, though, is a more clear focus on an area I know a lot about and love, and to act globally. I love the Nordics and the people there, but for me, knowing developers all over the world, it gives me fantastic learnings and views seeing different challenges, opportunities and mindsets from developers all around the globe.</p>\n<h2>Working with Developer Feedback and Communities</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve thought a bit about how to gain that focus and use my experience and background with the web, and all the gained knowledge and connections from there. At the same time, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_kinlan\">Paul Kinlan</a> reached out to me to see how we could work closer together, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgalbs\">Ben Galbraith</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dalmaer\">Dion Almaer</a> came to Google; Ben&#8217;s first time, and Dion returning. Sharing their passion about the web platform and what it means &#8211; and having followed the great work by both web developer relations under Paul Kinlan and the work of the Chrome Engineering &#38; Product team &#8211; it seemed like a natural move to get back to the web, full time.</p>\n<p>My new role at Google is working with Developer Feedback &#38; Communities for the web platform, including Chrome but also around the web as a whole. What do developers need from the web platform, what do they think it&#8217;s missing there that&#8217;s available on native, how can web browser vendors work together in building a web for everyone?</p>\n<p>I look forward to discussing the bigger picture, and also working with other web browser vendors to make sure we jointly move in the same direction of creating a great web platform for developers.</p>\n<h2>We lost something along the way</h2>\n<p>To me, the web is still the most democratic medium we have. Developers building things for virtually every platform available, based on standards and recommendations. Content that should be available and consumable no matter where you are in the world, and what kind of device you use.</p>\n<p>I think we lost something along the way with some mobile platforms, and the enormous focus on native apps. Separate codebases and teams, different store approvals, some things only available on one operating system. Remember the ease of just opening a web browser, putting in a URL and consuming the content? No mandatory app installs, different offers on different platforms and similar. That&#8217;s the premise of the web, and with Progressive Web Apps, through offline support, push notifications, installability and more, we are working hard on making the mobile web just as relevant and given in everyday life for people as it already is on desktop computers.</p>\n<p>The web and web browsers have improved tremendously, and the things you can now do on the web are fantastic. Performance, APIs and services are contstantly getting better, and it is a very exciting time to be building for the web.</p>\n<h2>Team members</h2>\n<p>With my new role, I&#8217;m part of a Developer Relations team led by Paul Kinlan, who has these excellent members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexanderdanilo\">Alex Danilo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/agektmr\">Eiji Kitamura</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake\">Jake Archibald</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbakaus\">Paul Bakaus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aerotwist\">Paul Lewis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/petele\">Pete LePage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_dodson\">Rob Dodson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sw12\">Sam Dutton</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samthor\">Sam Thorogood</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And also working closely together with other great web people at Google, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/addyosmani\">Addy Osmani</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/slightlylate\">Alex Russell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwilso\">Chris Wilson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/igrigorik\">Ilya Grigorik</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gauntface\">Matt Gaunt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_irish\">Paul Irish</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterlubbers\">Peter Lubbers</a></li>\n<li>+ many more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Talk to me</h2>\n<p>The web is extremely important, and I want to be a part of making sure it&#8217;s as useful and relevant for developers, content producers and users alike.</p>\n<p>As for Chrome, our main vehicles for checking current status and feedback/bugs are <a href=\"http://chromestatus.com\">Chromestatus.com</a> and <a href=\"http://crbug.com\">crbug.com</a>.

They want to solve problems in a good structured qualitative manner, suggest the best ways of doing it &#8211; sometimes opinionated, sometimes more broad &#8211; and constantly push the platform they work on to the limits of what it can do.</p>\n<p>The <strong>hacker developer</strong> type is similar to the super technical one, but in my experience, more solution-driven &#8211; whatever it takes &#8211; than necessarily the format of the solution.</p>\n<p>The <strong>teacher</strong> people find their motivation in being able to inspire and help people work with the platform, help them over hurdles and jumping through hoops, to succeed in what they are trying to to. Their main drive is more about the messaging and making sure people understand it and will grow from it.</p>\n<p>The final one is focused on <strong>people relations</strong>: this persona is usually closer to the teacher one than the others, in that they love to connect people, enable them through networking and connecting them with the right people and being responsive and making sure people are happy about what they do and don&#8217;t get stuck.</p>\n<p>Of course, most people working with Developer Relations don&#8217;t just match one of these personas, and they aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive, but I would say that most people I&#8217;ve met in DevRel are strongest in one of these four areas.</p>\n<h3>Titles</h3>\n<p>In terms of titles, the most common ones seem to be Technical Evangelist and Developer Advocate. I guess the intention of Evangelist would be that you bring out the word of the company, whereas Advocate is that you are supposed to be advocating the needs from external developers to help make your product(s) better for them to build on top of. As for the Evangelist title, I see it less nowadays, partly probably due to the religious connotation (no matter if you are religious or not, best not to confuse them) and that it implies more of a one-way communication than the desired bidirectional one.</p>\n<p>No matter the title, though, in my experience people&#8217;s behavior doing DevRel has been leaning more towards one or the other of the approaches, mostly independent of the title itself, which has been just fine.</p>\n<h3>Who are you?</h3>\n<p>My advice with personas and the way you want to do DevRel is to figure out who you are. Figure out who you <strong>really</strong> are.</p>\n<p>Find what you are good at and what you like. Hopefully they match. Find out how to be this person with everyone around you.</p>\n<p>I still struggle with this, almost everyday. I constantly keep on thinking I can do better, be better.</p>\n<h2>2. Developer Relations activities</h2>\n<p>There is a number of different activities you can do Developer Relations through, and generalizing, these are the more common ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaking at events</li>\n<li>Blogging &#38; documentation</li>\n<li>Writing and sharing code</li>\n<li>Social media</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Note that these are all outward facing; there&#8217;s another layer to this around internal work in your company, working with Engineering and Product teams around the platform, sharing developer feedback and more, which I won&#8217;t really cover here)</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking at events:</strong> What does speaking at events really mean to you? Are they great fun? Getting personal attention? Sharing knowledge? Or, are they a necessary evil? Do you cringe everytime you do it, but feel that you have to?</p>\n<p>To me, it means trying to inspire people, and being there for them. Taking the time to present, introduce or engage people in a certain topic, and then being around &#8211; in-person &#8211; for discussions, feedback and thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>Blogging &#38; documentation:</strong> I believe sharing knowledge and thoughts through blog posts and articles is key, and collectively we’re not doing enough of that. The written word is so <em>so</em> important, to make sure you can reach as many people as possible, they can read it in their own pace and ofthen their own language, they don&#8217;t have to scrub through a video to find a certain section, and much more.</p>\n<p>Documentation in general I would say lives on respective company&#8217;s developer site, or, in the case of the web, also in public collaborative places like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN Web Docs</a>. <em>Where</em> to blog, on the other hand, can be a bit more complicated. Most people seem to feel that if they blog on the company blog, theyre&#8217;re limited in what they can say, sometimes it becomes blogging-by-committee for legal/stakeholder reasons and the output is quite bland. And if you blog in your own web site or Medium channel, it&#8217;s great in the sense of freedom and building up your personal brand (which is usually harder in a company blog). But, there&#8217;s also the risk that that blogging and important content is tied to that specific person and when they leave the company, all that content is gone. And additionally, people&#8217;s personal blogs might feature company content and focus mixed with personal opinion posts that doesn&#8217;t always represent the company&#8217;s values.</p>\n<p>When I worked at Mozilla, and interesting phenomenon &#8211; in the spirit of being totally open and transparent &#8211; was that people people wrote public blog posts complaining or dissing the work of their colleagues and/ or another part or product at Mozilla. My take here is that openness is great, but also needs to be paired with personal respect and reaching out to people directly with your criticism, not just making it public directly. Also at Mozilla, I was the Editor for Mozilla Hacks for ~2 years. During that time we had lots of guest posts from external developers in the developer community, and I was really happy we could use that platform to share their knowledge and expertise to a broader audience. And this is something I think more companis could do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/Mozilla-Hacks.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Writing and sharing code:</strong> For a long time now, I would say that sharing code on GitHub is by far the most common, and also creating or contributing to frameworks for specific technologies. And I think that&#8217;s still a great platform for people to do that! Stack Overflow has been quite popular over the years as well, and a lot of people get concrete help there, but the signal-to-noise ratio has overall been a bit challenging.</p>\n<p>When you create and share code, I would say that the most important things are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to be open to feedback. You will get a lot of feedback and suggestions, and at the very least listen to it.</li>\n<li>Be constructive and respectful. Not everyone is that online, and sometimes the gut instict is to just be defensive or attack back. I&#8217;d urge you, if possible, to at least give disrespectful people an initial chance. I&#8217;ve experienced many situations, comments etc that, once I&#8217;ve responded respectfully and constructively, actually has led to quite good and rewarding discussions.</li>\n<li>There are always 100 ways to solve something. If you write code, how you structure your solution, there are many <em>many</em> ways you can build things. So when you get feedback on your things, or you give feedback on others&#8217; work, remember that there is never just one way of doing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Social media:</strong> When you have good code, content and documentation, naturally you want as many people as possible to see that. How to approach outreach and communication? Going out on Twitter is like crossing a floor filled with Lego…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/lego-foot.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You will be working hard to get attention for what you’ve done, and dor most of us, SEE ME! I ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY!</p>\n<p>And what it even harder is that snark, quick burns and petty attacks often get much more attention than quality content and a respectful tone. But still, don&#8217;t despair, keep on sharing good content. Don&#8217;t be tempted to lower your bar of behavior just for some quick likes. Personally &#8211; while you want to stand up for your work &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it helps anyone getting into fights in a public channel where no one will back down just for the very reason it&#8217;s public, and a level of territorial pride. Rather continue in-person or a video call, if possible, or over e-mail, but take disagreements out of the public space &#8211; unless you can keep it civil.</p>\n<h2>3. Measuring your work</h2>\n<p>Measuring Developer Relations is really hard. You can measure the easy things like X people at an event, Y people reading an article, Z people watching a video etc. But how do you measure the actual outcome?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/correlation.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This depends <em>a lot</em> on your product. Would or should you measure number of downloads for your product? Number of uses of your API? End users getting a better experience through big companies shipping your code or product? First of all, I&#8217;d strongly encourage you to have as much analytics of usage numbers as possible. Can you find a clear correlation between a blog post you did, documentation shared, event done etc with an uptake following that? And how do you know that the developers using, for instance, your API are using it because something you or your team did, compared to possible influence from other parts of your company?</p>\n<p>One important thing to point out here as well is that it&#8217;s not mainly about who should get credit for developers using something, but rather having enough data points to know which activities are most successful in helping developers adopting the best solutions.</p>\n<h3>Firefox DevTools and feedback</h3>\n<p>One more measurable outcome that I worked on at Mozilla was around Firefox Developer Tools &#38; UserVoice, which I started exploring because of a tip from a friend. Microsoft had used it for other areas before, and they started using it for their Edge browser later after this.</p>\n<p>The core approach was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let people give feedback and ideas</li>\n<li>Analyze and triage that feedback</li>\n<li>Compare it to other features on the roadmap, and prioritize it</li>\n<li>When developer community-suggested features were shipped, reconnect with them and the developer community to achieve a positive feedback loop</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/uservoice.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>With UserVoice, people could suggest ideas, vote on them and comment. And the main criteria were that it was simple to use, no sign-up or log-in needed, just an e-mail address. It also had a built-in search so for people creating new suggestions, it was matching ideas to see if there already existed a similar suggestion. It also had a general search, paired with official replies from Mozilla, with a direct contact and where we could indicate if an idea was Under Consideration, Shipped, Being Worked on or Declined. And even if we declined something, developers were happy because they got a reply! Better to know than to constantly wonder.</p>\n<p>And my favorite part was that, 6 weeks later and in line with the Firefox release cycle, the first features shipped! And we could publish blog posts, showing the community that 3 out of 5 of the new features were suggested and prioritized by them!</p>\n<p>And developers loved this, and in the big Vision Mobile survey that year, the number of web developers who said they used Firefox Developer Tools as<br />\ntheir primary toolset had increased 6%!</p>\n<p>I also gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0GZUCvfjHI\">keynote at Nordic.js in 2014</a> about this experience.</p>\n<h2>4. Feedback &#38; interacting with people</h2>\n<p>People are great! No, really, I&#8217;m not kidding! People are great! It just takes time to sometimes understand the many facets of interacting with people, from different approaches to their online persona and tone. People aren&#8217;t always logical, and many factors affect their behavior. A vast majority of people, though &#8211; once you actually take the time to listen to them &#8211; aren&#8217;t as bad as you think. It does take time and patience, however, staying calm and working hard to understand different perspectives. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t ever lose your temper, although I&#8217;m hoping most of you can stay calm. But just don&#8217;t explode directly, and not in public. Try and takie it easy, take a few breaths, get a second opinion from someone else to try and help you see things from another angle.</p>\n<p>But I would recommend giving people the benefit of a doubt as much as possble, to try and assume they are meaning well and that &#8211; in particular in DevRel business &#8211; they are not upset with <em>you</em>, as a person, but more likely about a technical issue they can&#8217;t solve, and sometimes misguidedly they express it towards you personally.</p>\n<p>And then of course everyone is your friend on LinkedIn. Like, everyone. And that&#8217;s ok. 🙂</p>\n<p>And wherever you work, whatever you do, there will always be feedback and opinions. Way <em>way</em> back when I started blogging in 2005, I got to hear so many times that “JavaScript isn’t a real language” and had to deal with that. When I worked at Mozilla, a lot of people came up to me at events, looked at their shoes, and mumbled something like &#34;I used to use Firefox, but… now I use Chrome&#34; and I would tell them that it was just fine! As long as they were using and enjoying the web!</p>\n<p>And at Google, as you can imagine, there are <em>a lot</em> of opinions about Chrome to other areas of Google working with completely different things (and idiots writing manifestos doesn&#8217;t help…).</p>\n<h3>Acknowledging people</h3>\n<p>Another key learning here is that people want, deserve and need to be seen and heard. In many cases, people just want to share their experiences or challenges, explain their problem and that you take the time to listen. If you can help, great; but if not, that&#8217;s just as fine. Because at least you listened, at least you tried.</p>\n<p><strong>DevRel is people business</strong></p>\n<p>And for me, interacting with people, meeting them in real life: <strong>this</strong> is what I get energy from. It&#8217;s so easy to get lost in e-mails, angry tweets, spreadsheets and more. But once I get to help and inspire people, I&#8217;m so happy and I see meaning in what I do.</p>\n<p>I would also strongly encourage you to find your real passion.</p>\n<p>DevRel is hard work, it can be very frustrating and it is a very unique mix of being technical and dealing with people. It can definitely take its toll on you, so make sure to find <strong>your</strong> passion</p>\n<p>But if we can make people feel like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/happiness.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Then we’re on to something<br />\nThen we’re doing something right</p>\n<h2>Have you tried listening? &#8211; video and slides</h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/mkFkCrEBihj9LH\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe></p>\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/251703595\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Qm_STpL0pnE:QuxdLBWJusQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Qm_STpL0pnE:QuxdLBWJusQ:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=Qm_STpL0pnE:QuxdLBWJusQ:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=Qm_STpL0pnE:QuxdLBWJusQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 14:22:15 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/Mozilla-Hacks.png","linkMd5":"03976a6efec93a9a4cef1bf0c0a3ac89","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-12-51-573_c713ad6390e4a66d.webp","destWidth":1145,"destHeight":564,"sourceBytes":105084,"destBytes":76928,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/Mozilla-Hacks.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-12-51-573_c713ad6390e4a66d.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/lego-foot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-14-819_bddaf04b4e3341b7.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/correlation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn21@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-13-14-090_a4c272d1ef961e1d.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/uservoice.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn90@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-13-11-471_01224f2a83f30e7a.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1809/happiness.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-13-11-563_5e6ccacee92f7afc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=Qm_STpL0pnE:QuxdLBWJusQ:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-13-11-160_89b47868e0b2b08c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170813},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"One million kilometers later","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2963","description":"<p>One million kilometers. That&#39;s a pretty long distance. Going through my travel statistics recently, I discovered that is how much I&#39;ve traveled during the last few years.</p>\n<p>This is what the overall stats look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>698</strong> days of traveling</li>\n<li><strong>1,126,866</strong> km</li>\n<li><strong>48</strong> countries</li>\n<li><strong>109</strong> cities</li>\n<li><strong>117</strong> trips</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;ve been extremely fortunate to get the opportunity to travel all over the world. To get to meet so many interesting people, and learn more about different cultures; learn about their opportunities and their challenges; their main motivations and their hardships. And I&#39;d like to believe this has helped me be a more understanding person, both for what the situation can be like for people, as well as appreciating all the amazing things I have in my life. And as part of it, I also feel that if I&#39;ve gone somewhere it&#39;s also my responsibility to educate people I meet about that place to breed better understanding and respect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Great-Wall.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Most of my trips have been work trips where I&#39;ve always made sure to take extra time to see and understand where I am, the history of that place, the nature and take in the enormous beauty there is in so many parts of the world. I&#39;m also very happy to have traveled with my family, and showing my children a number of places and teaching then about respect and compassion for people, animals and nature.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Beijing-Summer-Palace.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Another thing I think about is the impact on the environment. With my flights I&#39;ve tried to keep it to a minimum, meaning least number of connections, and fly with the more environmentally-friendly passenger airplanes (Boeing 787, Airbus 380). But I know planes still have a lot of exhaust, so I try to make up for it in other areas, like driving a hybrid car, eat more locally produced and ecological food, recycling and such. Small things, I know, but something at least.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Yogyakarta.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By now it kind of seems like a good-bye to travel and sum up what I&#39;ve done. Which isn&#39;t entirely true, but not false either. I&#39;ve been to so many places, and I&#39;ll continue traveling when it really makes sense or is important. But having had a number of years with 100+ days/year being on the road, I also want to spend more time at home with a more &#34;normal&#34; life. More family time, more evenings at home, more local things with friends, events and such. And I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get restless at one time or another, or when the travel bug will hit me again, but overall my estimate at least is that I&#39;ll travel less for quite a while now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robnyman/\"><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/instagram.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Also, if you like pretty pictures I share a bunch on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robnyman/\">Instagram</a> from all over the world, and I&#39;ve also started an <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertnyman/sets/72157689101772084/\">album on Flickr with Creative Commons-shared photos</a> you can look at and/or use.</p>\n<p>Travel is an extraordinary thing, and I encourage everyone to try and learn and understand as much about the world, its differences and all its wonderful people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Christ-the-Redeemer.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=5FNdXr5vzgI:KXVZWlmz574:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=5FNdXr5vzgI:KXVZWlmz574:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=5FNdXr5vzgI:KXVZWlmz574:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=5FNdXr5vzgI:KXVZWlmz574:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:09:33 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Great-Wall.jpg","linkMd5":"8337cc661e64316b5ea6367a8889f4ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-12-53-564_b6512780e5dc34b2.webp","destWidth":3036,"destHeight":3036,"sourceBytes":9452752,"destBytes":933026,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Great-Wall.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-12-53-564_b6512780e5dc34b2.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Beijing-Summer-Palace.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-13-15-037_3a28442d2b454c0e.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Yogyakarta.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-13-15-554_e6c3b1625d9d9789.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/instagram.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn45@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-13-13-156_02be02d41f50440a.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1000000-kilometers/Christ-the-Redeemer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-13-873_0187de47903c6028.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=5FNdXr5vzgI:KXVZWlmz574:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn93@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-13-10-853_cd28dd18a539fef7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170820},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"The End of the Star Wars Saga","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=3005","description":"<p>The year was 1983. I was 9 years old. I used to visit my paternal grandmother who lived in the city, and every time I came by she would take me to the movies, which was wonderful! It was the time when I learned to love both movies and cinemas.</p>\n<p>This time around, she told me she had heard about a space movie that was supposed to be good. It was called Return of the Jedi. So we went to the movie theater, got tickets and saw it. And naturally, it was fantastic! I was a small boy with wide eyes, and a new world opened up to me. This was my first encounter of any kind with the Star Wars universe.</p>\n<p>After this, my memory is a bit hazy. Since I loved the Return of the Jedi so much, we wanted to see the prior movies, and I *think* we went and saw the first (well, 4th chronologically): Star Wars: Episode IV &#8211; A New Hope. A number of years ensued with Star Wars toys and action figures, and a world I would dream myself away in.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I went with my daughters to see the final Star Wars movie. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Movie number 9 in the series, the ending to this epic saga. I&#8217;m not going to spoil the movie in any way, don&#8217;t worry. But I have to say it was a very special and emotional moment – 36 years later! – to finally see Star Wars come to an end, and to be able to share this with my daughters, who are both now older than what I was when I saw my first Star Wars movie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1912/Daughters.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Seeing the Lucasfilm logo and the the opening crawl come was definitely a goosebumps moment. End of an era.</p>\n<p>And I think, during all the circumstances, that it came to a decent and satisfying conclusion. Like Avengers: Endgame there are so many interesting characters which got way too little time to fully go through their respective character arcs or go deeper into their stories. Unfortunate but understandable. I wish the movie would have been 4 hours long, that it would have taken the time to slow down. It was a rabid pace and packed with events over the 2h 22 minutes it took place.</p>\n<p>That said, I think J.J. Abrams likely did the best he could with an extremely challenging situation. I feel content, and while it&#8217;s sad, I&#8217;m also happy that Star Wars has now reached its end.</p>\n<p>Thank you, George Lucas, for creating this amazing universe and for all the joy it has brought to me and my family&#8217;s lives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://robertnyman.com/images/1912/End.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=u75QC8PGGJ0:xmQrd6-Kr4M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=u75QC8PGGJ0:xmQrd6-Kr4M:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=u75QC8PGGJ0:xmQrd6-Kr4M:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=u75QC8PGGJ0:xmQrd6-Kr4M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:25:21 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"https://robertnyman.com/images/1912/Daughters.JPG","linkMd5":"bf883275ab102de0ae228149065a23a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-12-53-569_baa4902d18eb20ac.webp","destWidth":2938,"destHeight":3917,"sourceBytes":1516183,"destBytes":953636,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://robertnyman.com/images/1912/Daughters.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-12-53-569_baa4902d18eb20ac.webp","https://robertnyman.com/images/1912/End.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-14-785_677fd29672d8ecfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=u75QC8PGGJ0:xmQrd6-Kr4M:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-13-13-184_cd2fe3321fb694fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170810},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"The building for just one browser thing","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2972","description":"<p>When I got started with blogging back in 2005, I had been an interface developer for the web since 1999. The big challenges back in 2005 were convincing developers and companies to make sure that things worked in more than one web browser, and that JavaScript wasn&#39;t evil and actually pretty competent. And now, in 2018, it&#39;s back to the cross-browser support story again (JavaScript seems to be doing fine).</p>\n<p>Granted, 2018 has just started, so let&#39;s give it a chance. But in 2017 I saw a lot of web sites/apps released by a multiple of high-profile companies which only worked in one browser: Chrome. And it reminded me a lot of the days in 2005 where the story was the same, but just that back then web sites only worked in Internet Explorer (<code>document.all</code>, anyone?).</p>\n<p>Seeing this same story coming up again, I wanted to try and pinpoint the main reasons for why this happens, and also why it matters building for more than one web browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-people-only-build-for-one-web-browser\">Why people only build for one web browser</h2>\n<p>In 2005, Internet Explorer still had an enormous grip of the web browser market. In September 2002, the Phoenix browser first came out, which would then evolve to Firefox who had its 1.0 release in November 2004. Opera had already been around for a really long time, but it was first a few years into the life of Firefox that we started to see a shift in the web browser market share, and slowly, slowly, IE losing its dominance. When Chrome 1.0 came out in December 2008 it helped strengthen the movement Firefox and the community had started.</p>\n<p>The overall motivations back then for building for only one browser was that IE had a large enough market share for decision makers to feel this would be the most cost efficient way to reach their users. Cross-browser support was occasionally hard and could lead to longer developing times. Netscape 4 and its support was drastically different from IE, and since it became irrelevant, no other browser was big enough to force them to care more deeply about it.</p>\n<p>An extra factor that led to such an extreme dominance over the following years is that a lot of companies built IE-only Intranets with a lot of solutions dependant on proprietary APIs. Pairing that with a slow version upgrade cycle and no other browsers allowed to be installed, this immensely held back the evolution of the web &#8211; in particular when other browsers had a much faster pace with better standards support and implementing new features.</p>\n<p>I believe the situation in 2018 is similar to the initial mindset in 2005: one browser has a big enough piece of the market, and/or with a company&#39;s user base, and they believe it&#39;s enough to only test in that browser; that supporting more browsers means more work = higher cost and also possibly that they need APIs only supported in that browser.</p>\n<p>Where the situation is different, though, is that now the web standards support across browsers is in a much much better state, and all developers generally have a fast release and improvement pace. Chrome is also &#8211; as opposed to IE a few years in back then &#8211; at the forefront of browser evolution, together with Firefox, and Safari and Edge have gotten a lot better in recent time. Add to that a lot of newer browsers like Samsung Internet, Brave and much more popping up, also holding a very high standard.</p>\n<p>I also think, though, that in this high pace environment, browsers implement new and experimental features, and companies are quick to jump onto them and ship new things based on it, thus leading to certain web apps only working in one browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-you-should-build-for-all-browsers\">Why you should build for all browsers</h2>\n<p>Now that I&#39;ve talked about what I believe the cause and reasoning might be, I want to tell you why I believe it is crucial that we all build for more than one web browser.</p>\n<p>First, the number of great resources you have available now to find out what is supported where and how to do things are in a better place than it has ever been. <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">Can I use</a> has a lot of easily digestible information about browser support &#8211; and I was happy to work directly with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fyrd\">Alexis (@Fyrd)</a> who runs it to get the major Chinese browser in there as well &#8211; and then you have extremely extensive <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">documentation and browser compatibility tables at MDN</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/\">Chromestatus</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/\">Edge Platform Status</a> and <a href=\"https://platform-status.mozilla.org/\">Firefox Platform Status</a> have a lot of fine-grained details on features and their implementation state. There&#39;s also <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/\">Google&#39;s Web documentation</a>, the <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/\">WebKit blog</a>, <a href=\"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer\">Edge taking suggestions on UserVoice</a>. And, the Developer Tools in all web browsers is in their best shape ever with tons of tools and help for developers.</p>\n<p>Second, instead of building for one-browser-only, or one-browser-first, if you start in the end of using standardized and implemented features across the board in the 4 major web browser engines there are out there, you&#39;re not only reaching more users, you are also much better future-proofing your web site and, counter to what seems to be a common opinion, lowering the amount of technical debt or support needed by using features which are agreed on and shipped.</p>\n<p>Third, this is the key thing that differ the web from anything else. It&#39;s the most global and democratic medium we have, the barrier to entry for creating and sharing is quite low and there will be no company approving what you can publish and when. And things built a long time ago mainly still work in web browsers and this longevity is unparalleled. And when you build for just one browser you diminish all of this to a platform by just one company. The web is bigger than that, the web is stronger than that, and I for one believe we all truly need and deserve a platform for everyone.</p>\n<p>So, I understand your reasoning, perspective, goals and challenges. But please, please, consider building something for the web and not just one web browser.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=VqzIaDKvYDY:YZ-4cUUE6gs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=VqzIaDKvYDY:YZ-4cUUE6gs:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=VqzIaDKvYDY:YZ-4cUUE6gs:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?a=VqzIaDKvYDY:YZ-4cUUE6gs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:48:56 +0000","feedId":4901,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA","linkMd5":"f3442eede6537c9b54728809e0f00c32","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1053,"destBytes":410,"author":"Robert Nyman","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-12-51-030_6221e1bfaa24f271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?i=VqzIaDKvYDY:YZ-4cUUE6gs:I2FUP0JpNAM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-13-11-776_a93cf1ead280ccc3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/robertnyman?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-13-12-227_7e73e3120160d876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598307170812},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:12:50","title":"On #MeToo","link":"http://robertnyman.com/?p=2960","description":"<p>I&#8217;ve been following the stories on #MeToo, listening and talking to a lot of people, and have been trying to gather my thoughts.</p>\n<p>First, no one should ever have to feel unsafe. Ever. I&#8217;m so saddened to hear all the stories and testimonies, women being treated unfairly, as less worthy or as just being there for men&#8217;s entertainment. Why I&#8217;m so grateful about #MeToo &#8211; despite all the terrible stories &#8211; is that it has finally gotten to a point where everyone is listening. Where women feel brave, empowered and supported enough to share what has happen, to dare to say no.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been thinking through my own actions over the years. To my knowledge, I&#8217;ve never harassed or intentionally treated anyone unequal, but if there have ever been situations where I&#8217;ve made any woman feel uncomfortable, not seen or awkward, I&#8217;m very sorry. I know I have been young and made stupid jokes, and that while I personally haven&#8217;t done anything bad, I haven&#8217;t stood up properly when hearing other men talking about women, using a demeaning jargon.</p>\n<p>Some believe that with all the attention #MeToo gets now, people will also become opportunistic. There will be false or exxagarated claims, and that a certain vigilante mentality will follow and people will be judged before things are confirmed. I understand the vigilante worry, but at the same time, women have tried for such a long time to get help and not getting it. So this is what they have to do to get heard. The other part is that &#8211; according to studies &#8211; when it comes to claims about sexual assault and harassment, there are only a few percent that turn out not to be true. So with all the data we have, we have to make sure the victims get listened to, and that they get their fair chance to have their cases tried.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m grateful to live and bring up my daughters in Sweden &#8211; one of the most gender equal countries in the world &#8211; there&#8217;s still a long way to go. But I&#8217;m happy to see all the #MeToo demonstrations going on in Sweden, and so many people working together and supporting each other to move in the right direction.</p>\n<p>From my side, I constantly strive to treat everyone equal, and to make sure to speak up when I see or hear bad things. In my professional role, I work hard to make sure we have a good and representative gender balance at events, and that everyone feel safe and welcome.</p>\n<p>But this is not about me. It&#8217;s about all the women who have been treated badly and unfairly, who have felt afraid or have not gotten the same opportunities as men.</p>\n<p>Enough.
