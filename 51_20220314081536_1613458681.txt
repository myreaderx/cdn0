But the nickname of people living in Leuven has nothing to do with this, but rather with the city's 17th-century past.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 1691, in the midst of the Nine Years' War when France was trying to expand its territory. All neighboring countries were on edge for French invasions and surprise attacks, and most cities had posted guards on the lookout at all times. One night, the guards in Leuven were seemingly more on edge than usual and got spooked by some rustling in the treeline ahead. They opened fire and mowed down all of the intruders, celebrating their victory. However, the next morning they discovered that the invading force beyond the treeline was in fact a herd of cows returning to the stable.</p>\n<p>News of this event quickly spread throughout the country, earning the people of Leuven their nickname of <em>Koeschieters,</em> or cow-shooters. This statue made by P. Vanbekbergen in 1991 commemorates the story and the nickname. In line with the gentle mockery connected to the tale, the statue depicts a proud man with his foot planted atop a cow's head.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c298d039fd0233a0825f28c1a48870ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.atlasobscura.com/thWpFLQvNKWnLhV338F70fiwyU8B6z5FYxB_o-HeZUo/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:3058:2038:nowe:14:576/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy85ZmRi/MGFmMS02NDY1LTRk/ZmQtYTM4ZC04ZjAy/MWRhZDc3MTM5YWRm/ODlhNWQwNWFmMDQ2/NDNfSU1HMjAyMTEy/MzExMDUxMjEuanBn.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-02-077_9a4531ae1489823b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701264},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Gainesville Solar Walk in Gainesville, Florida","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gainesville-solar-walk","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Gainesville Solar Walk\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"848\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/mKw_m5p9VnmRfzLaLCssaXP5e6DNWqWiF_hHNcSE1Kc/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:797:531:nowe:1:195/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy9iZjEy/NDY3YS0zYjRmLTQ1/OTgtYjJjNS02OGI0/Y2M3ZDQ4ZjkxNGNh/ZmNjY2VkMmIzMDlj/ZDNfc2F0dXJuLnBu/Zw.png\" /></p> <p>The <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Gainesville, Florida\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/gainesville-florida\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"831\" data-title=\"Gainesville, Florida\" data-slug=\"gainesville-florida\">Gainesville</a> Solar Walk is a four-billion-to-one scale model of the solar system.

When he and his daughter, Anna, gingerly entered the dark, cobweb-covered home, they were drawn to a picture on the wall, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">Anna remembered</a>, “of a beautiful young woman about twenty-five years of age.” After extensively questioning Polly about the painting, Dr. Pool believed his initial hunch was correct. He was staring at a portrait of the long vanished Theodosia Burr Alston, a portrait which may hold the key to her long-debated fate at sea.Today, if people know anything about Theodosia, it is because of the lovely lullaby “Dear Theodosia,” sung by the character of Aaron Burr in the sensational musical <em>Hamilton</em>. But the real-life Theodosia grew from a beloved child into a highly intelligent, complex adult, whose fascinating story is largely unknown and worthy of its very own Broadway smash.</p>\n<p>Theodosia Bartow Burr was born in Albany, New York, on June 21, 1783. Her mother, also called Theodosia, was a brilliant, cultured woman. She had scandalized New England society, when as a married mother of five, she fell in love with an equally brilliant and much younger blue-blooded lawyer and Revolutionary War soldier—Aaron Burr. After her first husband’s death, the two were married, and little Theodosia, the couple’s only child to survive, became the center of her parents’—particularly her father’s—world.</p>\n<p>“Your dear little Theodosia cannot hear you spoken of without an apparent melancholy,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">the elder Theodosia wrote</a> to a traveling Aaron in 1785, “insomuch that her nurse is obliged to exert her invention to divert her, and myself avoid to mention you in her presence. She was one whole day indifferent to everything but your name. Her attachment is not of a common nature.”</p>\n<figure>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/35263/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Aaron reciprocated these feelings. His plans for his lovely, dark-haired “Little Miss Priss,” who was already displaying an extraordinary intellect and sharp wit, were incredibly ambitious, and for the times, highly progressive. “I hope yet by her [Theodosia] to convince the world what neither sex seems to believe,” <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmMtbk9MZ3YC&#38;pg=PA81&#38;lpg=PA81&#38;dq=I+hope+by+%5BTheodosia%5D+to+convince+the+world+what+neither+sex+seems+to+believe,+that+women+have+souls&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=Sdn1WeD_Nt&#38;sig=kC2lUKZDAJaiOpzNZXtLq-NYBak&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ved=0ahUKEwibkdDBsaPPAhVEOZAKHYDwDFIQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&#38;q=I%20hope%20by%20%5BTheodosia%5D%20to%20convince%20the%20world%20what%20neither%20sex%20seems%20to%20believe%2C%20that%20women%20have%20souls&#38;f=false\">he wrote</a>, “that women have soul!” (Some historians now <a href=\"https://wapo.st/3MEkuuE\">believe Burr had also fathered a second, unacknowledged daughter</a> by the time he penned this letter: Louisa Charlotte, born circa 1788, to Mary Emmons, a woman of color from Kolkata, India, who had worked for a time as a servant in the Burr household. Later in her life, Louisa appears to have known of her half-sister, but it is unclear if Theodosia ever learned about Louisa and her younger brother, John Pierre.)</p>\n<p>In 1800, Theodosia became deeply enamored with Joseph Alston, a wealthy planter from South Carolina. “My father laughs at my impatience to hear from you,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">Theodosia wrote</a> teasingly to Joseph during a separation.</p>\n<p>The couple were married on February 2, 1801, in Albany. Little more than a month afterwards, she and her new husband watched as her father was sworn in as Vice-President of the United States, under President Thomas Jefferson. They were further blessed nine months later when their son Aaron Burr Alston, nicknamed “Gampy” by his doting grandfather, was born.</p>\n<p>However, the birth of her only child took a heavy toll on Theodosia. She was severely injured during the traumatic birth, and the prolapsed uterus she suffered left her in immense pain, and made intercourse impossible. Although she adored her husband and his family, she had a hard time adjusting to the isolated life of a plantation mistress at The Oaks, the family estate on the Waccamaw River in South Carolina, and was soon spending half the year in New York with her father.</p>\n<figure>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/35262/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>On July 10, 1804, Aaron sat down at his desk and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ERIqAAAAYAAJ&#38;pg=PA351&#38;lpg=PA351&#38;dq=%E2%80%9CI+am+indebted+to+you,+my+dearest+Theodosia,+for+a+very+great+portion+of+the+happiness+which+I+have+enjoyed+in+this+life.+You+have+completely+satisfied+all+that+my+heart+and+affections+had+hoped+for+or+even+wished.%E2%80%9D&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=BlpWpn1WGG&#38;sig=sF1Rvq5tL8UGSaSurLrSIo_7NxE&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ved=0ahUKEwjk4bq7s6PPAhXC1B4KHRAcBQQQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%E2%80%9CI%20am%20indebted%20to%20you%2C%20my%20dearest%20Theodosia%2C%20for%20a%20very%20great%20portion%20of%20the%20happiness%20which%20I%20have%20enjoyed%20in%20this%20life.%20You%20have%20completely%20satisfied%20all%20that%20my%20heart%20and%20affections%20had%20hoped%20for%20or%20even%20wished.%E2%80%9D&#38;f=false\">wrote his Theodosia</a> a letter of goodbye. “I am indebted to you, my dearest Theodosia, for a very great portion of the happiness which I have enjoyed in this life. You have completely satisfied all that my heart and affections had hoped for or even wished.” The next day, Aaron—still the Vice President of the United States—would kill Alexander Hamilton in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Rumors swirled as to the cause of the duel. Aaron <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">had been incensed by a comment</a> Hamilton had made about “still more despicable” acts. Some thought Hamilton may have been referring to Aaron and Theodosia’s “morbid affection” for each other, which had led to whispers of incest.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, Aaron was soon on the run, although he was never tried for the murder. After serving out his term as Vice President, Aaron headed west to establish a new country comprised of western North American territory and Mexico. He planned to become emperor of said country, with Theodosia succeeding him as empress. He had the full support of his daughter and son-in-law, who supplied much-needed funds. The Alstons even headed west to help Aaron in his quest. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">Theodosia wrote</a> to her half-brother excitedly about “the new settlement which I am about to establish.”</p>\n<p>But the Burr dynasty was not to be. The plot was found out, and Burr was taken into custody. In 1807, he was tried for treason in Richmond, the ever loyal Theodosia at his side. Amazingly, Aaron was acquitted, and with the help of Theodosia he soon smuggled himself out of the country and headed for Europe.</p>\n<p>Her father now gone, Theodosia’s health—she was probably in the final stages of uterine cancer— deteriorated further. “The most violent affections have tormented her during the whole of the last 18 months,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">she wrote</a> in third-person to a doctor in 1808. “Hysteric fits, various colors and flashes of light before her yes, figures passing around her bed, strange noises, low spirits and worse.” She missed her father intensely. “What indeed,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">she wrote him</a>, “would I not risk once more to see him, to hang upon him, to place my child upon his knee, and again spend my days in the happy occupation of endeavoring to anticipate his wishes.”</p>\n<p>In 1812, Theodosia’s beloved “Gampy” died of malaria in South Carolina. With the loss of her only child, Theodosia’s world grew darker. “There is no more joy for me,” she wrote. “The world is blank. I have lost my boy.”</p>\n<figure>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/35225/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>On December 10, 1812, Joseph Alston was elected governor of South Carolina. His new position made it impossible for him to accompany Theodosia to New York, and with the War of 1812 raging in the Atlantic, he was worried about his frail wife making the treacherous trip to New York. To ensure his daughter’s safety, Aaron sent down his friend Dr. Timothy Green to secure a boat and make sure that Theodosia made it home to him.</p>\n<p>Theodosia, along with Dr. Green, a French maid and skeleton crew, boarded a small schooner called the <em>Patriot</em> at the port of Georgetown on December 31. One week passed, then two, then three—with no word from the <em>Patriot,</em> its small crew or passengers. “In three weeks I have not yet had one line from her,” <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KQoTApr0bHEC&#38;pg=PA168&#38;lpg=PA168&#38;dq=%E2%80%9CTomorrow+will+be+three+weeks,+since,+in+obedience+to+your+wishes,+Theodosia+left+me,%E2%80%9D&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=O1x4IZmF7n&#38;sig=cngPeiLTq4r2BV-jiu-1ZieLX6o&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ved=0ahUKEwjt-P_GtKPPAhWFlR4KHSOgCm8Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%E2%80%9CTomorrow%20will%20be%20three%20weeks%2C%20since%2C%20in%20obedience%20to%20your%20wishes%2C%20Theodosia%20left%20me%2C%E2%80%9D&#38;f=false\">Joseph wrote</a> Aaron. “My mind is tortured—after 30 days—my wife is either captured or lost!” By February 24, he had given up all hope. “My boy and-my wife- gone both! This, then is the end of all the hopes we had formed,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">he wrote</a> to his father-in-law. “You may well observe that you feel severed from the human race. She was the last thing that bound us to the species.”</p>\n<p>Within weeks of the<em> Patriot’s </em>disappearance, rumors about Theodosia’s fate began to spread in the North and the South. Joseph died in 1816, a shell of the man he once was. Burr lived another 23 years, long enough to witness the cottage-industry of conspiracy theories about his daughter’s disappearance come to life. He <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">refused to believe</a> she was still alive, stating firmly: “She is dead. She perished in the miserable little pilot boat in which she left. Were she alive, all the prisons in the world could not keep her from her father.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">Many believed</a> the <em>Patriot </em>had been captured by one of the pirate ships known to troll the Outer Banks. Over the years, numerous “death-bed confessions” from various aged or imprisoned pirates were reported in papers all over the country. The first to gain traction was the case of Jean DeFarges and Robert Johnson, who were executed in 1819 for other crimes. An 1820 article in the <em>New York Advertiser</em> claimed that the two had confessed to having been crew on the<em> Patriot</em>. They claimed to have led a mutiny, and scuttled the ship, killing all on board.</p>\n<p>In 1833, <em>The Mobile Commercial Register</em> reported that another man had confessed to raiding the <em>Patriot</em> with other pirates, who had reluctantly forced Theodosia to walk the plank. Other stories claimed that she had become the wife of an American Indian in Texas, been taken as a pirate’s mistress to Bermuda, or that she had killed herself after resisting the advances of the pirate Octave Chauvet. Yet another fanciful story had her writing farewell letters to her father and husband, and stuffing them and her wedding ring into a champagne bottle and throwing it into the Carolina sea before being executed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most oft-repeated “confession” was that of Benjamin F. Burdick, a “hard, rough old salt” of a sailor. On his death bed at a poor-house in Michigan, he is said to have confessed to a minister’s wife that he had been on the pirate ship that overtook the <em>Patriot</em>. According to an 1878 edition of the <em>New York Times</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said there was one lady on board who was beautiful appearing, intelligent and cultivated, who gave her name as Mrs. Theodosia Alston. When her turn came to walk the fatal plank she asked for a few moments time, which was gruffly granted her. She then retired to her berth and changed her apparel, appearing on deck in a few moments clad in pure white garments. And with a bible in her hand, she announced that she was ready. She appeared as calm and composed as if she were at home, and not a tremor crept over her frame, or a pallor overspread her features, as she walked toward her fate. As she was taking the fatal steps, she folded her hand over her bosom and raised her eyes to heaven. She fell and sank without a murmur or a sigh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then there is the curious case of “the female stranger,” who is <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-grave-of-the-female-stranger\">buried in the St. Paul’s Episcopal Graveyard</a> in Alexandria, Virginia. It is said this “veiled lady” appeared in the city in 1816, with a man claiming to be her husband. She died a short time later. Legend has it that this was Theodosia and Dr. Green, recently returned from captivity in the islands.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only clue we have as to what really happened to Theodosia is the Nags Head portrait, discovered by Dr. Pool in 1869. According to his daughter, Polly Mann told her and her father that her deceased husband, Joseph Tillett, was a “wrecker” who scavenged the ships that washed up on the shores of the Outer Banks. She claimed that decades before, he and his friends had come upon a scuttled, empty schooner near Kitty Hawk. In one cabin they found many fine items, including the portrait and dresses, which were now in Polly’s possession. “Also exposed to our view—a vase of wax flowers under a glass globe,” <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">Anna remembered</a>, “and a shell beautifully carved in the shape of a nautilus.”</p>\n<figure>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/35224/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Polly gave the portrait to Dr. Pool in lieu of payment. He took it back home to Elizabeth City. Over the years, he and his cohorts would attempt to get authentication of the portrait from the Burr and Alston families, whose opinions as to whether the likeness was Theodosia varied greatly. “I do remember her beautiful eyes,” Joseph Alston’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Theodosia-Burr-Alston-Portrait-Prodigy-ebook/dp/1929175310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1474561364&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=theodosia+burr+alston\">youngest sister wrote</a>, “and the eyes in the picture are really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Those who believe in the painting’s authenticity think it proves that Theodosia died off the coast of the North Carolina shore, one way or another. There were fierce storms on the Outer Banks January 2nd and 3rd in 1812, which caused damage to ships nearby the<em> Patriot’s</em> planned route. It is most likely that the small ship was simply over-powered by the storm, but who knows? Perhaps pirates, rogue wreckers, the British, or something else caused the boat’s destruction. Or perhaps Theodosia was spirited away to some exotic land, and lived a long life—though in her precarious health that seems very unlikely.</p>\n<p>Today the legend of Theodosia lives on. The Nags Head Portrait now hangs in the Lewis Walpole Library at Yale. Her ghost is said to haunt her plantation The Oaks, the Outer Banks, Richmond Hill and Bald Head Island, where it is said her spirit is chased by three headless pirates. In the late 19th and early 20th century the mystery was spun into several novels and countless magazine articles. Many little girls were named after her—including Theodosia Burr Goodman, who would become famous as the silent screen vamp Theda Bara. Her story was a favorite of poets, including Robert Frost, whose poem <a href=\"http://www.ketzle.com/frost/kittyhawk.html\"><em>Kitty Hawk</em></a> includes the line:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did I recollect how the wreckers wrecked Theodosia Burr off this very shore? T’was to punish her, but her father more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But perhaps the impact of the mystery of Theodosia is best summed up by her friend Margaret Blennerhasset in her poem <a href=\"http://canadianpoetry.org/2016/06/28/widow-of-the-rock/\"><em>On A Friend Who Was Supposed To Have Suffered A Shipwreck</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now I wander all alone, Nor heed the balmy breeze, but list the ring dove’s tender moan, and think upon the seas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>A version of this story originally appeared on October 7, 2016.

And while the agency itself was abolished after the war, many of its inventions are familiar to us today, such as “the clean plate club” or the still-popular meatless Mondays.</p>\n<p>To promote the latter, the United States Bureau of Fisheries (USBF) launched its own propaganda effort. The Eat More Fish campaign distributed posters that implored patriots to “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/smallmuseumsca/status/804786044587610112\">Save the meat for our soldiers and allies</a>,” or, simply, “Eat the carp!” One of the posters featured a stern-looking woman in a starched lunch-lady uniform and paper cap. “Eat more fish,” she admonished the onlooker, “a real health food.\"</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88056/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The woman’s name was Evelene Spencer and, to many Americans, she would have been a familiar sight. From 1915 to 1922, Spencer held the distinguished title of Fish Cookery Expert at the USBF (later renamed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), where she led the charge in persuading the public to eat seafood—so prolifically that she eventually became known as the Fish Evangelist.</p>\n<p>Spencer was a “celebrity chef” before there was such a thing, says April Gregory, curator of collections and exhibitions at the National Fish &#38; Aquatic Conservation Archives in South Dakota. “She was famous with American housewives,” who came to know Spencer through her posters, live cooking demonstrations, and, later, her seminal (and breathlessly-titled) cookbook, <em>Fish Cookery: six hundred recipes for the preparation of fish, shellfish and other aquatic animals, including fish soups, salads and entrees, with accompanying sauces, seasonings, dressings and forcemeats.</em></p>\n<p>Born in Canada in 1868, Spencer was a 47-year-old restaurant manager in Portland, Oregon, when she was hired by the USBF. She was married and the mother of two daughters. But little else is known about Spencer’s life or culinary training prior to her role as Fish Cookery Expert. According to Gregory, Spencer was one of just a handful of women the agency employed. “She was a pioneer in that regard, to hold a position other than secretary.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88160/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Gregory’s research has revealed that Spencer “appears to have had great freedom in her career—making her own choices, scheduling her own tours.” Gregory can’t say how Spencer would have pulled off such a feat, other than positing that, “she must have had a great personality.”</p>\n<p>Convincing Americans to eat fish would have required a great personality and then some. In the early part of the last century, a movement to eat more seafood didn’t just challenge the culinary status quo, but cultural norms as well.</p>\n<p>According to Barton Seaver, author of <em>American Seafood: Heritage, Culture, and Cookery from Sea to Shining Sea</em>, for most of the 19th through 20th centuries, Americans “mostly considered fish being beneath our aspirations.”</p>\n<p>While European colonists in the 1600s and 1700s relied on the ocean for food and commerce, that began to change as the population expanded westward, where the fertile, wide-open land of the nation’s interior became dominated by sprawling farms. By the mid-1800s, meat had become a proxy for prosperity. “Families could mark their wealth by the amount of meat they served,” Seaver writes. “It was considered embarrassing commentary upon a family’s tastes and economic standing if lobster was served at their table.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88133/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>If meat was a status symbol, fish was the marker of the outcast: The poor ate salt cod, Native Americans ate shad, and the sick and infirm were encouraged to eat seafood, since it was thought to be easier on digestion. Additionally, in the popular—and largely Protestant—imagination of the early 20th century, fish was associated with Catholic days of fasting, and therefore notions of penance, punishment, and sacrifice.</p>\n<p>According to a 1909 United States Department of Agriculture report, Americans were eating 150 pounds of meat per person annually, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045642/figure/F2/?report=objectonly\">while consuming only 10 pounds of seafood</a>. But then, according to Seaver, “World War I broke out and food came to be realized as one of our greatest weapons.” Suddenly, everyday Americans could support the troops fighting in Europe—as well as our allies—by cutting back on and sending high-quality food overseas.</p>\n<p>To orchestrate the rationing campaign, the government turned to those eye-catching posters—and to Evelene Spencer. She hit the road, sometimes with her daughter in tow, performing cooking demonstrations at large department stores in cities where the government had sent refrigerated train cars full of fish to rationing patriots.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88134/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>“As many of these fish are new to the average housewife,” reads a USBF bulletin from November 1918, “the demonstrations are intended to acquaint her with their merits, and at the same time broaden her knowledge of the possibilities of fish.” These possibilities included substituting devil fish for crab and squid for oysters. A few months later, Spencer penned an article for a USBF circular called, “Groupers, Fishes You Should Try, and Recipes for Them.”</p>\n<p>Spencer’s live tutorials drew sizable crowds. For example, Gregory found a letter of appreciation from a women’s club in Berkeley, California, expressing “the appreciation of its 300 members and friends for the ‘splendid demonstration of fish.’” The letter promises “there certainly is going to be a more intelligent response to the plea of ‘Eat more fish.’”</p>\n<p>Spencer seemed motivated by inspiring an “intelligent response,” not simply disseminating elementary recipes with easy-to-get fish. She wanted Americans to learn how to cook fish, but also where to find it, when to buy it, and how to debone and filet it. Spencer’s cookbook, which she coauthored with John Cobb, a fisheries professor at the University of Washington, may have been written for the amateur cook, but its contents read like a technical manual, containing headings like “How to Tell When Fish Is Fresh,” “Nutritive Value of Fish,” and “Conditions Affecting the Market Value of Fish.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88055/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>In her demonstrations and then her book, Spencer encouraged home chefs to try new kinds of seafood to save money and support the fishing industry. “Instead of always purchasing the better-known, high-priced fish,” she wrote, “choose the less-known and cheaper kinds.” To that end, <em>Fish Cookery</em> includes recipes like squid loaf, whale pot pie, creamed shark with cheese, and poached filets of shad in foamy clam nectar. There’s a whole chapter on roe and another on water mammals.</p>\n<p>The book overflows with expert tips. Buy even the small fish, Spencer advised, and the frozen fish, two items Americans remained squeamish about but that could, Spencer promised, help bring down the high cost of some seafood. Buy enough fish to have leftovers, and a little more to pickle. Buy oily fish to save on expensive cooking fats. Insist on the trimmings, too, and use them to make fish stock. Most fish, she revealed, “taste much better cooked in half the time usually given in recipes.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the book’s most enduring legacy was its guidance on calculating cooking times and temperatures based on the size and thickness of the fish, a topic that had long mystified the home chef. It also introduced the Spencer Hot Oven Method—coating fish in breadcrumbs and baking it at a very high heat, a technique that today we call “oven frying.” Celebrated chef and food writer James Beard called it “the most important announcement in fish cookery in the last century.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88057/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>By 1923, Spencer had returned to her native Canada to take a job at the National Fish Company, promoting the consumption of seafood until her death in 1935. Her obituary describes her as “well-known to the authorities at Washington, where her work on behalf of the Government was valued highly,” and highlights Spencer’s “cookbook which attained a circulation to be envied by a ‘best seller’ in the realm of fiction.”</p>\n<p>Spencer’s message to eat more fish still resonates at the agency that once employed her. “History does repeat itself,” says Gregory. “Today our agency is promoting eating invasive species to help save native species.”</p>\n<p>Those looking for fish recipes can still find and purchase Spencer’s book online. Multiple editions and more than a century later, its dedication still reads: “To the women of the United States, who, during the world war assisted so willingly in the ‘Eat More Fish’ campaign.\"</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 20:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b1a96e56a3b919471796c52282debc50","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Ashley Stimpson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88056/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn91@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-02-203_fed840320ced052d.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88160/image.jpg":null,"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88133/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn78@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-797_ed1cf613e89e1991.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88134/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn86@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-02-171_bb06844739412f18.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88055/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-01-618_839a3ac0953da7bc.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88057/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn91@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-02-001_1f4d7bffc38384ed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701254},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"The Society Editor Who Just Walked Into Soviet Russia and Started Spying","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/marguerite-harrison-reporter-spy-russia","description":"\n        <div>\n<p><em>For Women’s History Month, Atlas Obscura delves into the world of espionage, where being overlooked and underestimated has been an asset for centuries of women spies.

In fall 1919, when the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Division asked her to go to Russia to gather information on Vladmir Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, the 40-year-old <em>Baltimore Sun</em> journalist first asked Russia for permission to enter the country. When her request was denied, she traveled to Poland, which was then at war with Russia, and in February 1920, she simply walked across the Polish military front line into “no man’s land.” There, she waited until an officer of the Red Army appeared. “I explained to him in my very best Russian that I had come from America to learn the truth about the Soviet government and that I wished to go on to Moscow,” <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/maroonedinmosco00unkngoog/page/n21/mode/2up\">she later wrote</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88099/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Without that unflinching directness, Harrison never would have become a spy—the first woman hired as a foreign intelligence officer for the United States. She was the daughter of a wealthy Baltimore family, raised at the turn of the century to marry well and make a comfortable home. And she did just that, until her husband’s sudden death in 1915. Harrison found herself alone with a teenage son, Tommy, and her husband’s unpaid debts. To cover her expenses, Harrison began to take boarders in her home in Baltimore's fashionable Mount Vernon neighborhood, and when that proved insufficient, she presented herself to the managing editor of the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> and asked for a job. Harrison had never written an article before, “But I think I could,” she told the man during her interview. Her confidence, plus a lifetime of connections in the city, earned her a job as the assistant society editor.</p>\n<p>The outbreak of World War I took Harrison from writing about parties and the theater to reporting on the war effort from the homefront. But Harrison wanted to be closer to the action. She later explained <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/There_s_Always_Tomorrow.html?id=-qA8AQAAIAAJ\">in her autobiography</a> that she had become a spy because no American newspaper would send a woman to the front lines, though other female journalists found ways to witness the events in Europe “without resorting to espionage,” writes Elizabeth Atwood in <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/press/books/liberation-marguerite-harrison\"><em>The Liberation of Marguerite Harrison</em></a>. “She wanted to be a spy because she was fearless, fond of adventure and had an intense desire to serve her country.” The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence turned Harrison down; they did not want a woman in their ranks. But the U.S. Army’s new Military Intelligence Division (MID)—swayed by Harrison’s powerful connections, her fluency in German (her mother, hoping Harrison would marry a titled European, was to credit for her language skills), and her ready cover story as a reporter—accepted the eager recruit.</p>\n<p>The armistice had been signed before Harrison boarded a steamer bound for France in December 1918, but that didn’t lessen the urgency of gathering information on the rapidly shifting political climate in Europe. Harrison was charged with reporting to MID on politics, economics, and public morale in Berlin and then, after a brief, dull return to Baltimore, Harrison departed for Moscow.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88102/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Harrison’s dramatic arrival in Russia was followed by several weeks of successful intelligence-gathering in the Russian capital. She even talked her way into the Kremlin, where she encountered Leon Trotsky, then head of the Red Army. But a few days later, she was arrested and imprisoned in Moscow’s soon-to-be notorious Lubyanka prison. Faced with an accusation of espionage, Harrison bluntly and characteristically fessed up. “Very well, I acknowledge it,” she said. “I am an agent of the United States government.” To secure her release, she agreed to be a double agent for Russia. And then she promptly became a triple agent for the United States, passing lists of Americans imprisoned in Russia to her MID handlers, which eventually earned her another harrowing nine-month stay in Lubyanka.</p>\n<p>When Harrison was finally allowed to return to Baltimore in the summer of 1921, she wrote of her time in Russia blithely: “It was a wonderful experience and well worth the price I paid, which, after all, was the result of my entering Russia uninvited.” The experience would not deter her from traveling the world, as a reporter, <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/society-of-woman-geographers\">explorer, filmmaker</a>—and spy. Within a year, in fact, she would find herself in a Russian prison for a third time.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 21:45:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"390e444c395dad2b3eef3a11686da03e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"April White","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88099/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn88@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-01-777_183633aa380192e6.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88102/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn94@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-01-953_78ebf8508c55967b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701342},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"The Migrating House in Baarle-Hertog, Belgium","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/voordeurwissel","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"The Migrating House\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"2048\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/J5CoRDa-_sITO8z6G86k0danpBu5bX_eqiBaIXTcXus/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:1533:1022:nowe:0:558/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8zM2Jk/MDM4ZC0xMzgxLTQ5/OGUtYjg2ZS1lMDRl/YTE5OWVlMDgwODdj/OTZjYWY1ZDQ0MzQw/M2VfV2hhdHNBcHAg/SW1hZ2UgMjAyMi0w/MS0yOSBhdCAxMi4z/Ny4zMyBQTSAoNyku/anBlZw.jpg\" /></p> <p>Borders change, sometimes leaving territories in new countries along with their inhabitants. On other occasions, a border can shift slightly to compensate for the flow of a river, or something related. But what happens when a land survey moves the border by just enough for a house to be accidentally relocated into another country?</p>\n<p>The twin cities of Baarle Hertog and Baarle Nassau are a unique geographical oddity that dates back to a land dispute from the 12th-century, resulting in a crazy patchwork of enclaves and exclaves between <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Belgium\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/belgium\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4506\" data-title=\"Belgium\" data-slug=\"belgium\">Belgium</a> and the <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Netherlands\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/netherlands\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4468\" data-title=\"Netherlands\" data-slug=\"netherlands\">Netherlands</a> that never got resolved. </p>\n<p>However, the exact location of each border slowly became forgotten over time, and new roads and buildings were built where people thought they existed. Of course, such a situation cannot exist forever and a 15-year project to measure the exact location of the borders started in 1980 and conclude in 1995. </p>\n<p>Most of the borders did not shift much, others, very slightly. However, one specific border moved a few feet to the south, exactly past the front door of Chaamseweg 10. Seemingly insignificant in most places, but important in the two Baarles, as an old treaty dictated that the location of the front door dictated in which country a house was located, meaning the house had just moved from Belgium to the Netherlands. </p>\n<p>Its inhabitant at the time was an 84-year-old woman who did not want to deal with all the problems that come with emigration or leaving her country. She pleaded for help, but the municipalities could not make an exception. However, someone found a quite pragmatic solution to this problem not long after. They swapped the door with the window that was on its left, moving the house back into Belgium and solving all the problems with emigration for the inhabitant.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the house today can see the border and where the door once stood by the location of the metal grid that was once in front of the door. </p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c75b75b179c80fb6d2eef0aa3af85cd9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.atlasobscura.com/J5CoRDa-_sITO8z6G86k0danpBu5bX_eqiBaIXTcXus/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:1533:1022:nowe:0:558/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8zM2Jk/MDM4ZC0xMzgxLTQ5/OGUtYjg2ZS1lMDRl/YTE5OWVlMDgwODdj/OTZjYWY1ZDQ0MzQw/M2VfV2hhdHNBcHAg/SW1hZ2UgMjAyMi0w/MS0yOSBhdCAxMi4z/Ny4zMyBQTSAoNyku/anBlZw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn11@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-02-267_0214264440387d0f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701332},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"The Mexican Revolutionary Who Fought for Freedom on the Battlefield and in the Barroom","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/petra-herrera-mexican-revoultion-spy","description":"\n        <div>\n<p><em>For Women’s History Month, Atlas Obscura delves into the world of espionage, where being overlooked and underestimated has been an asset for centuries of women spies.

Herrera was also deep undercover.</p>\n<p>Pedro Herrera’s real name was Petra Herrera, and she had infiltrated Pancho Villa’s División del Norte in 1913 in disguise. But she was not a spy—not yet—she was just a woman who wanted to fight with a rebel army reluctant to welcome female soldiers in its ranks.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88130/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Little is known about Herrera’s life before she joined the fight, but she was unwilling to remain anonymous as the Mexican Revolution wore on. Once she had been accepted by the men, she revealed her secret, unfurling long braids that would become her trademark, and reportedly shouting out her identity: “I am a woman.”</p>\n<p>As she must have hoped, Herrera’s revelation did not change things, at least at first. In January 1914, the <em>Mexican Herald</em> reported, “Rebel leaders here were pleased to receive the first report from Peda [sic] Herrera, a young Mexican woman who is commanding a force of 200 men in the state of Durango. She holds the rank of captain in the rebel army.” Herrera was also part of Villa's force in the Second Battle of Torreón in the spring of that year—at least according to oral history. Her name does not appear in the official records of the fight, but another soldier reported Herrera “was the one who took Torreón.”<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9-8JGOdbCD4C&#38;pg=PA94&#38;lpg=PA94&#38;dq=%22petra+herrera%22&#38;source=bl&#38;ots=GVVA7MDlyA&#38;sig=ACfU3U1Yuy2fp8VZuWAgtekS5A2mnGV2Lw&#38;hl=en&#38;sa=X&#38;ved=2ahUKEwjpmo-Lu7v2AhVoSzABHddGAhE4MhDoAXoECA4QAw#v=onepage&#38;q&#38;f=false\"> Corridos were written about her exploits:</a> “The valiant Petra Herrera / To battle she entered / Always being the first / To start the exchange of fire.” The last stanza of the ballad proclaims, “Long live Petra Herrera.”</p>\n<p>And Herrera was not alone. There were an estimated 400 women who participated in the Second Battle of Torreón. “Perhaps Villa was unwilling to let it be known that women played such an important part in the battle,” writes Elizabeth Salas in<a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/salsol\"> <em>Soldaderas in the Mexican Military</em></a>. “It is possible that lack of acknowledgment and failure to be promoted to a generalship motivated Herrera to form an independent brigade of female soldiers.” Estimates of the size of her unit ranged wildly, from 25 to 1,000, and may have varied with the conditions of the war. Through it all, Herrera’s fame only grew.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88128/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>But none of it was enough to earn her the title of general. Around 1917, when fighting lessened, Herrera—who now pledged her allegiance to Venustiano Carranza, once an ally of Villa's but by then an opponent, and who would become the country’s new president in 1917—was made colonel before she and the rest of her female soldiers were dismissed, “because it was an army of women,” one observer said.</p>\n<p>So Herrera went undercover again. This time she served as a spy for the same Carrancistas who had disbanded her unit. The wartime leader was playing the role of a nondescript waitress at a cantina in Jiménez; Chihuahua had long been a Villa stronghold and Herrera’s former ally still held sway among some there. From her place behind the bar, Herrera quietly collected intelligence.</p>\n<p>Some time later—the exact date is not recorded—Herrera was confronted by a group of men in the bar. Had someone recognized her long braids and remembered her acts on the battlefield and her shifting loyalties? No one knows what caused one of the men to produce a pistol and shoot her three times. The doctor who fought to save her life believed they had a vendetta against her and would return to kill her if she survived. But Herrera died of her wounds. Her doctor blamed her passing on both an infection and—quite inexplicably, given Herrera’s years of brave service—a fear of her attackers.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f72669bafa8e23f2ee07d9e39aa639b2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"April White","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88130/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-02-473_68fdc8010e96499c.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88128/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-02-029_a0837133553c6908.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701310},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Mahadji Shinde Chhatri in Pune, India","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mahadji-shinde-chhatri","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Mahadji Shinde Chhatri\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"2000\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/uLI998_ZSZdxwairqX1JPCFqt862XGGNwc1aoRb0PQg/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:1497:998:nowe:0:894/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy9mOGM2/MzA0ZS1lNzEwLTQw/MTAtODkzYi1mYWRl/Yjc1ODk3ZGNmMDYx/MDNmMDE3NmYyMGZi/YWJfSU1HXzIwMjEx/MTI4XzE0MDkxMS5q/cGc.jpg\" /></p> <p>In a rectangular complex surrounded by trees in the neighborhood of Wanawadi in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Pune, India\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/pune-india\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"19288\" data-title=\"Pune, India\" data-slug=\"pune-india\">Pune</a>, stands a beautiful memorial.

The world’s largest salt flat is, of course, much livelier from the ground. It hosts large numbers of breeding flamingoes each November and is home to other species adapted to the salty surroundings, including several other birds and the adorably plump, bunny-eared viscacha, a rodent related to chinchillas.

High levels of precipitation have caused flooding, scuttling many tours and potentially disrupting the near-future plans of other people who like to snap images of the landscape: remote sensing scientists.</p>\n<p>Once the rainy season is over in April, Salar de Uyuni usually becomes so characterless that it’s one of several sites worldwide used to calibrate satellite cameras (locations include other salt flats, deserts, and ice sheets, from <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Israel\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/israel\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4535\" data-title=\"Israel\" data-slug=\"israel\">Israel</a> to <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Nevada\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/nevada\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4399\" data-title=\"Nevada\" data-slug=\"nevada\">Nevada</a>, <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Antarctica\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/antarctica\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4538\" data-title=\"Antarctica\" data-slug=\"antarctica\">Antarctica</a> to <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Algeria\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/algeria\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"16145\" data-title=\"Algeria\" data-slug=\"algeria\">Algeria</a>).

If what’s known as absolute radiometric calibration is off by just the width of a viscacha whisker, it could distort the information the image conveys. (Figuratively speaking, of course; viscacha whiskers are not a recognized unit of measuring anything. Yet.)</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.maxar.com/tech-and-tradecraft/2020/absolute-radiometric-calibration-is-an-essential-tool-to-imagery-science-but-what-is-it\">2020 post on the Maxar Technologies blog</a>, remote sensing scientists Michele Kuester and Tina Ochoa write that accurate absolute radiometric calibration is important for a host of satellite image users, from scientists looking at the color of a forest to gauge its overall health to farmers deciding whether a crop needs additional irrigation.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88110/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The Salar de Uyuni won’t serve as a blank slate for calibration anytime soon, however. From November 2021 through January, the heavy rainfall turned the expanse into a riot of color and wild patterns. Because the area is a basin with no outlet, runoff from the surrounding mountains—and all the sediment that came with it—has nowhere to go, and will stick around until this shallow new sea evaporates. The discolored water in the natural-color satellite image at top is the result of different kinds of particles carried onto the flat, as well as algal blooms propagating thanks to a sudden burst in nutrients from all the water and organic matter dumped into the basin. The parallel formations that resemble sandbars are likely the result of high winds pushing the water and sediment around.</p>\n<p>Unusually high winds and excessive rainfall created a similar phenomenon at roughly the same time on the other side of the world. In the North Sea between the English and Dutch coasts, a false-color satellite image acquired in February allowed scientists to see through the water and witness the undersea aftermath of Storm Eunice and other unusually strong storms that pummeled the region that month.

Through her childhood, she and her siblings combed the shores of Honolulu and Lahaina for edible varieties; Abbott’s Native Hawaiian mother could recognize and name nearly every one of the five dozen or so varieties of <em>limu</em> at their fingertips. At home, they pounded and added salt to seaweeds like the fuzzy, coppery limu kohu (<em>Asparagopsis taxiformis</em>) and the soft, tangled limu wawae’iole (<em>Codium edule</em>). They dipped the branchy, centipede-like limu huluhuluwaena (<em>Grateloupia filicina</em>) in tempura batter and deep-fried it.</p>\n<p>As she grew into adulthood, so too did Abbott’s interest in seaweed. By her passing at age 90 in 2010, she had single-handedly discovered more than 200 species and helped to turn the scientific community’s attention to the essential role the plants play in healthy marine ecosystems. Abbott’s work was so prolific that other researchers called her the First Lady of Limu.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt, says Stephen Palumbi, colleague, friend, and professor of marine sciences at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, that Abbott’s work was foundational for current research into seaweed, a broad category of algae. Today, scientists are exploring seaweed’s role in marine food webs and human nutrition, as well as its potential for sequestering carbon, mitigating ocean acidification, and even curbing the methane in cow burps.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88077/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Isabella Abbott, Izzie to her friends, was born in Hana, Maui, in 1919. She graduated from the University of Hawai’i with a degree in botany in 1941 and earned a Ph.D. at the University of California-Berkeley in 1950, becoming the first Native Hawaiian woman to hold a doctorate in science. That same year, Izzie’s biologist husband Don Abbott joined the faculty at the Hopkins Research Center in Pacific Grove, California, as a professor. Like many scholar-wives at the time, although she held a doctorate in marine botany, Isabella Abbott was eventually hired not on a tenure track but as an underpaid, under-resourced lecturer.</p>\n<p>Despite the slight, over the following decade Izzie “became one of the premier experts in the world on algae,” says Palumbi. And finally, Stanford righted its original wrong. When the university started to reevaluate the absence of women in its professional roles in 1972, they began at Izzie’s office door. In a single day, she was promoted to full professor of biology, making her the first woman and the first person of color to hold the title there. The speed of the promotion “was unheard of and it hasn’t happened since,” says Palumbi.</p>\n<p>For Abbott, seaweed was more than just a professional interest. She regularly showed up to work events with creations such as zucchini bread, made with bull kelp instead of squash, and led an annual seaweed pickling get-together. Her culinary prowess with kelp was even featured in <em>Gourmet</em> in 1987.</p>\n<p>As a researcher, Abbott was prolific. She authored more than 150 journal articles and eight books, including the definitive 1976 study on Pacific Coast seaweed, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Marine_Algae_of_California.html?id=qYrx7i02uqsC\"><em>Marine Algae of California</em></a>. In it, she illustrates the rainbow of limu beneath the sea: ethereal giant kelp (<em>Macrocystis pyrifera</em>) with its flowing mermaid locks; the mulberry-hued, coral-shaped grapestone or Turkish washcloth (<em>Mastocarpus papillatus</em>); leggy alaria (<em>Alaria fistulosa</em>) whose chartreuse blades can grow up to 99 feet in length.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88068/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Abbott was among the first scientists to recognize how marine environments rely on healthy seaweed forests: When kelp habitats begin dying off due to warming temperatures, ocean acidification and other human-induced factors, the entire ecosystem is in trouble. Abbott also laid much of the groundwork for understanding the other half of the story: While failing kelp forests are a sign of a larger problem, flourishing ones are powerful defenses against those self-same threats. The undersea plants don’t just sequester and store carbon, they restore natural upwelling and fill the ocean’s nutrient value chain, says Brian von Herzen, founder and executive director of the Climate Foundation. Rebuilding seaweed habitats can help to rebalance the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, groups such as Washington State’s Puget Sound Restoration Fund (PSRF), in addition to analyzing the losses, are looking to the future. PSRF is currently collaborating with the Squamish Nation to restore a bull kelp forest in an area where seaweed habitats have shrunk by more than 80 percent.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been successful thus far in being able to grow seeded kelp lines with nylon thread or twine,” says PSRF deputy director Jodie Toft. When ready, the tiny baby bull kelp are positioned by dive teams, though the group hopes that one day the forests regenerate on their own, without human intervention.</p>\n<p>This type of research has roots in the work of early pioneers like Abbott, says von Herzen: “Today we stand on the shoulders of these giants in the seaweed worlds.”</p>\n<p>Kelp also increasingly shows promise for fighting ecological degradation out of the water. In 2018, researchers at the University of California-Davis reported that incorporating red algae from the genus <em>Asparagopsis </em>into the feed of dairy and beef cattle <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247820\">reduces the methane emissions they exhale by more than 80 percent</a>. Abbott knew red algae well: In 1967, she identified an entirely new genus of the family which today bears the name <em>Abbotella </em>in her honor.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88066/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>In their later years, the Abbotts returned to Hawai’i and Izzie joined the faculty at the University of Hawaii-Manoa, where she taught until her passing. While there, she was awarded the Gilbert Morgan Smith medal, marine botany’s most prestigious award, and named a Living Treasure of Hawaii. The title was fitting for a woman who proudly displayed a Hawaiian flag quilt on her dining room wall. The heirloom was made by her grandmother, defiantly, at a time when the flag’s display was banned following the overthrow of the Native Hawaiian government in 1893.</p>\n<p>“That was very close to her heart, that quilt,” says Palumbi. “And the history of it tells you a little bit about that time, and growing up that way in the Hawaiian culture.” The First Lady of Limu wasn’t just a marine botanist. She embraced seaweed in all the traditional forms that had sustained the island and its people for generations. After all, wrote Abbott, the human relationship with seaweed began not with scientists, but “with a housewife in search of a pudding.”</p>\n<p></p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:10:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9d6a62148b54c2d1e97b94f564552da8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shoshi Parks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88077/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-05-765_3959ead9a12c7449.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88068/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-712_dc57efaa9fff5ce3.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88066/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn100@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-02-149_8e9e332a07b6f537.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701310},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Devil's Lapstone in Durham, England","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-lapstone","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"The Devil&#39;s Lapstone\" data-width=\"960\" data-height=\"720\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/j8VvDI7vPd0xx8I9pVXcwTXjx1n_Oyrx42Xja_mK5wA/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8xNjBm/N2Y2Mi1iMDI2LTQ4/M2QtODA2Zi1hOTVi/MjYzODIxMTU2NWI5/YmVmNzhhNTkxMDVl/ZjhfRGV2aWwncyBM/YXBzdG9uZS5qcGc.jpg\" /></p> <p>A local legend states that the Devil himself offered to help build Durham Cathedral.

Three years later, she would be executed for espionage.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88086/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Zheng was an ideal intelligence agent in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Her father was a politician of unquestioned allegiance to the Chinese Nationalist Party, and her older brother, a pilot, died in a Japanese attack—but her mother was of Japanese descent. Zheng spoke fluent Japanese and moved easily among the Japanese elites in the city. Shortly after the invasion, an official from the Chinese Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau approached her and asked her to spy on Ding Mocun, a well-protected Chinese security chief collaborating with Japan.</p>\n<p>It took more than a year, but in March 1939, Zheng found a way into his inner circle. “Ding’s predilection for young beauties was well known,” writes Louise Edwards in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/women-warriors-and-wartime-spies-of-china/4AB04D7610EBA20238F00581D9C47B46#fndtn-information\"><em>Women Warriors and Wartime Spies of China</em></a>. “Pingru was to perform the classic ‘honey-trap’ role. She presented herself at No. 76 [headquarters of a feared Japanese security section] full of charm and elegance and flattered Ding by reminding him that she had been his student while he was the principal at Minguang Middle School.”</p>\n<p>Zheng’s mission was to draw Ding out of his protective bubble so that Chinese Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau could assassinate the man, who was complicit in the torture of Chinese dissidents. Her first opportunity came in early December 1939, when the pair had a date. Zheng invited Ding to her home at the end of the evening, but could not woo him inside, where assassins waited. Eleven days later, on December 21, she tried again.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88088/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The pair had planned to visit an acquaintance of Ding’s, but on the way to his home, they drove by the Siberian Fur Store on the city’s busiest shopping thoroughfare. Zheng begged Ding to stop at the luxurious furrier and buy her a new coat; two assassins stood outside the shop. Ding agreed to indulge Zheng, but as they entered the shop, something spooked him. He raced back to the car and sped away in a hail of bullets.</p>\n<p>It must have been clear to Zheng, whom Ding left behind at the fur shop, that she would now come under suspicion, but she did not waver. A few days later she even went to No. 76 to see Ding. She was arrested upon her arrival, imprisoned, and interrogated for more than a month. Then, in a small forest outside Shanghai, she was shot in the chest.</p>\n<p>The full story of Zheng’s espionage would not be known until the end of the war, when Ding was arrested and charged with treason—and even then there were conflicting accounts. Was Zheng to be honored as as a patriot or dismissed as a sex worker? Or both, a Mata Hari of her era?</p>\n<p>The question persisted for decades, fueled by author Eileen Chang’s fictionalized novella about the events, <em>Lust, Caution</em>, published in 1983, and director Ang Lee’s feature film of the same name released in 2007.</p>\n<p>Finally, in 2009, on the 95th anniversary of Zheng’s birth, the matter was settled when a life-size bronze statue of Zheng, with the Siberian Fur Shop behind her, was erected in a park in Qingpu, west of Shanghai. The monument depicts Zheng at the moment of her execution. But a banner hung at its unveiling showed Zheng as she had been before the Japanese invasion, the plot, the execution: a modern girl with stylish bob and a gentle smile.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"929be221b43415f5095622b8ecd4366a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"April White","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88086/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-700_b121a6800af06d0a.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/88088/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn98@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-01-977_af58a1bf27552dbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701313},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Biltmore McDonald's in Asheville, North Carolina","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/biltmore-mcdonalds","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"\" data-width=\"2943\" data-height=\"2207\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/49l6cfwkRfu7IRKMiDxqe2M6Oh1L4lTvlbBpFl9GGvc/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy82OGE3/NGQyYjgwMGJiNGQ4/YmZfZm91bmRfb25f/ZmxpY2tyLmpwZw.jpg\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Built in 1895, Asheville’s Biltmore Estate is the largest private home in the United States—</span><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/largest-homes-america-mar-lago-vanderbilt-property-1629667#:~:text=Estate%2C%20North%20Carolina-,(16%2C622m%C2%B2),-Biltmore%20Estate%2C%20Asheville\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by a long shot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Otherwise your dinner could flow right past you.</p>\n<p>Somen are white wheat noodles, which Japanese cooks serve cold or over ice during the summer. Typically, they're boiled and cooled, then eaten with <em>tsuyu</em>, a sauce made from <em>dashi</em> soup stock and soy sauce. Common toppings include cucumber and sliced mushrooms. The Japanese have eaten somen since the eighth century, but they didn't start floating the noodles down artificial rivers until modern times. </p>\n<p>In the southern town of Takachiho, in 1959, the House of Chiho restaurant dreamed up nagashi (flowing) somen in order to capitalize on the pure, local spring water. In a tradition that continues today, staff fill long chutes of halved bamboo trunks with cold running water. Once they yell, \"<em>Ikuyo</em>!\" or \"It's coming!\" they add strings of cooked noodles for diners downstream to snatch out of the current. At most establishments, a basket at the end of the waterworks catches slippery noodles, and the staff retrieves them for customers. But at the well-known Hirobun restaurant in Kyoto, what you catch is what you get, until red-dyed somen floats through and signals the end of the meal. </p>\n<p>People in Japan will buy bamboo shoots to serve nagashi somen at home. But as an alternative, home cooks and restaurateurs can buy machines that spin noodles around circular basins or send them down miniature water slides that look like toys.</p>\n<p>Still, the traditional style has a special appeal. In 2016, the citizens of Gose, in Nara prefecture, set the Guinness World Record for \"longest distance to flow noodles down a line of bamboo gutters.\" They built a working nagashi somen chute that was 3,317 meters (10,871 feet) long. Other record-breakers, meanwhile, have used high-pressure washing machines to power noodles to speeds that created actual waves.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6ac2a833faeee07dbb19cc492a4d6b9a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.atlasobscura.com/Rhz8KM-isBV64BbqLAITHG5wTIHfaIPkf0XYIjukzgI/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy84ZTEx/YTQ4MjExYWEzZDY4/ZWJfTmFnYXNoaVNv/bWVuLmpwZw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-02-175_be74da22c1d62330.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701317},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Eagle Tower in Fish Creek, Wisconsin","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eagle-tower","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Canopy walk to Eagle Tower\" data-width=\"732\" data-height=\"549\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/kiVcJYqwjhTClUDuMeJIYheVSLtGRT9lAZyvNXfX1IQ/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy80ZmJh/NTI3NC01NGRjLTQ2/MWQtOGY5Ny0xMWI1/ZDgwYTcxYzBmNzYy/NmUzZjdjZDFkZGNj/MzJfUFhMXzIwMjEw/NTMxXzEzMDQ0MDc1/My5NUC5qcGc.jpg\" /></p> <p>Peninsula State Park in Wisconsin is a perfect place to visit for outdoor enthusiasts.

Now known as Kudan after the nearby village, the site is believed to be the Nigrodharam Bihar mentioned in Buddhist texts where Buddha met his father, King Suddhodhana, for the first time following his enlightenment. </p>\n<p>The site is located nearly six kilometers (3.7 miles) south of Buddha’s childhood home, the palace at Tilaurakot. Kudan served as a meeting place for Buddha’s followers and also hosted the ordination of his son, Rahula, an event commemorated by a stupa erected atop the tallest hill. Consequential theological debates were also held at Kudan, including whether women ought to be ordained.  Although Buddha initially rejected this proposal, his step-mother, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, prevailed upon him and became the first <em>bhikkhuni</em>, or Buddhist nun.</p>\n<p>The excavation of the Bihar (“home”) began in 2007, revealing original stone and brickwork. The site contains several ancillary structures including a well, several stupas, and the remains of a large pond. The Bihar itself stands 22 feet high and measures over 15,000 square feet in area. A dubious staircase takes intrepid explorers to the top of the Bihar for an unparalleled view of the entire site as well as to the locus of a well-worn Shiva linga.</p>\n<p>Although many of the specific details about Buddha’s life and the initial spread of his philosophy are shrouded in legend, the site’s original name—Nigrodharam—derives from Nigrodha, the name of a Buddhist monk who purportedly once owned the banyan grove where the Bihar was built. In the third century B.C., Nigrodha is said to have converted Emperor Ashoka Maurya to Buddhism who became one of Buddhism’s most powerful champions. Today, stone pillars erected by Ashoka can still be found in nearby Nepali villages and cities celebrating the Buddha. Kudan is, therefore, a good starting point for any enthusiastic pilgrim to retrace the footsteps of the Buddha and his followers.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"876a9cfa9ce7eddc3d26c4bfeebe780b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.atlasobscura.com/gDuL67YXRpEG6OVVsABCjaBGVeH7tFxWHicSb0axFG4/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy9hNDk0/Mzc5ZS05ZWE3LTRj/NzYtYTM2OC1kNGZm/NjViNGQyZDhmNGU2/MTE1MmRmNjE1MDY2/ZTRfU2hpdmFfVGVt/cGxlX0t1ZGFuX05p/Z3JvZGhyYW1fS2Fw/aWxiYXN0dV9OZXBh/bF9SYWplc2hqX0Ro/dW5nYW5hXygyKS5q/cGVn.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-01-663_0c0c85a37114e97a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701322},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Bahnhof Eismeer (Eismeer Railroad Station) in Grindelwald, Switzerland","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bahnhof-eismeer-eismeer-railroad-station","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Viewpoint Bahnhof Eismeer\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/0oUjtZVyAZh63nsprm0Oa135b23uBJVw-2cdVuLFQBY/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy82YWMw/ODcwNS03ODJmLTQ3/ZjgtODY2OC05YjIx/ZWVmOWVjYzA2NmY1/NmI2MWNlMmQxNzZj/ODVfMS5qcGc.jpg\" /></p> <p>This station can only be reached by train because it is located at an altitude of 3,159 meters (10,364 feet), directly in the Eiger mountain in the Bernese Alps. The station is the second-highest in Europe, and part of the Jungfrau Railway, which runs from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungfrauenjoch. The destination station, the Jungfraujoch, is the highest station in Europe, located at 3,454 meters (11,332 feet). The main use of the train station Eismeer is to give passengers a view of the surrounding mountains.</p>\n<p>Construction of the Jungfrau Railway began in 1896. The first section was completed in 1898. An additional section with a station followed every year, until the Eismeer station was opened on July 25, 1905. Since the initiator of the Jungfrau Railway, Adolf Guyer-Zeller, had died in the meantime and his successors, his sons, had financial difficulties, the Eismeer station remained the terminus for a few years until the Jungfrau station was completed in 1912.</p>\n<p>The route runs over just nine kilometers (5.6 miles), approximately seven kilometers (4.3 miles) of which is inside the mountain. The train climbs some 1,400 meters (4,593 feet) in altitude, a journey which takes about 35 minutes. On the way up, the train has always stopped at Eismeer station, allowing passengers to enjoy the view. Today this stop lasts about five minutes. While initially there were only balconies with metal grilles on the viewing platforms, these are now completely covered for safety reasons.</p>\n<p>From here, visitors have an exceptional view of the surrounding mountains and in particular of the Ischmeer glacier. In 1973, the Ischmeer glacier was 8.3 kilometers (5.1 miles) long. Due to global warming, the length of the glacier has shortened significantly. By 2015, the length had shrunk to just 6.2 kilometers (3.9 miles).</p>\n<p>Originally there was another such station on this line, the Eigerwand station, right on the north face of the Eiger. This station opened on June 28, 1903, and was the terminus until the Eismeer station opened. The station can also only be reached by train, but has a door that leads directly out onto the cliff.

While wandering through the orchard, your gaze lands on apples so deeply hued that they seem to have emerged from a fairy tale. You reach out reflexively and pluck an enchanting orb, pressing its waxy, smooth skin against your palm. On taking a bite, you discover a rock-hard, sour piece of fruit. It's terrible.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Arkansas Black apples aren't meant to be eaten straight off the tree. In fact, the best thing you can do to one is put it in the refrigerator and forget about it until next season. Patient pickers are rewarded with a sweet, firm fruit that offers notes of cherry, cinnamon, vanilla, and coriander, but only after having aged it in cold storage for a few months.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Growers first discovered and cultivated this breed in 1870, at an orchard in the county seat of Bentonville. Arkansas established an economy around apple production, and during the 1920s, 15 to 20 percent of the state's yield was its namesake black variety, thought to be a descendant of the Winesap apple. But moth infestations that necessitated costly management and the onset of the Great Depression were a fatal blow to commercial production.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Families maintained Arkansas Black apples trees in their yards, but the supply was relegated to home cooking, including baking the long-lasting fruit into pies and pastries. Today, the species make up between 3 and 5 percent of the state's apple production. Over the last decade, local chefs have taken to the fruit with renewed interest, using the <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/heirloom-appalachian-apples\">heritage crop</a> to add a unique element to meat accompaniments, pie fillings, and cheese pairings.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Feb 2022 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7dd18e65b0de785126a07296a1c7edd6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.atlasobscura.com/J6YiYjybTfmG2DVUvKSHEZdysJB9mDirPFR9giFMLNI/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy85N2I1/MzA5NC1iYzVlLTRk/ZjktYmI0Yi1jMTdk/ZWYzNjkzMWNlZmQ0/NjVhNmFkYjkxNDA5/OGVfNDQ2MDcxMTlf/MjkxMDYzNzQxNTMw/OTU3XzU4MDMxMjE3/Mzc0MzkwNTk5M19u/LmpwZw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-01-808_69b22fd560de8ad3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701316},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Floating Coffin of Pinner in London, England","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/floating-coffin-of-pinner","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Hanging coffin of Pinner\" data-width=\"5238\" data-height=\"3539\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/cFEeLt06ckSHrRXX0ID4UTlCPei6UYC9eFB-mJ2Pt5c/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:5238:3492:nowe:0:0/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy9lYmZj/ZWNhMS03NjM0LTQ0/NDEtOTQzMi03YTgw/NzdhMDc3ZjNhYjY4/M2ZlYjk3NzJhZjM0/ZTJfS01LMDM3MDQu/SlBH.jpg\" /></p> <p>There is a grave in the churchyard of St. John the Baptist’s church in Pinner that stands apart—or rather above— the rest.</p>\n<p>A stone, triangular monument protrudes out from the ground, and thrust through its center is a single coffin. The monument is dedicated to William Loudon and his wife, Agnes Loudon.</p>\n<p>Several stories surround this odd, in some ways occult, monument.

It's said Loudon’s son, in his burgeoning career as a landscaper and cemetery designer, created this clever workaround.

The city is stuffed with such examples of well-preserved but long-disused monuments that Romans have proudly built to uphold their culture and civilization as the world’s apex.</p>\n<p>Of late, however, a growing community of Italians are turning to a more vivid way of honoring the past. Both restaurants and a museum are embracing new, experiential forms of food archeology to demonstrate how food has always been one of the glories of Rome.</p>\n<p>On the northwestern flank of the Circus, an ancient marble finger mounted on a wall points to the sky above the entrance to Garum, Rome’s new culinary <a href=\"https://www.museodellacucina.com/\">library and museum</a>. Inside, amongst the creeping foliage and lush marble of a former monastery, I meet Matteo Ghirighini, the Museum’s director and lead curator.</p>\n<p>Despite only opening in February 2020—two weeks before the pandemic gripped the country—the space itself feels practically primordial. Ghirighini first walks me through the museum’s ground-floor collection of kitchenware, pointing out 17th-century cake molds and hand-painted terrine pots hailing from throughout the continent. These items, once common amongst the elite, are now quite rare.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88119/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Such implements, though, are only half of Garum’s collection, the culmination of a lifelong obsession of hotelier-turned-pâtissier Rossano Boscolo. In the early 1980s, the pastry chef began accumulating these tools, later opening a cooking academy in the Etrurian town of Tuscania. It wasn’t long before Boscolo made the leap to historic culinary texts, compiling a collection that is at once comprehensive and eclectic. Finally, after nearly 40 years of amassing these treasures, Boscolo made his collection public, putting Ghirighini, an antiquarian bookseller by trade, at its helm.</p>\n<p>By appointment but free of charge, visitors to Garum can access an invaluable selection of largely French and Italian cookbooks, stored in the upper level of the museum. From a 1541 Lyon imprint of Apicius’s chronicle of ancient Roman cuisine to a first printing of Bartolomeo Scappi’s Renaissance era cookbook, Boscolo’s collection spans <a href=\"https://www.museodellacucina.com/en/book-show/\">millennia of gastronomic history</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of the books happen to be first editions, which are seldom accessible to the public. The collection is a resource for both historians and scholars, but Ghirighini also considers it a way for ordinary people to connect and empathize with cooks of centuries past. “The study of culinary texts,” Ghirighini tells me, “affords a rare insight into those who are doing the cooking, particularly amongst the working-class. In this way, we can better understand the spirit of their time.”</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88117/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Where I’m eager to delve into the era of Apicius, whose first-century <em>De Re Coquinaria</em> is generally considered the first cookbook on record and whose true authorship remains forever in question, Ghirigini prefers to keep the museum’s focus on the Renaissance era and beyond. According to him, the ancient works are “unreliable.” He’s not wrong. Even the museum’s namesake <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/garum-ancient-roman-fish-sauce\"><em>garum</em></a><em><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/garum-ancient-roman-fish-sauce\">⁠</a>—</em>an ancient condiment made from fermented fish innards⁠—lacks any sort of cohesive recipe to be faithfully replicated.</p>\n<p>The notion of absolute authenticity plagues any scholar focused on the ancients. Instead, Ghirighini sees the museum as sort of a gastronomic <em>Mythbusters</em>. With Boscolo’s collection as a resource, the museum tracks the evolution of famed dishes, looking to separate food fact from folklore while engaging as broad an audience as possible.</p>\n<p>During its short existence the museum has hosted a diverse range of exhibits and initiatives, including “Garum By Night,” an evening of historical fine dining, the “Panettone Maximo” competition where local bakers vied to create the best Christmas cake, and wine tastings. Boscolo himself has also hosted a limited-run television series entitled <a href=\"https://www.la7.it/il-gusto-di-sapere\"><em>Il gusto di sapere</em></a> (“The Pleasure of Knowledge”) in which he and a celebrity co-chef cooked recipes sourced from his book collection, cooking them onsite while discussing their origins.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88123/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>This scholarly attitude towards food has spread to a number of innovative restaurants in Rome. Hostaria Antica Roma’s Paolo Magnanimi knows quite well the limitations of the texts he’s researched. Consider Magnanimi’s version of <em>patina cotidiana</em>, translated literally to “everyday dish.” Magnanimi uses era-appropriate ingredients—beef, fennel, and cheese—to produce a kind of proto-lasagna.</p>\n<p>Yet consulting Joseph Dommers Vehling’s translation of Apicius, one won’t find a cheesy casserole. Rather, the first mention of <em>patina quotidiana</em> features cow’s brains mashed, poached, and presented as a sort of omelet. Later in the <em>Coquinaria</em>, though, the <em>patina cotidiana</em> does feature varied ingredients, such as cow’s udder and fish, sandwiched between <em>laganum</em>, a sort of flatbread made from wheat flour. As several culinary scholars have hypothesized, the recipe may well have served as precedent for the sheets of <em>lasagne </em>first referenced in the 14th-century <em>Liber de Coquina</em>.</p>\n<p>By presenting the <em>patina </em>as a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210719-what-did-the-ancient-romans-eat\">tomatoless lasagna</a>, Magnanimi can in theory cater to modern appetites while also showing how much Italian food has changed over the centuries. After all, tomatoes didn’t exist in Europe until the 16th century.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88113/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Operating in clear view of the Pantheon, the oldest operational building on earth, Rome’s Armando al Pantheon may well be equally iconic in certain circles. Founded in 1961 as a traditional trattoria by its namesake, only under the stewardship of Armando’s son, Claudio Gargioli, has the <em>trattoria</em> blossomed into a proper <em>ristorante</em>.</p>\n<p>Here, Apicius’s recipe for duck is simply prepared with prunes and an ancient honey wine called <em>mulsum</em>, while his guinea fowl, for lack of <em>laser</em><em>—</em>an ancient herb lost to time—is enhanced instead with porcini mushrooms and dark ale. Like Magnanimi, Gargioli weaves narrative and history into his dishes, even publishing a literary cookbook that ties personal anecdotes to traditional recipes.</p>\n<p>Magnanimi himself happens to be meeting up with Ghirihini the day after our call, hinting at future collaborations between his restaurant and the museum. Pandemic permitting, Ghirighini envisions visiting chefs and scholars perusing Garum’s rare texts and illuminating them through tastings and even more events within the library. The reanimation of historical cuisine affords a rare opportunity to engage with and learn from history, as cooks interpret old recipes to the best of their abilities. As Magnanimi and Gargioli have shown, the attempts may not be absolutely authentic, but they’re almost always delicious.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 22:30:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"02c5fa7c1ac348018693604f8752457d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Eric Millman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88119/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-01-824_c599804cd9594ea5.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88117/image.jpg":null,"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88123/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn82@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-848_57db383b747212a8.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/88113/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn47@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-01-918_d90e12dbe4572413.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245701315},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:01","title":"Green Chartreuse","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/green-chartreuse-carthusian-monks-voiron-france","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"The cellars where the monks age their liqueur.\" data-width=\"3504\" data-height=\"2336\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://img.atlasobscura.com/uTmioAxBAJqlB_cdQL41_ZvcuS5W4-wquf-m2HzUn00/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy80M2Jh/NTkzNi04MTFhLTQ2/ZjYtOGUxYy00NzRm/MzczYTlmOTMzZThi/NTkxMWRhZmMwOGZm/NTlfQ2hhcnRyZXVz/ZV9jYXZlc19EYXZp/ZCBNb25uaWF1eC5q/cGc.jpg\" /></p> <p>In 1084 AD, St. Bruno of Cologne formed an order of silent monks called the Carthusians. They resided in a valley of the Chartreuse Mountains, a region of the French Alps, near Voiron. By 1605, they were a large, well-respected order, and King Henri IV's Marshal of Artillery presented the Carthusians with an ancient alchemical manuscript. It contained a recipe for an elixir that would prolong life.</p>\n<p>But after looking over the document, even the most learned of monks were at a loss. The concoction called for 130 different plants. It required advanced distillation, infusion, and maceration techniques. No one could even decode the recipe until 1737, when the monastery's apothecary finally produced a liqueur following the ancient text. Even then, it's assumed he took creative liberties.</p>\n<p>A lone monk delivered the first bottles of potent herbal tonic (which was 69 percent alcohol) to surrounding villages by mule. But it didn't end there: In 1764, the Carthusians adapted the recipe into a milder liqueur called Green Chartreuse. The update, which was still potent at 55 percent alcohol, is the version we consume today. <a href=\"https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/11/info-about-chartreuse-difference-between-green-and-yellow-chartreuse-how-to-mix-with-chartreuse-cocktail-advice.html\">Some tasters</a> describe it as an herbaceous, sinus-clearing drink that's \"almost mentholated in its immediate heat.\" The monks themselves recommend serving it cold, either chilled or on the rocks.</p>\n<p>Despite increasing demand, the order has continued the tradition of having just two monks handle the entire process. Only Dom Benoît and Brother Jean-Jacques know all the ingredients and how to turn them into the beloved, moss-toned liqueur. Once they've readied a batch, they age it in huge oak casks inside the world’s longest liqueur cellar. Several years later, the same men test the product and decide if it's ready for bottling. That's where their work ends, as all subsequent phases of production are handled by other parties.</p>\n<p>The liqueur is now sold all over the world, with funds going toward the monastery. Buying alcohol lauded for longevity <em>and</em> a righteous cause? You'd be a sinner not to drink to that.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Feb 2022 16:00:00
