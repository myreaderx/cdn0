The <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/a-guide-to-modernas-covid-19-vaccine/\">Moderna</a> phase 3 trial included about 30,000 volunteers, while the <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/a-guide-to-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/\">Pfizer/BioNTech</a> and Johnson &#38; Johnson trials included about 44,000 each.

The figure may refer to reports submitted to a federal database used to monitor vaccine safety &#8212; but, as we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-viral-posts-misuse-vaers-data-to-make-false-claims-about-covid-19-vaccines/\">explained</a>, anyone can submit such reports, so they&#8217;re not verified or proof that the vaccine caused the reported problem. The system has been frequently <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-tucker-carlson-misrepresents-vaccine-safety-reporting-data/\">misrepresented</a>.<span></span></p>\n<p>Nearly 44 minutes into the <a href=\"https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&#38;clip_id=15926\">committee hearing</a>, during an exchange with Farella, Hall also suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine should have been &#8220;pulled from the market&#8221; and made his erroneous claim about testing.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Hall, May 6:</strong> And have you seen any other vaccine that was put out for the public that skipped the animal tests?</p>\n<p><strong>Farella:</strong> Never before &#8212; especially for children.</p>\n<p><strong>Hall:</strong> What I have read, they actually started the animal tests and because the animals were dying, they stopped the tests. Folks, I think that&#8217;s important to understand there. That what we&#8217;re talking about is, the American people are now the guinea pigs. This is the test program that&#8217;s going on. They didn&#8217;t do the human testing and they stopped the animal tests because the animals were dying, and then they turned it out for the public.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But as we said, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2798-3\">testing</a> on both animals and humans was conducted before the COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.
