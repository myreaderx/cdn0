Some short-lived pollutants dropped noticeably during the strong lockdowns of April, as businesses shuttered and travel was reduced. But CO<sub>2 </sub>levels don't fluctuate based on short-term events like that, so the long-term effect on climate change was expected to be trivially small—assuming economies rebounded fairly quickly.</p>\n<p>A new study led by the University of Leeds’ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersforster\">Piers Forster</a> (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersforster/status/1291704349714939906\">his daughter Harriet</a>) takes advantage of phone location data to re-examine the first six months of the year, tracking more than just CO<sub>2</sub>. While they ultimately find that the impact has been small, their results also highlight that the <em>way</em> economies choose to rebound could have a much bigger effect over the long term.</p>\n<p>The work relies on mobility data made public by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility\">Apple</a>, covering 114 countries. Using that along with energy and emissions datasets, the researchers converted behavior changes into pollution changes. The phone data record changes in transportation use quite well, although purported changes in activity between residential, commercial, and industrial settings are harder to relate to energy. The researchers compared the changes they saw in their phone data to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x\">May study</a> that estimated April emissions using things like utility data. They found their phone-based estimate of home energy use probably overestimates the real change.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697532#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697532&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u5U37aIGQ7E:OnAhk8PRr5w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 12:30:35 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/india_tmo_2016-2020_lrg-800x847.png","linkMd5":"1f8ee3e737cba81ca20f434345f0e356","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_1/2020-08-08/1596902007117_8b894ae34fe78935.webp","author":"Scott K.

Finding a new podcast to love can be daunting when episodes regularly exceed the hour-long mark. If you’re struggling to commit to podcasts on topics like history and science, don’t fret: We have recommendations for great series that typically serve complete episodes well under half an hour.</p>\n<h3>Science Diction</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the best way to recover from stress is to focus on learning something new. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/813012842/science-diction\">Science Diction</a> helps with this by presenting the etymologies of familiar scientific technical terms alongside bite-sized usage histories of how people engage with science. The episode on \"Meme,\" for example, tells the story of the word's coinage as a parallel to \"gene\" to show how ideas spread through a culture. Science Diction talks about the spread of \"meme\" itself, sometimes as a meme, until it became the one of the most common ways to refer to images and jokes passed around on the Internet. An episode titled \"Vaccine,\" meanwhile, teaches us what happens when the public is scared of new science, describing antivax propaganda nearly as old as the first vaccines themselves.</p>\n<p>Science Diction releases episodes monthly, and it only started this year, so many of its episodes are about concepts related to COVID-19. Even if you’re fatigued by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/covid-19-coverage/\">that topic</a>, I still recommend this podcast as a refreshing, historical overview of similar stories, told in a laid-back way.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697338#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697338&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 14:00:36 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quick-podcasts-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"d509600f93eba59ed9eee68e5f9b39f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596902011066_4c5ca911faf8dbd1.webp","author":"Ars Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quick-podcasts-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596902011066_4c5ca911faf8dbd1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596902028971_9b3bb5623e05de91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=VHPvPmY1NR4:snypPVafnHs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_2/2020-08-08/1596902034932_f109b6f5ad45fc26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_3/2020-08-08/1596902026917_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_5/2020-08-08/1596902037460_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-08 23:53:12","updatedTime":"2020-08-08 23:53:12","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 15:53:12 +0000","fetchMs":65,"handleMs":1120,"totalMs":48656,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3.248.106.3","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"1ef034e3c89346b281bb55206f93af5e_2","bgimgsTotal":3,"bgimgsGithubTotal":3,"articlesImgsTotal":11,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":11},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-07 17:28:11","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn92@2020_2/2020-08-08/1596901991259_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
