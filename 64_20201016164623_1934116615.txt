Robots aren&#8217;t capable of creative thinking for sure, but there are two aspects to creating art, right? The idea, and the execution. Meet the Primus robot &#8211; it partners with human creators to be able to execute their artistic visions. Designed to work as a robotic arm holding a brush or a tube of paint, Primus is great at execution, creating stunningly accurate geometric artpieces that absolutely pop!</p>\n<p>The first series of artpieces pay a minimalist homage to Andy Warhol, one of modern art&#8217;s biggest proponents. The Warhol artpiece was translated from a digital format into a set of commands that Primus can understand. Then all you do is mount a canvas, calibrate the Primus, and get it to start painting! Primus uses a combination of brush strokes and paint extrusion, creating paint that isn&#8217;t just flat, but has an element of thickness to it too. Certain swatches use stencils, which the human helps apply and remove during the painting process. The result? A very odd yet appealing combination of art and a robotic factory-line! I guess Warhol would really find this enjoyable!</p>\n<p>Designer: Proximars</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/auto-draft/proximars_painting_robot_1.jpg\"

src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/a-wifi-router-that-encourages-you-to-disconnect-from-the-digital-world/1_BIUM_Jonghoon-Yoon_light-smartphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Last year, the Bium wifi router took home the Bronze award from the Asia Design Prize for its unique mission: to help users disconnect from the internet. Ironic? Perhaps. But in the Internet age, it&#8217;s easy to become overwhelmed with information and mild distractions. The occasional break from social media can do wonders for your mental health.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s hard to step away from our devices. The Bium has a setting that switches off the internet periodically, helping users clear their minds of digital distractions. The length of these internet-enabled intervals is indicated by four glowing antennas on the router. As the data “runs out,” the light fades — almost like a candle flame. Users can also extend the Bium’s self-imposed internet limit by placing their phone on the little tray that appears to double as a wireless charger. This is such a clever feature because it truly stops users from going online; they can&#8217;t be tempted to use their phone data. No cheating allowed.</p>\n<p>When you first look at the Bium, its function (as a wifi router) is not immediately apparent. It looks more like an electronic incense holder &#8211; a smart design choice that helps foster a calm, meditative environment. However, its appearance and function perfectly embody its name, bium, which translates to &#8220;emptiness&#8221; in Korean. The digital world is full of distractions, which is why the Bium encourages users to put down their devices and embrace the bium.</p>\n<p>Designer: Jonghoon Yoon</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone

don&#8217;t have your contact solution? Then you Google how to keep your contacts safe because you need them the next morning and you end up putting it in saltwater, praying that they don&#8217;t dry up or cause infections to your eye. Obviously, this is not safe and can be extremely harmful &#8211; even contact solution alone is not enough to kill all the microbes in your lenses, and if you&#8217;re a girl then you know there might even be specs of mascara. So how do we ensure our lenses are always clean and avoid serious infections? We use Q Egg and a reminder on our phones to pack the solution!</p>\n<p>Q Egg is a smart contact lens case that gives you triple protection against bacteria by working with your contact solution as well as DNA-smashing UVC light to kill infection-spreading microorganisms. There are three layers of defense that are designed in the product to make the process super efficient while delivering the highest standards of cleanliness &#8211; your contact solution, UVC light, and a vibrational motor. Q Egg radiates DNA-smashing UVC light as a second layer of defense to kill infection-spreading microorganisms. The vibrational motor that recirculates the solution to rinse off any remaining particles and natural eye secretions. These powerful combinations kill 99.999% of the toughest and most stubborn pathogens commonly found responsible for contact-related eye infections. In a pandemic where the virus can spread via contact with the eyes, it is important to make sure we are keeping our contact lenses as clean as possible.</p>\n<p>The case&#8217;s sleek design lets you disinfect your lenses on-the-go and was made to fit with the rest of your cosmetic tools. The product has controlled wavelengths and doses so it won&#8217;t fog or change the color of your contact lenses. &#8220;Q Egg needs just 30 minutes to do what your contact lens solution alone needs 4 hours to achieve,&#8221; claims the team as they talk about how this product was designed to reduce medical risks and costs.

src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stilform/stilform-ink/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>stilform&#8217;s vision for the humble is so incredibly simplistic and elegant, it won an award for the World&#8217;s Best Pen in 2016. It&#8217;s easy to make products better by complicating them, adding new features, or giving them design upgrades&#8230; making a product better by simplifying it is an incredibly challenging task, yet the stilform INK handles it beautifully.</p>\n<p>Celebrated as the most successful fountain pen in crowdfunding history, the stilform INK is back in its minimal, delightful glory, but with a few tiny tweaks that make it better and more long-lasting. The pen comes in its signature cylindrical design, with two flat edges running length-wise to prevent it from rolling. Its iconic element lies in the magnetic cap, which cleverly self-aligns as it snaps to the pen, thanks to multiple hidden neodymium magnets that make sure the cap fits on the right way. To open the pen, just twist the cap causing the inner magnets to repel each other, and the cap effortlessly comes off to reveal the German-made Peter Bock nib sitting inside.</p>\n<p>In its pursuit of simplicity, the pen hides all its functional details to keep its form pristine. Made almost entirely from machined titanium and aluminum, the stilform INK doesn&#8217;t use any plastic parts or glue in its assembly&#8230; just old-fashioned threading, tolerances, and magnets help hold the pen together and allow it to last practically forever. The titanium outer body of the stilform INK comes with an added Diamond-like Coating to protect its surface finish, making it absolutely scratch and abrasion-proof, keeping your pen looking brand new even after decades.</p>\n<p>Each stilform INK pen comes impeccably crafted and assembled in Germany, in a variety of anodized colors for the aluminum variant and in DLC black for the titanium variant. You can choose the style of Bock nib you want fitted in your pen, along with a variety of add-ons, including a leather pouch, an aluminum base, or a machined metallic pocket clip that slides right onto the pen&#8217;s cap whenever you want. You can even grab a discount on stilform&#8217;s entire pen collection, featuring the stilform INK along with its Red Dot Design Award and German Design Award-winning pens, the stilform Ballpoint, and the Arc Gel Pen.</p>\n<p>Designer: stilform</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stilform-ink.kckb.st/c70d7607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $77</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-09-11T08:27:01+00:00\">$97</del> (20% off).

display","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=281695","description":"<p><iframe title=\"PhonePad  | Turn Your Smartphone Into a Tablet\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\"

Smartphones have the same components most tablets and laptops have. They connect to the internet, have powerful processors, can multitask, and with their variety of apps, allow you to do everything you possibly could on a laptop&#8230; the only distinction being they&#8217;re small enough to slide into your pockets. While that&#8217;s definitely an achievement, the smartphone&#8217;s small size actually is what prevents it from being a full-fledged replacement to your computer. You can&#8217;t really enjoy movies on a 5-inch screen, or efficiently make presentations, or read through long documents &#8211; these are places where a larger display just helps. The PhonePad gives your smartphone that larger display&#8230; and much more.</p>\n<p>Designed as a sleek, wired display that&#8217;s compatible with any smartphone, tablet, or even laptop, the PhonePad gives you an instant FullHD external display measuring at 15.6-inches, complete with a touchscreen surface. Plug the PhonePad into your smartphone and it instantly scales it up. You can operate your phone using PhonePad&#8217;s touchscreen, and enjoy the benefit of a larger display, perfect for watching Netflix or playing Fortnite (or Among Us, whichever suits you). However, the true potential of the PhonePad is in turning your smartphone into a laptop. Given that your iPhone or Android phone already has the processing power and the app-store to let you do everything from attending meetings to typing mails, making spreadsheets, communicating on Slack, and sharing files, the PhonePad completes the laptop experience by giving you a larger screen, along with multiple ports, a headphone jack, and a powerful set of speakers! Just hook the PhonePad up using a USB cable and you have a much larger, latency-free display. You can even hook a wireless keyboard and mouse to your phone and you literally have a laptop running a mobile OS!</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you&#8217;re a hardcore laptop user, the PhonePad simply upgrades your workflow by giving you a secondary display. Connect it to your laptop and you instantly have a multi-window setup that you can use for work, entertainment, gaming, or a combination of the previous 3. The PhonePad measures a mere 0.2 inches and weighs 0.95 lbs, allowing you to slip it right into your bag or under your arm and carry it wherever you go. It comes with its own cover too that doubles as a stand, allowing you to use the PhonePad in both landscape and portrait orientations! Its universal compatibility makes it even better, giving you the ability to connect it to almost all your devices that support external displays&#8230; like your smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, Nintendo Switch, or even your DSLR! Yeah, you heard me!</p>\n<p>Designer: Anyware Technology</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-281696\"

Remember Pen Drives? Those thumb-sized USB sticks became all the rage in Y2K for transferring files, movies, and illegally downloaded music (don&#8217;t act like you never used Limewire). The problem, however, with Pen Drives were their limited amount of storage&#8230; an issue that was solved by External Hard Disks that hit peak popularity around 2010. These Hard Drives could store over a hundred times what a Pen Drive could, but they had a problem. They were large, came with detachable cables that often got lost, and most importantly, they had rotating discs inside which could go corrupt or get scratched without warning. That&#8217;s when Cloud Drives came to the rescue. Just store your belongings on a foolproof server somewhere in a nondescript location, and you could access all your data via the internet. A pretty convenient solution, although with three caveats. A. You needed a pretty great internet connection, and B. Your data could be accessed by anyone who pretended to be you, and C. You needed to pay a recurring subscription fee for this cloud-service to store your data&#8230; rent, basically.</p>\n<p>Now that the history lesson is over, close those damn textbooks and take a look at the future of storage. Meet the VAVA SSD Touch, a pocket-sized storage device that&#8217;s high on capacity, high on security, and on portability. It&#8217;s sort of like we&#8217;ve come a full circle with the VAVA SSD Touch, but the idea is that this product builds on the successes of its ancestors. It&#8217;s as portable as a pen-drive, as spacious as a hard drive, arguably more secure than cloud-storage, and faster than all three of them. Measuring less than 4 inches, VAVA SSD Touch comes with a sleek looking metal case made from 100% recyclable aluminum, and solid-state drive on the inside ranging anywhere from 512GB to 2TB in capacity. Its slick metallic casing is punctuated by a blue square located on the front that gives the VAVA SSD Touch a layer of biometric security. Acting sort of as a password, the fingerprint sensor prevents people from accessing your data without your authorization. The SSD only unlocks after it authenticates your fingerprint, and you can program as many as 10 fingerprints into the VAVA SSD Touch, allowing your family, colleagues, or coworkers to have access to shared data&#8230; or better still, use a password to ensure more impregnable security.</p>\n<p>Its portable format makes it infinitely easier to carry large amounts of data, and unlike a cloud account, you don&#8217;t need an internet connection to access your files. In fact, the SSD uses a USB 3.1 (Gen2) interface and has read/write speeds of up to 540/480MB/s, allowing you to transfer a file as heavy as 10Gb in nearly 20 seconds. Designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices, you can use the VAVA SSD Touch to transfer files between systems, take backups of your smart-device/computers/servers, play games on your console, watch movies on your TV, or even quickly take file-dumps from your camera or drone. With as much as 2TB of data, the VAVA SSD Touch gives you more storage than you&#8217;ll actually need in a format that fits in your pocket, locks with your fingerprint, boasts of a 3-year warranty, and comes at a one-time cost so you don&#8217;t need to pay monthly or yearly fees to Apple, Google, Amazon, or Microsoft for their cloud storage plans. Besides, you can even grab yourself one of VAVA&#8217;s 9-in-1 USB Hubs to completely revolutionize how you use your devices!</p>\n<p>Designer: Eric Wei</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vava-ssd-touch.kckb.st/5cf48b20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $89</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-10-15T06:53:50+00:00\">$132</del> (32% off).

Instead of the conventional hour markers in a watch, the watch face features clock hands. The hour numbers are completely replaced by a mini arrangement of hands to display each hour of the day. However, these mini clock hands are still, whereas the larger running hands tell the minutes and the hour. Featuring a 40mm case, the watch is unisex. The 316L stainless-steel enclosed casing is available in color options of black and silver. Not to mention the casing is ultra-thin, only 7.5mm. Running on a Miyota GL20 Japanese movement, the watch is a part of Anicorn’s Trio of Time Series. Its straps are interchangeable with the strap of any other watch in the TTT series.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/volleback-garbage-watch/01-Garbage-Watch_Vollebak_repurposed.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/volleback-garbage-watch/04-Garbage-Watch_Vollebak_repurposed.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/volleback-garbage-watch/09-Garbage-Watch_Vollebak_repurposed.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Meet the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/14/this-watch-aims-to-repurpose-the-tonnes-of-electronic-waste-generated-every-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Garbage Watch</a> by Vollebak, a watch made by repurposing the electronic waste we throw out every year. Rapidly changing technology has given rise to a culture of disposable electronics – everything from phones to TV, gadgets are not designed to last long. This electronic waste contains many of the world’s precious metals like silver, platinum, copper, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, and zinc. You’ll find 7% of the world’s gold in e-waste! Vollebak changed their approach to the problem, they explained “So our Garbage Watch started with a very simple idea. What if garbage isn’t garbage? What if it’s simply pre-assembled raw materials that we can use to make new things. It’s why everything you can see on the Garbage Watch used to be something else – a motherboard from your computer, a microchip in your smartphone, or wiring from your TV.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/Nixie_watch_using_VFD_technology.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/this-vfd-nixie-watch-looks-cooler-than-any-smartwatch-ive-ever-seen/Nixie_watch_using_VFD_technology_02.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/17/this-vfd-nixie-watch-looks-cooler-than-any-smartwatch-ive-ever-seen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VFD watch</a> by Nixoid Command sports a gorgeous steampunk design that, in the era of smartwatches, feels like the perfect alternative to a timepiece that captures all your data and tracks every move. Fitted on the inside with Vacuum Fluorescent Displays encased in glass cylinders that perfectly resemble Nixie tubes, the VFD watch comes in two variants, a traditional-looking circular Space Watch, and a rectangular Cyber Watch that looks more eye-catching. Both watch variants come with a steel body that’s fitted with proprietary Vacuum Fluorescent Displays that showcase the time. The watches revive VFD technology (commonly found in cassette players and other electronic products in the 70-80s), which eventually went obsolete after LCD screens made their debut. Each watch comes precisely fitted with VFD tubes that help tell the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/this-spacex-themed-timepiece-is-a-musk-have-for-your-watch-collection/02-spacex_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/this-spacex-themed-timepiece-is-a-musk-have-for-your-watch-collection/05-spacex_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This cool space-themed watch by UNDONE (a brand has always shown a penchant for space) has created the <a href=\"http://yankodesign.com/2020/08/20/this-spacex-themed-limited-edition-timepiece-is-a-musk-have-for-your-watch-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpaceXplorer</a> watch that pays homage to the 2014 SpaceX Dragon V2 spacecraft. It is a limited-edition timepiece that celebrates achievements that we have made in terms of design, technology, and innovation. This special watch pays great attention to detail and you will recognize those little things instantly if you are a space nerd. For instance, it features styling elements from the new SpaceX ultra-modern space suits. Then it takes it up a notch by using the Dragon V2 capsule’s design details – the grey dial ring, white indices, and the unique hands which are modeled off of the capsules white oblong shaped indices and windows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/09/auto-draft/adesse_watch_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"ADESSE\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0PLiQxZlRo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/09/30/the-adesse-watch-showcases-minimalism-achieved-through-design-by-subtraction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adesse Watch</a> literally has a watch strap and face. It strips away the watch of everything Jansen believes can be removed, but still retains the watch’s functionality. The watch has absolutely no hands, a plain, unbranded face, and even uses minimal markings around the rim of the inside of the case, rather than on the dial itself. This results in the watch’s dial being an absolute empty canvas. Taking inspiration from an hourglass’s ability to use shadows to tell time, Adesse comes with an offset on the surface of its watch-dial. The offset casts a slight shadow, making it visible as a hand, which points to the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/ganymedes-series-01-watch-takes-inspiration-from-underwater-voyaging-vessels/ganymede_series01_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/ganymedes-series-01-watch-takes-inspiration-from-underwater-voyaging-vessels/ganymede_series01_5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Designed taking inspiration from marine voyaging vessels, the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/06/28/ganymedes-series-01-watch-takes-inspiration-from-underwater-voyaging-vessels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ganymede Series 01</a> by Bala Radharamanan doesn’t have a watch face as much as it has a porthole. The rounded-square watch body comes with a capsule-shaped window that has a unique way of telling the time. Peer through the capsule-shaped window and you see a bunch of numbers arranged in concentric arcs. Multiple hands make rounds of the watch’s vertical face, pointing out the time. Follow the hand’s color and read the number that it points to of the corresponding color, and there you have it. It does have a learning curve, but that’s the price of having something as uniquely alluring as the Ganymede Series 01.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ByEpWOd.gif\" alt=\"The Gemic Watch Tells Time Through Undulating 3D Surfaces\" width=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/04/the-gemic-watch-tells-time-through-undulating-3d-surfaces/gemic_3.jpg\" alt=\"The Gemic Watch Tells Time Through Undulating 3D Surfaces\" /></p>\n<p>“Time is not just a number but also a story of the life”, says designer Xundi Li, who has, through the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/04/02/the-gemic-watch-tells-time-through-undulating-3d-surfaces/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gemic</a>, attempted at giving time a shape. Ultimately each moment in your day is different from the last, and the Gemic watch tries to reflect that, by looking different with each passing minute. The watch consists of two different 3D layers that sit atop each other, rotating to tell the time. Ridges on the layers indicate what time it is, and the layers themselves come with amoeba-shaped cutouts that rotate as the layers do, creating a visualization in the center of the watch’s face… right in the middle of which sits Gemic’s branding.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"BIG BOLD Jelly Watch by Swatch\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAnONhvd2TA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/01/auto-draft/swatch_big_bold_jellyfish-yankodesign05.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Forfeiting the original 34 mm case, Swatch adopted a more impressive 47 mm dial, fully transparent with a semi-transparent silicone strap!

Crafted from plastic, the case features a height of 44.80 mm and a thickness of 11.75 mm. The larger case has been teamed up with red, blue, and yellow hands, making for a watch that looks as though it likes to have some fun!

Designed by Cesare Zuccaro, the watch’s second hand even resembles the lens on the sextant, with its hollow ring shape that forms a halo around the numbers on the dial as it smoothly makes its way in a circle. The watch comes encased in a 316L Stainless Steel body, topped with a sapphire glass. Nominated for an A’ Design Award, Argo lets you choose between a Milanese-style chainlink strap as well as a strap made out of premium Italian leather, both designed to complement the watch’s remarkable interstellar appeal!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/11/a-hands-free-wooden-watch-that-uses-twelve-little-circles-to-tell-the-time/grovemade_hero.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/11/auto-draft/grovemade_black_watch-yankodesign06.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/12/03/a-hands-free-wooden-watch-that-uses-twelve-little-circles-to-tell-the-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Watch 01</a> by Joe Mansfield and Ken Tomita of Grovemade with Stefan Andrén ditches the traditional analog design for a circular wooden face. The hand-sanded walnut face was dyed a beautiful black with Japanese calligraphy ink and topped off with a clear lacquer. Oxidized to a deep black, the stainless steel module complements the face perfectly. However, this is where it gets even more interesting. Foregoing the classical dials you usually see on watches, Grovemade adopted twelve little circles to represent the time, instead of the usual numbers. A peek at the watch will reveal not numbers, but round holes that will guide you, and be sure to watch out for the orange-and-white-colored ones!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/06/225782/odyssey_space_inspired_watch_01_layout.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2016/12/Odyssey_Movement_opens_in_chrome.gif\" alt=\"odyssey_movement_opens_in_chrome\" width=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Whether it’s via the air, land, or sea, fantastic voyages have long inspired timepiece design and the modern <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/06/23/the-odyssey-watchs-vanishing-chronograph-dials-showcase-the-passage-of-time-in-a-space-inspired-theme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Odyssey watch</a> by Sahil Ravjit &#38; Andra Wibisono is no exception. The masculine design looks to our eventual space travel as inspiration for its subtly futuristic yet sophisticated aesthetic. It’s an elegant, modern take on a classic precision timepiece – the chronograph. Its distinguished sub-dials have marked plates in place of traditional hands, creating the illusion of time passing as numbers slowly vanish out of sight. Dotted markers orbit at varying speeds, drawing the eye to a graceful movement while indicated the time elapsed.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to new concepts for iconic fashion staples, like <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/watch/\">watches</a>, it’s important for the design to stand out. Now, sometimes that means ornate details and intricate decoration, but sometimes it’s just the opposite. As is the case for the new visual timepiece concept, Sans. Turning minimalism into the design’s distinguishing attribute, Roshan Hakkim, the creator behind it, says, “Sans is a concept watch, which [aims to distill] the watch face to the bare minimum; ‘One dot replaces two hands.’”</p>\n<p>You won’t find any hour, minute, or second hand on this watch, in fact, the watch is named after the French word for “without.” Sans is a stainless steel concept watch that offers a relaxed alternative approach to telling time, you’ll know the hour and relative minute throughout the day, but not too much else. This is the perfect watch for outings that don’t require cell phones, time-limiting itineraries, or for those of us who prefer a bit more wiggle room when it comes to our personal schedules. Replacing the numbers that typically surround the watch face are laser etched dots and replacing the rotating clockface pointers, also known as &#8220;hands,&#8221; is a single circle that represents each hour of the day. Instead of the gradual transition from one hour to the next, this watch jumps every 5 minutes. For instance, in order to indicate a time of 2:30, number two will remain above the 30-minute marker. This minimalist approach to telling time is not so much an aesthetic decision, even though the design is both airy and elegant, but more so one rooted in a “celebration of purity,” as described by Hakkim on his Instagram.</p>\n<p>Timepieces are classic and will most likely stand the test of, well, time. Sans brings an exciting, fresh revamp to the traditional timepiece by stripping it down to its bare essentials. Besides, checking your phone for the exact time only leads to even more time spent on the touchscreen. With Sans, you might feel encouraged to forget about the details, the seconds, the minutes, if only for a moment, and to just live from hour to hour.</p>\n<p>Designer: Roshan Hakkim</p>\n<p><img

Jenga!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=282161","description":"<p><iframe title=\"GEMJI &#62; The Multigame System for Designers &#38; Creatives\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ralev/must-see-the-gemji-game/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got 1 minute to spare, I&#8217;d recommend you watch the video above and have your mind blown by what the GEMJI is capable of. I want to call it a pack of cards, but the GEMJI is more than that. I&#8217;d call it magnetic tiles, but the GEMJI is capable of working like blocks too. Its innovative design and magnetic modular system mean the GEMJI can practically be anything you want it to be. Just like a TV screen is made of individual pixels that light up to create any type of image, the GEMJI&#8217;s individual tiles come together to form the framework of any sort of game. You can use the GEMJI to build game-boards, mazes, towers, and even 3D models because the GEMJI isn&#8217;t a game, it&#8217;s the base structure needed to build and play any game you want!</p>\n<p>The best way to describe the GEMJI is by calling it a game system. This means that GEMJI&#8217;s tiles can be used to devise and play multiple types of games for various audiences across all age groups. Younger GEMJI-players can use it to create mazes, while more proficient youngsters can snap multiple tiles together to build complex 3D models. If you&#8217;re looking for less of a creative outlet and more of a traditional game, the GEMJI&#8217;s black-and-white pieces can be used to play anything from Chess to Draughts, Jenga, Go, Mahjong, Backgammon and even devise your own games along the way! Each GEMJI box-set comes with 70 of those dual-color magnetic tiles, along with a playbook of 30+ games you can play (including GEMJI&#8217;s own original games) and an online app which promises many more games with future updates. Moreover, the system can be even used as a framework for learning specific skills &#8211; for example &#8211; programming fundamentals (yes, there are games for that, too). To make it easy to travel with, the box even packs a traveler&#8217;s pouch so that you can carry it wherever you go.</p>\n<p>GEMJI, as simple as it is, gets a whole bunch of things right. It&#8217;s compact, making it great to carry around, yet versatile, fitting a myriad of games into its small factor. Its magnetic construction gives it the advantage of ensuring your pieces never get lost, while also allowing you to play with the GEMJI on uneven surfaces or moving vehicles. In fact, the magnets even work as a fidget-toy. The GEMJI&#8217;s individual modules can be used in their 2D capacity as tiles or can be used as 3D building blocks to make larger objects. Each tile is carefully hand-assembled, and the entire set comes with as many as 500 built-in magnets for a new kind of unmatched gaming experience. The GEMJI magnetic tiles are washable too, allowing you to easily clean them if they get dirty&#8230; but by far two of its most impressive features are that A. it&#8217;s incredibly tactile and provides great audio feedback with the magnetic clicks, making it one of the only games that&#8217;s designed keeping visually impaired players in mind, and B. the absence of any language/text and the purely symbolic nature of the GEMJI makes it easy to play with children as well as with people who speak different languages!

CO2","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=282406","description":"<p><iframe title=\"weetbe mask osaka - promotional video (EN)\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\"

too&#8221;. Each mask, just like each phone, each car model, or each sneaker design, hopes to make its own impression, solve its own set of problems, and create a positive impact on the user and help the company earn a fair amount of money that then goes into delivering better products. Meet the weetbe mask, one of many masks featured on this site. Unlike other masks though, weetbe has a set of properties unique to it. It&#8217;s transparent, comes with not two but three filters, has an attachable face-shield component, and the best part, a modular fan-unit that snaps onto the filter on the front, power-delivering clean, filtered air to your nose and mouth for as long as 8 hours.</p>\n<p>Drawing on the analogy of masks and mobile phones, the weetbe mask offers a level of modularity that reminds me of Google&#8217;s Project Ara. The mask itself is a functional face-mask with a transparent body, hypoallergenic design, and certified filters&#8230; but its ability to snap-on extra modules is what makes it wonderful. The weetbe comes with a clear, see-through body complete with an air-sealing lining and an anti-fog coating. Adjustable straps help secure the mask around your face, while filters on the front as well as the sides help you breathe 98% clean, purified air. The mask comes fitted with Proveil filters, which are made from nanofibers that are small enough to trap respirable airborne particles including viruses. These filters are reusable, can be washed or steam-sterilized, and are made to biodegrade too, allowing you to replace them easily and guilt-free.</p>\n<p>The most anticipated feature about the weetbe, however, is the snap-on fan module. Referred to as the &#8216;fan osaka&#8217;, the fan module snaps right onto the front, pushing air through the anterior filter to create positive air pressure inside the mask. Built with its own lithium-ion battery, the fan works for 8 hours on a full charge and works silently. The module is smaller and lighter than you&#8217;d think, still retaining the mask&#8217;s transparent appeal, and is perfect for snapping on while exercising, jogging, or even for elderly people who find it difficult to breathe through a mask. Backers of the weetbe can even opt in for the &#8216;screen osaka&#8217; a snap-on-snap-off face shield made from clear polycarbonate, offering a pristine, see-through barrier that protects the upper half of your face. The screen sports a similar anti-fogging feature, making sure your view isn&#8217;t ever obstructed by condensation.</p>\n<p>Other features of the weetbe include its ability to be customized, with a custom skin you can apply on the inside of the mask, turning its transparent body into a canvas of print. The head-bands are customizable too, allowing you to add a name or company logo on. The weetbe is even splash-resistant, which means you can easily wear it out in the rain&#8230; and its transparent design, aside from enabling you to use facial unlocking on your phone, just gives you the freedom to breathe clean air and be protected without having your face concealed by opaque fabric or plastic. Besides, it helps to be able to smile at friends, neighbors, and other people too!</p>\n<p>Designer: Weetbe Design</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://weetbe-first-transparent-mask.kckb.st/ea0a7a3b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $29</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-09-05T10:42:36+00:00\">$75</del> (60% off).
