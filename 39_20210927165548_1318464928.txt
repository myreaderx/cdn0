Their end goal is to create interaction beyond language, through visuals alone. Today we&#8217;re sharing their latest, a furniture retrospective on traditional Korean culture that&#8217;s been modernized. An accompanying modern dance performance – the Living Performance Project – focuses on the emotions formed by the perception of the Klassiker lounge chair and SEOULBAN side table they&#8217;ve created. The viewer is then immersed in the furniture and its design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=453295\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-453295\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-453295\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/06/MISC-Studio-Klassiker-Chair-2-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"brown chair\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/06/MISC-Studio-Klassiker-Chair-2-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/06/MISC-Studio-Klassiker-Chair-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/06/MISC-Studio-Klassiker-Chair-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/06/MISC-Studio-Klassiker-Chair-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>MISC Studio&#8217;s <a href=\"https://misc.kr/Klassiker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Klassiker</a> is a lounge chair inspired by the traditional Korean A-frame carrier: ji-gae. Klassiker is designed to support weight with a simple system, the tension of the extended front and rear legs, along with the stability of oval-shaped wooden support, create a perfect balance.

table used since 37 A.D. through today. Functionality is improved with the more compact size, its simplicity marks the old days of Seoul.

The boundary of Seoul is marked with a heavy squared wooden top with curved edges. Molding details around the table&#8217;s base signify the eight castle gates that surrounded Seoul.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_453307\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

From Daybreak to Moonlight, they&#8217;re all really beautiful and would make any room feel dreamy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460845\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460845\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460845\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-460845\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-810x1097.jpg\" alt=\"model Iman dressed in gold and feathers at Met Gala\" width=\"810\" height=\"1097\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-810x1097.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-800x1084.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-768x1040.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-1134x1536.jpg 1134w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Courtesy Mike Coppola for Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTyZg_4IVZs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Iman at the Met Gala dressed by Harris Reed</a></strong><br />\nAnother dreamy pick&#8230; Did you catch the Met Gala red carpet, specifically Iman looking like an ethereal golden goddess?! Iman is always stunning, yet she looked even more otherworldly floating along in a gold jacquard bustier and flares with a tiered crinoline and gold leaf overskirt and matching headpiece, all thanks to London-based <a href=\"https://www.harrisreed.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Harris Reed</a>. I&#8217;ve followed the 25-year-old British-American designer on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/harris_reed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram</a> for a couple of years now and it&#8217;s no surprise their work landed on a supermodel at the Met Gala. Reed has been nailing each step of a short yet already impressive career which lead to this moment, from a candle collection (I have 2 and they&#8217;re intoxicating), a collaboration with MAC Cosmetics, a line of platform boots with ROKER Atelier, jewelry collaboration with Missoma, and now fresh off the London Fashion Week runway with their demi-couture collection made from upcycled garments from Oxfam. Looking forward to seeing what Reed does next!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/azio/products/retro-classic-usb?variant=40115067846847\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460847 noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-460847 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-810x810.jpg\" alt=\"angle shot of retro keyboard in maple wood\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-810x810.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-800x800.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/azio/products/retro-classic-usb?variant=40115067846847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">RETRO CLASSIC USB Keyboard</a></strong><br />\nYes, it&#8217;s super easy to whip open your laptop and start pecking away at the keys conveniently embedded right there. But when you&#8217;re at a desk for any extended period of time, getting a monitor and keyboard is probably a better setup for a multitude of reasons. There are plenty of keyboards to choose from but there&#8217;s something about one with keys that have that tactile clicky thing when pressed. In addition to that super satisfying feature, this keyboard also has a retro look that makes typing much more fun. Plus, it really makes your desk look way cooler than it is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460848\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460848\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460848\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table-810x402.jpg\" alt=\"three images showing DIY table made of cardboard\" width=\"810\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table-810x402.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table-800x398.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table-768x382.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://t-o-o-g-o-o-d.com/pages/the-joy-of-cardboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Roly-Poly Side Table DIY Instructions from Faye Toogood</a></strong><br />\n<em>The Unboxing Show</em>, which just wrapped at London Design Festival, is an exhibition by designer and artist Peter Marigold, that invited designers to remember that cardboard can be of value despite how much of it goes to waste. Modeled after her Roly-Poly side table, Toogood designed a version to be made from cardboard. At the show, visitors could create the design themselves with the help of a cardboard cutting CNC machine and assistance assembling it from Marigold and his team.

I&#8217;ve acquired an army of cameras throughout my life (I have a degree in photography) and always love finding a new one. This camera is the size of a cassette tape (if you&#8217;re old enough to remember those!) and is a legit digital camera that takes photos like a film camera all within a hard paper shell. It runs with two AAA batteries and an SD card, and once installed, you can take photos and videos with a resolution of 13 mega pixels. I ordered this months ago and just received it as they&#8217;ve been on backorder all year. Can&#8217;t wait to test it out!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/tRNMPxhaARs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:00:50 +0000","feedId":39,"bgimg":"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Calico-Wallpaper-Atmosphere-Daybreak-Wallpaper-810x703.jpg","linkMd5":"c2faf84a3d61060b0b31661dfef35494","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn92@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-32-971_b28b84a005c2de56.webp","destWidth":810,"destHeight":703,"sourceBytes":78086,"destBytes":46128,"author":"Caroline Williamson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Calico-Wallpaper-Atmosphere-Daybreak-Wallpaper-810x703.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn92@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-32-971_b28b84a005c2de56.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Iman-Met-Gala-2021-Harris-Reed-810x1097.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-39-327_4dd06545c0600c35.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Azio-Retro-Classic-USB-Keyboard-1-810x810.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-39-791_340e18bf9485c44d.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Faye-Toogood-Cardboard-Roly-Poly-side-table-810x402.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn100@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-38-320_e033b8697f00b674.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Take5-Oct21-Paper-Shoot-Paper-Camera-810x571.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-37-585_3938d72f2cbfa563.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/tRNMPxhaARs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-38-230_a8987277b6161a5f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761718206},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:18","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:18","title":"nlumec® Will Have You Seeing Candles in a New Light","link":"https://design-milk.com/?p=460412","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/seeing-candles-in-a-new-light/nlumec_brandspotlight_featuredimage-1280x720/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec_brandspotlight_featuredimage-1280x720-1-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"nlumec® Will Have You Seeing Candles in a New Light\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a title=\"nlumec®\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>nlumec®</strong></a> encourages us to rethink the way we consume candles.

The dynamic connection between light and form is illustrated through the geometric shape of each candle and their hyper-detailed etchings. As the candles burn, the etchings evolve into a delicate, netting-like structure around the candle’s flame. There are 3 unique designs, each named in Latin after an emotional state of being – <strong><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/gravis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">Gravis</a></strong>, <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/test_02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>Fortis</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/miratus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>Miratus</strong></a> – and laced with different meanings. Composed of materials as fleeting as the emotions themselves, nlumec® candles use a blend of ethically sourced beeswax, with cotton and hemp fibers. The thoughtful spirit and careful construction of nlumec® creations prove that candles can do more than create a warm ambience, they can be mediums of emotional expression through light.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/test_02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-460514 size-full\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-fortis-candle-1.gif\" alt=\"nlumec fortis candle before and after lighting\" width=\"810\" height=\"570\" /></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"nlumec® Fortis Candle\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/test_02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>nlumec® Fortis Candle</strong></a><br />\n/ˈfôrdəs/ strong, powerful, firm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/gravis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-460515 size-full\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-gravis-candle-1.gif\" alt=\"nlumec gravis candle before and after lighting\" width=\"810\" height=\"570\" /></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"nlumec® Gravis Candle\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/gravis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>nlumec® Gravis Candle</strong></a><br />\ngra‧vis /ˈɡrɑ(ː)ʋis/, [ˈɡrɑ(ː)ʋis̠] important, dignified, heavy, weighty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/miratus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-460518 size-full\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-miratis-candle-1.gif\" alt=\"nlumec miratus candle before and after lighting\" width=\"810\" height=\"570\" /></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"nlumec® Miratus Candle\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec/products/miratus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>nlumec® Miratus Candle</strong></a><br />\nmīrātus: astonished, amazed.</p>\n<p><strong>&#62;&#62;&#62; For more nlumec® candles, visit the Design Milk Shop <a title=\"here\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/nlumec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>here</strong></a>! &#60;&#60;&#60;</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/bTkOXIpxrVU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:00:42 +0000","feedId":39,"bgimg":"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec_brandspotlight_featuredimage-1280x720-1-810x456.jpg","linkMd5":"fba43cc5a1cc91b7bd682bcaa29d6742","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-25-061_528f1399e6d946eb.webp","destWidth":810,"destHeight":456,"sourceBytes":57455,"destBytes":35684,"author":"Alexa Morales","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec_brandspotlight_featuredimage-1280x720-1-810x456.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-25-061_528f1399e6d946eb.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec_founderimage_810x570.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-37-633_1fca15349eb9c521.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-fortis-candle-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-45-468_e007db44fa7a0af1.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-gravis-candle-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-41-297_4f79fded45cb6dc4.webp","https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/nlumec-miratis-candle-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn47@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-47-372_4bd5c9235f4a4158.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/design-milk/~4/bTkOXIpxrVU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn100@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-38-685_d72a2b880440ccc3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761718213},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:18","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:18","title":"Unfold Is the Tool You Need to Dominate Your Brand’s Social Media","link":"https://design-milk.com/?p=460456","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>We’re proud to create the following content in partnership with <a href=\"https://share.sqsp.link/designmilk-sept-homepage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener sponsored external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Squarespace</a>, an easy-to-use website builder.

You can do that in seconds with Unfold. If your brand channels 1970s skate culture, you can select a template from the Film Frames that will supply a rough-hewn, Super 8 aesthetic familiar to the early days of skate videos in empty SoCal pools. Meanwhile, the Moodboard collection gives away its fashion-friendly roots in its name.

Created in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://FrankLloydWright.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener sponsored external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation</strong></a>, this is a forward-looking collection that pays homage to Wright’s work and helps advance his design legacy long into the future.</p>\n<p>“We have been honored to work with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation as we developed and designed this collection,” said Judd Lord, Senior Director of Industrial Design. “Their dedication to create and inspire in the name of making life more beautiful mirrors our own steadfast commitment to inspire, challenge and elevate the world around us through distinctive design and unparalleled craftsmanship. Staying true to Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision of reinvention was core to our product development, and the Foundation’s incredible knowledge and deep reverence for that vision has been invaluable.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460691\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460691\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460691\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-460691\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Rectangular-Raincan-Showerhead-810x900.jpg\" alt=\"rectangular showerhead with light and water turned on\" width=\"810\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Rectangular-Raincan-Showerhead-810x900.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Rectangular-Raincan-Showerhead-800x889.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Rectangular-Raincan-Showerhead-768x853.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Rectangular-Raincan-Showerhead.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rectangular Raincan Showerhead</p></div>\n<p>Inspired by Wright’s encompassing oeuvre, and pulling from the natural world he gravitated toward, the collection exhibits his revolutionary style of American architecture through carefully chosen materials and meticulous attention to detail.

It directly channels Wright’s artistry as someone who challenged conventions.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>– Lucia McBroom, Brizo Senior Brand Manager</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460694\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460694\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460694\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-460694\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Widespread-Lavatory-Faucet-810x475.jpg\" alt=\"double vanity bathroom sink with wood and metal sink faucets\" width=\"810\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Widespread-Lavatory-Faucet-810x475.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Widespread-Lavatory-Faucet-800x469.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Widespread-Lavatory-Faucet-768x450.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/Brizo-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Bathroom-Collection-Widespread-Lavatory-Faucet.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Widespread Lavatory Faucet</p></div>\n<p>“People sometimes make the mistake of thinking Frank Lloyd Wright’s legacy is complete,” said Stuart Graff, President and CEO of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. “But really, it’s ongoing.

As it turns out, Berry drew upon honesty, her childhood, and her experience as a mother raising her daughter in NYC to inform her of this collaboration, as Kate Berry explains in a recent chat with Design Milk:</p>\n<p><strong>The Domino aesthetic is very specific and very special, but how would you describe it when you brought it over to a furniture line?</strong></p>\n<p>Crate&#38;Barrel had never worked with a publisher and said, we really love Domino’s sense of color *and* your design is accessible.</p>\n<p>A lot of the stories we do are not necessarily the highest design. We range, we have some places that we shoot that are very aspiration and I love those, but we also shoot small studio apartments. Maybe some people have really amazing art and furniture, and some people have IKEA hacks that are very clever and smart, so I think they really wanted to work with us for that accessibility and relatability.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we emphasized on small space. Kids furniture, they make little because they’re kids, but when I think about small space, it’s not about smaller furniture. Actually, a lot of the furniture is big, but it maximizes the space, so going up higher. I really pushed for a bookshelf to be super tall, like why does it have to be this [shorter] height? If we’re talking about small space, we want to maximize.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-460614 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17-810x1215.jpg\" alt=\"colorful modern bookshelf for kids\" width=\"810\" height=\"1215\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17-810x1215.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-17.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460596\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-3-810x630.jpg\" alt=\"kids furniture\" width=\"810\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-3-810x630.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-3-800x622.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-3-768x597.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Or else it’s just lost space.</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly.

Kids furniture is usually very colorful. I think Domino brings a very optimistic color palette to the collection, which I love. Personally as a mom, I’m always grappling with, do I invest in furniture that can grow with them until they’re teenagers or do I want to preserve them in their childhood moment? Does it need to grow with them or do you think kids furniture should have its own special moment on the timeline of furniture that they’re going to have?</strong></p>\n<p>That’s a good question. This is how we tackled that. The furniture should grow with you, most certainly, but what a three- to four-year-old wants versus what a teenager wants is going to be totally different. So the way we imagined it is modularity. There’s a bookshelf, it’s a neutral bookshelf, you can take that to college, you can have that in your living room when they’re grown. But there are these colorful boxes that you can fit and slide in. My daughter Quinn has so many LEGO and plastic toys so you can either throw them in, slide them, and they’re these color blocks, or you can flip them on the other side and they’re shelves so you can put paperwork.</p>\n<p>The furniture, definitely. To me, I didn’t want it to be a wasteful thing that you would throw out. This has got to work for a teenager.</p>\n<p>The bedding is where we definitely had this push and pull because I wanted just stripes and things that <em>I</em> would want to live with. But Sebastian (Brauer, VP of Product Design at Crate&#38;Barrel) said, “Here me out. Kids really need something to identify with.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460612\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-15-810x621.jpg\" alt=\"kids furniture\" width=\"810\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-15-810x621.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-15-800x613.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-15-768x589.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-15.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460599\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-6-810x630.jpg\" alt=\"kids furninture\" width=\"810\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-6-810x630.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-6-800x622.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-6-768x597.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-6.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460611\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14-810x1215.jpg\" alt=\"kids rug\" width=\"810\" height=\"1215\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14-810x1215.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-14.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460597\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-4-810x630.jpg\" alt=\"kids furniture\" width=\"810\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-4-810x630.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-4-800x622.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-4-768x597.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Kate Berry tapped on her artist friends to create some of the familiar figurative and graphic elements that kids would be able to recognize. San Francisco-based graphic artist and surfer Jeff Canham injected fun and playfulness with a glow-in-the-dark, reversible quilt and a Suns, Swims, Seas print that reads the same way upside down. Further down in Los Angeles, Mary Matson adds a whimsical and electric style with surfer cushions and a wavy, beach-reminiscent quilt.</em></p>\n<p>I showed these things to my daughter and some of my friends’ kids’, boys and girls, different in ages. The kids really gravitated towards certain figurative things! So I said, “OK. You guys are the experts.” So there are those moments that are just for the young kids.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460618\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-21-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"kids bedding\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-21-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-21-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-21-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-21.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460619\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-22-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"kids bedding\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-22-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-22-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-22-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-22.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460617\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-20-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"kids bedding\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-20-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-20-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-20-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-20.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>At least the main furniture, the things that the parents are investing in, will definitely grow with them, and the items that are a little lower of a price point are the things they can switch out as they grow older.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, like bedding.

With the trundle bed and soft storage containers made to fit it perfectly, there can be a home for everything.</em></p>\n<p>Those were specifically designed because of the need I have as a mother. My daughter has all these trinkets that are so special to her. This will happen to you. It happens to every parent I know. You’re going to go in and try edit and get rid of their things. Don’t try to do it when they’re home. They will dig it out of the garbage and go “This is so special to me!”</p>\n<p>Having these different compartments and things that are accessible to them, my hope is that we’ll give them the tools to be autonomous and be able to organize for themselves where they want to organize. We have a nightstand that has a bulletin board. My daughter makes a lot of art, so to be able to pin that up next to her bed and have her art around her, it’s very important for the way our family lives. I’m going off on a tangent…</p>\n<p><strong>No, that’s actually my next question which was how did your role as a mom inform you of these design decisions? It seems like you made sure that kids, even though they’re kids, they have autonomy over their own space and they can curate and grow. All day long they’re told to do things and, in their own safe space that you’ve created for them, they can express themselves, even if they’re two or eight years old.</strong></p>\n<p>You can give them these things and you can give them the space, but you’re also kind of teaching them to organize at an early age. However they do it, if they do it or not, it’s their space to do whatever they choose to do with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460605\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-8-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"kids furniture\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-8-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-8.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tZXsp4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-460609\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-12-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"kids furniture\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-12-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-12-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/cratekids-domino-collaboration-kate-berry-12.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>While Kate Berry admits that her own childhood had limited options when it came to kids furniture (she creatively fashioned a vanity from a milk crate and some leftover fabric for her rainbow pinstripe wallpapered room), she is able to draw upon her past in recognizing the importance of designing pieces that, ultimately, needs to make kids feel safe and right at home.</em></p>\n<p>I didn’t have these kinds of choices!

Desert landscapes hold a very special place in my heart and Taos has been the source of a lot of personal growth. I bring the energy it gives me back to New York. It’s part of what powers my creative practice, and what I bring into my thinking about spaces in conceptual ways and the energy in them.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460278\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460278\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460278\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-460278\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/F5-Elena-Hampton-Berry-Campbell-Photo-Frampton-Co-810x608.jpg\" alt=\"art gallery with white walls and three abstract paintings\" width=\"810\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/F5-Elena-Hampton-Berry-Campbell-Photo-Frampton-Co-810x608.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/F5-Elena-Hampton-Berry-Campbell-Photo-Frampton-Co-800x600.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/F5-Elena-Hampton-Berry-Campbell-Photo-Frampton-Co-768x576.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/F5-Elena-Hampton-Berry-Campbell-Photo-Frampton-Co.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Elena Frampton</p></div>\n<p><strong>5. Berry Campbell<br />\n</strong>One of my go-to galleries in New York City is <a href=\"https://www.berrycampbell.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Berry Campbell</a> – great art works, friendly atmosphere and an inspiring robust program! The gallery champions female painters like Yvonne Thomas, Perle Fine and Judith Godwin, giving women artists long overdue consideration on the market. They also represent a diverse range of works with something for everyone: from minimalist Walter Darby Bannard, to the more expressive William Perehudoff, to the very geometric Ken Greenleaf. I can also spend forever perusing their online inventory – a convenience especially now.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Work by Frampton Co.:</strong></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460284\" class=\"wp-caption

Romanek&#8217;s client roster includes Beyonce and Jay-Z, Gwyneth Paltrow and Misty Copeland, among others, so she&#8217;s no stranger to creating environments that are comfortable and beautiful. She refers to it as &#8220;livable luxe&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly the bullseye that the <a href=\"https://www.mgbwhome.com/new/brigette-romanek-x-mgbw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Brigette Romanek x Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams</strong></a> collaboration hits dead-on.</p>\n<p>This 7-piece collection is Romanek&#8217;s first foray into furniture design, but Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams are pros. (They just expanded into a full lifestyle brand earlier this year!).

Her desire to make each piece feel functional and cozy was made possible by MGBW adjusting details to create comfortable pieces with a bit of modern whimsy.

Round pillows and angled wood legs add the perfect touch. The L.A. Collection features a chair, ottoman, two sizes of sofas and an upholstered bed with oversized, hand-tailored cushions as its hallmark. All upholstery is available for customization with hundreds of fabrics and 20+ MGBW wood finishes. Lastly, there&#8217;s the Dell Swivel Chair. A classic that&#8217;s been perfectly scaled, it&#8217;s made up of a lower back, angled arms and a wood swivel base before being topped off with a round cushion. It comes in your choice of hundreds of fabrics and leathers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=460086\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-460086\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img

The reusable bag company that’s doing its part to solve the world&#8217;s plastic problem, and support women across the globe. For founder Janean Mann, the solution to the cycle of plastic pollution was simple: create the ultimate reusable bag, and make it something people want to use again and again. Their compact design, stylish colors, and accessible price points already make <a title=\"Junes bags\" href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/junes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">Junes bags</a> winners in our book. The brand didn’t stop there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Mann visited Juarez, Mexico, she partnered with a local, all-women sewing co-op to produce its bags, weaving support for women into the brand’s fabric. The partnership helps women of Juarez achieve economic autonomy while supporting their families. The company continues proving its commitment to women at a global scale by donating a portion of every sale to the Global Fund for Women, a non-profit foundation empowering and protecting women around the world through human right’s initiatives.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_460708\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-460708 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/junes_brandspotlight_juarezco-op-1280x900-1-810x570.jpg\" alt=\"Junes all woman sewing co-op in juarez, mexico\" width=\"810\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/junes_brandspotlight_juarezco-op-1280x900-1-810x570.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/junes_brandspotlight_juarezco-op-1280x900-1-800x563.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/junes_brandspotlight_juarezco-op-1280x900-1-768x540.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/09/junes_brandspotlight_juarezco-op-1280x900-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Junes’ partnership with an all-female sewing co-op in Juarez, Mexico provides a sustainable income for women along our shared border.</p></div>\n<p>In an effort to close the loop on plastic pollution, Junes makes every decision with the planet&#8217;s future in mind.
