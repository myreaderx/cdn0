In this last but not least phase is where Voilà takes place, <strong>turning a technical document such as Notebook into an interactive presentation or a stand-alone web app ready to be shared with non-technical readers</strong>. You can learn more about Voilà in <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93\">this blog post</a>.</p><p>Voilà is an easy-to-use command-line tool that shines in its simplicity and flexibility. All its versatility comes from a custom template system built upon Jinja templates that allows everyone to create a custom UI to share Jupyter Notebooks. Examples of the versatility provided for the template system are <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/a-slideshow-template-for-voil%C3%A0-apps-435f67d10b4f\"><em>voila-reveal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/a-slideshow-template-for-voil%C3%A0-apps-435f67d10b4f\"><em>voila-gridstack</em></a>.</p><p><em>Voila-gridstack</em> is a Voilà template started by <a href=\"https://github.com/btel\">Bartosz Telenczuk</a> to <strong>turn notebooks into dashboards</strong> following the specification introduced by the legacy <em>jupyter-dashboards</em> project. The idea behind is to be able to change the layout of the cells to re-configure your dashboards using drag-and-drop. Once you have your desired layout, its configuration stays in the metadata of the notebook. This makes it simple to carry around or share the notebook and its layout configuration.</p><p>With the release of JupyterLab 3.0, we wanted to update the <em>voila-gridstack</em> template by adding an editor for JupyterLab.</p><h3>Configure your layout</h3><p>The first way to open the <em>voila-gridstack</em> editor is by right-clicking on the notebook and selecting open with “Voilà Gridstack”. The editor is itself a JupyterLab Document Widget, which can be seen as another view of the same notebook document. The editor can also be launched from the classic notebook with a toolbar button.</p><figure><img alt=\"Opening JupyterLab-Gridstack\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m3zuJtMenNyGL-0R2nz7Cg.gif\" /><figcaption>Opening JupyterLab-Gridstack</figcaption></figure><p>Once the editor is open, every cell is decorated with a toolbar as a drag-and-drop handle and a button to remove the cell from the dashboard. When removing a cell, it is just marked as hidden in the metadata but it is not deleted from the notebook file. Besides, handles are provided for resizing cells in the layout.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u0AnafiS2HtXhCiCMg25cA.gif\" /><figcaption>Configuring your layout</figcaption></figure><p>When opening the editor for the first time in a new notebook, the metadata of the notebook is modified to follow <em>jupyter-dashboards</em>’ specification. By default, you will see an empty editor. To add new cells just drag them from the notebook view. It is not possible to add cells from another notebook.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t4EW3oCIrt5FaMXUyjYPFw.gif\" /><figcaption>Adding new cells</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you can save the layout into the metadata of the notebook by clicking the “save” button or with the ctrl+s shortcut and then it’s time to hit the render button and Voilà! You will see your layout as a stand-alone web app.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y6-MX2tjbBavUr3GHFDnIw.gif\" /><figcaption>Voilà!
