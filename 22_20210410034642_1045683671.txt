It&#39;s the reason banks, traffic lights, and anesthesiologists exist. Even before crypto, creative minds have been drawn to finance, as trust creates opportunities for leverage and securitization. In 1997, seeking more control over his songwriting catalog, David Bowie raised $55 million with Bowie Bonds. The bonds paid 7.9% interest over a 10 year-long term - a scant premium to a US 10 Year Treasury Note at 6.45%. What made Bowie Bonds unique was the collateral, or source of trust: future royalties on Bowie&#39;s music, which the bondholder felt people would continue to value. Moody&#39;s rated the bonds A3 and Bowie used the proceeds to buy out his former manager, shoring up the bonds and securing long-term control of his music.</p><p>Though innovative in its collateralization, the Bowie Bond was on its face a vanilla financial instrument, no different in form than a bond issued by GM or P&#38;G. In order to connect his art and potential investors, Bowie had to rely on the (expensive) apparatus of traditional gatekeepers in finance and entertainment to imbue his bonds with the essential attributes of trust and scarcity. The royalty stream (trust) was mediated by lawyers and accountants in big publishing houses, and the legitimacy of each individual bond (scarcity) was dependent on the financial powers of Wall Street.</p><p>What if Sir David Bowie (note: he declined knighthood in 2003, but it&#39;s my blog) fell to earth in 2021? What might Bowie have done … with crypto?</p><h2>Scarcity</h2><p>People like scarcity - a lot. Owning something scarce makes one feel unique, and signals success and worthiness as a potential mate. Scarcity is also an instinctual trigger for obsession - when we sense a scarcity of something, be it food or a mate, we are programmed to become obsessed with finding it. Art auctions, the (pre-pandemic) lines outside Supreme, and the margins on a Panerai Tourbillon prove this point.</p><p>A Van Gogh and a Rothko are both unique, and therefore scarce, because they are made of atoms, and it is impossible to arrange a second set of atoms in an identical configuration. Print artists, whose lithographs are made to be reproduced without alteration, use a small &#34;17/100&#34; written in the corner, to distinguish each print and bestow scarcity upon it.</p><p>To hold value, scarcity must be credible. The dirty (not-so) secret of the art world is that art buyers, and even professional art appraisers, <a href=\"https://time.com/4236970/a-fake-rothko-and-the-rise-of-modern-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">struggle to discern</a> originals from forgeries. A well-made forgery provides the same practical value as an original - you can hang it on your wall and bask in its profundity. Yet the art world invests millions of dollars in identifying the &#34;real&#34; version of valuable works; once unmasked, forgeries are nearly worthless.</p><p>Digital art suffers from perfect reproducibility, and hence, a lack of scarcity. There is no &#34;real&#34; version - even in the artist&#39;s studio, copies proliferate in backups, on shared drives, and in cache files. For decades, we have experimented with watermarks and anti-piracy tech to try and enforce a physical, world-of-atoms scarcity on digital goods. By contrast, non-fungible tokens, (NFTs) reflect a digital-native approach to credible scarcity.</p><p><strong>Attaching an NFT to a digital artwork gives the NFT owner discretion to designate any digital copy of that artwork as the sole authentic copy at any point in time. </strong>This approach jettisons our world-of-atoms obsession with a specific physical object, and acknowledges that scarcity has always been a function of bits, not atoms. Value is in the eye of the beholder.</p><h2>Let&#39;s dance</h2><p>On March 11, digital artist Beeple collected $69.3 million (minus the hefty fee of his gatekeeper, Christie&#39;s) from the auction of an NFT associated with a collage of his 13 year-long project of daily digital artworks. The media has made much of the fact that the buyer of Beeple&#39;s NFT, crypto investor Vignesh Sundaresan, did not obtain any tangible &#34;thing&#34; for his money. The art itself is available for anyone to view - for free - on <a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beeple&#39;s web site</a>. But collecting art has rarely been about the thing. It&#39;s about credible scarcity.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60709e04a451820019b3a559?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"678\" width=\"1560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>NFTs create and capture the value of scarcity cred in a massively dispersed fashion that bypasses gatekeepers and taps into capital anywhere. At the high end, digital art sold for millions doesn&#39;t really need an NFT, just as Bowie didn&#39;t need crypto to securitize his royalties in 1997. Christie&#39;s could have just as easily sold an embossed paper certificate, and entered the buyer&#39;s name in a leather bound book securely held at Christie&#39;s headquarters. But that sort of infrastructure isn&#39;t available to the vast majority of digital artists, whereas anyone can create an NFT. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html?smid=url-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nyan Cat</a>, a pop culture meme, isn&#39;t likely to appear at Christie&#39;s any time soon, but as an NFT it sold for nearly $600,000.</p><h2>All the young dudes</h2><p>Scarcity cred explains more than NFTs. The entire $2 trillion crypto asset class rests on scarcity cred. Bitcoin&#39;s attractiveness as a store of value is a function of its scarcity cred, as it has a built-in limit of 21 million coins. Compare that to the USD: Almost 30% of the US money supply has been created since 2020.</p><p>There&#39;s a variety of crypto technologies/products/platforms evolving new means of creating and capturing value in a network: Ethereum, Ledger, Uniswap, Hedera, Cardano - a soup of innovation that is, similar to other tech innovations, not doing anything new … just doing it better.</p><p>It remains to be seen if this approach will take hold. Crypto&#39;s energy use is a source of real concern, but the hardware and software are evolving quickly to become far more energy efficient. Even Beeple thinks the current mania is a bubble, as he told my podcasting partner Kara Swisher. But the history of the art market is a history of bubbles, as are the histories of finance and the internet. All are still with us.</p><p>Crypto is firing on the walls of the world&#39;s financial citadels. Naturally, the generation of leaders behind those walls is not inclined to acknowledge the Wildlings outside. But scoffing at novel technology, be it a mangonel, black powder, or blockchain, rarely ends well for the legacy asset holders. Bigger castles are already being erected on the hill just above the naysayers … in this case, in mere years vs. generations. It&#39;s likely that on the day of its imminent public listing, Coinbase will be more valuable than Goldman Sachs. A reasonable question in the JPMorgan and Goldman board meetings:</p><p><em>How the fuck did we/you let Coinbase happen?</em></p><p>But that&#39;s another post. Unencumbered by regulation, reticence to destroy legacy assets, or boomer brains that just don&#39;t &#34;get it,&#34; crypto is a $2 trillion disruptive force. I can validate that anybody over 50 has trouble understanding this stuff, and am fairly certain that the number of candles on the CEO&#39;s office party birthday cake is inversely correlated to their understanding of crypto.</p><p>Of course, in a system that is still heavily skewed in favor of older, white men, &#34;getting it&#34; for that cohort can be worth billions. Crypto investors Michael Novogratz and Michael Saylor, both over 50, have a combined net worth approaching $10 billion. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2021/04/06/the-cryptocurrency-tycoons-on-forbes-2021-billionaires-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">But they are the exceptions</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60709e32a451820019b3a55e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Scott Galloway\" height=\"260\" width=\"520\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Galloway</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Bowie himself was 50 when he issued Bowie Bonds.

But you don't need many: Between a chef's knife and a paring knife, you can chop, slice, dice, cube, mince, brunoise, chiffonade, julienne, and more. Beyond those two, you'll probably want a bread knife, and depending on how much meat and poultry you cook, you may consider a boning or utility knife as well. Tracking down the perfect kitchen knives individually might be preferred depending on whom you ask, but it can also be a time-consuming and expensive task, which is why purchasing them as a set is often a practical choice. </p>\n<p>I've done stints in restaurants and raw bars, served as a galley cook aboard a private yacht, and filleted and shucked more seafood while working on fishing boats than I can recount. For this guide, I tested eleven knife sets, focusing on balance between the blades and handles, quality of construction, and edge retention.</p>\n<p>While sharpness was a given (any knife not sharp out of the package would've been immediately disqualified), we chose to test edge retention by slicing tomatoes before running knives on a glass cutting board 200 times in order to dull them (pro tip: for the sake of your knives, never use a glass cutting board). After dulling, we tried slicing tomatoes again to determine which edges held up best. We also consulted a professor of metallurgy to provide insight into the pros and cons of different alloys, and to break down our contenders' hardness ratings. </p>\n<p>Below are the knife sets that passed our tests exceptionally well.

These are, arguably, the only knives you will ever need, and Victorinox's versions are among the more resilient ones we've tested.</p>\n <p>The knives in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IEBTZ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipgf_121317_best-knife-sets-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004IEBTZ4&amp;linkId=b1f1ed3ad86ad577bb7d56a0ab528ba6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Fibrox Pro set</a> are made of the very same high-carbon steel as many affordable to mid-range knives (X50CrMoV15), but Victorinox cuts some corners with a stamped blade (rather than an individually constructed one), a molded plastic handle, and no real flair. However, those are precisely the correct corners to cut; if you're on a budget, you definitely want to purchase a set of knives whose blade construction was the primary focus. Fancy handles are great, but not when they're attached to insufficient blades.</p>\n <p>If you're looking to keep costs to a minimum, if your kitchen is fairly minimalist, if you share a cooking space, or if you're looking to furnish a second home or rental, this is the knife set to purchase (and then never worry about). Even with heavy use, you'll be able to bring them back up to snuff in short order, and butchers like Pat LaFrieda and commercial kitchens all over the world stock a smattering of Victorinox's chef's knives, which is a testament to the brand's quality.</p>\n <p>Could you stand to add a few knives to your quiver after buying this pared-down set? Maybe, but you can still prepare just about anything with these four basic tools, and if you're trying to stick to a budget, less is more. You could find a 17-piece set for about the same price if you wanted to, but we've tried a handful of them over the years, and considering how little goes into each knife in such a set, you'd find yourself replacing them sooner than you would like.</p> The best knife set upgrade \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60302515623bd30012bcc4f8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"F.N.

If your needs would be better suited by a six-piece set, which also includes a bread knife, a boning knife, and a utility knife, that's also available for $660.</p>\n <p>Apart from looking unbelievably cool thanks to the VG-10 steel patterned into the blade, these knives are the most balanced and solidly built of any we've tried. We also like that three \"sharpenings\" are included with the purchase of every set, which should get you through a year to a year-and-a-half of constant use.</p>\n <p>We put \"sharpenings\" in quotations because what the brand actually does — and this is pretty ingenious, we must say — is send you a replacement set of freshly sharpened knives in a box with a prepaid packaging slip into which you'll put your used, dulled knives for return. After the first three sharpenings, though, the cost is on you and it's admittedly steep: $60 for the three-knife set, $90 for the six-knife set, and $50 for a steak knife set.

The chef's and paring knives have a respectable 17-degree cutting angle, and we found that the blades fell right through vegetables similarly to the way the Wusthof Classic Ikon knives did, even before and after chopping on a glass cutting board 200 times.</p>\n <p>A lot of people will find Knifey's service irresistibly convenient, and considering the price (starting at about $140 per year with two annual sharpenings), it's not an unreasonable expenditure. Likewise, if you want to do your own sharpening, you can pay the one-time annual subscription fee, receive the knives, and keep them.</p>\n <p>Knifey's service works similarly, if not exactly like F.N. Sharp's above: receive your knives, run them through their paces until they're dull, and then let the brand know it's time. They'll rush a set of freshly sharpened knives over, then you place your dull knives in the empty box, slap on a prepaid shipping label, and carry on with your newly sharpened knives.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Too many people neglect their knives, which only makes chopping and slicing more arduous — not to mention more treacherous. If you tend to let your knives get dull, Knifey's service could save you trouble, and maybe even a trip to the emergency room.</p> Methodology \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60302682bed5c50011a2bab7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Our Methodology Knife Sets\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Insider</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>I've been using knives regularly — as most of us have — for the better part of my life, and on and off professionally. I relied on my own experience along with the unbiased and uninformed opinions of five others during testing.</p>\n <p>Ahead of testing, I got in touch with butcher and New York City meat purveyor Pat LaFrieda as well as Mike Tarkanian, a research affiliate and a senior lecturer at MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), to find out what their requisites are for great knives. Here's what we settled on taking into consideration:</p>\n <p><strong>Edge retention: </strong>Our knife-testing process involved slicing a few fresh tomatoes, taking note of the ease with which the chef knife from each set handled the task. After we had sufficient data, we took each chef's knife to a glass cutting board and ran it over the surface 200 times. Some knives held their edge, others not so much. We looked at the edges after running the knives and noted if there were any visible changes.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>We then returned to the tomatoes, cutting a few more and seeing how much resistance we felt compared with the performance of the knives straight out of the packaging. Knives that held their edges passed on to further rounds of consideration.</p>\n <p><strong>Alloy, and the HRC (hardness rating): </strong>We consulted several experts in the field, but the most informative source we encountered was <a href=\"mailto:tarky@mit.edu\">Michael J Tarkanian</a> , a professor of metallurgy at MIT. With his help, we were able to cut through the marketing and the scientific terminology behind different alloys and what allows a knife to retain an edge.</p>\n <p>We looked for a hardness rating of around 60 HRC, which offers great edge retention while still allowing for an edge of around 15 degrees (though up to 20 degrees, which is duller than 15, was still considered sufficient).</p>\n <p><strong>Ergonomics: </strong>For a knife to work well, you have to be able to hold it comfortably in your hand. We asked an array of people to pick up knives and decide which ones were the easiest to grip; across the board, they went for the ones with heavier, rounded, almost bulbous handles.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Balance between the handle and the blade is also key. Pricier knives almost always offer better balance because that extra cost goes into using denser and often more desirable materials, like layered Damascus steel.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>A well-balanced knife with a good blade will cut through vegetables with minimal pressure, like our top pick from Wusthof. A not-so-well-balanced knife will take a little force to get started.</p> What else we tested and recommend \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60302741bed5c50011a2baba?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What else we tested Knife Sets\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Owen Burke/Insider</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>We tested 11 knife sets in total; here are a few of the others that we also recommend:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RFN0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipgf_121317_[%E2%80%A6]eativeASIN=B00004RFN0&amp;linkId=3a776bb7d2e7e42187703d2360ef749c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>J.A. Henckels (Zwilling) Classic 7-Piece</strong></a><strong>: </strong>We enjoyed using these knives almost as much as we did the Wusthof Classic Ikon set, but the handles were a little awkward to hold, and the blades didn't retain their edges quite as well.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmadeincookware.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-knife-pair%3Fvariant%3D32764115877967\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Made-In</strong></a><strong>: </strong>These are good knives and made of the same material as most of the ones we tested (X50CrMoV15). But the handles are a little small and somewhat awkwardly shaped. Still, you won't get a bad set of knives from Made-In. We wish the brand still offered three- and five-piece sets, though, because we think the six-piece is overkill for most.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmaterialkitchen.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-trio-of-knives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Material Trio of Knives</strong></a><strong>: </strong>These are very well-balanced knives and we love how sharp they are out of the box. The magnetic block is a little unwieldy, and we found that these blades dulled more than others during testing, but that may be due to their exceptional 13-degree edges. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmaterialkitchen.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-good-shears\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">$35 Good Shears</a> are a worthy addition, too.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://misen.com/products/essentials-knife-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Misen Essential Knife Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Misen offers attractive three- and five-piece packages at a great price. The knives are nicely weighted, and the AUS-10 (and lower-grade AUS-8 on smaller knives) steel offers a sharper blade than the common X50CrMoV15 you'll find in mid-range knives. That being said, AUS-10 requires more care,&nbsp;since it's easier to stain and the edges are more brittle. If you don't mind a little maintenance, a Misen set is all you'll ever really need in the kitchen.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcookpotluck.com%2Fproducts%2Fknife-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Potluck Knife Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Also punched out of the same alloy as most knives we tested, these are about as affordable as a decent set of knives gets. The blades outweigh the handles, but they held up in testing and if you're on a really tight budget, Potluck is a good choice.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://shun.kaiusa.com/sora-2-pc-chef-s-set.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Shun 2-Pc Chef's Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Shun is a favorite of some of the world's top chefs, and this is one of their more economical sets. If you're interested in Japanese blades but don't want to break the bank, these are a great start. They're extremely sharp at 14 degrees, but the edges are somewhat brittle and should be handled delicately and dried properly.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://shun.kaiusa.com/classic-2-pc-starter-set.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Shun 2-Pc Classic Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A step up from Shun's Chef's Set, these are beautiful knives that cut more smoothly than any we tested. A 16-degree one-sided edge isn't quite as sharp as some others you might find of this style (and price), but it does lend the blades some longevity. The 34-layer Damascus steel looks great and adds a lot of weight, and the offset handle fits nicely (if you're right-handed). This is a great upgrade pick for anyone specifically interested in Japanese knives, and we wholly recommend it as such.&nbsp;</li>\n </ul> What we look forward to testing \n <p>Here are some knife sets we're currently considering for future updates:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/classic-g2338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Global Classic 3-Piece Knife Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This three-piece set, and the brand in general, is a favorite among chefs including the late Anthony Bourdain.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.macknife.com/products/professional-series-set-3-pcs-pro-31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>MAC Professional Series 3-Piece Set</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Mac is another chef favorite, and this one is lauded as a workhorse by Eric Ripert, co-owner and executive chef of the thrice-Michelin-starred New York City fixture Le Bernardin. It's a little on the pricey side, but we're curious to see how it stacks up to our investment pick.</li>\n </ul> Why you may want to put your knife set together piecemeal \n <p>Depending on your budget, you may want to consider other options besides a knife set. Any time you're buying a set of something, the brand and/or manufacturer often adds in fillers (i.e. less than useful pieces) and cuts corners, and the case is no different with knives.</p>\n <p>A lot of chefs we spoke with recommend keeping only one, two, or maybe three knives in a kitchen: a chef's knife for most tasks, a paring knife for smaller jobs like peeling fruit or scoring dough, and a bread knife. You might also consider forgoing a knife block for a magnetic bar, which takes up far less space when stuck to the side of your fridge or mounted on a wall. Over time, you may want to add something like a utility or boning knife, but the truth is most kitchens will rarely find much use for one. If you do need one, you know who you are, and you probably carve a lot of poultry and/or meat.</p> Check out our other knife-related guides \n <figure> \n  <img

And while drug use and preexisting medical conditions may have contributed to his death, it was the encounter with law enforcement that caused it.</p>\n<p>\"To the best of my knowledge, he was generally healthy on May 25, before the events of that evening,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner, testified Friday during the murder trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin.</p>\n<p>Chauvin, who is white, was fired after video captured him placing his knee on Floyd's neck, an unarmed Black man, for more than nine minutes, despite pleas from Floyd and bystanders to stop. \"I can't breathe,\" Floyd said. He was later pronounced dead due to a lack of oxygen.</p>\n<p>The former Minneapolis cop is on trial for second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter charges. His defense team has argued Chauvin was merely following department policy - a claim disputed by police - and that Floyd's drug use contributed to his death.</p>\n<p>During his autopsy, Baker said he did not discover any visible damage to Floyd's heart or brain. And while the examination did reveal that Floyd had COVID-19, it did not uncover any damage to his lungs that would suggest it contributed to his death.</p>\n<p>But Floyd did have heart disease and narrow coronary arteries, Baker testified.</p>\n<p>\"He already has a heart that needs more oxygen than a normal heart,\" he said. And a physical encounter with law enforcement is \"going to cause stress hormones to pour into your body,\" including adrenaline, which is \"going to ask your heart to beat faster, it's going to ask your body for more oxygen.\"</p>\n<p>Although use of drugs, such as Fentanyl, and preexisting medical conditions may have contributed to Floyd's death, Baker testified, it was not the cause.</p>\n<p>\"In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take, by virtue of those heart conditions,\" Baker said.</p>\n<p>Floyd's death spurred a summer of civil unrest, with Black Lives Matter protests across the US spurring new efforts to ensure accountability for police who abuse their power.</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

Companies have been betting on battery-powered planes for this cleaner future. But even though electric planes have been around since the 1970s, they haven&#39;t really taken off. So, what&#39;s keeping them grounded?</p><p>In the late 1800s, two French army officers experimented with electricity to propel an airship, but they ran into problems when the battery just couldn&#39;t hold enough energy. This would become a recurring problem for the next 100 years.</p><p>When nickel-cadmium batteries were invented, the first flight with an electric motor took off, but it only lasted less than 15 minutes.</p><p>Then, in the 1980s, lithium-ion batteries were invented. They could store more power than ever before, leading to planes like the Solar Impulse 2. Starting in 2015, the solar-powered aircraft spent 16 months flying around the world, except it flew at an average speed of 28 to 34 mph.</p><p>Solar Impulse 2 is part of a movement in recent years to develop alternative energies, especially when people and governments started realizing just how bad flying was for the environment. The aviation industry emitted about 1 billion tons CO2 in 2019. That&#39;s about 2.5% of global emissions. That might not sound like a lot, but it&#39;s almost as much as the entire continent of South America emits in a year.</p><p><strong>Kevin Noertker:</strong> We need to make changes to the industry, and electrification is one of the big trends which will hopefully reduce that burden.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Electric planes have been on people&#39;s mind for a while, but two big problems are keeping electric grounded. First, the technology&#39;s not quite ready.</p><p>When you&#39;re trying to get an electric plane off the ground, you want a battery that packs a lot of punch in a little package, but...</p><p><strong>Carolina Anderson:</strong> Batteries are not as efficient as gas, and they&#39;re probably not gonna be for a while.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> A battery&#39;s efficiency, or ability to hold power, is measured in specific energy. Right now, even the best batteries have a specific energy of only 250 watt-hours per kilogram, but we have to get closer to 800 to really start flying, and that is still nothing compared to jet fuel&#39;s specific energy, which is nearly 12,000 watt-hours per kilogram.</p><p>Think about it like those computers from the &#39;80s. They were huge, but way less powerful than the sleek ones we have today. Right now, batteries are like those &#39;80s computers. They&#39;re not as powerful as they need to be, and they&#39;re not just big, they&#39;re also heavy.</p><p>So if you want to add more power to a plane, you need to get a bigger battery, and to get that plane airborne despite the weight, you&#39;ll need even bigger battery that&#39;s more powerful, but that means more weight. And then you&#39;ll need an even bigger battery to offset that weight. Oh, you get the point.</p><p>But even if engineers design a plane around the shortfalls in battery tech, they have to take on the industry&#39;s second hurdle, certification. In the US, that means getting permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to test and fly an electric plane. Companies have to prove every inch of their aircraft is safe, passing a series of tests, one of which is to make sure the battery cells won&#39;t catch fire.</p><p><strong>Roei Ganzarski:</strong> If something goes wrong, you can&#39;t stop. You can&#39;t pull to the side of the road. There&#39;s only one place for that airplane to go. And so the regulatory stringency is much higher, the requirements for reliability, redundancy, and safety are much higher for a good reason. You have no alternate.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The FAA amended its rules in 2016 to allow electric propulsion systems in airplanes built for up to 19 passengers. The real problem, though, is that certification, even with these amendments, takes years, so companies have gotten creative. They&#39;ve started to retrofit old planes to get certified quicker.</p><p><strong>Ganzarski:</strong> You&#39;re taking out the entire old, gas-guzzling, emission-creating engine and its fuel system, and replacing that space and weight with an electric propulsion system.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Retrofitting has happened in phases. The first phase was from Slovenian company Pipistrel. It created the world&#39;s first all-electric two-seater plane back in 2007 by putting an electric engine in a glider.</p><p><strong>Tine Tomažič:</strong> Gliders are safe to fly by definition, even without a functioning engine, so we were able to experiment without putting anybody at risk or do harm to anyone.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Today, those planes are used for pilot training.</p><p>The second phase: a hybrid. Los Angeles company Ampaire replaced one of the two engines in a 1973 Cessna with an electric one. Ampaire hopes to get its new plane, the Electric Eel, certified for commercial flights by 2021.</p><p>And, finally, over in Vancouver, electric-motor manufacturer MagniX and Vancouver-based airline Harbour Air flew a retrofitted 62-year-old plane. A 15-minute test flight in December 2019 made it the world&#39;s first all-electric commercial plane to fly. It proved that electric could actually take off. The two companies&#39; goal is now to electrify the rest of Harbour Air&#39;s fleet of more than 40 seaplanes and have it certified by the end of 2021.</p><p>So, retrofitting seems perfect. The problem, though, is that it limits you to what the plane structure is already built for, so if the original motor is, say, 1,000 pounds, and you remove it, then...</p><p><strong>Ganzarski:</strong> I only have 1,000 pounds to put back in, right? I can&#39;t make the total package heavier.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Electric motors are smaller and lighter than gas ones, but remember, those batteries are heavy.</p><p><strong>Ganzarski:</strong> So you lose range because batteries, for the same amount of power, are so much heavier than fuel.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> So while Harbour Air and MagniX figured out the balance of weight in their plane, the range took a hit. Their electric plane can go over 100 miles, a little less than the distance from Seattle to Vancouver, but for electric planes to be successful long-term, they&#39;ll have to go farther.</p><p>Israeli company Eviation might have a solution. Instead of retrofitting an old plane, its engineers built a plane from scratch. The nine-seater plane, Alice, was designed around the battery to reduce weight.</p><p>Omer Bar-Yohay: That battery&#39;s literally all over the place. It&#39;s under the floor, it&#39;s in the wings, it&#39;s the fuselage in different locations.</p><p>Narrator: Alice, in theory, could fly up to 650 miles, roughly a flight from Las Vegas to Denver, but because it was built from the ground up, getting her certified is taking longer.</p><p>Bar-Yohay: We&#39;re very confident that we will be testing the plane in flight early 2020 and believe that from that point on the certification process will take about two years.</p><p>Narrator: Each electric plane in development is different, but they all have one thing in common: they&#39;re going after flights under 500 miles. And while it may not seem like an impressive distance, these short-range electric planes could solve a major problem in travel.</p><p>In 2018, a little less than half of all air tickets sold globally were for flights under 500 miles, but instead of using small, efficient planes designed for these shorter routes, we often use expensive airliners built to fly thousands of miles. These planes are most efficient if they&#39;re able to cruise for a long period of time, but on a flight that&#39;s 50 minutes, these planes go up, and they come right back down. Currently, a 109-mile flight from Los Angeles to San Diego emits about 110 pounds of CO2.</p><p>Bar-Yohay: For a technical-savvy person, that&#39;s an insanity, because we&#39;re using the wrong tools for the job.</p><p>Narrator: In the last four decades, flying regional with commercial jets got so expensive for airlines in the US, Europe, and Australia that they began stopping service to regional airports. Today, of the 20,000 FAA-approved runways in the US, only 2.5% are currently active.</p><p>The regional airports left are running at a loss or even going bankrupt, but electric planes could be a fix, and there&#39;s already an infrastructure for them. Omer says 11,000 of those 20,000 US runways could support an electric plane, which is a lot cheaper to operate. Alice could save about $800 per flight hour compared to a normal turboprop plane.</p><p>Noertker: It&#39;s a tenfold increase in the number of potential destinations, all the while not having the significant burdens on the communities of noise and pollution.</p><p>Narrator: As for the distant future, electric aviation could come in all kinds of forms. Uber is already working on an electrical vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, or eVTOL, that could pick you up right at your house and fly you to an airport. Even big players like Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls-Royce are betting on this future.</p><p>Tomažič: We set out on a journey that&#39;s akin to crawling, walking, running, leaping. We&#39;re now in the phase of walking. The running part will be the bigger electric airplanes flying longer distances, and the big leaps, coming in a decade or so, will be the eVTOL segment, which is vertical takeoff and landing electric-powered machines that effectively take off and land where we want them, bringing the airports to people.</p><p>Narrator: Everyone we talked to said that&#39;s still about 15 years off, and now that an electric plane has actually proven successful, those in the industry are hopeful that investment into battery development will start rolling in. Because to break out of that infinite power and weight loop we were talking about, we&#39;re gonna need more efficient batteries for electric planes to really take off.</p><p>Bar-Yohay: The question is, when does it make economic sense and who has the many billions it will take to bring a product like this to market in 15 years&#39; time? So, is it the future? Absolutely.</p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in March 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-planes-future-of-aviation-problems-regulations-2020-3'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aSNE2tV0N-4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 20:14:08 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5e73e59dc485400c5d1ce534?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"50cb80e085c5a7bd461b3a8965176e48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-53-569_b2a66008dd1452a0.webp","destWidth":1243,"destHeight":932,"sourceBytes":37598,"destBytes":37598,"author":"insider@insider.com (Abby Narishkin,Emmanuel Ocbazghi,Steve Cameron)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-33-760_004ac252569e30e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-07-772_e5f813460f06bab0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=aSNE2tV0N-4:jTA4-Pj1JLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-00-042_9c655e3bfcdc4b4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/aSNE2tV0N-4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-55-429_d69820c187ceb09d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331640},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"DOJ veterans say the latest twist in the Matt Gaetz sex-trafficking investigation could be the most 'scary' one yet for the lawmaker","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/prosecutors-doj-veterans-react-joel-greenberg-plea-deal-matt-gaetz-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606c578ea7d803001963eea9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Matt Gaetz\" height=\"2736\" width=\"5472\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rep.

Both men <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-strange-friendship-that-may-bring-down-matt-gaetz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grew up in wealthy Florida circles</a> and shared similar interests, and Greenberg <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexislevinson/matt-gaetz-ultimate-trump-defender-is-happy-being-notorious#.svYpMnN6x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told BuzzFeed News</a> in 2018 that he considered Gaetz a mentor.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear what the terms of his plea deal will be. An agreement hasn&#39;t been formalized, and the stipulations can vary from a defendant pleading guilty but refusing to divulge information about other targets to pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate, which would get them additional leniency when sentencing approaches.</p><p>Either way, law-enforcement veterans said, it puts Gaetz in a highly unenviable position.</p><p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t bode well that his friend and alleged partner in crime just took a plea deal,&#34; said Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department.</p><p>&#34;What Gaetz would be concerned about is if there&#39;s a cooperation agreement in this matter that involves the defendant flipping on him,&#34; said <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en/our-team/sherine-ebadi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sherine Ebadi</a>, a former FBI agent who served as the lead agent in the government&#39;s case against ex-Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. &#34;That gets scary for coconspirators because they know someone who&#39;s either aware of their crimes or someone they coconspired with is now working with the government.&#34;</p><p>Others echoed that assessment.</p><p>&#34;Simply put: As a prosecutor, you&#39;re not flipping Greenberg unless he gives you Gaetz,&#34; Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliehonig/status/1380319065223409665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>The Florida lawmaker has not been charged with any crimes, and he&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-tucker-carlson-matt-gaetz-interview-doj-sex-trafficking-video-2021-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fervently denied</a> the allegations against him, alleging the department&#39;s investigation is part of an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gaetz-tweets-response-doj-investigation-sex-trafficking-criminal-extortion-2021-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">elaborate extortion scheme</a> targeting his family. A spokesperson for Gaetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>Greenberg&#39;s attorney makes an unusual statement</h2><p>Greenberg&#39;s lawyer Fritz Scheller appeared to hint at a plea deal involving cooperation on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-associate-joel-greenberg-lawyer-speaks-out-about-congressman-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">telling reporters after a court hearing</a>: &#34;I am sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today.&#34;</p><p>That said, it&#39;s unusual for prosecutors or defense attorneys to publicize the existence of a plea deal because they&#39;d want to avoid tipping off other targets.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s certainly an interesting statement,&#34; Ebadi said of Scheller&#39;s comments. &#34;It makes you wonder what the motive was behind saying that.&#34;</p><p>She added that she&#39;d handled cases in which cooperators &#34;tried to work both sides&#34; because &#34;they know they have leverage against someone, and they want to try and broker some sort of deal to not cooperate.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if [Scheller&#39;s] foreshadowing, I don&#39;t know what the motive would be because generally cooperators don&#39;t want people to know they&#39;re cooperating,&#34; Ebadi said. &#34;But maybe that buck has passed because this case has been so publicly talked about.&#34;</p><p>When working with cooperating witnesses, prosecutors also take into account the person&#39;s credibility because &#34;now you&#39;re dealing with someone who already admitted to a crime and is motivated to tell you what you want to hear because it benefits them by potentially reducing their sentence,&#34; Ebadi said.</p><p>To vet the information they get, investigators dig for documents, financial records, and electronic filings to corroborate a cooperating witness&#39; testimony.</p><p>Former Justice Department officials said that this case, in particular, may not be a tough one to crack.</p><h2>Investigators have a huge pile of breadcrumbs to follow</h2><p>Gaetz is suspected of having had a sexual relationship with a woman when she was 17 years old in 2019. Investigators are also examining whether he paid for her to travel across state lines and broke sex-trafficking laws by doing so. The inquiry is looking into whether the Florida lawmaker used campaign money to fund travel for women, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-investigation-looking-into-cash-paid-directly-women-nyt-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Times reported</a> investigators were scrutinizing Gaetz and Greenberg&#39;s interactions with &#34;multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments.&#34;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-gaetz-bahamas-trip-federal-probe-sex-trafficking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBS News reported</a> that prosecutors were also zeroing in on a trip Gaetz took to the Bahamas in late 2018 or early 2019 with a hand surgeon and marijuana entrepreneur who is accused of footing the bill for female sex workers, hotel rooms, and travel expenses. On Thursday, The Daily Beast reported that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-reportedly-sent-900-to-ally-accused-sex-trafficker-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaetz sent Greenberg $900 via Venmo</a> in 2018 and that Greenberg then sent $900, in varying amounts, to three young women.</p><p>&#34;The problem for the congressman is that anything involving travel with others always leaves behind a trail of documents and records,&#34; Cramer said. &#34;If he did travel with an underage girl while in a sexual relationship with her, records exist proving that.&#34;</p><p>The woman Gaetz is suspected of having a sexual relationship with would be 19 years old now and may also be willing to talk to investigators, he added.</p><h2>What Greenberg could tell prosecutors</h2><p>Then there&#39;s other information prosecutors would need to build a strong case, details they may not be able to glean from records and documents. That&#39;s where Greenberg comes in.</p><p>For one, he could have been privy to conversations in which only he and Gaetz were present or private communications that took place on encrypted apps, in text messages that could have been deleted, or on a burner phone.</p><p>&#34;There could be a number of things they did that the government may not have access to or doesn&#39;t even know exist,&#34; Ebadi said.</p><p>But the biggest thing he could speak to, she added, is whether Gaetz expressed his intent in the conduct he&#39;s accused of engaging in.</p><p>&#34;Depending on what prosecutors charge, often an element in various cases is intent, or proving someone&#39;s knowledge or willfulness when committing a crime,&#34; Ebadi said, adding that with Greenberg, &#34;you could have someone that was present when [Gaetz] was making statements like, &#39;I&#39;m going to do this,&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m doing this for these particular reasons.&#39; Those are crucial words in a case like this, especially when it comes to that element of intent.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/prosecutors-doj-veterans-react-joel-greenberg-plea-deal-matt-gaetz-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X0Nx2KBfSa0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 20:19:13 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/607048114d3e410018b702ed?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"0698c1b0d9c40125081de3f353f72f6f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn5@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-53-632_c56aee6d8a2af127.webp","destWidth":4859,"destHeight":3644,"sourceBytes":292026,"destBytes":292026,"author":"ssheth@businessinsider.com (Sonam Sheth)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606c578ea7d803001963eea9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-58-908_240960a1d07940f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-08-418_8e25a204b15a32d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-45-55-312_70634898f853eece.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X0Nx2KBfSa0:PNFkpfXSgzU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-05-220_14e00f95874674e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X0Nx2KBfSa0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn99@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-57-387_53c5bf21a6be3410.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331621},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"A guide to Bixby Home, the hub where you can access Samsung’s digital voice assistant","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-bixby-home","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606e33d670954f0019195cae?format=jpeg\" alt=\"bixby\" height=\"2127\" width=\"4254\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Bixby Home is the landing page for the voice assistant, and it can be accessed in a few different ways.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Bixby Home is a landing page for Bixby commands and tutorials found on any Samsung device that includes the Bixby voice assistant. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">You can start Bixby Home by pressing the Bixby button (or the side or Power button, depending on your device).  </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">At one time, Bixby Home was highly customizable, but Samsung has greatly simplified the page.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-uri=\"4c86c1c3a45644bf07d168dc4c802e5e\">Visit Insider&#39;s Tech Reference library for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Bixby is the voice assistant for Samsung devices, similar to Siri on Apple devices and Alexa on Amazon products.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"606dfbb4badeb411dd761fac\" data-title=\"What is Bixby?

class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><strong>Hammocks are a relaxing way to rest in your backyard, at a campsite, or in the backcountry.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Factors in buying a hammock include tree access, outdoorsy features, and insect protection. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Our top pick, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YZ9Vfh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Wildhorn Outfitters Outpost</a>, lets you lay flat and only costs $40. </strong></li>\n</ul><p>Hammocks have been used for literally hundreds of years, dating back to early indigenous Americans. They&#39;re incredibly practical, lifting you off the ground to stay cool in the heat of summer and protected from insects or, in the backcountry, wildlife.</p><p>In the modern era, hammocks are often seen swinging in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-places-buy-outdoor-patio-furniture-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backyards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/camping-essentials-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">campsites</a>, frat houses, and teenagers&#39; bedrooms. They&#39;re prized for their comfort and for how easily they fold up for transport and storage when the R&#38;R session is over.</p><p>Each hammock on our list shares a couple of key characteristics in that they hang from two fixed points (not always a tree) and support a person or two. However, that&#39;s where the comparisons stop. Some hammocks are designed for comfort, others for light travel and to withstand the elements outside. Before you buy a hammok, it&#39;s important to think through where you&#39;ll use it, how you&#39;ll set it up, and who might be sharing or borrowing it, which we go into in more detail at the end of this guide.</p><p>In the meantime, we&#39;ve personally tested the majority of the hammocks on this list and can confirm - your life can only get better after a nap in any hammock on this list.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><h3>Here are our picks of the best hammocks:</h3><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Best hammock overall: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outpost-Double-Single-Camping-Hammock/dp/B011W0VEOC/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e2a9c00a032d12f5287eafccc313413b&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Wildhorn Outfitters Outpost Camping Hammock</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best budget hammock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Newdora-Ultralight-Multifunctional-Lightweight-Backpacking/dp/B01J7BPZLQ/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=0006f46569e44714141a449eb1a136aa&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Newdora Parachute Cloth Ultralight Hammock</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best backyard hammock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Choice-Products-Portable-Carrying/dp/B00LOZNXRC/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=0b39be8216a42f2486c468f22c806056&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Best Choice Products Cotton Double Hammock</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best backpacking hammock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T8ABNXQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00T8ABNXQ&linkId=2e6c678f560bb2b8de05ceaff39dfb9d560bb2b8de05ceaff39dfb9d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hummingbird Ultralight Single Hammock</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best camping hammock: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=184534&ctc=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F149550%2Fkammok-roo-double-hammocko-double-hammock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Kammok Roo Double</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best classic rope hammock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pawleys-Island-Hammocks-Original-Hammock/dp/B000068DY9/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=07af2ce985d64c337ca4327b6957c64f&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow\">Pawleys Island Rope Hammock</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best hammock for insect protection: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/G4Free-Portable-Mosquito-Capacity-Foldable/dp/B01F58BAGO/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=872282861fb5c1e03025830e32549ec0&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">G4Free Foldable Hammock with Mosquito Net</a></strong></li></ul><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Updated on 4/9/2021 by Rachael Schultz:</strong> Updated the &#34;what to look for when buying a hammock&#34; section; added &#34;best camping hammock&#34; pick</p></aside>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe best hammock overall\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59d4f6c5c68d7b6d1e8b7192?format=jpeg\" alt=\"wildhorn outfitters\" height=\"999\" width=\"1332\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Wildhorn Outfitters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outpost-Double-Single-Camping-Hammock/dp/B011W0VEOC/?&#38;_encoding=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;linkId=e2a9c00a032d12f5287eafccc313413b&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildhorn Outfitters Outpost Camping Hammock</a> measures 11-feet long, so you can achieve an almost flat sleeping position when spread out on a diagonal.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Long hammock for ideal sleeping comfort, easy to set up and adjust strap system, high-quality materials</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Slightly bulky when packed, not made with ripstop fabric</p><p>Most hammocks feel great when you first climb in, your body feeling almost weightless as you ease yourself into a gentle curve and rock back and forth in the breeze.

While most insect bites are merely annoying, causing an itch or a bit of pain, mosquito-borne illnesses like the Zika virus, dengue fever, malaria, and more can be <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/signs-a-bug-bite-is-serious-2018-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serious, even deadly, issues</a>.</p><p>Whether you're traveling to an area known for endemic insect-borne diseases or you're just tired of having flies buzzing around you while you try to relax, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/G4Free-Portable-Mosquito-Capacity-Foldable/dp/B01F58BAGO/?&#38;_encoding=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_100417_best-hammocks-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;linkId=872282861fb5c1e03025830e32549ec0&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G4Free Portable Hammock with Mosquito Net</a> is a great solution.</p><p>The hammock itself is made from smooth, supportive parachute-style nylon and generously accommodates a single adult user. Two hoop-shaped wireframes hold the insect netting up and out of the way, creating a large interior area in which you can sit up and move about without constantly touching the mesh. The netting can also be detached and moved out of the way when not needed.</p><p>The materials used to construct the hammock, mesh, and the supporting roping are all mildew and rot-resistant, making this insect shelter hammock a great choice for use in jungles, on beaches, and in various tropical locations. Your back might protest after multiple nights of sleeping in it, though, as it does dip noticeably when in use.</p>\n\tWhat to look for when buying a hammock\n\t\n\t<p>Hammocks are amazing for any leisurely outdoor experience, whether in the backyard or backcountry. But what you want in one is entirely different for those two situations.</p><p>We tested models from some of the most well-respected hammock makers in the industry for all types of lounging experiences. But there are a few key things to consider before deciding which to buy:</p><p>First, <strong>who</strong> will be using the hammock? Every hammock has a weight capacity and size capacity, so consider the size of the single person, or if you'll want to lay in it with your sweetie, regularly.&#160;</p><p><strong>When</strong> will you use your new hammock? This issue is a bit more nuanced than you might think. Sure, saying \"I'll probably use it on Saturday afternoons\" might be the right answer, but you should also consider the season (temperature and insects can be factors in choosing) and if you will be using the hammock overnight.</p><p><strong>Where</strong> you install the hammock &#8212; will you use it camping in the wilderness or only on the patio beside the pool? Is it going to be hung in the basement playroom or in a bedroom? Will you want to set up and take down the hammock frequently and in various locations, or leave it as a semi-permanent installation? Not only do these allow you to select the right hammock but make sure you're getting the most out of which one you ultimately decide on.&#160;</p><p>Finally, <strong>how</strong> will you use your hammock? Is this purely a leisure investment or if you want to get into hammock camping. The latter you can also use in your backyard, but you can't take, say, a rope hammock to a National Park and expect to get a good night's sleep in it.&#160;Many are designed for specific use cases and using them improperly can significantly impact the experience.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hammock'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wgRl3EA9m0E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:11:43 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5eb95d33144192780641960a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ee91f607d835f7a596c19717c57e4648","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn62@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-53-673_d3b1c0474f90cebd.webp","destWidth":856,"destHeight":642,"sourceBytes":41478,"destBytes":41478,"author":"stevenjohn23@gmail.com (Steven John)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/59d4f6c5c68d7b6d1e8b7192?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-02-491_89aa66b1c0b8b258.webp","https://i.insider.com/59d269dcc68d7b282e8b6097?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-45-57-570_2061f7e63c79e0eb.webp","https://i.insider.com/59d26abd351ccf89468b62c9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-59-588_1dd5919f3350c486.webp","https://i.insider.com/5d435293100a240bb521cd65?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn88@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-54-292_a1b76f3c678c6bfb.webp","https://i.insider.com/6070dc434943790018bb1c5b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-38-356_e750a7cb390bc8cc.webp","https://i.insider.com/59d26956c68d7b1d008b6685?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn88@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-06-650_ad3b1b410cc34b52.webp","https://i.insider.com/59d26b4cc68d7b1c008b66e0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn32@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-38-643_c83bc47671423186.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn7@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-46-03-112_5202cbda8c0248d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-56-624_d9c80d96ce99c032.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wgRl3EA9m0E:bk2dMwI43S4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn51@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-04-188_77c1207cb6c324e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wgRl3EA9m0E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-07-807_2f393fb680f438f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331649},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"Rep.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-obstacles-23andme-faces-in-going-public-s4-analysis-2021-3\">in the past few years.</a></p><p>But founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki indicated no plan to stray from the company&#39;s original mission in a recent conversation at <a href=\"https://hbr.org/sponsored/2021/04/leaders-who-make-a-difference-a-special-live-issue-of-hbr\">HBR Live</a>, a day-long leadership conference held by the Harvard Business Review.</p><p>From the company&#39;s inception in 2007, the &#34;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/style/anne-wojcicki-23andme-genetics.html\">doyenne of DNA</a>&#34; said on Thursday that she drew on her experience in healthcare investing to craft 23andMe&#39;s number one guiding philosophy: the development of a platform &#34;that&#39;s genuinely in the best interest of customers and is entirely outside of the system.&#34; In wanting to put the consumer at the at the forefront of healthcare in a $4 trillion industry, Wojcicki said the company always knew controversy was, in some ways, part of the plan. </p><p>Now, with much of that regulatory and data privacy-related controversy behind them, 23andMe is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/23andme-cofounder-anne-wojcicki-interview-explains-decision-spac-ipo-2021-2\">planning to go public</a> at a $3.6 billion valuation via a reverse merger with Virgin CEO Richard Branson&#39;s blank check holding company. </p><h2><strong>Keeping consumers front and center</strong></h2><p>Positioning 23andMe&#39;s mission-driven approach directly opposite the &#34;move fast, break things&#34; ethos of Silicon Valley, she said the long-term vision of the soon-to-be publicly traded company hasn&#39;t changed. Wojcicki pointed to its &#34;healthcare flywheel&#34; concept across both of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-obstacles-23andme-faces-in-going-public-s4-analysis-2021-3\">23andMe&#39;s recent SEC filings</a>, as evidence of putting consumers front-and-center of their business model. </p><p>Its most financial and investor risk report, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-obstacles-23andme-faces-in-going-public-s4-analysis-2021-3\">reviewed by Insider</a>, reaffirms Wojcicki&#39;s statements, showcasing that the company intends to invest in its core offering of direct-to-consumer genetics health and family ancestry reports, which make up the bulk of its business.</p><p>However, the S-4 filing showed that the company&#39;s efforts to use its genetic database in drug development, including its high-profile pharma partnership with GSK, stand on shakier ground. More alarmingly, 23andMe&#39;s overall revenue has fallen in recent years in line with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dna-test-company-pivot-strategies-23andme-color-invitae-helix-ancestry-2021-3\">overall downturn in the consumer genetics market</a>.</p><p>Despite changes in regulation over the years and mounting concerns over personal data privacy, she told HBR Live that giving consumers the ability to learn about their genetics and opt into research remains the company&#39;s vision for the future. 23andMe differentiates itself from competitors like Ancestry, she said, by focusing on engagement and the ability to be responsive to its users.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m engaging you with your whole genome holistically, whether that&#39;s the ancestry side, the health side, or your family relationships, and I want to keep you coming back,&#34; Wojcicki said. Most companies or academic genetic databases are missing that high level of user engagement, she added.</p><p>As detailed in 23andMe&#39;s SPAC filing, the company faces significant obstacles in becoming profitable or turning any findings from its 10 million user-strong genetic database into drug or therapeutics.</p><p>Later in the HBR Live conversation, Wojcicki remained unconvinced that there are easy fixes within the existing US healthcare system. </p><p>&#34;You can play to follow the code to lead to a slightly better outcome, but like hands down, I just don&#39;t want to be in the system,&#34; Wojcicki said. &#34;Tell me who makes money if I&#39;m healthy at a hundred, and I will go in that path.&#34;</p><p>The closest thing at this point is Kaiser Permanente, she said in closing, referring to the 75-year-old health system whose organization structure incentivizes <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kaiser-permanente-ceo-on-the-social-determinants-of-health-2018-8\">an all-encompassing approach</a> to its members&#39; health outcomes. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/23andmes-ceo-committed-to-consumer-first-healthcare-entirely-outside-the-system-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wJbv0ueIy-E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 20:47:05 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6070a7b94943790018bb1b65?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c5a202a70dfdaa067667c8b60da38cc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-35-476_a3119cc49c72e596.webp","destWidth":2220,"destHeight":1665,"sourceBytes":102508,"destBytes":102508,"author":"pyeo@businessinsider.com (Patricia Kelly Yeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6070a7b94943790018bb1b65?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-35-476_a3119cc49c72e596.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-59-837_9a07a268776057bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn39@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-56-491_80d99c634e518e91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wJbv0ueIy-E:Nz5yb4ndLaY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-55-125_5a3a60ef79d1ae73.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wJbv0ueIy-E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn83@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-06-364_bfecef50a3591f7a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331594},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"A man in Texas was arrested on suspicion of trying to buy explosives from an undercover FBI agent as part of a plot to blow up data centers","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/man-in-texas-tried-to-buy-explosives-to-blow-up-data-centers-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6070a0044943790018bb1b2c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"C-4 explosive blasting cap\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Marine inserts blasting caps into blocks of C-4 explosive, February 1, 2005.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pfc.

Investigators allege he also admitted to bringing a sawed-off rifle to the city on January 6, <a href=\"https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-4514.html#:~:text=(a)%20No%20person%20shall%20within,for%20causing%20the%20firing%20of\">a crime in itself in Washington, DC</a>, but that he left the weapon in his car during the riots.</p><p>According to the court filings, a confidential source connected Pendley with an undercover FBI agent who Pendley believed to be an explosives supplier. Prosecutors allege Pendley told the agent he wanted to bring down &#34;the oligarchy&#34; in the US by attacking Amazon AWS web servers that federal agencies rely upon, most of which were located in Virginia.</p><p>&#34;The main objective is to f--k up the Amazon servers,&#34; prosecutors accuse Pendley of saying. &#34;There&#39;s 24 buildings that all this data runs through in America. Three of them are right next to each other, and 24 run 70 percent of the Internet. And the government especially the higher-ups, CIA, FBI, special s--t, they have like an 8 billion dollar a year contract with Amazon to run through their servers. So we f--k those servers, and it&#39;s gonna piss all the oligarchy off.&#34;</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20612405-seth-pendley-complaint/?embed=1&title=1le=1\" title=\"Seth Pendley complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" width=\"700\" height=\"905\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></div><p> </p><p>On Thursday, Pendley met with the undercover agent once more to acquire what he believed to be active explosives, but the FBI agent supplied him with inert devices instead, and explained his motives to the agent. According to the DOJ, agents promptly arrested Pendley after he had placed the fake explosives into his vehicle. </p><p>After searching Pendley&#39;s home, investigators said they found hand-drawn maps, flashcards relating to the planned attack, a piece of sawed-off rifle, wigs and masks, and a machete with his username from MyMilitia.com affixed onto the blade.</p><p>Acting US Attorney Prerak Shah praised investigators in a statement for apprehending Pendley before he had a chance to endanger people or infrastructure.</p><p>&#34;We are also incredibly proud of our FBI partners, who ensured that the defendant was apprehended with an inert explosive device before he could inflict real harm, Shah said. &#34;The Justice Department is determined to apprehend domestic extremists who intend to commit violence, no matter what political sentiment drives them to do so.&#34;</p><p>A spokesperson for Amazon told Insider it would continue to monitor for any outside threats against its staff and data servers.</p><p>&#34;We would like to thank the FBI for their work in this investigation,&#34; the spokesperson said. &#34;We take the safety and security of our staff and customer data incredibly seriously, and constantly review various vectors for any potential threats.

A few left my sensitive skin red and irritated, but most failed to leave any impression whatsoever.</p><p>Well, one afternoon more than a decade ago, I was invited to Kate Somerville&#39;s spa in Los Angeles where I was introduced to the skincare guru herself, as well as one of her trademark products that would change my facial regimen forever - the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970640539642798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">ExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment</a>.</p><p>In case you don&#39;t understand the importance of exfoliating, <a href=\"https://www.doctorsaedi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nazanin Saedi, MD</a>, a board-certified dermatologist and director of the Laser Surgery and Cosmetic Center, explains that it&#39;s a crucial step in helping the skin rid itself of the dead cell debris, which allows for skin renewal and regrowth. </p><p>This tube of green, pumpkin-scented scrub was - and still is - the best exfoliating treatment I have ever used. It works in just two minutes to transform my rough and dry skin to baby soft without any irritation - and without visiting the LA spa. </p><h2><strong>What it is</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970640539642798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Kate Somerville&#39;s ExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment</a> is a dual-action exfoliator, so it works physically and chemically. It has natural enzymes as well as physical granules to remove dead skin, clean out clogged pores, and give skin a more fresh-faced appearance. </p><p>Somerville created the product back in 2006 for her celebrity clients because they weren&#39;t able to get into the spa for regular facials - like when they were on extended trips for work - and this concoction basically served as a facial in a bottle. In 2007, she started selling the product at her spa and on QVC, where <a href=\"https://people.com/archive/an-a-list-beauty-guru-vol-67-no-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it sold out in just six minutes</a>. It&#39;s still currently her bestselling product with reportedly double-digit growth every year.  </p><p>The exfoliator is free of all parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. Papaya, pineapple, and pumpkin enzymes naturally smooth skin without overdrying, while lactic acid offers the &#34;chemical&#34; component as a natural alpha hydroxy acid that exfoliates. The combination of rosewood and cinnamon extracts work to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and aloe vera, honey, and vitamin E smooth and soften skin. </p><h2><strong>How to use it</strong></h2><p>The brand recommends using the product once or twice a week, either in the morning or at night.</p><p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970640539642798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">The treatment</a> is really easy to use. All you have to do is apply a thin layer to clean, wet skin, and then gently massage it into your skin for about 30 seconds. You might feel a slight tingling on your face, which means the product is starting to work its magic. Leave it on for one minute if you have sensitive skin, or up to two for other skin types. Your skin will continue to tingle slightly as you wait. Once you&#39;re ready, rinse off the product and pat dry - and that&#39;s it. </p><p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970640539642798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f08960b19182426e53ddb93?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Kate Somerville ExfoliKate \" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Somerville/Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>My favorite part of the process is feeling the results. After more than a decade of use, the product never fails to impress. My skin always feels like it just spend an hour in the hands of a facialist - soft, smooth, and silky. </p><h2><strong>Other considerations </strong></h2><p>Even though you might become totally obsessed with this product and its instant results, make sure not to overuse it.</p><p>&#34;I think the biggest issue with exfoliation is that people like to do it too often,&#34; Dr. Saedi explains. &#34;If you over-exfoliate, you&#39;re stripping natural oils from your skin and that can lead to overproduction of oil.&#34; She recommends just using it two to three times a week. </p><p>If your skin damage is next level, board certified plastic surgeon <a href=\"http://dermguy.com/dr-jason-d-bloom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jason Bloom, MD</a> suggests looking into something a little more powerful, like a chemical peel or lasers. Treatments such as <a href=\"http://www.picosure.com/how-does-it-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PicoSure</a> can penetrate deeper within your skin in order to kickstart collagen growth, helping to alleviate dark spots, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, and even fine lines and wrinkles. Obviously these sort of treatments are going to cost a whole lot more than a tube of <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970640539642798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">ExfoliKate</a>, so you want might want to try this product first - and definitely consult with your dermatologist.</p><p>And if you&#39;re currently using retinol products, or are getting laser or any other resurfacing treatments, you might want to speak with your dermatologist or esthetician before using any sort of exfoliating products too. I&#39;ve made this mistake, and my skin ended up red and irritated.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>Without a doubt, this is the best facial exfoliator that I have ever used.</p><p>While the price is steep - <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1737292100302521046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">$88 for 2 oz</a> or <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1711970735233219063\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">$185 for 5 oz</a> - you get what you pay for in results. My experience is that a tube lasts a long time - six months to a year - but obviously that depends on how often you use it. If you aren&#39;t willing to invest in a full-size tube, you can try out the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1737292179062508661\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">0.5 ounce travel-size for just $25</a>.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"5e45c74d4b661b15815b1416\" data-purchase-option=\"\">ExfoliKate

With that said, a few titles, like &#34;Spider-Man: Homecoming,&#34; aren&#39;t included since they were <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-some-marvel-cinematic-universe-movies-arent-on-disney-plus-2019-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">produced by different studios.</a></p><p>Beyond the MCU movie lineup, new spin-off series focused on various Marvel characters will be available on Disney Plus as well.

That said, any R-rated films, like &#34;Logan&#34; and &#34;Deadpool,&#34; are unlikely to ever be included.</p><h2>What order should I watch the Marvel films in?</h2><p>Though different Marvel Studios movies take place at different points in the MCU&#39;s timeline, the best order to watch the movies in is the same order that they were originally released in theaters.

after the Fox News host openly embraced the white supremacist Great Replacement conspiracy theory on air.</p><p>&#34;Given his long record of race-baiting, we believe it is time for Carlson to go,&#34; ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a letter to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott.</p><p>On Thursday night, Carlson <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tucker-carlson-endorses-white-supremacist-replacement-conspiracy-theory-2021-4\">alleged</a> that Democrats were &#34;importing a brand new electorate&#34; of &#34;Third World&#34; immigrants to &#34;dilute&#34; the political power of Americans.</p><p>He referenced the replacement theory, a well-known racist philosophy that has inspired <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/el-paso-shooting-racism.html\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"95c77dc4563a39699a3155d39284eeb2\">racist

data-uri=\"79160d340ee4fb786b977bade1193606\">mass murder</a> in the US and around the world for years and presumes that white, western populations are facing a demographic ticking clock in multicultural societies.</p><p>A Fox News spokesperson told Insider that Carlson was making an argument about voting rights.</p><p>&#34;I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term &#39;replacement,&#39; if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate - the voters now casting ballots - with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World,&#34; Carlson told his audience of millions. &#34;But they become hysterical because that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, actually. Let&#39;s just say it. That&#39;s true.&#34;</p><p>The letter sent by the ADL was first <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/09/media/adl-letter-fox-news-tucker-carlson/index.html\">reported by CNN Business.</a> In it, Greenblatt condemned Carlson&#39;s &#34;open-ended endorsement of white supremacist ideology.&#34;</p><p>&#34;This is not legitimate political discourse,&#34; Greenblatt wrote in the letter to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, according to CNN. </p><p>Demonizing immigrants is a recurring theme in Carlson&#39;s show, with the host once <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tucker-carlson-fox-news-loses-advertisers-immigrants-us-dirtier-2018-12\">saying</a> that immigrants make the country &#34;dirtier.&#34;</p><p>In recent years, replacement theory has been referenced at the white supremacist march on Charlottesville in 2017, where extremists shouted slogans like &#34;Jews will not replace us&#34; and killed peaceful protestor Heather Heyer, and the 2019 El Paso Walmart mass shooting, where a white gunman intentionally targeted predominantly Latino victims.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

</strong>This right here is the longest jump ever recorded in the World Rally Championship - 278 feet! That&#39;s nearly the length of a football field! So what kind of car did driver Sebastien Loeb have for this incredible feat? A Citroën C4, a simple European compact car known for its safety and reliability. But how do you send an average economy car into orbit and safely back down again? You transform everything that makes it an average car. From adding a suspension that can handle the landing to an aerodynamic body kit that will prevent it from flying away, it&#39;s all in how rally cars get completely re-engineered from the inside out.</p><p>The first important difference between rally cars and road cars is a more aerodynamic design that makes flying through the air a whole lot easier - and safer. Let&#39;s compare a rally car like Hyundai&#39;s i20 WRC model and the automaker&#39;s i20 compact car that it&#39;s based on. Besides both being built on the same steel shell, they look completely different. One screams &#34;race car&#34; while the other screams &#34;new parents&#34;. But those eye-catching additions aren&#39;t just for show. Once the i20 takes flight, it&#39;s aerodynamic additions make sure it comes back down as soon as   possible and on its wheels</p><p>This requires creating downforce, one of the most important parts of racing in general. Downforce is the downward vertical force on a car that keeps it glued to the ground. In a sport like IndyCar racing that takes place on a smooth flat tarmac, creating downward force is important for simply giving racers more grip in tight corners. But in rallying where there&#39;s constant elevation changes on loose gravel and snow, downforce keeps cars from flying off the track</p><p>To generate downforce, rally cars like Hyundai&#39;s i20 WRC are fitted with sloped carbon fiber wings throughout the body. While most obvious is the six-foot long one in the back, there are also small wings positioned over the wheels. These are known as dive planes.  Although they may be a different size and shape, their function is the same: As the car drives forward at high speed, it has to cut through air. High pressure air forced under the car creates an upward force on the vehicle known as lift. The wings counteract this lift with downforce. Incoming air forced over the car is slowed down and pushed upward by the wings. The equal and opposite reaction is slower-moving high pressure air now pushing the car downward.This is the downforce needed to keep the car properly balanced.</p><p>This downforce is especially useful for jumps. In a rally car that constantly finds itself in the air, having plenty of downforce to stay level and coming straight back down on all four wheels is especially important. Just ask driver Petter Solberg who lost his rear wing in the 2005 Rally Finland.</p><p>For the air going underneath the car is a piece known as the splitter added up front right under the bumper. Just as its name suggests, it &#34;splits&#34; the air traveling at the car, sending tighter low pressure air underneath and quickly out the back before it can enact too much lift on the car. Large amounts of slower-moving high pressure air are forced over the car, creating extra downforce. This again helps keep the car level as it takes flight. Without it, the car would be flipped backward right as it took off!</p><p>But even if you can send a car flying into the air level and straight down on all four wheels, it means nothing if that car doesn&#39;t have a suspension that can handle the landing. That&#39;s why the suspension that ends up on a WRC rally car looks nothing like what you&#39;ll find on your typical road car, especially the dampers. Dampers or shock absorbers, are the key part of a rally car&#39;s suspension that keeps it from crumpling to pieces when the car comes back down.</p><p>On a regular road car, every time your car bounces over a rough surface or hits a nasty bump, the intense energy and vibrations on your wheels are absorbed by a large coil spring. But while those springs are great at absorbing energy, they need something in the way to keep them from bouncing back uncontrollably like a trampoline. That&#39;s where dampers come in. Positioned inside the spring, they&#39;re made up of a long telescopic body with a piston and oil inside. As the spring compresses during a heavy bump or impact on your wheel, so does the damper, and that piston slides down through the oil. As the spring bounces back, the damper is what keeps it under control, as the oil slows down the piston&#39;s return and converts that energy into heat. On a road car the goal of the suspension and dampers is to keep the ride as smooth and comfortable as possible, ideally so you barely notice those bumps at all.</p><p>But on a WRC rally car, comfort is the engineers&#39; last concern. There&#39;s no question there are bumps and bangs coming. You&#39;ve got 1.2 tons of metal crashing down from heights of over 3 feet. The goal is for the car to survive - and keep going as fast as possible. This calls for dampers twice as big and strong so they can handle more intense compression. They&#39;re built thick, heavy and tuned with the intention of absorbing an enormous impact, not making sure the passengers are cozy.</p><p>A motorsport like rallying also requires an additional canister connected to the damper. In an especially active damper, oil temperatures are reaching up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit. This can cause your shock absorbers to overheat, which leads to them compressing irregularly and the driver losing control of the vehicle. An additional canister, or &#34;remote reservoir&#34;, allows you to carry more oil and have a place where it can cool down.</p><p>The most crucial feature rally car dampers have though is how adjustable they are. With knobs found on both the dampers and throughout the car, everything from ride height, to compression speed, to how fast they rebound can be adjusted. For rally courses that feature more jumps, drivers need a car that&#39;s both higher off the ground with a suspension that they can count on bouncing back immediately and as smoothly as possible when they make a heavy landing.</p><p>Just as important to the rally car&#39;s suspension though are the tires. Even if your shock absorbers can handle a jump, if your tires collapse on impact then you aren&#39;t going anywhere. In a league like the WRC, teams have many different types of bespoke tires. For gravel courses where jumps are especially found, the most important thing to have is thick tires with stiff reinforced sidewalls for puncture resistance. </p><p>On a normal road tire, tiny steel belts inside the tread provide extra support to the tire&#39;s contact patch. This is the part of the tire that touches the road. However, the tire&#39;s sidewalls are thin and flexible, to make for a more comfortable ride. Gravel rally car tires are the exact opposite, with little support under the contact patch, but sidewalls that are practically bulletproof. This is to prevent hard cornering and hard impacts from causing the rally tire to fold over on itself, or remove itself from the wheel.</p><p>Rally tires are also softer than regular tires in terms of the rubber compound used. This allows them to absorb more bumps and shocks. It also gives them more grip when ripping down a gravel stage or landing a high impact jump. The softer compound provides this but won&#39;t last as long as your street tire. Fortunately they aren&#39;t needed to last nearly as long, just until the end of the race.</p><p>But even if your car has the aerodynamics to soar through the air smoothly, and a suspension that can handle the landing, it&#39;s going to mean nothing if your car&#39;s undercarriage isn&#39;t protected properly. The undercarriage has many exposed components, like fuel lines that are easily penetrable by sharp rocks and race debris. Consumer cars use carpeting for the underside of the vehicle to reduce road noise and improve airflow, but this does nothing to prevent damage. So the i20 WRC is fitted with three quarter-inch thick steel plates bolted to the underside of the car. Known as skid plates, or sump guards, these tools can also be made from carbon fiber or aluminum. Their main objective is to protect the oil pan, transmission, gear box, and fuel tank from loose stones and debris.</p><p>Skid plates help drivers against a number of major car problems, the most dangerous being fuel and oil leaks. While these two issues usually just result in engine failure, they have also caused a number of major fires in the WRC. Esapekka Lappi&#39;s unsolved car fire at March&#39;s Rally Mexico is believed to have been caused by an oil leak. Skid plates drastically improve your chances of avoiding them.</p><p>Still the skid plate alone can&#39;t protect you from everything. Just ask driver Elfyn Evans who landed on nothing but his sump guard at last year&#39;s Rally Estonia, and suffered two compression fractures, cutting his season short. No matter how prepared you may be, some rally car disasters are just unavoidable.</p><p>So while cars only take to the air in NASCAR and Formula 1 after something has already gone wrong, in the World Rally Championship it&#39;s a major part of the competition. Between being equipped with an aerodynamic body, heavy duty suspension, and a steel plated undercarriage, jumping nearly the length of a football field is something these incredible vehicles can handle day to day. While they may be based on compact cars that can barely handle a pothole, the right kind of engineering can transform them from family vehicles into high-flying tanks.</p><p><em>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE: This video was originally published in September 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/rally-cars-are-compact-cars-that-jump-hundreds-feet-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mirF73mrFdY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 19:34:07 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f6ce9a1c4049200115cb797?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"3906fb67784d4b832115607c80a64ae2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn39@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-38-422_cbfff8373d36818f.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":134070,"destBytes":134070,"author":"insider@insider.com (Daniel Gessner)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn21@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-04-873_67501b52ad4a1b51.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-02-741_1d376880c6f7817f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mirF73mrFdY:szZIE8torUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn48@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-00-117_89ed21dc3b740cec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mirF73mrFdY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn27@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-33-000_d5010dd430d1ac5e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331671},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"The Ingenuity Mars helicopter's blades are spinning ahead of its first flight - making the NASA team 'nervous and excited'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mars-helicopter-spins-blades-first-flight-nasa-team-nervous-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6070d5f7a451820019b3a683?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mars ingenuity helicopter rotor blades spin\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Perseverance rover photographed the Ingenuity helicopter before (left) and after (right) it spun its rotor blades.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-photographed-mars-surface-before-flight-2021-4\">NASA&#39;s Ingenuity helicopter</a> has spun its blades and charged up with solar energy on Mars.</li>\n<li>On Monday, Ingenuity will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-live-nasa-fly-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-first-time-2021-4\">attempt the first controlled flight on Mars</a>.</li>\n<li>The NASA team is nervous and excited for the high-stakes experimental flight.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>NASA&#39;s Ingenuity helicopter is charging up and spinning its blades in preparation to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-live-nasa-fly-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-first-time-2021-4\">fly above the Martian surface</a>.</p><p>The 4-pound drone is set to lift off early on Monday, rise 10 feet above the dusty red ground of Mars&#39;

The air there has just 1% the density of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, making Ingenuity&#39;s task the equivalent of flying three times higher than the peak of Mount Everest. To catch enough lift with so few molecules to push against, the helicopter&#39;s two pairs of blades will have to spin in opposite directions at a speed roughly eight times faster than a passenger helicopter on Earth.</p><p>&#34;There were some people who doubted we could generate enough lift to fly in that thin Martian atmosphere,&#34; Amiee Quon, who tested Ingenuity in a Mars-simulation chamber on Earth, said in the Friday briefing.</p><p>It worked in the test chamber, but flying on Mars is a different story.</p><p>&#34;There are four possible outcomes. The first is for success. Second, partial success. Third could be insufficient or no data coming back, which means we&#39;ll have to take more time to figure out what&#39;s happened. Or it could be failure,&#34; Aung said.</p><h2>&#39;High-risk, high-reward&#39;</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60304d03623bd30012bcc5a0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"perseverance rover landing mars nasa mission control celebrates\" height=\"1280\" width=\"1706\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Perseverance surface-operations team celebrates the rover&#39;s landing from their mission-control room at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, February 18, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://images.nasa.gov/details-PIA23723\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Because Ingenuity is a demonstration of technology that&#39;s never been used on Mars before, it&#39;s &#34;high-risk, high-reward,&#34; according to Zurbuchen.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s a lot of a lot of things that could certainly go wrong, I guess, besides crashing or not working at all. You can imagine 1,000 ways that either of those things could happen,&#34; Ravich said.</p><p>The worst-case scenario, he added, is that Ingenuity doesn&#39;t get off the ground at all. Even if it flies a little bit and crashes, the team could potentially salvage data from the robot and learn lessons for future space helicopters.</p><p>If the rotorcraft does fly and land smoothly, even just for this first flight, Ingenuity could revolutionize the way NASA investigates other planets.</p><p>&#34;Suppose that it does, in fact, work. What we will have proven is that we can add an aerial dimension to discovery and exploration on Mars,&#34; Zurbuchen said. &#34;That aerial dimension, of course, opens up aspects of science and overall exploration that, frankly, at this moment in time, are only our dreams.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mars-helicopter-spins-blades-first-flight-nasa-team-nervous-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5I6yjs41JOc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:28:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6070de4c4943790018bb1c5f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9f4b7a9a4541c47b64dc3fc3bcbcba3b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-45-56-514_6115b1dde70ba4b4.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":242150,"destBytes":242150,"author":"mmcfalljohnsen@insider.com (Morgan McFall-Johnsen)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6070d5f7a451820019b3a683?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-08-324_1f6cf7ff4ecc71c4.webp","https://i.insider.com/6070de244943790018bb1c5e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/10/03-45-56-346_9a4a57971545fe5b.webp","https://i.insider.com/606f4a6f4d3e410018b70112?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-59-932_bcd9b8c25c429ff5.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f2110e040c1f316e20b1493?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-46-14-182_7aec1700d8555156.webp","https://i.insider.com/60304d03623bd30012bcc5a0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_2/2021/04/10/03-45-55-025_a852aab1c2850ddb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-06-040_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-02-863_6a4103af0daa4a3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-07-047_32089d0dc6f83615.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-00-486_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5I6yjs41JOc:gcXxFlAqi7s:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-02-880_eb3a0c9c06573b97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5I6yjs41JOc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/10/03-46-05-804_a7da6626b050312e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026331701},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:31","title":"The top 9 movies on Netflix this week, from 'Concrete Cowboy' to 'Legally Blonde'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-movies-on-netflix-this-week-concrete-cowboy-legally-blonde-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ffca258d184b30018aae1e2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"concrete cowboy netflix\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Concrete Cowboy&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Netflix</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Every week, the streaming search engine Reelgood compiles for Insider a list of which movies have been most prominent on Netflix&#39;s daily top-10 lists that week. </li>\n<li>Netflix counts a view if an account watches a movie or TV show for at least two minutes.</li>\n<li>The Netflix drama &#34;Concrete Cowboy,&#34;

Accounting for inflation, that is roughly the same amount that Congress approved in 2020.</p>\n<p>But liberal Democrats had been hoping for more. Last year, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pushed for a 10% cut in defense spending, arguing that the money - over half of US discretionary spending - could be put to better use funding social programs, especially amid a pandemic.</p>\n<h2>'A budget is about priorities'</h2>\n<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders said the request bothered him.</p>\n<p>\"I have serious concerns,\" Sanders, an independent from Vermont who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, said in a statement Friday. \"At a time when the US already spends more on the military than the next 12 nations combined, it is time for us to take a serious look at the massive cost over-runs, the waste and fraud that currently exists in the Pentagon.\"</p>\n<p>That concern was echoed by Sanders' liberal colleague, Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in February.</p>\n<p>\"A budget is about priorities, and we continue to overinvest in defense while underinvesting in public health and so much more that would keep us safe and that would save lives,\" Warren said.</p>\n<p>That comment came <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/deputy-secretary-of-defense-nominee-dr-kathleen-hicks-agrees-with-senator-warren-that-we-could-lower-our-740-billion-defense-budget-to-better-reflect-our-priorities-without-sacrificing-our-security\">during questioning</a> of Dr. Kathleen Hicks, the Biden administration's pick for deputy secretary of defense. Hicks, for her part, said the Pentagon could get by on less money, but that would require \"hard choices\" the White House does not appear willing to tackle in its first spending proposal.</p>\n<p>In 2020, the Pentagon failed its audit for the third year in a row. It does not expect to pass a comprehensive review of its assets until at least 2027.</p>\n<h2>Biden administration defends proposal</h2>\n<p>A White House official, speaking on background with reporters on Friday, sought to assuage progressive critics.</p>\n<p>\"A large chunk of that increase is to pay for the pay raise for men and women in uniform and the civilians that support them,\" they said.</p>\n<p>According to the federal formula for military pay increases, service members should expect a 2.7% increase in their salary, the Military Times <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/12/26/new-in-2021-military-pay-raise-likely-to-be-smaller-next-year/\">reported last December</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration will release a more detailed spending proposal in the coming months.</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

revolution in the fight against climate change.</li>\n<li>The growing collection of renewable energy sources and advanced IoT technology are giving smart cities a tangible future.</li>\n<li>Because of their work, Insider named the top execs at Fortum and Iberdrola to our annual list of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tb/the-list-of-300-people-transforming-business-in-europe-2020-9\">10 leaders transforming energy in Europe.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tb/the-people-transforming-business-in-2020-9\"><strong>Visit Insider&#39;s Transforming Business homepage for more stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>The events of the last year have highlighted the need for safe, reliable, and healthy environments. In both business and in personal life future-proofing has become more important than ever. </p><p>Many business leaders in the renewable energy sector believe that interconnected data across multiple systems is key to providing a holistic understanding of the spaces we live in. </p><h2><strong>The necessity of the digital twin</strong></h2><p>Technology is enabling this like never before, said Jordi Badosa, research engineer at the Dynamic Meteorology Laboratory (LMD) at École Polytechnique and technical director at the Energy4Climate Centre, Institut Polytechnique de Paris. &#34;The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main revolutions happening - objects that measure, monitor, and execute actions, all organized in the so-called digital twin of the building.&#34;</p><p>This digital twin, Badosa said, &#34;allows effective maintenance, health monitoring, and extreme events or alarm detection. In terms of energy, buildings become prosumers (that is, they produce and consume their own energy) and the occupants become &#39;consum&#39;actors.&#39;&#34; Electrical vehicles connected to buildings change the consumption profile and set technical and economic challenges to the grid and the users. &#34; </p><p>There are some exciting developments on the horizon, according to Badosa. &#34;These include buildings that can store the energy in a seasonal time frame (that is, the extra heating from summer to be used to heat in winter, for example) and Vehicule2grid solutions, that is electric vehicles that can also supply electricity to the building, allow to adapt the load curve and potentially reduce peaks and costs,&#34; Badosa said. We&#39;ll also start to see living labs that help to make building occupants aware and informed actors that contribute to the smartness of the building.  </p><p>&#34;Cities produce 70+% of all carbon emissions, so they must be made &#39;smart&#39; by aggregating huge amounts of data from buildings and infrastructure to create Digital Twins - a 3D virtual replica,&#34; explains Michael Jansen, CEO of Cityzenith, a leading digital twin provider in the smart city and energy saving space through its SmartWorldOS™ platform.</p><p>&#34;The digital twin enables minute diagnosis of how a smart city will operate, with real time optimization and automation, plus the ability to run simulations to predict and manage city performance indicators - including carbon emissions and their effect on climate change,&#34; Jansen said. &#34;From there architects, engineers, city planners and building managers can also examine various carbon-related impacts such as traffic patterns, or map the lifecycle of a building from design, cost-saving &#39;right first time&#39; construction and, ultimately, demolition.&#34;</p><h2><strong>Challenges to creating smart cities</strong></h2><p>There are challenges to overcome in transitioning to fully smart cities. &#34;Lack of data formulation and owner reluctance to reveal the carbon footprint of their real estate, hampers the process. Lack of openness from building owners and operators within a city, inaccurate, aging data from aging infrastructure that hinders the ability to optimise and lack of community buy-in are all barriers,&#34;  Jansen said.</p><p>However, smart city projects are driving consultation, awareness and change positively through organizations like <a href=\"https://www.c40.org/\">C40Cities</a>, a group that represents 8% of the world&#39;s people and 25% of its economy, and its steering committee includes major European cities: Copenhagen, London, Milan, and Stockholm.</p><p>There are groundbreaking projects happening all across Europe. The &#34;SmartQuart&#34; project features a complete hydrogen microgrid, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). The project is trialling three different non-fossil-fuel energy systems in three different towns/districts so that they can be compared. The towns will be connected together so that they can trade surplus energy with each other as and when required.</p><p>The Kaisersesch hydrogen grid is where German heating systems manufacturer Viessmann will be testing its condensing boilers for operation with pure hydrogen and also testing the practical operation of hydrogen-compatible fuel cell heating systems. In Bedburg there will be a local district energy system set up using energy generated wind turbine, new solar plants and central and decentralized heat pumps. Solar will also be used to power a district in Essen that will also include charging stations for cars.</p><p>Patrick Doherty, head of emerging verticals at Elavon Europe, said Covid has had a huge impact on how we travel. &#34;With recovery efforts underway, new travel patterns and use of the transport networks will emerge over the coming months,&#34; he said. &#34;In response, transport operators are looking to restore confidence in travel across our cities to ensure its infrastructure is convenient, adaptable, and sustainable for future generations.&#34; </p><p>Energy company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tb/the-list-of-300-people-transforming-business-in-2020-9/transformers/markus-rauramo\">Fortum</a> is working to enable the cities of Stockholm and Espoo to join the circular economy, launching several projects and investing heavily in sustainable heat production and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Spanish giant <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tb/the-list-of-300-people-transforming-business-in-2020-9/transformers/ignacio-gal%C3%A1n\">Iberdrola</a> is investing more than €600m over the next ten years to enable the country&#39;s main urban areas to move towards becoming smart cities.</p><p>Collaborations are essential to making products and systems become a reality, said Christian Engelke, Viessmann&#39;s technical director, &#34;finding the most successful set-ups, especially when it comes to essential infrastructure involves widespread behavioral change.&#34; Viessmann developed its first heat pump around 50 years ago yet the market is not yet at a point where heat pumps are an everyday choice of heat generator: &#34;There is no point in having the perfect product if there is no proof it works, no fuel supply or investment in infrastructure, no skilled people to install and service it, or incentives to bring it to market.&#34;</p><div

political right, explicitly endorsed the white supremacist &#34;Great Replacement&#34; theory during his Thursday night program.</p><p>Carlson argued that Democratic lawmakers are &#34;importing a brand new electorate&#34; of &#34;Third World&#34; immigrants to &#34;dilute&#34; Americans&#39; political power by adding more voters to the rolls. He described his argument as the so-called replacement theory, which is a core belief of white supremacists that has motivated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/el-paso-shooting-racism.html\">racist violence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/christchurch-harbored-white-supremacists-before-massacre-2019-3\">mass murder</a> in the US and around the world. </p><p>&#34;I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term &#39;replacement,&#39; if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate - the voters now casting ballots - with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World,&#34; Carlson told his audience, which is among the largest in cable news. &#34;But they become hysterical because that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, actually. Let&#39;s just say it. That&#39;s true.&#34;</p><p>Carlson argued that his comments aren&#39;t racialized, despite the fact that the vast majority of the conservative voters he&#39;s defending <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/\">are white</a> and the immigrants he&#39;s demonizing are largely people of color. The Fox host is making his argument in the context of Democratic efforts to create <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/18/us/joe-biden-news\">pathways to citizenship</a> for millions of undocumented immigrants, the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/\">majority of whom</a> are from Mexico and Central and South America.</p><p>White nationalists and others on the far-right have long espoused the &#34;Great Replacement&#34; and &#34;white genocide&#34; conspiracy theories to whip up racial resentment. In 2017, neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, &#34;Jews will not replace us.&#34; </p><p>&#34;If you change the population, you dilute the political power of the people who live there,&#34; Carlson said on Thursday. &#34;So every time they import a new voter, I&#39;d become disenfranchised as a current voter … Everyone wants to make a racial issue out of it. Oh, white replacement. No. This is a voting rights question. I have less political power because they&#39;re importing a brand new electorate. Why should I sit back and take that?&#34;</p><p>A Fox News spokesperson told Insider that Carlson wasn&#39;t endorsing the &#34;white replacement&#34; theory, but instead making an argument about voting rights. </p><p>Carlson&#39;s comments build on similar anti-immigrant arguments he&#39;s made in the past.

Wiping in circles can create uneven pressure and ultimately lead to screen damage. It&#39;s also more likely to create streaking.<br><br></li></ul><h3><strong>Don&#39;t:<br></strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">Use any fabric that feels rough to the touch - even a fabric as soft as a cotton shirt has snags and uneven parts that can damage a computer screen. Microfiber cloths are ideal because the fibers are so tiny that they can cover every inch of the screen with even pressure at the same time, eliminating any opportunity for scratches.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Use anything containing bleach to clean your screen.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Spray any cleaning solution directly onto the screen. To avoid any risk of damage from excess moisture, spray the solution directly onto the microfiber cloth instead.</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Apply pressure when you clean the screen.

Carlos Franqui, founder of <a href=\"https://www.thefloratorium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floratorium</a>, is a pro when it comes to creating life-like works with faux flowers and plants. He's created jaw-dropping installations for hotels, restaurants, and boutiques, including <a href=\"https://www.marearestaurant.com/new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marea</a>'s iconic outdoor seating flower tunnel, the wisteria-draped rooftop of the <a href=\"https://www.thebeekman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beekman Hotel</a>, vibrant window displays for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fveronicabeard.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Veronica Beard</a>, plus numerous home decor projects for individual clients.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Here's what Franqui says to keep in mind when considering fake plants and flowers:</p><p><strong>Use:</strong> If your main goal is a beautiful one-day event such as a party or wedding, Franqui recommends going with real blooms since making them last won't be an issue. However, if you want the long-term look of real flowers without the upkeep, then you may want to turn to fake options. For more permanent patio decor, a floral centerpiece you don't want to keep replacing, or a hard-to-reach corner of your home or office that doesn't get much sunlight, fake plants and flowers can be a life-saver.&#160; &#160;</p><p><strong>Color</strong><strong>:</strong> \"It's always important to look at the color of fake flowers to make sure they are as close as possible to mother nature's colors,\" says Franqui. Look for plants that have color variations as opposed to being all one color for a more realistic look. You may even want to compare photos of real plants with fake options side-by-side to ensure they're a close match.</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Franqui recommends silk as a good option for a realistic look. He also says you should look for \"real touch\" plants and flowers. Real touch flowers and plants are made from a special liquid polymer blend that allows them to more easily take on a life-like shape, color, and feel. Some real touch flowers are made just using the polymer, but some silk flowers can also be coated in it after. Franqui recommends silk real touch plants as the overall best choice.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\tHow to style fake plants and flowers\n\t\n\t<p>\"My trick to make fake plants and flowers look realistic is to incorporate real elements in the design,\" says Franqui. For example, fill a clear vase with fake flowers with real water or use real soil or moss in a planter with a fake tree or plant for a more natural feel.</p><p>Franqui also likes to mix real and fake plants together for the best results. If possible, add a few real twigs or blooms to a faux floral arrangement and use fake plants to enhance indoor or outdoor greenery rather than only using fake options throughout.&#160;</p>\n</div><div

While it did take some time to adjust to and I still had to remind myself to sit up straighter at times, my back felt a lot better after using the stool. The lightly curved base also allowed me a good deal of mobility but was sturdy enough that I never felt like I was going to tip over on it.</p><p>The Varier Move is<a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-announces-neat-product-certification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) certified</a> by the Mayo Clinic, which means it will allow you to burn more calories even while sitting. While this is by no means a total replacement for getting up and walking around, it's far better than sitting hunched over in your traditional desk chair.</p><p>The top of the stool is reminiscent of a bike seat, although a much larger and more cushioned one. You sit with your feet planted and your legs splayed slightly open, which in turn opens your hips and keeps your core and your leg muscles engaged. While this style of sitting is amazing for the posture, I wouldn't advise wearing a shorter dress or skirt while using this.&#160;</p><p>It's height adjustable with a range of, allowing it to be compatible with both a traditional and standing desk. The rounded bottom allows you to tilt and balance at all angles, and you can rotate a full 360 degrees.</p><p>The only true downside I could see with the Varier Move is the price. This is not something I would call budget-friendly. However, if you suffer from back pain or just want to find a way to be more active while tethered to your desk, I found the Varier Move Stool to be the winning option that truly works.</p>\n\tThe best for a standing desk\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a0f0ddaf914c329008b49d1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"best active seating focal upright Locus Leaning\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Focal Upright</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>If you're looking for an alternative to standing all day, the</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015TOI2TM/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=37&#38;imprToken=e6bc4732-adf5-d636-a21&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_112017_best-active-seating-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B015TOI2TM&#38;linkId=62063e1a51cb408a72f297a420880228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"> <strong>Locus Leaning seat</strong></a><strong> from Focal will give you a place to rest.</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Promotes good posture, high-quality design, works well with a standing desk</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive, takes up more space than many alternatives</p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li><strong>Height range:</strong> 4' 11\" to 6' 10\"</li><li><strong>Weight limit: </strong>300 pounds</li><li><strong>Height adjustability: </strong>31 to 41 inches</li><li><strong>Dimensions (LWH):</strong> 45 x 25.5 x 41 inches</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>32 pounds</li></ul></aside><p>As its name states, the<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015TOI2TM/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=38&#38;imprToken=e6bc4732-adf5-d636-a21&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_112017_best-active-seating-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B015TOI2TM&#38;linkId=62063e1a51cb408a72f297a420880228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"> Focal Locus</a> is a leaning style of active seating, the middle ground between sitting and standing. It allows you to take a rest from standing all day but keeps you more mobile than a traditional office chair.</p><p>The leaning angle promotes hip opening, which in turn puts less pressure on your spine. The Locus comes with a footboard, which puts your feet and ankles at a more comfortable angle as you lean, preventing you from putting any extra strain on those muscles. The only downside of the footboard is that it does take up a good amount of space. There are rollers to make it easy to move around, and it will also fold to make storage slightly easier.&#160;</p><p>The seat itself is a saddle-style, which pushes your pelvis forward so your spine aligns and removes pressure from the lumbar vertebrae. It's also lightly padded and designed to help reduce pressure points that are normally pinched in a traditional office chair. The Locus is also height adjustable.&#160;</p><p>The Locus will need to be put together, but expert assembly is also available if you're the type that cringes at the words \"assembly required.\"</p><p>The Locus is one of the most expensive active seating options on the market, but in this case, you will get what you pay for.

It comes at a relatively affordable price, especially when compared to other active seating models on the market.</p><p>While it can be easier to slouch in this style of active seating, the backrest can help. A metal bar across the front keeps the ball securely in place, and the four casters on the bottom allow you to move the chair. These can also be locked in place for extra stability when you need it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this chair won't work with a standing desk, and its height adjustability relies upon the level of inflation. However, it is designed to fit most standard-height desks.</p><p>If you're looking for a more cushioned seat, this is also a great option. While the ball encourages you to work your core muscles and improve your posture, its material and bounce make for a very comfortable seat. Some basic assembly is required with this chair, but it does come with an air pump so you can inflate the exercise ball and start using your chair right away.

The kneeling position prompts you to shift more than sitting in a traditional desk chair. It also takes the pressure off both the spine and hips. This is a great solution if you suffer from back pain, and you're looking for a way to change up your sitting routine throughout the day.</p><p>First designed in 1979, the<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XXP15CW/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=44&#38;imprToken=e6bc4732-adf5-d636-a21&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_112017_best-active-seating-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B06XXP15CW&#38;linkId=3f8451b8935d6a297f20089f72a5bd88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"> Varier Variable Balans</a> consists of a wooden frame and large cushions for comfortable support. The two knee rests are positioned at an optimal width to open up your hips and take pressure off your spine. The legs are slightly curved, allowing it to rock slightly. This allows you to lean forward and back with more freedom, extending your reach and increasing your mobility.</p><p>The Variable Balans works well with a traditional desk, but it won't be compatible with a standing desk.&#160;</p><p>Some users have complained that putting their weight on their knees gets uncomfortable throughout the day, but it's important to engage your core muscles while using this chair. That way, you won't be straining your knees and instead rely on your other muscles to hold you up.</p>\n\tHow to choose the right active seating option for you\n\t\n\t<p>It's important to note that active seating is a lot like a new exercise. Since you'll be utilizing your core more than you would in a normal desk chair, it does take some getting used to. You'll want to build up to using your active seat more throughout the day gradually. Below are a few other factors you'll want to consider to find the perfect style of active seating for you.</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>What style do you want? </strong>Based on your setup, you'll want something that works with your traditional, standing, or height-adjustable desk. You'll also want a seat that will work best for you, whether you want to engage your core or improve your posture.&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Is it height adjustable? </strong>This is important not only for allowing you to rest in the optimal position but also so it can be compatible with a sit-stand desk, if you have one.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>How much cushioning do you want? </strong>How much cushioning you need will depend on how often you want to use active seating. If you plan on switching back and forth between active seating and your normal office chair you may not need as much.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>How much space will it take up? </strong>If you don't have much space to spare, or you travel often and want to take your seat with you, you may want to consider a collapsible or portable style of active seating.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Is it easy to assemble? </strong>The easier it is to assemble, the more quickly you'll be able to start using your new office chair.</li></ul>\n\tCheck out our other office gear

Along the oceanfront, the north end is generally held to be more contemporary, with the south end having older properties.</p><p>Ocean Boulevard is the main drag that runs parallel to the beaches with busy spots around Wither Heights and Yaupon Circle. Families will probably want the ease of being close to the action and the sands, while couples or older visitors may want to stay a few blocks back from the seafront, and there are quieter residential areas around the country clubs and golf courses away from the clamor.</p><p>There are many units within gated resorts, from brands such as Marriott and Sheraton, and some independent complexes. These places have shared community pools and other leisure facilities, some even having small water parks. The vast majority of the accommodations in Myrtle Beach are close to the beaches.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How much does it cost to rent a vacation house in Myrtle Beach?</strong></h2><p>If you want to book a private vacation rental in Myrtle Beach, the cost will depend on factors such as house or unit size, proximity to the beach and downtown, added amenities such as a pool, plus the time of year and the day of the week that you plan to visit.</p><p>It will also, as noted, depend on whether you're renting inside a gated resort community or not. Myrtle Beach gets incredibly busy during the summer and over holiday weekends.&#160;</p><p>For example, a small unit in a resort might start at less than $75 per night off season, but surge to over $300 per night for a summer weekend. A large, lavish beach house could be closer to a thousand dollars or more per night at any time.</p><p>For better deals, as well as increased availability, visit in shoulder seasons like spring or fall when the weather is still quite pleasant and there are fewer crowds and less competition for inventory. If you're set on a summer trip to Myrtle Beach, plan to increase your budget or consider only staying midweek for lower rates.</p><p>Expect to pay, at minimum, a few hundred dollars for a short midweek stay off season, or over one thousand dollars for a weekend or summer visit in a higher-end property. B</p><p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnbs-cancellation-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">be aware of cancellation policies and read the fine print</a>, as some homes have strict rules and service fees. You may also want to check <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-vrbo-homeaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other home rental sites</a>&#160;before you book to make sure you're getting the best deal. Finally, as the global pandemic continues, be aware that shared amenities such as pools or gyms may be closed. Be sure to check with the host before booking if accessing such facilities is important to your stay.</p><h2><strong>What is there to do in Myrtle Beach?</strong></h2><p>Myrtle Beach is a casual, family-focused resort town, with 60 miles of brown sand along the Grand Strand, framed by amusement and water parks, shopping malls, family attractions, chain restaurants, golf courses, and country clubs.</p><p>The major attractions center around families and golfing, with theme parks including the Family Kingdom Amusement Park, Myrtle Waves Water Park, and the NASCAR SpeedPark. Ripley's Aquarium and the SkyWheel are also huge draws.</p><p>Some of the best golf courses include Dunes Golf &#38; Beach Club, Caledonia Golf Club, Tidewater Golf Club and Grande Dunes Resort Club.</p><h2>Is Airbnb safe?</h2><p>The CDC now says&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-travelers-can-now-travel-in-the-us-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"303f476a077d8164f790a3cf23ec1cf6\">fully vaccinated people can safely travel in the US</a>.</p><p>Additionally, experts say&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"1e6ea0063f937a96dc22dade5b4c7c6e\">Airbnb is safe</a>, especially&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-is-safer-airbnb-hotels-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"3aa44a069ccdebdc5c7e8b56165c0439\">compared to hotels</a>, because they eliminate interactions with others.

Look for the Target Clean symbol in store and online to find over 4,000 products that meet their clean standard.</p><p>All beauty products certified as Target Clean are formulated <em>without</em> the following: propyl-parabens, butyl-parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, formaldehyde-donors, nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), Oxybenzone, SLES, retinyl palmitate, hydroquinone, triclosan, triclocarban, BHA &#38; BHT.</p><ul><li>Deodorant: Additionally formulated without aluminum.</li><li>Oral care: Additionally formulated without artificial sweeteners.</li></ul><h3>What is considered clean beauty?</h3><p>Clean beauty follows two simple standards: transparency and safe ingredients. You should know exactly what you're getting with a glance at the label. As for safe ingredients, the <a href=\"https://thegoodfaceproject.com/good_face_index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Good Face Index</a> ranks every cosmetic ingredient based on safety and toxicity. But some general ones to avoid are parabens, sulfates, oxybenzone, and formaldehyde.</p><p>Just because a product is organic, natural, or green, doesn't mean it's non-toxic. Manmade ingredients are clean as long as they're safe and non-toxic. This also means that clean beauty doesn't have to be all-natural, preservative-free, etc.</p><p>In Europe, over 1,300 potentially harmful chemicals are banned from cosmetics. In the United States, that number is just 11. Unfortunately, clean beauty products are not regulated by the FDA, so it's up to the brand's discretion.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

There&#39;s no wizard in Google Sheets, though, so you&#39;ll need to enter all the values manually.</p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>How to use VLOOKUP with Google Sheets</strong></h2><p>The easiest way to understand how to use VLOOKUP is with an example. Imagine you have a table in a Google Sheet that represents data about products in inventory, including part number, name, price, and so on. If you want to create a second table that only includes the part number and price, you could use VLOOKUP to extract price from the spreadsheet knowing only the part number.</p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606fc72a4d3e410018b7026c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to use VLOOKUP with Google Sheets 2\" height=\"610\" width=\"1083\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This is a hypothetical spreadsheet which we&#39;d like to extract information from using VLOOKUP.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong><strong><br></strong></p><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">Enter the part number you want to find and then, in the field next to it, enter &#34;=VLOOKUP&#34; and press tab to start entering the arguments of the formula.  </li><li aria-level=\"1\">The first argument is the search key, which is the part number you just entered in the cell to the left. Either type the value into the formula or click the cell to the left to automatically enter it into the formula. Type a comma. </li><li aria-level=\"1\">The second argument is the range. You&#39;ll want to specify the set of columns to include in the search. You can type it, as in &#34;A:E&#34; or click on the first column header and then drag the mouse to the last column in the table. Type a comma. </li><li aria-level=\"1\">The third argument is the column that contains the value you&#39;re looking for. In this example, we want the price, which is the third column in the range. Type a 3 and add a comma. </li><li aria-level=\"1\">Type &#34;False&#34; and add the closing parenthesis. <br><p><br>The final formula will look like this: </p><p><strong>=VLOOKUP(G2,A:E,3,false) </strong></p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606fc78b4d3e410018b7026e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to use VLOOKUP with Google Sheets 3\" height=\"494\" width=\"878\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Here is a completed VLOOKUP formula.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>You should see the result appear in the cell with the formula. </p><p>You can drag this cell down to copy it to subsequent cells in the column.

For example, if you want to know the price of a product, you might search for the product name or item number in the same row. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>The range</strong> is the columns that contain the data.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>The index</strong> is the column that contains the value you want to find. In the example of finding the price of a product, this is the price column. Rather than using the column letter, you number the columns in the range; the first column is 1, and so on.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>The final value</strong> is &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false&#34; and is used to indicate if the index column has been sorted. It&#39;s optional, but defaults to &#34;true&#34; if you don&#39;t include it - which will give you the wrong result if the table isn&#39;t sorted. </li></ul><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606fc8e04d3e410018b70272?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to use VLOOKUP with Google Sheets 1\" height=\"383\" width=\"682\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This is what the VLOOKUP formula looks like in Google Sheets.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><h2>How to use VLOOKUP on multiple sheets</h2><p>That procedure will help you build a VLOOKUP table if you&#39;re extracting information from a table on the same sheet, but if you want to build a table on a different sheet, you&#39;ll need to make one small change: You need to modify the range to an absolute value that references the name of the spreadsheet.</p><p>For example, suppose you have a Google Sheets workbook with a sheet named &#34;Parts&#34; and you want to extract prices but store them on a new sheet named &#34;Audit.&#34; The range needs to be prefaced with the name of the sheet and an exclamation mark (!). The formula will look the same but instead of this:</p><p><strong>=VLOOKUP(G2,A:E,3,false) </strong></p><p>It needs to look like this:</p><p><strong>=VLOOKUP(G2,Audit!A:E,3,false)</strong></p><h2>How to use VLOOKUP with a wildcard</h2><p>You can also use VLOOKUP to search for partial matches using wildcards - you simply need to use the asterisk (*) or question mark (?) in the search key. The asterisk can be used to match any sequence of characters, while the question mark only replaces a single character.</p><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606fc97c4d3e410018b70273?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to use VLOOKUP with Google Sheets 5\" height=\"778\" width=\"1384\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can use a wildcard symbol to search for a partial index term.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>How to use VLOOKUP to find the closest match</strong></h2><p>While most of the time you&#39;ll want to find an exact match, you might sometimes need to find the closest match. For example, suppose you are looking for a part that&#39;s less than a target price. Here&#39;s how to do that:</p><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">Sort the index column - in other words, the column with the price you are looking for. If you don&#39;t sort the table, you won&#39;t get accurate results. To do that, select the first row, then click &#34;Data&#34; in the menu. Choose &#34;Sort sheet by column A -&#62; Z.&#34;</li><li aria-level=\"1\">Enter your formula as you normally would. </li><li aria-level=\"1\">To complete the formula, set the &#34;is_sorted&#34;
