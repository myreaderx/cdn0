A second attempt on October 1 got to within 18 seconds of launching before a ground systems issue delayed the launch. Finally, having addressed that issue, poor weather on Monday morning forced yet another delay.</p>\n<p>But the fourth time proved the charm for SpaceX on Tuesday morning, as the company's Falcon 9 rocket got its payload of 60 Starlink satellites off the pad and into space shortly after the Sun rose over the Florida coast. With Tuesday's mission, SpaceX has now launched 775 total Starlink satellites, although most of the original 60 prototype satellites have since been de-orbited.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712129#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712129&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:46:04 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-13-Oct-6-2020-5043-980x654.jpg","linkMd5":"a9bb388314bfc315edc5fe51053e738b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-18-50-920_30aa0a4e45058bbc.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":654,"sourceBytes":45827,"destBytes":13092,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-13-Oct-6-2020-5043-980x654.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-18-50-920_30aa0a4e45058bbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn97@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-496_e7433dd6a9702206.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=CaXK5jIKgAU:R76CiDILlTg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-19-05-505_6893a5b60f9333ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-19-05-603_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-464_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249530480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","title":"A decades-long struggle to find a virus wins the Nobel","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711854","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228904068-800x545.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a statue of a person, with a poster in the background.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228904068.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"697\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> This photograph of a bust of Alfred Nobel was taken just prior to the announcement of the winners of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, on October 5, 2020.

About a month went by before the virus was identified and its complete genome sequence was identified. This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine honors a 25-year-long struggle to identify the virus we now know as hepatitis C.</p>\n<h2>The ABCs</h2>\n<p>The hepatitis viruses are a bit confusing. There are now five of them known, and while they're united by their ability to attack the liver, they're very different in most other ways. The most significant of the viruses are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, and they're caused by three largely unrelated viruses—some even differ in their genetic material, using DNA versus RNA—with very different properties.</p>\n<p>One of the first differences recognized by the medical research community was how the viruses spread. Hepatitis A infections can start due to contaminated water or food; in contrast, B and C are typically spread through contaminated blood or needles, making them a threat to the blood supply. The hepatitis A virus was the first identified, leaving researchers focused on the bloodborne B and C. B was the next identified, which is when this year's Nobel Laureates enter the picture.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711854#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711854&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 19:26:09 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228904068-800x545.jpg","linkMd5":"0420f1a8509fb637aade2cfee2af1459","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn14@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-00-197_3eb5992b816a8f8f.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":545,"sourceBytes":49514,"destBytes":26156,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228904068-800x545.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn14@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-00-197_3eb5992b816a8f8f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/09/13-19-05-656_31cf3908d66d220c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=cHfZ7m81Yws:lKjMRIaZqfQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn17@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-19-05-452_b79bf3c29d32b8aa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-19-05-603_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-464_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249530481},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","title":"Space Force considers merging Cape Canaveral with Kennedy Space Center","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712623","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KSC-64PC-0082_large-800x640.jpg\" alt=\"External photographs of a gigantic building.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KSC-64PC-0082_large.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1536\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> In 1964, an overall aerial view of \"Missile Row,\" Cape Kennedy Air Force Station.

Here's how the Guardian describes the issue:</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHE was responsible for collating the test results from public and private labs, and publishing the daily updates on case count and tests performed.</p>\n<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In this case, the Guardian understands, one lab had sent its daily test report to PHE in the form of a CSV file – the simplest possible database format, just a list of values separated by commas. That report was then loaded into Microsoft Excel, and the new tests at the bottom were added to the main database.</p>\n<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But while CSV files can be any size, Microsoft Excel files can only be 1,048,576 rows long. When a CSV file longer than that is opened, the bottom rows get cut off and are no longer displayed. That means that, once the lab had performed more than a million tests, it was only a matter of time before its reports failed to be read by PHE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The agency says it will take precautions to make sure an error like this doesn't happen in the future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711742#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711742&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=BEpTyhL3sp8:6W36v6J1okg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:51:15 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/uk-covid-reporting-001-800x600.png","linkMd5":"f2c65e75da20270940f559f42aa68ebb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_2/2020/10/09/13-18-50-884_7d3a29df4b15e535.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":93270,"destBytes":34814,"author":"Timothy B.

In those simpler times, he recalls walking outside to watch the takeoff from a designated area on the runway.</p>\n<p>Four-year-olds are into all things big and loud, and seeing an airplane come racing down the runway, popping a wheelie, and then taking off was just about the coolest thing he could imagine. His mom and grandmother, both educators, noted his interest and bought him model airplanes.

Now a team of scientists has found evidence from supercomputer simulations that those waves may also encode the shape of merging black holes as they settle into their final form, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00446-7\">a new paper</a> published in the Nature journal Communications Physics.</p>\n<p>General relativity predicts that two merging black holes should give off powerful gravitational waves—ripples in the fabric of spacetime so faint that they're very difficult to detect. The waveforms of those signals serve as an audio fingerprint of the two black holes spiraling inward toward each other and merging in a massive collision event, sending powerful shock waves across spacetime. Physicists look for a telltale <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw\">\"chirp\" pattern</a> in the data as the two black holes collide. The new remnant black hole vibrates from the force of that impact, and those vibrations—called a \"ringdown\" since it is much like the sound of a bell being struck—also produce gravitational waves. Furthermore, the gravitational-wave signals <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/physicists-hear-the-ringing-of-a-baby-black-hole-for-the-very-first-time/\">have multiple frequencies</a>, dubbed \"overtones,\" that fade away at different rates (decay), with each tone corresponding to a vibrational frequency of the new black hole.</p>\n<p>LIGO detects these gravitational waves via laser interferometry, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. (LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana, while a third detector in Italy, <a href=\"https://www.ego-gw.it/history/\">Advanced VIRGO</a>, came online in 2016.) On September 14, 2015, at 5:51am EDT, both detectors picked up signals within milliseconds of each other for the very first time. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712796#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712796&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 20:00:58 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ligo1-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"fe9dffe91f70bee7b898cf4b12e50798","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-18-50-761_3a22157742408b83.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":22629,"destBytes":11210,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ligo1-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-18-50-761_3a22157742408b83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_2/2020/10/09/13-19-05-499_0d50273e29bf5d36.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=nM9ZGDpMcSM:D6Vz1n4ucuA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-19-06-519_61e5649a774796c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-19-05-603_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-464_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249530480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","title":"In a pandemic-driven world, trust in science is rising","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712268","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages_CoronavirusProtectiveGearScientists_CROPPED-800x419.jpg\" alt=\"People in protective gear examine pages of notes.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages_CoronavirusProtectiveGearScientists_CROPPED.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"529\" data-width=\"1011\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Scientists doing what they do best.

While the Pew has the advantage of over a decade of data in some countries and large survey populations, it suffered a bit in terms of timing.

Another is that poop is forever. Archaeologists have already explored the contents of coprolites and the chemicals left behind by a city’s worth of human waste. And according to a recent study, DNA from your gut microbes can stick around for centuries under the right conditions.</p>\n<p>Archaeogeneticist Susanna Sabin and her colleagues found DNA from human gut-dwelling microbes in samples from a 600-year-old household cesspit in Jerusalem and a 700-year-old public toilet in Riga, Latvia. Eventually, that data will help researchers plumb the depths of medieval microbiomes to understand how the microscopic populations of our intestines have evolved over the centuries. For now, the study offers a few small hints about medieval life and suggests that ancient toilets have more to tell us.</p>\n<h2>Medieval vs. modern microbiomes</h2>\n<p>We already know that the microbiomes of modern hunter-gatherers and modern urban dwellers look quite different from each other. Figuring out how those differences evolved could offer some insights about health problems in modern urban dwellers. Sabin and her colleagues thought medieval latrines might be a good place to start looking for clues since medieval cities were urban but not yet industrialized. They sequenced DNA in sediment samples from a 15th-century cesspit in Jerusalem and a 14th-century public latrine in Riga.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711685#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1711685&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VJ0bN55W4-4:b5P0msBV-zk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 11:15:18 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Riga_latrine-800x806.jpg","linkMd5":"0dde7fbd728526ce6e163475eb4cfda8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-18-50-809_acb35214e500e886.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":806,"sourceBytes":127162,"destBytes":80288,"author":"Kiona N.

This award may spur a bit of controversy, as there were a lot of other contributors to the development of CRISPR (enough to ensure a bitter patent fight), and Charpentier and Doudna's work was well into the biology side of chemistry. But nobody's going to argue that the gene editing wasn't destined for a Nobel Prize.</p>\n<h2>Basic science</h2>\n<p>The history of CRISPR gene editing is a classic story of science: a bunch of people working in a not-especially cutting-edge area of science found something strange. The \"something\" in this case was an oddity in the genome sequences of a number of bacteria. Despite being very distantly related, the species all had a section of the genome where a set of DNA sequences were repeated, with a short spacer in between them. The sequences picked up the name CRISPR for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" but nobody knew what they were doing there.</p>\n<p>The fact that they might be important became apparent when researchers recognized that bacteria that had CRISPR sequences invariably also had a small set of genes associated with them. Since bacteria tended to rapidly lose genes and repeat sequences that weren't performing useful functions, this obviously implied some sort of utility. But it took 18 years for someone to notice that the repeated sequences matched those found in the genomes of viruses that infected the bacteria.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712462#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712462&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 16:52:50 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228937163-800x541.jpg","linkMd5":"5d41c10c6d67d843b0afafdb0f7616b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-18-50-737_6dfe78dc621b2316.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":541,"sourceBytes":60561,"destBytes":31378,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228937163-800x541.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_6/2020/10/09/13-18-50-737_6dfe78dc621b2316.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-728_1a295864cbc439a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=2h8TcMkugzM:0ZRiBCe9lw8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn91@2020_3/2020/10/09/13-19-05-639_263fbf295f8619a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/09/13-19-05-603_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_4/2020/10/09/13-19-05-464_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602249530480},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 21:18:50","title":"Russian space corporation unveils planned “Amur” rocket—and it looks familiar","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1712054","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EjqIBa_XkAAANsK-980x1201.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Here's a schematic of the proposed Amur rocket.

It has its roots in a mathematical curve proposed by geologist M. King Hubbert in the 1950s, which he applied to total US production.</p>\n<p>That same curve has been used to describe the depletion of groundwater in regions where water is replenished much too slowly for heavy use to be sustainable.
