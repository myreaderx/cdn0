Instant. Smarter. ThermBot.ai\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thermbot/the-thermometer-smaller-instant-smarter/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a parallel universe where grandparents are much more tech-savvy than their grandchildren, but this one probably isn&#8217;t it. The funny video behind ThermBot&#8217;s thermometer does, however, demonstrate that regular thermometers are antiquated and can do with an upgrade.</p>\n<p>Meet the ThermBot. It&#8217;s smaller, simpler, smarter, and faster than that icky thermometer you put in your mouth, or that contactless thermometer gun everyone is brandishing outside their establishments nowadays. Barely the size of a 9V battery, the ThermBot comes with a pop-out port that allows it to plug into a phone or a power-bank. Once plugged in, the ThermBot works as a contactless thermometer, reading your temperature from a distance. The ThermBot&#8217;s digital white-on-black backlit LCD display is much easier to read, provides accurate temperature readings in under a second, and the device itself is a whole lot smaller than the conventional hand-held thermometer-gun&#8230; but that isn&#8217;t all.</p>\n<p>The ThermBot&#8217;s pop-out USB-C port serves a much larger purpose. Once you plug it into your phone, the ThermBot allows you to send your temperature reading to your fitness apps, integrating another aspect of health into your digital-health monitoring dashboards. For people who find themselves keeping regular tabs on their heart-rate or even their blood pressure, the ThermBot provides you with another facet of health-monitoring, and automatically integrates with apps like Google Fit and Apple Fitness. You can set the ThermBot up with IFTTT too, allowing your readings to go directly to your HR as a Slack message along with a sick-leave request, or allowing you to ping your physician if the temperature is too high or low. The ThermBot doesn&#8217;t do things differently, however, it gives your regular thermometer a few feature upgrades (and a massive size reduction) to help it serve you better. I&#8217;m personally conflicted by the fact that the ThermBot doesn&#8217;t have its own battery (and needs to be plugged into an external source). One could argue that the absence of the battery helps the ThermBot to last longer and eliminates the need to constantly charge it. The ThermBot also comes with a standard USB-C port, but if you do happen to use an iPhone, the ThermBot comes with a lightning power adapter in the box too.</p>\n<p>Besides, it&#8217;s difficult to ignore how incredibly compact and sleek the ThermBot is. Its rounded form, stainless-steel body and glass paneling just gives it the kind of sleekness that&#8217;s more consistent with consumer-tech. At just 0.05 lbs (22 grams), it&#8217;s much lighter than any standard contactless thermometer, and is small enough to store in your pocket or even backpack, allowing you to easily travel with it&#8230; probably in an alternate universe where the planet isn&#8217;t affected by a deathly pandemic. For this universe, however, the ThermBot does a pretty darn amazing job of being a simple, small, smart thermometer that works the instant you plug it in.</p>\n<p>Designer: Eli Ostreicher</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yanko.fnd.to/thermbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $89</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-08-18T12:05:27+00:00\">$149</del> ($60 off).

You can use either hand on your smartphone or tablet screen, but when you&#8217;ve got a watch strapped to your left-hand wrist, you can pretty much only control it with your right hand&#8230; and what do you do when the right hand&#8217;s busy holding bags, washing dishes, driving a car, wearing gloves, or petting your dog? Mudra has a pretty futuristic solution to that problem &#8211; you use sensors to control the watch without needing to touch it.</p>\n<p>Working on a tech quite similar in outcome to the Google Soli chip found in the Pixel 4, the Mudra is a wristband for the Apple Watch that comes with its set of sensors that pick up hand gestures by measuring nerve activity in your wrist. The Mudra band allows you to use your watch without touching it, but more importantly, it gives you the ability to use your left-hand to control parts of the Watch experience, being able to snooze alarms, accept or reject calls, play/pause/skip music tracks, or even playing an old-fashioned game of Snake. The band picks up directly on gestures sent to your wrist via the motor nerve, almost forming a brain-to-device interface. State-of-the-art electrodes in the band can decode different signals, telling apart a variety of gestures that give you complete control over your watch (fun fact, Mudra translates to &#8216;gesture&#8217; in Sanskrit). The band works with all generations of the Apple Watch, connecting to them via Bluetooth, and batteries inside the Mudra allow it to work for over two days before needing to be charged using a proprietary contact-based charger.</p>\n<p>Designed to be a convenience, but with the potential of being much more, the Mudra band&#8217;s sensor technology has a wide variety of applications. Not only is it great for when your hands are occupied, it&#8217;s also extremely useful for the disabled (who can still send gesture-instructions through their motor nerves), and even offers a great way to interface with a screen without having to look at it, potentially making the Apple Watch safe to use while driving too!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"http://wearabledevices.co.il/\"

Meet Campster &#8211; the most compact, lightweight. durable and portable chair! After selling over 100,000 pieces, intense market analysis, and tonnes of feedback, Copenhagen-based Sitpack refined the camping chair to make one that is truly the king of camping thrones!</p>\n<p>The idea behind this chair is simple &#8211; you can take it anywhere and you can sit anywhere. The company&#8217;s goal is to always create products with multiple usages and timeless design. Constructed from high-end materials, this three-legged chair will let you take a seat wherever you are while ensuring comfort, maneuverability, and stability. Campster&#8217;s one-piece telescoping design uses gravity to unfold and Sitpack&#8217;s trademark &#8220;one-pull&#8221; locking system to keep it sturdily in place!</p>\n<p>&#8220;By using beautifully anodized aluminum we obtain a very exclusive look and feel. Another feature that sets our product apart from most other competitors, is our seat which is readily attached to the seat poles making it a multi-functional seat and protection sleeve &#8211; for safe carrying if you forget the carry bag,&#8221; explains the team on why they decided to enter the saturated market of chairs and disrupt it. Campster&#8217;s height is 43cm/17&#8243; which is not something I&#8217;ve seen in any portable chair. The value it gives to the users is sitting high but packing small &#8211; the all-in-one frame is complete with a ripstop nylon breathable mesh seat to get the seat weight down to 2 lbs &#38; carry capacity up to 300 lbs. &#8220;The simple pivoting arms make for a backrest that will follow you every move, whether you move forward, backward or to the side &#8211; as long as you keep your legs on the ground for support, you can move around freely,&#8221; adds the team.</p>\n<p>It is engineered to be the smallest, lightest, and least restrictive portable chair ever and shows that you don&#8217;t need a bulky chair for it to be comfortable. Campster comes with free accessories like the nylon multi-use carry bag, anti-slip elastopolymer addon feet, and an aluminum carabiner. It is truly a chair for all outdoor adventures right from trekking to tailgating, it works for the practical packer and the lazy hiker!</p>\n<p>Designer: Sitpack</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://campster.kckb.st/e2575a70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click Here to Buy Now: $79</a> <del datetime=\"2020-08-11T10:41:30+00:00\">$129</del> (38% off).

fatigue!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=273840","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273863\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273840/01-tailtalk_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>The first thing that came to my mind when I saw this design was a cat standing in front of the bowl, it takes a long pause and says, &#8220;Welcome to my TailTalk!&#8221; &#8211; now you can&#8217;t unsee it so let&#8217;s &#8216;talk&#8217; about it. TailTalk is a multifunctional pet bowl that happens to have won the Red Dot Award 2020 as well as the Good Design Award 2019, so it certainly solves a problem most pet owners face &#8211; food spillage.</p>\n<p>The innovative bowl takes into account that the pets eat both dry + wet foods for their respective benefits, and this product serves the purpose of holding both instead of having two bowls. The design is intuitive for pets and their owners, both sides of the liner can be used by simply flipping it over. The shallow side holds the wet food and the deeper side is for dry food, this way it prevents odor and minimizes bacterial growth. Shallow depth is chosen for wet food because it contains the moisture and makes it easy to lap up the wet bits while the deeper bowl is chosen for dry food to avoid spilling of crumbs. Clean eating isn&#8217;t just limited to ingredients, to keep the space clean while pets enjoy their meal TailTalk has a gap between the inner and outer shell which works as an anti-overflow tank. I call this gap the food moat!</p>\n<p>Another benefit of the cleverly crafted bowl is that it avoids whisker fatigue. Your cat&#8217;sÂ whiskers are extremely sensitive and can become easily fatigued by unnecessary contact with things like the sides of bowls. So to prevent whisker fatigue, you should make sure your cat&#8217;s food bowls are low and shallow and her water dish is wide &#8211; exactly like TailTalk which also has a gap that further minimizes contact with the sides. The simple design is effective in avoiding food waste and keeping the space hygienic which is healthy for your pets too. It saves you cleaning effort and now there are very slim chances of your pet eating food scattered on the floor that could disrupt their digestion and lead to more cleaning for you.</p>\n<p>Designer:
