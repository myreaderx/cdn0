Now, Indigenous people are exploring how this type of study can be conducted in a way that respects their people and traditions. Meagan Cantwell talks with contributing correspondent Lizzie Wade about a summer workshop for Indigenous scientists that aims to start a new chapter in genomics.\n\nWe’ve known for decades that PCBs—polychlorinated biphenyls—are toxic and carcinogenic. In the 1970s and 1980s, these compounds were phased out of use in industrial and electronic applications, worldwide. But they are still in the environment—in soil and air—and in animal tissues, particularly those of killer whales. These toxic compounds start out at minute levels in tiny organisms, but as the small are eaten by the slightly larger, the PCB concentration increases—from plankton, to fish, to seals—until you are at killer whales with PCB-packed blubber. Ailsa Hall, director of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrews University in the United Kingdom, talks with host Sarah Crespi about her group’s work measuring PCB levels in different killer whale populations and calculating the effect of PCBs on those populations 100 years from now.\n\nIn this month’s book segment, Jen Golbeck interviews Damon Centola about his book How Behavior Spreads: The Science of Complex Contagions.

Researchers have published dozens of papers exploring the unique microorganisms that thrive in this area, while at the same time fighting large agricultural industries draining the precious water from the pools.\n\nDavid Tatnell, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Exeter, talks with host Sarah Crespi about using heat to make sound, a phenomenon known as thermoacoustics. Just like the sound of fire or thunder, sudden changes in temperature can create sound waves. In his team’s paper in Science Advances, Tatnell and colleagues describe a thermoacoustic speaker that uses thin, heated films to make sound. This approach cuts out the crosstalk seen in mechanical speakers and allows for extreme miniaturization of sound production. In the ultrasound range, arrays of thermoacoustic speakers could improve acoustic levitation and ultrasound imaging. In the hearing range, the speakers could be made extremely small, flexible, and even transparent.\n\nThis week’s episode was produced with help from Podigy.\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\nDownload a transcript (PDF)\n\n[Image: David Jaramillo; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f7c23c5103ecd7a1e6473d9fbca5f257","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/de9846a5-714a-4ead-adf7-abec0116e7f5/audio.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598926021351},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","title":"Better hurricane forecasts and spotting salts on Jupiter’s moon Europa","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/0316b7ad-d022-4829-a441-aaea0177641d/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"We’ve all seen images or animations of hurricanes that color code the wind speeds inside the whirling mass—but it turns out we can do a better job measuring these winds and, as a result, better predict the path of the storm.

Cats, not so much. These often-fractious felines tend to balk at strange situations—be they laboratories, MRI machines, or even a slightly noisy fan. Online News Editor David Grimm joins host Sarah Crespi to discuss several brave research labs that have started to work with cats on their terms in order to show they have social smarts comparable to dogs. So far, the results suggest that despite their different ancestors and paths to domestication, cats and dogs have a lot more in common then we previously thought.\n\nAlso this week, host Meagan Cantwell speaks with Greg Erhardt, assistant professor of civil engineering at University of Kentucky in Lexington about the effect of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft on traffic in San Francisco, California. His group’s work showed that when comparing 2010 and 2016 traffic, these services contributed significantly to increases in congestion in a large growing city like San Francisco, but questions still remain about how much can be generalized to other cities or lower density areas.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF) \n\nAds on this show: KiwiCo\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n\n[Image: Thomas Hawk/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 May 2019 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"db472d0bac06f99343b1fb1784470030","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/741dedfe-34b1-4bd7-b560-aaea01776cd0/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598926021352},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","title":"Podcast: Babylonian astronomers, doubly domesticated cats, and outrunning a T.

Rice can survive flooding by fast internodal growth—basically a quick growth spurt that raises its leaves above water. But this growth only occurs in prolonged, deep flooding. How do these plants know they are submerged and how much to grow? Sarah and Susan discuss the mechanisms involved and where they originated.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nDownload a transcript of this episode (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\n[Image: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b77acb01e5d6136e98f96200d0d42a17","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/58aebf7f-b2f0-4be5-a218-aaea01779d44/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598926021353},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","title":"Evolution of skin color, taming rice thrice, and peering into baby brains ","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1eab0cb4-41de-47f4-ab72-aaea01781ea4/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week we hear stories about a new brain imaging technique for newborns, recently uncovered evidence on rice domestication on three continents, and why Canada geese might be migrating into cities, with Online News Editor David Grimm.  \n\nSarah Crespi interviews Sarah Tishkoff of the University of Pennsylvania about the age and diversity of genes related to skin pigment in African genomes.  \n\nListen to previous podcasts.  \n\n[Image: Danny Chapman/Flickr; Music: Jeffrey Cook]\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2f23982087890f74c56c44d92f60f915","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/1eab0cb4-41de-47f4-ab72-aaea01781ea4/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598926021355},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","title":"Earthquakes caused by too much water extraction, and a dog cancer that has lived for millennia","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/dfdb0ee6-d3cd-42d8-8a33-aaea01775ed3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"After two mysterious earthquake swarms occurred under the Sea of Galilee, researchers found a relationship between these small quakes and the excessive extraction of groundwater. Science journalist Michael Price talks with host Sarah Crespi about making this connection and what it means for water-deprived fault areas like the Sea of Galilee and the state of California.\n\nAlso this week, Sarah talks with graduate student Adrian Baez-Ortega from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom’s Transmissible Cancer Group about the genome of a canine venereal cancer that has been leaping from dog to dog for about 8000 years. By comparing the genomes of this cancer from dogs around the globe, the researchers were able to learn more about its origins and spread around the world. They also discuss how such a long-lived cancer might help them better understand and treat human cancers.\n\nThis week’s episode was edited by Podigy.\n\nAds on this week’s show: Science Sessions podcast from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n\nDownload the transcript (PDF)\n\nListen to previous podcasts.\n\nAbout the Science Podcast\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":2276,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d5febf4ce80f787092bb31977790b2fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/dfdb0ee6-d3cd-42d8-8a33-aaea01775ed3/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598926021352},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:07:01","title":"Podcast: The archaeology of democracy, new additions to the uncanny valley, and the discovery of ant-ibiotics","link":"https://traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/95ab13e7-f709-4a58-acad-aaea01775538/a1b48900-28b0-456c-8a48-aaea0178e85c/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=974a9512-19b3-4589-b531-aaea01775557","description":"This week, what bear-mounted cameras can tell us about their caribou-hunting habits, ants that mix up their own medicine, and feeling alienated by emotional robots with Online News Editor David Grimm.
