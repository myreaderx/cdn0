That hollow chamber is what makes the acoustic guitar sound like one (and that&#8217;s why electric guitars don&#8217;t need acoustic chambers) &#8211; the air within the chamber vibrates when you pluck a string, causing resonance, amplifying the sound, almost like cupping your hands in front of your mouth to help amplify your voice. That strategy works for audio everywhere. It&#8217;s why subwoofers are big and boxy, and why bigger phones usually have better speakers (because they have audio chambers built into them).</p><p>It&#8217;s just physically difficult to make smaller, sleeker audio devices sound as good as larger ones, but a clever trick would be to very innovatively use that resonance chamber. That&#8217;s sort of the principle behind the Lytte HarmoniQ&#8217;s design. The TWS earphones&#8217; unique shape comes with a specially designed 3D acoustic chamber that helps make the audio sound richer, with better, more distinct basslines&#8230; while also helping reduce sound distortion as well as providing organic noise isolation of up to -35 db, allowing it to rival the Airpods Pro&#8217;s active noise cancellation tech just through its ergonomic design.</p><p>The amount of careful consideration built into the Lytte HarmoniQ is truly remarkable. Each earphone casing is meticulously 3D printed using DLP printing tech (a feature that allows it to have that unique acoustic chamber shape) and hand-polished to look as remarkable as it does. Just like most smart earphones, the Lytte HarmoniQ support iOS as well as Android integration, with the ability to tap, double-tap, and long-press to control music playback as well as smartphone functions (including summoning the phone&#8217;s voice AI). Bluetooth 5.0 ensures a robust wireless connection, allowing you to walk around the room with your phone a few feet away from you without any impact on quality or latency, and an IPx4 waterproof rating helps make the earphones impervious to sweat or drops of water, so you could exercise in the Lytte HarmoniQ just fine. In fact, its silicon ear tips help secure the earphones carefully in your ear canal, so they don&#8217;t accidentally drop out like AirPods often do.</p><p>The Lytte HarmoniQ earphones (pronounced &#8216;lit harmonic&#8217; if you&#8217;re still wondering) come with a robust charging case that gives it an overall 35 hours of playback. Designed to be a more audio-conscious pair of wireless earphones, the Lytte HarmoniQ focuses all its attention on nailing the details and getting the features right. The compact 3D printed form helps not only ensure a proper fit, it actually positively impacts the sound quality, making the Lytte HarmoniQ rival the sound of earphones from audio giants like Sennheiser or Bang and Olufsen. Minimal audio distortion and passive noise-canceling help sweeten the deal, making the earphones a good pick for people who are audio connoisseurs, while features like IPx4 water resistance, Bluetooth 5.0, and that 35-hour battery life give you exactly everything you&#8217;re looking for in a pair of smart, truly wireless in-ear audio devices.</p><p>Designer: HarmoniQ Labs</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://igg.me/at/lytte-harmoniq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $109</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-06T12:19:38+00:00\">$229</del> (52% off).
