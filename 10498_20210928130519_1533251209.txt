I’m in the Audience Insights Group, and our mission is to help The Times grow by understanding our audience. I currently lead our work for NYT Cooking. I also help teams across The Times with workshop design and meeting facilitation.</p><p><strong>How long have you been at The Times?<br></strong>Just about seven years.</p><p><strong>Most Times employees are working remotely right now. What does working from home look like for you?<br></strong>I live with my family on a relatively quiet street in Manhattan. In these work-from-home days, I’m usually sitting at a table in our living room that doubles as the family weekend craft table. I might be sharing the space with polymer clay, casting resin molds, needle felting tools, X-Acto knives or various types of glue. I love making things and I teach art workshops whenever I can.</p><p>Aside from the creative spark I get from being in the “craft zone,” the second best part of sitting at the craft table is that it’s next to a window that overlooks one of New York City’s treasured sidewalk trees. Over the last 18 months of working from home I have enjoyed watching the birds that stop by “our tree” on their way through Central Park. Other times, the scene is less bucolic: the other day, we were witness to an intense pigeon fight for space on an outside window ledge. The city can be a tough place.</p><p><strong>How do you start your day?<br></strong>My workday usually begins on paper. I am a devoted fan of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-paper-planners/#what-about-hobonichi-planners\">Wirecutter-endorsed</a> Hobonichi planners. Most mornings, before I begin work at the computer, I sit with my planner, a .38mm navy blue gel pen from Muji (seriously the best pen), and a cup of tea (PG Tips, brewed strong, one sugar).</p><p>I enjoy taking this time to think about my day before Slack messages and emails start piling up.</p><p>One thing I have learned over time is that good habits are more likely to stick if you find a way to make them enjoyable. But like so many other things, this often sounds easier than it is.</p><p><strong>What is something you’ve worked on recently?<br></strong>One recent project I led was to understand — and help us build for — the first seconds of a user’s visit to one of our recipe pages. What is the very first thing people look for? What do they need to see before they commit to reading through the rest of the page? (Spoiler: it’s always about timing and ingredients.)</p><p><strong>Tell us about a project you’ve worked on at The Times that you’re especially proud of.<br></strong>For a few years I focused on our global growth efforts, and as part of that, I was on the team that launched “NYT en Español,” a Spanish-language digital publication that was based in Mexico City. We had an amazing team and I’m so proud of the work we did together.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you faced in your career and how did you overcome it? Knowing what you know now, would you do things differently?<br></strong>I have worked in what we now call “digital products” for over 20 years. During that time, I have been a front-end developer, a visual designer, an information architect, a product manager and for the last decade, primarily a user researcher. At every step along the way I have been part of an emerging discipline.</p><p>There’s never been a roadmap for what a long-term career looks like in this space. We are all figuring it out as we go. It’s been fun, but also a challenge. Sometimes I look with envy at friends who have more clearly mapped out professional paths. But I don’t think I would have changed anything along the way.</p><p><strong>What was your first job?<br></strong>In high school, I worked at a frozen yogurt shop in an Atlanta strip mall. A highlight was serving a perfectly swirled frozen yogurt to Maynard Jackson who, at the time, had just finished his third term as the mayor of Atlanta.</p><p>Frozen yogurt is, in my opinion, the best fast food job because you don’t have to fry anything, which means it doesn’t smell bad and the skill of getting that perfect swirl on top of a cone will serve you well whenever you have access to a soft serve ice cream machine at another point in life.</p><p><strong>What is something most people don’t know about you?<br></strong>I think a lot of people know this, but I’m a big fan of taking on experimental side projects. For example, over six months in 2019 I wrote and distributed a monthly zine that included recipes, interviews, contributor essays, illustrations and more, and pulled them into a book that I shared with friends and contributors.</p><p><strong>Do you have any favorite life hacks or work shortcuts?<br></strong>When you’re feeling stuck, stop staring at a screen and switch to paper. Or, find someone to explain what you’re working on and talk out loud about where you’re stuck. These are simple things, but they work.</p><p><strong>What is your superpower?<br></strong>I’m a good listener. As well as being a researcher, I’m also a certified Co-Active Coach. Coaching, like user research, is 90 percent about listening.</p><p><strong>What or who are you inspired by?<br></strong>I love any documentaries or podcasts that go deep into an artist’s creative process. Song Exploder is a particular favorite.</p><p><strong>Complete this sentence: Over time, I have realized __________.<br></strong>That you have to deliberately create the right circumstances to think deeply and clearly. A mentor once told me, “If you do everything right, you just need 45 minutes of thinking a day.” The corollary is that if you don’t make time to think, you won’t have it.</p><p><strong>What is your best advice for someone starting to work in your field?<br></strong>Stay curious. Be helpful. Don’t forget the big picture.</p><h3>More in ‘Meeting’</h3><p><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-kinshuk-varshney-engineering-manager-at-the-new-york-times-5c634beb5fcf\"><em>Meeting… Kinshuk Varshney, Engineering Manager at The New York Times</em></a><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-romello-goodman-senior-software-engineer-at-the-new-york-times-1dc17f683fd2\"><em><br>Meeting… Romello Goodman, Senior Software Engineer at The New York Times</em></a><a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/meeting-kathleen-kincaid-executive-director-for-development-engagement-at-the-new-york-times-39ceb00c1137\"><em><br>Meeting… Kathleen Kincaid, Executive Director for Development &#38;
