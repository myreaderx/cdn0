Cancer Research UK (CRUK)’s entrepreneurship programmes were designed to address the gap between discoveries and clinical impact by nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset in our research community.

As a wide-eyed teenager, pursuing a research career in cancer felt like the best way to put my drive and curiosity to a useful purpose.</p> <p>Ten years later, I have finally completed my undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate training, and while my research has a strong translational aim, I feel I am far removed from producing a drug treatment which will help cancer patients. Even if I was developing a drug, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with it.</p> <p>When the Eureka Virtual School was advertised, I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about what being a translational scientist means exactly and how you go about that journey of translating a “eureka” moment at the bench into a treatment.</p> <p>Attending the school was so different from other conferences or training. To my delight, there were no endless slides of things that I already knew or would forget the moment the next slide appeared. It was about having a conversation with experts from very different fields, ranging from patent law to communication. I learned so much during those 3 days, chief of which was that I didn’t know very much about the reality of taking a discovery through to patients. But now I understand the overall framework and, most importantly, who to ask for help.</p> <p>It was incredibly useful to be able to speak to people from all the different areas of translational medicine, be it from a patient advocacy position, a research group leader position, or a clinical trials management position.</p> <p>It was the most useful training I have ever been to – I think it will change more than just my career path. The virtual school reignited my passion to do translational research.</p> <div id=\"attachment_23594\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"23594\" data-permalink=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2021/09/22/making-the-most-of-your-eureka-moment-getting-from-the-science-to-the-clinic/richard-stephens/\" data-orig-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens.png\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Richard Stephens\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens.png\" data-large-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-23594\" src=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens.png 150w, http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Richard-Stephens-96x96.png 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Richard is in his third decade as a patient advocate.

It’s important to remember that from a patient perspective, the quality of our lives may be just as important to us as the length of it, so coping with treatments is often as important as curing the disease.</p> <p>Time flew, but some of us continued chatting offline and on LinkedIn.

And I am very glad I did – after just a few hours of this virtual school, my expectations had already been fulfilled.</p> <p>The first day kicked off with a lecture about patient advocacy taught by a patient and it was incredibly inspiring. Later, we had sessions on things as essential and diverse as leadership, conflict resolution, mentoring, and intellectual property. More inspiring moments came from the experience in translational approaches of experts such as Dr Sergio Quezada.</p> <p>In only three days, in small groups, we had to leverage our skills to identify unmet clinical needs, research questions, potential inventions and the corresponding IP strategies, and the funding strategy to attract investors.</p> <p>Overall, the Eureka School was a real surprise that introduced the complexities of working translationally brilliantly. After three days, I learned that the challenges in oncology come in the form of unmet clinical needs, and importantly that our efforts must orbit around these needs. The school taught me that as complex as cancer is, diversity is the key.</p> <div id=\"attachment_23596\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"23596\" data-permalink=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2021/09/22/making-the-most-of-your-eureka-moment-getting-from-the-science-to-the-clinic/elisa-heyrman/\" data-orig-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman.png\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Elisa Heyrman\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman.png\" data-large-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-23596\" src=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman.png 150w, http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elisa-Heyrman-96x96.png 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elisa is a final year PhD researcher at Barts Cancer Institute, part of Queen Mary University of London.

I wanted practical advice on how to bring an invention to the clinic. I previously followed a course on intellectual property (IP), but this was only one aspect of translational research. The Eureka Virtual School not only covered IP, but also patient involvement, team development and communication, all in a platform that allowed me to expand my network.</p> <p>Even though it was virtual, the event really helped me to build a network and meet new people to learn from. There was a broad panel of speakers and participants in my network, I now feel more confident that my future research will be translated into the clinic.</p> <p>Another topic emphasised was patient involvement. Before the course, I thought patient involvement should be done at the stage of clinical trials, but it was great to hear how patient involvement can be done early in research. As a PhD researcher working on oncolytic viruses, there are many things I’d like to find out from patients – would they take a virus injection for cancer treatment? How would it make them feel and can we make it more acceptable for them?</p> <p>The course was a real kickstart my journey to learning more about translation.</p> <div id=\"attachment_23597\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"23597\" data-permalink=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2021/09/22/making-the-most-of-your-eureka-moment-getting-from-the-science-to-the-clinic/alison_howe/\" data-orig-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe.png\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"alison_howe\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe.png\" data-large-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-23597\" src=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe.png 150w, http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alison_howe-96x96.png 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alison Howe&#8217;s career has spanned roles in drug development, team leadership and senior management.

We need teams of dedicated patients, clinicians, scientists, lawyers, industry, and government working as partners towards a common goal. To assemble and coordinate such large and diverse teams, a translational scientist must also have a host of specialised skills, including leadership, communication, critical thinking, creativity, and empathy.</p> <p>During the programme, participants come together to embrace new perspectives, challenge assumptions, and learn a different approach to research that puts the patient at its heart. Having gone through the program myself in 2014, I can honestly say the experience was life-changing.</p> <p>I’ve learned so much from the Eureka family. It is my great joy and privilege to continue contributing to these certificate programs, inspiring others in the same way Eureka has inspired me.</p> <div id=\"attachment_23599\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"23599\" data-permalink=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2021/09/22/making-the-most-of-your-eureka-moment-getting-from-the-science-to-the-clinic/marjolein-schaap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap.png\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Marjolein Schaap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap.png\" data-large-file=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-23599\" src=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap.png 150w, http://34p2k13bwwzx12bgy13rwq8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Marjolein-Schaap-96x96.png 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marjolein is a Research Programme Manager in the CRUK Careers and Discovery Research team.</p></div> <h2>Marjolein Schaap: “The unique approach to educating early career researchers about the importance of translational medicine is very inspiring.”</h2> <p>Translating the research that we fund to benefit patients is of huge importance to us and we want our future cancer research leaders to have an opportunity to gain the relevant skills and knowledge to be able to do this.</p> <p>Working with the Eureka Institute was an amazing experience; their unique approach to educating early career researchers about the importance of translational medicine is very inspiring, putting the patient at the heart of everything.</p> <p>I have experienced first-hand how this approach has completely changed some of the participants&#8217; way of thinking about their research, which was incredibly powerful to see.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <div class=\"info-box-full-width-no-bg\"> <p>The Eureka Institute for Translational Medicine focus on delivering training with the aim of building interdisciplinary networks which can inspire, catalyse and sustain translational medicine.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237913/\">evaluation</a> of the first decade of Eureka’s programmes was published in 2018.</p> <p>Participants reported a “paradigm shift” in their scientific knowledge and beliefs.
