State lawmakers in Idaho, Tennessee, and Oklahoma have passed laws “banning”\nCRT, and legislatures in several other states are debating similar measures.\nBut perhaps the single most promising action taken to date was a letter sent\nlast week from Montana State Superintendent Elsie Arntzen to the Montana State\nAttorney General Austin Knudsen asking for a legal opinion on whether CRT\nindoctrination violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/ban-critical-race-theory-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">argued</a> earlier this month in Newsweek, it certainly does. Reflecting on his school’s CRT practices, the lead teacher of Grace Church School <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/audio-shows-grace-church-head-teacher-admitting-were-demonizing-white-people-being-born-1585069\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a>: “We’re demonizing white people for being born.” CRT professors routinely write articles for teachers in mainstream teacher publications like <em>Education Week </em>recommending <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-white-teachers-need-anti-racist-therapy/2020/02\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> “white teachers need a particular type of therapy” to address their “white emotionalities” and to undo “whiteness in education.” </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eden-5_19-2.jpg?x91208\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008601940\"/><figcaption>A protester holds a sign outside a building as the Noblesville school board meets inside on Tuesday, May 4, 2021. Via REUTERS</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who\ndoesn’t instantly understand how morally abhorrent this is need only switch the\nraces. No teacher today is free to say things like\n&#8220;black students are ignorant and therefore I decenter, disrupt and\ndismantle blackness in the classroom.&#8221; Such rank bigotry is (properly)\nillegal under the Civil Rights Act. And yet, CRT adherents routinely talk of\nwhites as inherently privileged oppressors, and speak of a duty to disrupt and\ndismantle “whiteness.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her <a href=\"https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/arntzen-requests-ags-opinion-on-critical-race-theory-in-education/article_2c0436d3-29ce-5657-ba38-9ccd095141fa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">letter</a> to the Montana State Attorney General, State Superintendent Antzen shows a full command of this issue, honing in on perhaps the single most troubling and revealing statement made by the foremost public proponent of CRT ideology, Ibram X. Kendi: “The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntzen points to\ninstances where schools have segregated students or staff by race professional\ndevelopment or student “affinity spaces,” and then shamed students by race.\nAntzen also appropriately notes that lesson plans decrying “whiteness” “may\ncause a racially hostile environment under Title VI” of the Civil Rights Act. This\nall seems so obviously illegal that there should be little doubt what the\nMontana state attorney general will say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One might well\nask: If all of this is already illegal, why are state legislatures moving to\npass more laws about it? The answer, unfortunately, is that the Department of\nEducation’s Office for Civil Rights has signaled that it will not enforce\ntraditional civil rights law. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten has\nherself overseen training accusing white teachers of “spirit murdering” black\nstudents, and the Department of Education’s recently proposed regulation cites\nKendi directly, as well as a teacher training book that declares that\n“colorblindness” in the classroom actually endangers student safety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, then, it will be up to states to protect the civil rights of all children. The slew of laws being proposed and passing through state legislatures are a welcome development. But for these laws to matter, they must be enforced. Other governors and attorneys general should render their own opinions on whether CRT indoctrination violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act — and then prepare to enforce fundamental protections for all students.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"related-items shortcode \"><p><strong>Learn more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/ban-critical-race-theory-now/\">Ban Critical Race Theory now</a> | <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/senate-democrats-voted-to-permit-systemic-racism-in-higher-education/\">Senate Democrats voted to permit systemic racism in higher education</a> | <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/canceled-at-georgetown/\">Canceled at Georgetown</a></p></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/a-new-front-in-the-fight-against-critical-race-theory-in-schools/\">A new front in the fight against Critical Race Theory in schools</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aei.org\">American Enterprise Institute - AEI</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:32:46 +0000","feedId":18304,"bgimg":"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eden-5_19-2.jpg?x91208","linkMd5":"0e60e1b9fa586f83ba2d22631a3af41a","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"John Konicki","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eden-5_19-2.jpg?x91208":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621442247640}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-20 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2021-05-20 00:37:27","feedId":18304,"fetchDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 16:37:27 +0000","fetchMs":87,"handleMs":21,"totalMs":30680,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":24,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"f306b40366a93aa712f78b685bea0f01","hostName":"us-002*","requestId":"56941472f8e24ddc829b94024d9657ea_18304","contentType":"application/rss+xml;
