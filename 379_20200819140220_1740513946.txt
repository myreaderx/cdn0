I'll explain why autoloading is so important and show you how to use Composer for autoloading step by step. I'll also explain the difference between the different kinds of autoloading in Composer.</p><h2>Why Do We Need Autoloading?<br>\n</h2><p>When you build PHP applications, you may need to use third-party libraries. And as you know, if you want to use these libraries in your application, you need to include them in your source files by using <code class=\"inline\">require</code> or <code class=\"inline\">include</code> statements. </p><p>These <code class=\"inline\">require</code> or <code class=\"inline\">include</code> statements are fine as long as you’re developing small applications. But as your application grows, the list of <code class=\"inline\">require</code> or <code class=\"inline\">include</code> statements gets longer and longer, which is a bit annoying and difficult to maintain. The other problem with this approach is that you're loading the entire libraries in your application, including the parts you're not even using. This leads to a heavier memory footprint for your application.</p><p>To overcome this problem, it would be ideal to load classes only when they are actually needed. That's where autoloading comes in. Basically, when you use a class in your application, the autoloader checks if it’s already loaded, and if not, the autoloader loads the necessary class into memory. So the class is loaded on the fly where it’s needed—this is called autoloading. When you’re using autoloading, you don’t need to include all the library files manually; you just need to include the autoloader file which contains the logic of autoloading, and the necessary classes will be included dynamically.</p><p>Later in this article, we'll look at autoloading with Composer. But first, I'll explain how you can implement autoloading in PHP <em>without</em> Composer.<br></p><h2>How Autoloading Works Without Composer<br>\n</h2><p>You might not realize it, but it is possible to implement autoloading in PHP without Composer. The <code class=\"inline\">spl_autoload_register()</code> function is what makes this possible. The <code class=\"inline\">spl_autoload_register()</code> function allows you to register functions that will be put into a queue to be triggered sequentially when PHP tries to load classes that are not loaded yet.</p><p>Let’s quickly go through the following example to understand how it works.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\nfunction custom_autoloader($class) {\n  include 'lib/' . $class . '.php';\n}\n\nspl_autoload_register('custom_autoloader');\n\n$objFooBar = new FooBar();\n?&gt;</pre><p>In the above example, we’ve registered the <code class=\"inline\">custom_autoloader()</code> function as our custom autoloader by using the <code class=\"inline\">spl_autoload_register()</code> function. Next, when you try to instantiate the <code class=\"inline\">FooBar</code> class and it’s not yet available, PHP will execute all the registered autoloader functions sequentially. And thus the <code class=\"inline\">custom_autoloader</code> function is called—it includes the necessary class file, and finally the object is instantiated. For this example, we're assuming the <code class=\"inline\">FooBar</code> class is defined in the <strong>lib/FooBar.php</strong> file.</p><p>Without autoloading, you would need to use the <code class=\"inline\">require</code> or <code class=\"inline\">include</code> statement to include the <code class=\"inline\">FooBar</code> class file. The autoloader implementation is pretty simple in the above example, but you could build on this by registering multiple autoloaders for different kinds of classes.</p><p>In practice, you won't often be writing your own autoloader, though. That's what Composer is for! In the next section, we’ll discuss how to use Composer for autoloading in PHP.</p><h2>How Autoloading Works With Composer<br>\n</h2><p>Firstly, make sure to <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-is-composer-for-php-and-how-to-install-it--cms-35160\" target=\"_self\">install Composer on your system</a> if you want to follow along with the examples. When it comes to autoloading with Composer, there are different methods you could choose from.</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-is-composer-for-php-and-how-to-install-it--cms-35160\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/769/posts/35160/preview_image/web%20dev.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-code\">PHP</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">What Is Composer for PHP and How to Install It</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Sajal Soni</div></a></li></ul><p>Specifically, Composer provides four different methods for autoloading files:</p><ol>\n<li>file autoloading</li>\n<li>classmap autoloading</li>\n<li>PSR-0 autoloading</li>\n<li>PSR-4 autoloading<br>\n</li>\n</ol><p>As per the official Composer documentation, PSR-4 is the recommended way of autoloading, and we’ll go through that in detail in the next section. In this section, we’ll briefly discuss the other three options.</p><p>Before we go ahead, let’s quickly go through the steps that you need to perform when you want to use Composer autoloading.</p><ul>\n<li>Define the <strong>composer.json</strong> file in the root of your project or library. It should contain  directives based on the type of autoloading.</li>\n<li>Run the <code class=\"inline\">composer dump-autoload</code> command to generate the necessary files that Composer will use for autoloading.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Include the <code class=\"inline\">require 'vendor/autoload.php'</code> statement at the top of the file where you want to use autoloading.<br>\n</li>\n</ul><h3>Autoloading: The <code class=\"inline\">files</code> Directive<br>\n</h3><p>File autoloading works similarly to <code class=\"inline\">include</code> or <code class=\"inline\">require</code> statements that allow you to load entire source files. All the source files that are referenced with the <code class=\"inline\">files</code> directive will be loaded every time your application runs. This is useful for loading source files that do not use classes.</p><p>To use file autoloading, provide a list of files in the <code class=\"inline\">files</code> directive of the <strong>composer.json</strong> file, as shown in the following snippet.</p><pre class=\"brush: javascript noskimlinks noskimwords\">{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"files\": [\"lib/Foo.php\", \"lib/Bar.php\"]\n    }\n}</pre><p>As you can see, we can provide a list of files in the <code class=\"inline\">files</code> directive that we want to autoload with Composer. After you create the <strong>composer.json</strong> file in your project root with the above contents, you just need to run the <code class=\"inline\">composer dump-autoload</code> command to create the necessary autoloader files. These will be created under the <strong>vendor</strong> directory. Finally, you need to include the <code class=\"inline\">require 'vendor/autoload.php'</code> statement at the top of the file where you want to autoload files with Composer, as shown in the following snippet.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n \n// code which uses things declared in the \"lib/Foo.php\" or \"lib/Bar.php\" file\n?&gt;</pre><p>The <code class=\"inline\">require 'vendor/autoload.php'</code> statement makes sure that the necessary files are loaded dynamically. <br></p><h3>Autoloading: The <code class=\"inline\">classmap</code> Directive<br>\n</h3><p>Classmap autoloading is an improved version of file autoloading. You just need to provide a list of directories, and Composer will scan all the files in those directories. For each file, Composer will make a list of classes that are contained in that file, and whenever one of those classes is needed, Composer will autoload the corresponding file.</p><p>Let’s quickly revise the <strong>composer.json</strong> file to demonstrate the classmap autoloader.</p><pre class=\"brush: javascript noskimlinks noskimwords\">{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"classmap\": [\"lib\"]\n    }\n}</pre><p>Run the <code class=\"inline\">composer dump-autoload</code> command, and Composer will read the files in the <strong>lib</strong> directory to create a map of classes that can be autoloaded.</p><h3>Autoloading: PSR-0<br>\n</h3><p>PSR-0 is a standard recommended by the PHP-FIG group for autoloading. In the PSR-0 standard, you must use namespaces to define your libraries. The fully qualified class name must reflect the <code class=\"inline\">\\&lt;Vendor Name&gt;\\(&lt;Namespace&gt;\\)*&lt;Class Name&gt;</code> structure. Also, your classes must be saved in files that follow the same directory structure as that of the namespaces.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the following <code class=\"inline\">composer.json</code> file.</p><pre class=\"brush: javascript noskimlinks noskimwords\">{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-0\": {\n            \"Tutsplus\\\\Library\": \"src\"\n        }\n    }\n}</pre><p>In PSR-0 autoloading, you need to map namespaces to directories. In the above example, we’re telling Composer that anything which starts with the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library</code> namespace should be available in the <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library</strong> directory.</p><p>For example, if you want to define the <code class=\"inline\">Foo</code> class in the <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library</strong> directory, you need to create the <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo.php</strong> file as shown in the following snippet:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\nnamespace Tutsplus\\Library;\n\nclass Foo \n{\n    //...\n}\n?&gt;</pre><p>As you can see, this class is defined in the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library</code> namespace. Also, the file name corresponds to the class name. Let’s quickly see how you could autoload the <code class=\"inline\">Foo</code> class.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n \n$objFoo = new Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo();\n?&gt;</pre><p>Composer will autoload the <code class=\"inline\">Foo</code> class from the <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library</strong> directory.</p><p>So that was a brief explanation of file, classmap, and PSR-0 autoloading in Composer. In the next section, we’ll see how PSR-4 autoloading works.</p><h2>How PSR-4 Autoloading Works With Composer<br>\n</h2><p>In the previous section, we discussed how PSR-0 autoloading works. PSR-4 is similar to PSR-0 autoloading in that you need to use namespaces, but you don’t need to mimic the directory structure with namespaces.</p><p>In PSR-0 autoloading, you must map namespaces to the directory structure. As we discussed in the previous section, if you want to autoload the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo</code> class, it must be located at <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo.php</strong>. In PSR-4 autoloading, you can shorten the directory structure, which results in a much simpler directory structure compared to PSR-0 autoloading.</p><p>We’ll revise the example above—see if you can spot the differences.</p><p>Here's what the <strong>composer.json</strong> file looks with PSR-4 autoloading.</p><pre class=\"brush: javascript noskimlinks noskimwords\">{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": {\n            \"Tutsplus\\\\Library\\\\\": \"src\"\n        }\n    }\n}</pre><p>It’s important to note that we’ve added trailing backslashes at the end of namespaces. The above mapping tells Composer that anything which starts with the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library</code> namespace should be available in the <strong>src</strong> directory. So you don’t need to create the <strong>Tutsplus</strong> and <strong>Library</strong> directories. For example, if you request the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo</code> class, Composer will try to load the <strong>src\\Foo.php</strong> file.</p><p>It’s important to understand that the <code class=\"inline\">Foo</code> class is still defined under the <code class=\"inline\">Tutsplus\\Library</code> namespace; it’s just that you don’t need to create directories that mimic the namespaces. The <strong>src\\Foo.php</strong> file contents will be identical to those of the <strong>src\\Tutsplus\\Library\\Foo.php</strong> file in the<strong> </strong>previous section.</p><p>As you can see, PSR-4 results in a much simpler directory structure, since you can omit creating nested directories while still using full namespaces.</p><p>PSR-4 is the recommended way of autoloading, and it’s widely accepted in the PHP community. You should start using it in your applications if you haven’t done so already!</p><h2>Conclusion<br>\n</h2><p>Today, we discussed autoloading in PHP.

framework. </p><p>Do you want to create hybrid apps that work on both Android and iOS? With Ionic, you no longer need to create separate apps for Android and iOS operating systems. Instead, with Ionic, you can create one code base that is compatible with both Android and iOS. </p><p>One great benefit of using Ionic is that you don't need to learn a new language from scratch. Developers can create full-featured mobile apps for Android and iOS using technologies they are already familiar with, like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. <br></p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/ionic-ecommerce-universal-ios-android-ecommerce-store-mobile-app-with-laravel-cms/20757378?s_rank=8\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Ionic eCommerce\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1885/posts/32832/image/Ionic-Ecommerce.jpg\" class=\"loaded\"></a></figure><h2>Top-Selling Ionic App Templates on CodeCanyon</h2><p>Ready to kick-start your Ionic development?

Each of these components has multiple variants for the UI. For example, there are five different UI demos for the grid component. You can pick the one that meets your needs and easily integrate it in your application.</p><p>The UI looks great for each component, and the code has been optimized to give you the best possible performance, without any lag.</p><h2>Free Ionic App Templates and Components<br>\n</h2><p>It is not always possible to find completely developed Ionic app templates for free. Most of the time, you can expect to get individual components for free, like login screens or custom lists. Here are a few free Ionic app components and templates for you to explore.</p><h3>Ionic 4 Custom Color Picker</h3><p>This component will help you quickly add a <a href=\"https://market.ionicframework.com/themes/custome-color-picker\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">custom color picker</a> to your Ionic app. Instructions for installation and usage are given on the download page.</p><h3>Ionic 4 Starter Theme</h3><p>This is a basic <a href=\"https://market.ionicframework.com/themes/ionic4-start-theme\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic 4 starter theme</a> with several pages like login, register, about, and edit profile. It also contains a couple of components like notifications and a popup menu.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Ionic 4 Start Theme\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1251/posts/34763/image/ionic4_free_start_theme.png\" class=\"loaded\"></figure><h3>Beautiful Custom List</h3><p>This <a href=\"https://market.ionicframework.com/themes/beautiful-custom-list\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful custom list</a> is actually a standalone component that you can integrate in your other Ionic apps. As the name suggests, it is simply a list of different items. However, the UI is very appealing.</p><h3>Ionic 3 Multi Purpose Theme</h3><p>This is yet another basic <a href=\"https://market.ionicframework.com/themes/ionic-3-multi-purpose-theme\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Ionic 3 theme</a> that gives you access to common ready-made components and pages. You will get things like a welcome page, a news feed page, and a sidebar with sliding animation.</p><h2>Tips on Getting Started With an Ionic App</h2><p>Even though Ionic makes it a lot easier for people to quickly create apps for both Android and iOS, it can still be a bit challenging for absolute beginners. There are a couple of things that you can do to get started quickly.</p><h3>1. Read the Documentation</h3><p>The best way to learn about Ionic and get help when you are stuck is to read <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the documentation</a>. It provides information about a variety of topics like installation, theming, components, and native APIs.<br></p><h3>2. Try Creating Basic Apps</h3><p>The next step in the right direction would be for you to try to create some basic apps of your own. This could be something simple like a timer or calendar app in the beginning. After that, take a look at free apps created by other users and see the process they followed.</p><h3>3. Start Developing Complete Apps</h3><p>Once you fully understand the basic concepts and have created a few basic apps, it's time to start working on the app you wanted to create in the first place.</p><h2>Build Your Ionic App Now! </h2><p>A fully completed app will have a lot of components, screens, and functionality that will take a lot of time and effort on your part to create from scratch. The Ionic apps and templates <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/tags/ionic?sort=price-asc&amp;term=ionic&amp;view=grid#content\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">available on CodeCanyon</a> will prove a great time-saver for you at this point.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/tags/ionic?sort=sales&amp;term=ionic&amp;view=grid#content\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Ionic Apps on Codecanyon\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1251/posts/34763/image/ionic_codecanyon_bottom.png\" class=\"loaded\"></a></figure><h2>Take Advantage of Ionic Tutorials From Envato Tuts+</h2><p>If you want to improve your skills in building Ionic apps and templates, then check out some of the ever-so-useful <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/categories/ionic\">Ionic tutorials</a> we have on offer!</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--card\">\n<li class=\"roundup-block__content posts__post\"><article><header><a class=\"posts__post-preview\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-ionic-start-with-these-courses-and-tutorials--cms-33989\"><img class=\"posts__post-preview-image posts__post-preview-image--regular\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/769/posts/33989/preview_image/mobile%20learning%20guide.jpg\"></a><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link posts__post-title\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-ionic-start-with-these-courses-and-tutorials--cms-33989\"><h1 class=\"nolinks\">How to Learn Ionic: Start With These Courses and Tutorials</h1></a></header><div class=\"posts__post-teaser\">New to Ionic?

SimpleXML","link":"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/parse-xml-to-an-array-in-php-with-simplexml--cms-35529","description":"<p>In this post, you'll learn how to parse XML into an array in PHP. SimpleXML is a PHP extension that makes this possible.</p><p>In your day-to-day PHP development, sometimes you'll need to deal with XML content. Whether it’s exporting data as XML documents or processing incoming XML documents in your application, it’s always handy to have a library that can perform these operations smoothly. When it comes to dealing with XML in PHP, there are different methods to choose from. In fact, there are different extensions available in PHP that allow you to read and parse XML documents.<br></p><p>PHP’s XML parser is based on James Clark’s expat library, which is a stream-oriented XML library written in C. This XML parser library allows you to parse XML documents, but it’s not able to validate them. It’s event-based and stream-oriented, and thus it’s really useful when you’re dealing with very large XML files—but a little more complicated than it needs to be for small files. <br></p><p>The other option is the SimpleXML extension, which is one of the most popular extensions used by the PHP community to process XML documents. The SimpleXML extension allows you to parse XML documents very easily, just as if you were reading a file in PHP.</p><p>In this article, we’re going to use the SimpleXML extension to demonstrate how you could convert XML content into an array. If you want to follow along with the example in this article, make sure that you’ve installed the SimpleXML extension in your PHP installation.</p><h2>The SimpleXML PHP Extension<br>\n</h2><p>The SimpleXML PHP extension provides a complete toolset which you can use to read, write and parse XML documents in your PHP applications. It’s important to note that the SimpleXML extension requires PHP 5 at a minimum. Also, it requires the libxml PHP extension.</p><p>The SimpleXML extension is enabled by default, but if you want to check if it's enabled in your PHP installation, you can check it quickly by using the <code class=\"inline\">phpinfo()</code> function.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"The phpinfo Function\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/413/posts/35529/image/how-to-convert-xml-to-array-in-php-with-simplexml-phpinfo.png\"></figure><p>As you can see, you should see the SimpleXML section in the output of the <code class=\"inline\">phpinfo()</code> function.</p><p>The SimpleXML extension provides different functions that you could use to read and parse XML content.</p><h4>Loading an XML String or File With SimpleXML</h4><p>For example, if you want to parse the XML file, you can use the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function. The <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function allows you to read and parse the XML file in a single call. On the other hand, if you have an XML string which you want to convert into an XML document object, you can use the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_string()</code> function.</p><p>You could also use the <code class=\"inline\">file_get_contents()</code> function to read the file contents and pass the resulting string to the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_string()</code> function, which eventually parses it into an object. Alternatively, if you prefer the object-oriented way, you could also use the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> class and its utility methods to convert an XML string into an object.</p><p>In this article, we’re going to use the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function to read an XML file, and we’ll see how to convert it into an array. Next, we’ll go through a real-world example to demonstrate how to do this.</p><h2>How to Convert XML to an Array With PHP</h2><p>In this section, we’ll see how you can convert XML content into an array.</p><p>First of all, let’s quickly go through the steps that you need to follow to convert XML content into an array with the help of the SimpleXML extension.</p><ul>\n<li>Read the file contents and parse them. At the end of this step, the content is parsed and converted into the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> object format. We’re going to use the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function to achieve this.</li>\n<li>Next, you need to convert the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> object into a JSON representation by using the <code class=\"inline\">json_encode()</code> function.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Finally, you need to use the <code class=\"inline\">json_decode()</code> function to decode the JSON content so that it eventually generates an array of all documents.<br>\n</li>\n</ul><p>For demonstration purposes, let’s assume that we have an XML file as shown in the following snippet. We’ll call it <strong>employees.xml</strong>. It contains the basic details of all employees. Our aim is to convert it into an array that you could use for further processing.</p><pre class=\"brush: xml noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;   \n&lt;employees&gt;   \n    &lt;employee id=\"1\"&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;John&lt;/name&gt;   \n        &lt;email&gt;john@example.com&lt;/email&gt;\n        &lt;address&gt;\n           &lt;street&gt;3201  Glendale Avenue&lt;/street&gt;\n           &lt;city&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/city&gt;\n           &lt;state&gt;CA&lt;/state&gt;\n        &lt;/address&gt;\n    &lt;/employee&gt;\n    &lt;employee id=\"2\"&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;Mike&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;email&gt;mike@example.com&lt;/email&gt;\n        &lt;address&gt;\n           &lt;street&gt;781  Stroop Hill Road&lt;/street&gt;\n           &lt;city&gt;Duluth&lt;/city&gt;\n           &lt;state&gt;GA&lt;/state&gt;\n        &lt;/address&gt;\n    &lt;/employee&gt;\n&lt;/employees&gt;</pre><p>As you can see, the <strong>employees.xml</strong> file contains the names and emails of employees. It’s important to note that the <code class=\"inline\">employee-id</code> value is passed as an attribute of the <code class=\"inline\">&lt;employee&gt;</code> tag.</p><p>Next, create the <strong>simplexml.php</strong> file with the following contents.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\nlibxml_use_internal_errors(TRUE);\n\n$objXmlDocument = simplexml_load_file(\"employees.xml\");\n\nif ($objXmlDocument === FALSE) {\n    echo \"There were errors parsing the XML file.\\n\";\n    foreach(libxml_get_errors() as $error) {\n        echo $error-&gt;message;\n    }\n    exit;\n}\n\n$objJsonDocument = json_encode($objXmlDocument);\n$arrOutput = json_decode($objJsonDocument, TRUE);\n\necho \"&lt;pre&gt;\";\nprint_r($arrOutput);\n?&gt;</pre><p>Let’s go through the important snippets in the above example to understand how it works.<br></p><h3>Read and Parse the XML File<br>\n</h3><p>Firstly, we’ve used the <code class=\"inline\">libxml_use_internal_errors()</code> function to disable standard libxml errors and enable user error handling. In this way, we can catch the XML errors during parsing and display them in a user-friendly way. This is also really useful in the development phase.<br></p><p>Next, we’ve used the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function to read and parse the <strong>employees.xml</strong> file. The first argument of the <code class=\"inline\">simplexml_load_file()</code> function is a path to the XML file. It’s important to note that you need to adjust this path as needed. In the above example, it’s assumed that the <strong>employees.xml</strong> file is at the same directory level as that of the <strong>simplexml.php</strong> file. If the XML file is parsed successfully, it returns an object of the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> class; otherwise, it returns <code class=\"inline\">FALSE</code>.</p><p>Next, if the <code class=\"inline\">$objXmlDocument</code> variable is set to <code class=\"inline\">FALSE</code>, there was a problem parsing the <strong>employees.xml</strong> file. In that case, we use the <code class=\"inline\">libxml_get_errors()</code> function to get all the errors and display them for debugging purposes. The <code class=\"inline\">$objXmlDocument</code> variable is set to <code class=\"inline\">TRUE</code> if the <strong>employees.xml</strong> file is parsed successfully.</p><h3>Convert the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> Object Into Its JSON Representation<br>\n</h3><p>Next, we’ve used the <code class=\"inline\">json_encode()</code> function to convert the <code class=\"inline\">SimpleXMLElement</code> object into its JSON representation. We’ve stored the JSON string in the <code class=\"inline\">$objJsonDocument</code> variable, as shown in the following snippet.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">$objJsonDocument = json_encode($objXmlDocument);</pre><h3>Decode the JSON String Into an Array<br>\n</h3><p>Finally, we’ve used the <code class=\"inline\">json_decode()</code> function to decode the JSON string data. It’s important to note that we’ve passed <code class=\"inline\">TRUE</code> in the second argument of the <code class=\"inline\">json_decode()</code> function, which converts all objects into associative arrays.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">$arrOutput = json_decode($objJsonDocument, TRUE);</pre><p>Had you not passed <code class=\"inline\">TRUE</code> in the second argument, the <code class=\"inline\">json_decode</code> function would have produced objects of type <code class=\"inline\">StdClass</code> instead of arrays.</p><p>So that's an outline of the whole process. Let’s run the <strong>simplexml.php</strong> file, and you should see the following output.</p><pre class=\"brush: plain noskimlinks noskimwords\">Array\n(\n    [employee] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [0] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                    [@attributes] =&gt; Array\n                        (\n                            [id] =&gt; 1\n                        )\n                    [name] =&gt; John\n                    [email] =&gt; john@example.com\n                    [address] =&gt; Array\n                        (\n                            [street] =&gt; 3201  Glendale Avenue\n                            [city] =&gt; Los Angeles\n                            [state] =&gt; CA\n                        )\n                )\n\n            [1] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                    [@attributes] =&gt; Array\n                        (\n                            [id] =&gt; 2\n                        )\n                    [name] =&gt; Mike\n                    [email] =&gt; mike@example.com\n                    [address] =&gt; Array\n                        (\n                            [street] =&gt; 781  Stroop Hill Road\n                            [city] =&gt; Duluth\n                            [state] =&gt; GA\n                        )\n                )\n        )\n)</pre><p>As expected, the array contains all the documents. As you may have noticed, it has also parsed the <code class=\"inline\">id</code> field, which is attached with each document in the form of an attribute, and you can access it with the <code class=\"inline\">@attributes</code> key, as shown in the above output. Basically, everything is available in the form of key-value pairs.

The WordPress plugin directory includes thousands of free plugins that’ll help you create the site you need. But if you’re looking for more advanced features, a better user interface, or improved support, it’s worth buying premium plugins from authors on <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress\">CodeCanyon</a>.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"CodeCanyon\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/Code%20Canyon.jpg\"></a></figure><p>But sometimes you might need to code your own plugin! This can be more efficient than using a third-party plugin, as you might only need a part of the code provided by those. It also means you can develop a plugin that meets your needs more precisely, or you can customize an existing plugin to adapt it for your site.</p><h2><b>What Do You Need to Make a Plugin?</b></h2><p>To build your own plugin and run it on your WordPress site, you’ll need:<br></p><ul>\n<li>a code editor</li>\n<li>a development WordPress installation with a copy of your live site for testing</li>\n</ul><p>Don't test your plugin on your live site until you know it works!</p><p>If you don’t already have a local WordPress installation, follow our guide to <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-set-up-a-killer-wordpress-testing-environment-locally--net-5065\">copying your site to a local install</a>.

What they all have in common is that they add extra functionality to your site. Types of WordPress plugin include:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>site maintenance plugins</strong> for things like security, performance, or backups</li>\n<li>\n<strong>marketing and sales plugins</strong> for things like SEO, social media, or eCommerce</li>\n<li>\n<strong>content plugins</strong> such as custom post types, widgets, shortcodes, forms, galleries, and video feeds</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API plugins</strong> that work with the WordPress REST API or pull in external content from services like Google Maps</li>\n<li>\n<strong>community plugins</strong> that add social networking features</li>\n</ul><p>…and lots more! For an idea of what plugins can do, check out the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_self\">WordPress plugin directory</a> and the <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/category/wordpress\">CodeCanyon</a> marketplace.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"WordPress Plugin Directory\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/plugin%20directory.jpg\"></a></figure><h2><b>What Goes Into a Plugin? </b></h2><p>Before you get started building your plugin, it’s worth knowing what goes into a plugin. Exactly what the plugin code will look like will depend on your plugin: some are small, with just one plugin file, while others are massive, with multiple include files, scripts, stylesheets and template files. And there are plenty that fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>The elements you’ll probably have in your plugin are:</p><ul>\n<li>the main plugin file (this is essential)</li>\n<li>folders for different file types</li>\n<li>scripts</li>\n<li>stylesheets</li>\n<li>include files to organize the code</li>\n</ul><p>Let’s have a look at each of these.</p><h3><b>The Main Plugin File</b></h3><p>The main plugin file is essential. It will always be a PHP file, and it will always contain commented-out text that tells WordPress about your plugin.</p><p>Here’s an example, from the Akismet plugin:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\n/**\n * @package Akismet\n */\n/*\nPlugin Name: Akismet Anti-Spam\nPlugin URI: https://akismet.com/\nDescription: Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to &lt;strong&gt;protect your blog from spam&lt;/strong&gt;. It keeps your site protected even while you sleep. To get started: activate the Akismet plugin and then go to your Akismet Settings page to set up your API key.\nVersion: 4.1.6\nAuthor: Automattic\nAuthor URI: https://automattic.com/wordpress-plugins/\nLicense: GPLv2 or later\nText Domain: akismet\n*/</pre><p>This tells WordPress what your plugin does, where to find out more about it, and who developed it. It also gives information about the version number and the text domain and path for internationalisation, as well as the license.</p><p>WordPress takes this information and uses it to populate the plugins screen in your site. Here’s how Akismet looks on that screen:</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Akismet in plugins screen\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/Akismet%20in%20plugins%20screen.jpg\"></figure><p>You can see that the information provided in the plugin file is used to populate this entry and provide links.</p><p>Other information about the plugin is contained in the <strong>README.txt</strong> file, which is used to populate the plugin's page in the plugin directory:</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Akismet in plugin directory\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/Akismet%20in%20plugin%20directory.jpg\"></figure><p>The main plugin file will also contain the code that makes the plugin run. Sometimes that will be all the PHP for the plugin, but for larger plugins, there’ll be calls to include files containing extra code. This helps you organize your code and means you don’t have one long disorganized file that’s difficult to work with. I’ll show you how to use include files later in this guide.</p><h3><b>Folder Structure</b></h3><p>While there are no hard and fast rules on how you organize the folders in your plugin, it makes sense to adopt the same structure that other plugin developers use. This will familiarize you with the way other plugins are built and mean that if you share your code in future, it will make sense to other people.</p><p>Folders in your plugin might include:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>css</strong> or <strong>styles</strong> for stylesheets</li>\n<li>\n<strong>scripts</strong> for JavaScript</li>\n<li>\n<strong>includes</strong> for include files</li>\n<li>\n<strong>templates</strong> for template files that your plugin outputs</li>\n<li>\n<strong>assets</strong> for media and other asset files</li>\n<li>\n<strong>i18n</strong> for internationalisation files</li>\n</ul><p>You might find you need to use more folders if your plugin is large or complex. For example, WooCommerce has folders for packages, sample data, and more. These in turn include subfolders for things like blocks and admin files.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"WooCommerce file structure\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/WooCommerce%20file%20structure.jpg\"></figure><h3><b>Scripts and Stylesheets</b></h3><p>If your plugin outputs content that needs styling, either in the front-end or in the admin screens, you may need stylesheets. And if your plugin will use scripts, you’ll need files for these.</p><p>It makes sense to keep these in their own folder, even if you only have one of each. You’ll need to enqueue these scripts and stylesheets using a dedicated function in your main plugin file. I’ll show you how to do this when we’re building the plugin.</p><h3><b>Include Files</b></h3><p>If your plugin needs organisation, you can do this by splitting your code into multiple files, called include files. You then put these files into their own folder and call them in your main plugin file using an <code class=\"inline\">include</code> or <code class=\"inline\">require</code> function.</p><p>This way, you can keep the bulk of your code in a well-organized file structure while your main plugin file remains lean and minimal.</p><p>If your plugin isn’t all that big, you don’t need to use include files: just add your code to the main plugin file. But you might find you need to organize this file and reorder functions within it as you add them, to maintain a logical structure.</p><p>These are the most common elements of a plugin. We’ve seen in the WooCommerce example that there can be many more. Or in smaller plugins there can be many fewer. But as you develop more plugins, you’ll find yourself using these elements more and more.</p><h2><b>How to Run Your Plugin Code: Options</b></h2><p>When you add code to your plugin, it won’t do anything until you activate it in some way. There are a few methods you can use to activate your code or pull in code from WordPress:</p><ul>\n<li>functions</li>\n<li>action and filter hooks</li>\n<li>classes</li>\n</ul><p>Let’s take a look each of these.</p><h3><b>Functions</b></h3><p>Functions are the building blocks of WordPress code. They’re the easiest way to get started writing your own plugins and the quickest to code. You’ll find plenty of them in your themes' files too.</p><p>Each function will have its own name, followed by braces and the code inside those braces.</p><p>The code inside your plugin won’t run unless you call the function somehow. The simplest (but least flexible) way to do that is by directly calling the code in your theme or somewhere else in your plugin.</p><p>Here’s an example function:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">tutsplus_myfunction {\n // code goes here\n}</pre><p>To directly call that function in your theme, you’d simply type <code class=\"inline\">tutsplus_myfunction()</code> in the place in your theme template files where you want it to run. Or you might add it somewhere in your plugin... but you’d also need to activate the code that calls it!</p><p>There are a few limitations of this:</p><ul>\n<li>If the function does something that isn’t just adding content somewhere in a theme template file, you can’t activate it this way.</li>\n<li>If you want to call the function in multiple places, you’ll have to call it again and again.</li>\n<li>It can be hard to keep track of all the places you’ve manually called a function.</li>\n</ul><p>It’s much better practice to call functions by attaching them to a hook.</p><h3><b>Action and Filter Hooks</b></h3><p>By attaching your function to a hook, you run its code whenever that hook is fired. There are two types of hook: action hooks and filter hooks.</p><p>Action hooks are empty. When WordPress comes to them, it does nothing unless a function has been hooked to that hook.</p><p>Filter hooks contain code that will run <em>unless</em> there is a function hooked to that hook. If there is a function, it’ll run the code in that function instead. This means you can add default code to your plugin but override it in another plugin, or you can write a function that overrides default code that’s attached to a filter hook in WordPress itself.</p><p>Hooks are fired in three ways:</p><ul>\n<li>By WordPress itself. The WordPress core code includes hundreds of hooks that fire at different times. Which one you hook your function to will depend on what your function does and when you want its code to run. You can find a list of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/\">WordPress hooks</a> in the developer handbook.</li>\n<li>By your theme. Many themes include action and filter hooks that you can use to add extra content in key places in your website’s design. And all themes will include a <code class=\"inline\">wp_head</code> and <code class=\"inline\">wp_footer</code> hook. Combine these with conditional tags and you can run specific code on certain types of pages in your site.</li>\n<li>By your plugin or other plugins. You might add an action hook to your plugin and then add functions in your include files that attach code to that hook. Or you might write a filter hook and then have a function that overrides its contents under certain circumstances. Alternatively, if you’re creating a plugin to complement another plugin, you can hook your functions to the existing hook in the third-party plugin. I’ve done this with WooCommerce, for example, to customize what’s output on product pages.</li>\n</ul><p>Some of this is more advanced, but with your first plugin, you’ll probably be hooking your functions to an action or filter hook output by WordPress itself, most likely an action hook.</p><h3><b>Classes</b></h3><p>Classes are a way of coding more complex features such as widgets and customizer elements, that make use of the existing WordPress APIs. </p><p>When you write a class in your plugin, you’ll probably be extending an existing class that’s coded into WordPress. This way, you can make use of the code provided by the class and tweak it to make it your own. An example would be the customizer, where you might write a class including a color picker, making use of the color picker UI that’s provided in the existing class for the customizer.</p><p>Using classes is more advanced than functions, and it’s unlikely you’ll do it in your first plugin. To find out more, see our guide to <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-programming-in-wordpress-classes--cms-20021\">classes in WordPress</a>.</p><p>If you do write classes, you’ll still have to use actions or filters to get them to run.</p><h2><b>Plugin Best Practices</b></h2><p>Before you start coding your plugin, it helps to understand <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/best-practices/\">best practices</a> for plugins so your code can be high quality right from the start. </p><p>These include:</p><ul>\n<li>Write your code according to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/\">WordPress coding standards</a>. If you want to submit your plugin to the plugin directory, you’ll have to do this.</li>\n<li>Use comments throughout your code so other people can work with it—and so you remember how your code works when you come back to it in the future.</li>\n<li>Name your functions, hooks, and classes using prefixes so they are unique to your plugin. You don’t want to give a function the same name as another function in a different plugin or in WordPress core.</li>\n<li>Organize your folders logically, and keep your code separated so other people can understand it and so you can add to it over time without it becoming a mess.</li>\n</ul><p>You might think that using best practice isn’t necessary because it’s just you working with the plugin. But your plugin might grow over time, you might let other people use it, or you might sell it. Or you might come back to it in two years and not be able to remember how the code is organized!</p><h2><b>Creating Your First Plugin in 4 Steps</b></h2><p>At last! You have a grounding in how plugins work, and it’s time to roll your sleeves up and create your first plugin. I’m going to take you through the process of creating a simple plugin that registers a custom post type.</p><p>This is a very common use of a plugin, and something you might then build on over time to add custom template files for your custom post type or other functionality.</p><p>I’ll show you the basic code for the plugin and give you an introduction to how you might add to it over time.</p><h3><b>1. Create the Plugin Folder and File</b></h3><p>Even if your plugin is starting out small with just one file, it’s good practice to give it its own folder. Start by creating a folder in your <strong>wp-content/plugins</strong> directory. Inside that, create a PHP file for your plugin.</p><p>Give them both a name that makes sense and includes a prefix. I’m calling my folder <strong>tutsplus-register-post-types</strong> and my file <strong>tutsplus-register-post-types.php</strong>.</p><p>Now open your plugin file and add the commented-out information at the top. You can take mine below and edit it to reflect the fact that this is your plugin, not mine.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">&lt;?php\n/*\nPlugin Name: Tuts+ Register Post Types\nPlugin URI: https://tutsplus.com/\nDescription: Plugin to accompany tutsplus guide to creating plugins, registers a post type.\nVersion: 1.0\nAuthor: Rachel McCollin\nAuthor URI: https://rachelmccollin.com/\nLicense: GPLv2 or later\nText Domain: tutsplus\n*/</pre><p>Now, if you save your file and go to the <strong>Plugins</strong> screen in your development site, you’ll see the plugin on the screen:</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Our plugin on the Plugins screen\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/Our%20plugin%20on%20the%20Plugins%20screen.jpg\"></figure><p>You can activate it if you want, but it won’t do anything yet because you haven’t added any code to it. Let’s do that.</p><h3><b>2. Add Functions</b></h3><p>Now it’s time to write the first function in our plugin. Start by making your plugin and adding the braces which will contain the code. Here’s mine:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">function tutsplus_register_post_type() {\n    \n\t// movies\n\t$labels = array( \n\t\t'name' =&gt; __( 'Movies' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'singular_name' =&gt; __( 'Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'add_new' =&gt; __( 'New Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'add_new_item' =&gt; __( 'Add New Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'edit_item' =&gt; __( 'Edit Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'new_item' =&gt; __( 'New Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'view_item' =&gt; __( 'View Movie' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'search_items' =&gt; __( 'Search Movies' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'not_found' =&gt;  __( 'No Movies Found' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'not_found_in_trash' =&gt; __( 'No Movies found in Trash' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t);\n\t$args = array(\n\t\t'labels' =&gt; $labels,\n\t\t'has_archive' =&gt; true,\n\t\t'public' =&gt; true,\n\t\t'hierarchical' =&gt; false,\n\t\t'supports' =&gt; array(\n\t\t\t'title', \n\t\t\t'editor', \n\t\t\t'excerpt', \n\t\t\t'custom-fields', \n\t\t\t'thumbnail',\n\t\t\t'page-attributes'\n\t\t),\n\t\t'rewrite'   =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'movies' ),\n\t\t'show_in_rest' =&gt; true\n\n\t);\n\tregister_post_type( 'tutsplus_movie', $args );\n\t\t\n}</pre><p>This includes all the labels and arguments for your post type and (crucially) the <code class=\"inline\">register_post_type()</code> function which is provided by WordPress.</p><p>I’ve used <code class=\"inline\">movies</code> as my post type here as I’m creating an imaginary movie review site. You might want to use something different.</p><p>Now, if you save your file and go back to your site, you’ll see that nothing has changed. That’s because you haven’t activated your code. The method we use to activate the function here is by hooking it to an action hook provided by WordPress, the <code class=\"inline\">init</code> hook. When you use a function provided by WordPress (such as <code class=\"inline\">register_post_type</code>), you’ll find that there’s a hook that you should use. You can find details in the WordPress handbook entry for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/\">registering custom post types</a>.</p><p>So let’s add the hook. Under your code, and outside the braces, add this line:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">add_action( 'init', 'tutsplus_register_post_type' );</pre><p>We use the <code class=\"inline\">add_action()</code> function to hook our code to an action hook, with two parameters: the name of the action hook and the name of our function.</p><p>Now try saving your files and going back to your site. You’ll see that the custom post type has been added to your admin menu.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"custom post type in menu\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/custom%20post%20type%20in%20menu.jpg\"></figure><p>Nice!</p><p>Now let’s add an extra function, to register a custom taxonomy. Below the code you’ve written so far, add this:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">function tutsplus_register_taxonomy() {    \n\t\n\t// books\n\t$labels = array(\n\t\t'name' =&gt; __( 'Genres' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'singular_name' =&gt; __( 'Genre', 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'search_items' =&gt; __( 'Search Genres' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'all_items' =&gt; __( 'All Genres' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'edit_item' =&gt; __( 'Edit Genre' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'update_item' =&gt; __( 'Update Genres' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'add_new_item' =&gt; __( 'Add New Genre' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'new_item_name' =&gt; __( 'New Genre Name' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t\t'menu_name' =&gt; __( 'Genres' , 'tutsplus' ),\n\t);\n\t\n\t$args = array(\n\t\t'labels' =&gt; $labels,\n\t\t'hierarchical' =&gt; true,\n\t\t'sort' =&gt; true,\n\t\t'args' =&gt; array( 'orderby' =&gt; 'term_order' ),\n\t\t'rewrite' =&gt; array( 'slug' =&gt; 'genres' ),\n\t\t'show_admin_column' =&gt; true,\n\t\t'show_in_rest' =&gt; true\n\n\t);\n\t\n\tregister_taxonomy( 'tutsplus_genre', array( 'tutsplus_movie' ), $args);\n\t\n}\nadd_action( 'init', 'tutsplus_register_taxonomy' );\n</pre><p>Again, you might want to change the name of your custom taxonomy. Here, I’ve made the taxonomy apply to the post type I’ve just registered (the third parameter of the <code class=\"inline\">register_taxonomy</code> function). If you gave your post type a different name, make sure to edit that bit.</p><p>Now save your file and take a look at your admin screens. When you hover over your post type in the admin menu, you’ll see the new taxonomy.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"custom taxonomy in admin menu\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/227/posts/35454/image/custom%20taxonomy%20in%20admin%20menu.jpg\"></figure><p>You now have a working plugin. Well done!</p><p>Let’s take a look at how you might add to it.</p><h3><b>3. Enqueue Stylesheets and Scripts</b></h3><p>If you need to use custom styling or scripts in your plugin, you could add them right into your plugin file—but that’s not best practice. Instead, you should create stylesheets and scripts as separate files in your plugin folder and enqueue those, using a function provided by WordPress.</p><p>Let’s imagine you want to add styling for your custom post type. You could add this to your theme, but you might want to add some specific styling to the plugin to make the post type stand out from other post types in any theme.</p><p>To do this, you create a new folder inside your plugin folder called <strong>css</strong> (or <strong>styles</strong>, it’s up to you). Inside that folder, create a stylesheet called <strong>style.css</strong>, or you can give it a more specific name for clarity. I’m going to call mine <strong>movies.css</strong>.</p><p>You then need to enqueue that file in your plugin so that it can be used by WordPress. Add this to your main plugin file, above the functions you already have. I like to add enqueuing and includes first in my plugin file so I can see what other files are being activated.</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">function tutsplus_movie_styles() {\n    wp_enqueue_style( 'movies',  plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . ‘/css/movies.css’ );                      \n}\nadd_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', ‘tutsplus_movie_styles' );</pre><p>If you save your file, you won’t see any difference in your admin screens—but if you’ve added posts of the custom post type and your stylesheet includes styling for them, you’ll now see that in the front-end of your site.</p><p>Note that the hook used for enqueuing both stylesheets and scripts is the same: they both use <code class=\"inline\">wp_enqueue_scripts</code>. There isn’t a separate hook for styles.</p><p>Enqueuing scripts works in a very similar way. Follow these steps:</p><ul>\n<li>Add a <strong>scripts</strong> or <strong>js</strong> folder to your plugin folder.</li>\n<li>Save your script files in that folder.</li>\n<li>Enqueue the script in the same way as the stylesheet above, replacing the <code class=\"inline\">wp_enqueue_style()</code> function with <code class=\"inline\">wp_enqueue_script()</code>.</li>\n</ul><h3><b>4. Using Include Files</b></h3><p>Another option as you develop your plugin is to create extra PHP files, known as include files. If you have a lot of these, you might create multiple folders for different types of include file, or you might just create one folder called <strong>includes</strong>.</p><p>There are a few functions you can use to include files, which you’ll find in our comprehensive guide to <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-include-and-require-files-and-templates-in-wordpress--wp-26419\">including and requiring files</a>.</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-include-and-require-files-and-templates-in-wordpress--wp-26419\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cdn.tutsplus.com/wp/authors/legacy/Japh/2012/08/27/preview.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-code\">Creative Coding</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Include and Require Files and Templates in WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Tom McFarlin</div></a></li></ul><p>For example, in our custom post type plugin, we might create some code to vary the way the content of the page is output, using the <code class=\"inline\">the_content</code> filter hook to amend the code being run each time the content is output on a product page.</p><p>Instead of adding this code to the main plugin file, you could add it to a separate file called <strong>movie-content.php</strong> and then write the code in that file for the way the content is output for movies.</p><p>To include this file in your plugin, you add a folder called <strong>includes</strong> to your plugin, and then inside that folder you add the <strong>content-movie.php</strong> file.</p><p>To include that file in your plugin, you add this code at the beginning for the main plugin file:</p><pre class=\"brush: php noskimlinks noskimwords\">include( plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . ‘includes/movie-content.php' );</pre><p>You don’t need to hook this to an action or filter hook—just use the <code class=\"inline\">include_once()</code> function in your plugin file. That will then call the code from the include file as if it was in your main plugin file at that point.</p><h2><b>Taking It Further: Plugin Features</b></h2><p>In this guide, I’ve shown you how plugins are coded and how to get started building a simple plugin.</p><p>Once you’ve got the hang of plugin development, you can build more complex and full-featured plugins to carry out more complex tasks on your site.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some examples.</p><h3><b>Widget Plugins</b></h3><p>Widget plugins involve working with classes but are a good introduction to the topic.

This means that if you switch themes in the future, you still have that functionality. And you can use the plugin on another site running a different theme.</p><p class=\"question\"><b>I’ve added code to my plugin. Why is nothing happening?</b></p><p>This is probably because you haven’t hooked your code to an action or filter hook. Until you do that, nothing will happen.</p><p class=\"question\"><b>When I edit my plugin and check my site, I get a white screen.

Offer a Free Trial</h3><p>Free trials are one of the most effective ways to market <em>anything</em>—and membership websites are no exception. </p><p>Customers like to know exactly what they’re getting before they make a purchase. Giving potential new subscribers a way to experience all of your website’s great membership features, first-hand and for free, can encourage them to make a purchase.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/armember-complete-wordpress-membership-system/17785056\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ARMember Best Membership Plugin For WordPress With Free Trial\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2660/posts/35597/image/ARMember-membership-plugin.jpg\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/armember-complete-wordpress-membership-system/17785056\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ARMember</a> is a WordPress membership management plugin that let's visitors choose a free trial. </figcaption></figure><h3>2. Create Multiple Subscription Levels</h3><p>To get the maximum number of registrations, your membership plans need to appeal to a wide audience. </p><p>Unless you have a specific reason not to, it’s always a good idea to create multiple membership levels—for example, you might offer Bronze, Silver, and Gold subscriptions, or Monthly and Annual plans. For the best results, each membership should offer unique perks, and there should be a considerable difference in pricing.</p><p>If you’re trying to monetize your website, then multiple membership levels can also be a way to increase the average spend per member. If a new customer expresses an interest in a Silver subscription, then you have the opportunity to upsell them a Gold subscription.</p><p>Even after a user has purchased their subscription, there may still be upsell opportunities in the future. In these scenarios, it can often help to present the upsell as an exclusive bonus—for example, if a subscriber's Silver membership is about to expire, then you could offer them a Gold membership at a discounted rate, as a special thank you for being such a loyal customer. </p><h3>3. Keep in Constant Communication With Your Community </h3><p>Today’s typical Internet user has a short attention span, so even after someone purchases a subscription, you’ll need to work hard to keep them engaged with your website.</p><p>Most premium WordPress plugins have features that are designed to help you hold your audience’s attention—for example, both <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/armember-complete-wordpress-membership-system/17785056\">ARMember</a> and <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/youzer-new-wordpress-user-profiles-era/19716647\">Youzer</a> integrate with popular email marketing solutions Mailchimp and Mailster. You can encourage members to visit your website by sending them regular newsletters and email updates about all the new and exciting content they’re missing out on.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/youzer-new-wordpress-user-profiles-era/19716647\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Youzer Best Membership Plugin for WordPress\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2660/posts/35597/image/Youzer-best-membership-plugins-wordpress.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Build and talk with your online community with the <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/youzer-new-wordpress-user-profiles-era/19716647\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Youzer WordPress membership plugin</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Other plugins, such as <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-membership/8746370\">WooCommerce Membership</a> and <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/ultimate-learning-pro-wordpress-plugin/21772657\">Ultimate Learning Pro</a>, allow you to “drip” content to your users. By carefully scheduling content in advance, you can ensure that <em>something</em> is always happening on your website, which will encourage members to get into the habit of regularly checking your site, in the hopes of discovering new content.</p><h3>4. Create a Sense of Community</h3><p>A successful online community needs to <em>feel</em> like a community, so you should try to give subscribers multiple ways to connect with one another.</p><p>As a minimum, visitors should be able to comment on your content and reply to comments left by other members, but you could also allow users to post their own content; view other people’s profiles; create and join groups, and exchange instant messages with other members of the community. </p><p>Many premium WordPress plugins also include features that are inspired by social media—for example, <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login/5958681?_ga=2.209361236.71199192.1575379090-1280144257.1574810364\">UserPro</a> allows members to “follow” each other and view logs of every member’s recent activity, including any new content or comments that this person has posted.  </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login/5958681\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UserPro Member List Plugin\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2660/posts/35597/image/userpro-socials-userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login-5958681.jpg\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login/5958681\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">UserPro</a> lets members of your site connect with each other in meaningful ways.</figcaption></figure><p>By fostering a sense of community, you can encourage members to build an emotional connection to this community, and by extension your website. </p><h2>More WordPress Plugins For Great Websites From Envato Tuts+</h2><p>You now know that plugins can help you create a WordPress membership site.

Elementor","link":"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-404-page-with-wordpress-and-elementor--cms-35555","description":"<p>Spend any amount of time online, and you’ll eventually encounter a 404 page.</p><p>Whether you type a URL incorrectly or click a broken link, a 404 is the Internet’s way of letting you know that the requested page does not exist.</p><p>Even the best website will throw a 404 error from time to time, so why not use this error to your advantage? In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a 404 page that helps you connect with your audience, provides a better user experience, and maybe even secures you a few additional sales!&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll be using the Elementor front-end page builder to create three custom 404 pages, using three different methods—and <em>zero</em> code.&nbsp;</p><p>Elementor has over 5 million active installs, but if you’re completely new to Elementor then I’ll also be covering all the background information you need to build professional and compelling websites with Elementor.</p><h2>What We'll Be Covering<br></h2><p>Links don’t live forever!&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, you may need to move or delete certain pages, or decide to merge related posts into a single page that contains all the information your audience could possibly need.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever the server cannot locate the requested webpage, it’ll display a 404 error. If you don’t add a custom 404 page to your website, then the server will display a stock 404 page—which isn’t exactly the nicest thing to look at.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Every website has a default 404 page but their design often leaves a lot to be desired\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-default.png\"></figure><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to replace your website’s default 404 with a custom webpage, using Elementor. Since Elementor is a flexible tool, we’ll be creating a selection of 404 pages, using all of the following methods:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Create a 404 page using Elementor's Theme Builder</strong>. I'll show you a quick and easy way to create a professionally designed 404 page, using one of Elementor's ready-made templates.</li><li><strong>Design a completely custom 404 page</strong>. Have a specific design in mind? Or want to experiment with a few different potential designs? I'll show you how to build a completely custom 404 page from scratch, by adding text, images, and buttons to a blank template. By the end of this section, you'll have created the following design:</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"In this tutorial Ill show you how to turn a blank slate into a custom 404 page\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-complete-custom-404.png\"></figure><ul><li><strong>Envato Elements Template Kits</strong>.&nbsp;Install a themed collection of templates that contain designs for all the pages your website could possibly need—including the following 404 template:</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Envato features a wide selection of professionally-designed template kits\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-template-kit-envato.jpg\"></figure><h3>Why Your Website <em>Needs</em> a Custom 404 Page<br></h3><p>Elementor’s user-friendly, drag-and-drop editor may take the pain out of webpage design, but creating a custom 404 page <em>still</em> requires time and effort.</p><p>Before we get stuck into Elementor, let’s look at some of the reasons why you should always consider creating your own 404 page.</p><h4>404 Errors Are Inevitable <br></h4><p>Sometimes, you may need to delete a piece of content, relocate a page to a new URL, or merge multiple posts into a single URL.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you should perform regular content audits where you identify and rectify any broken links, but even if you’re proactive about checking your URLs, some 404 errors are completely out of your control.&nbsp;</p><p>Your website will throw a 404 error if a visitor misspells a URL or a typo-prone third party links to a part of your website that never existed in the first place!&nbsp;While you can’t control other people’s mistakes, you can minimize their impact by creating an engaging 404 page.&nbsp;</p><h4>Connect With Your Audience <br></h4><p>A 404 page is an opportunity to express yourself and strengthen your relationship with your audience.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply type \"best 404 pages\" into Google and you’ll find countless round-ups of creative and unusual 404 pages. Why not follow in their footsteps and use your 404 page as an opportunity to show off your sparkling personality?&nbsp;</p><p>You might treat your visitors to a few 404-related puns, put your own spin on a popular meme, or even build something more elaborate, such as a 404 mini-game. Although it’s <em>technically</em> not a 404 page, Google’s \"No internet\" dinosaur game is a good example of how you can transform an error page into something fun and engaging.</p><p>However, your 404 page should always be appropriate for your target audience and your wider website. A humorous 404 page may not be appropriate if your website covers sensitive topics, or if you’re trying to present yourself as a trusted authority.</p><h4>Re-Engage Disengaged Visitors <br></h4><p>There are many different ways that a visitor can arrive at your 404 page, but the end result is always the same: this person expected to access some interesting content, and now they’re staring at an error message. They’re likely to be frustrated and annoyed, and may even be on the verge of giving up on your website entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>A custom 404 page is an opportunity to recapture this person’s interest before they navigate away from your website.</p><p>You can often re-engage a disappointed visitor by featuring&nbsp;navigational controls that promote your website’s most interesting and relevant content. These controls might include menus, carousels, a list of your site’s most popular pages, or a list of recommended posts based on the content they've previously accessed.</p><p>By signposting your website’s most interesting content, your 404 page can encourage visitors to dive back into your website, rather than navigating away from it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Drive Conversions and Close Sales <br></h4><p>Why not use your 404 page as a tool to drive conversions and secure additional sales?&nbsp;</p><p>You could offer a discount, coupon code, or a free <a href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/15-membership-plugins-adding-members-to-your-wordpress-site--cms-30232?_ga=2.218894553.1939968695.1595426321-656173759.1592834457\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">membership subscription</a> as an apology, or even a reward for “finding” your 404 page!</p><p>Alternatively, if you operate an <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-an-amazon-affiliate-website-with-a-woocommerce-affiliate-plugin--cms-33154\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">eCommerce store</a>, then why not add some product recommendations to your 404 page? Bonus points if these recommendations are tailored for the individual visitor.&nbsp;</p><h4>Build Trust With a Consistent Brand Image <br></h4><p>Studies show that once you’re familiar with a company’s branding, you subconsciously start to trust that company. Consistency is the key to consumer confidence, which explains why every Apple store around the world looks eerily similar.</p><p>After investing so much time and effort into designing a website that perfectly reflects your brand, the last thing you want is for a generic 404 page to pop up and completely ruin the mood.</p><p>By creating a custom 404 page, you can deliver a seamless user experience, reinforce your brand, and instill a sense of trust in your target audience.&nbsp;</p><h4>Transform Lost Visitors Into Invaluable Testers<br></h4><p>When it comes to identifying and fixing broken links, why not enlist the help of your audience?</p><p>Simply add a contact form to your 404 page, and your visitors can give you a heads-up about any broken links they discover. You could even provide an incentive for visitors to report 404 errors, such as offering a discount code or a free subscription to your <a href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/15-membership-plugins-adding-members-to-your-wordpress-site--cms-30232?_ga=2.218894553.1939968695.1595426321-656173759.1592834457\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">members-only content</a>.</p><h2>What Is Elementor?<br></h2><p>Throughout this tutorial, we’ll be using Elementor to build advanced page layouts using a simple drag-and-drop editor.&nbsp;</p><p>The core Elementor plugin is free to download and provides access to over 40 basic Elementor widgets and over 30 templates. However, if you invest in a premium plan, then you’ll also get access to Elementor’s:</p><ul><li><strong>Theme Builder</strong>. This allows you to customize your entire WordPress theme, including its header, footer, and archive pages.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Popup Builder</strong>. Popups may get a bad reputation, but the occasional well-placed popup can be a great way to catch the visitor’s attention. Using the Popup Builder, you can design, test, and publish custom popups via the familiar Elementor user interface.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>WooCommerce Builder</strong>. If you’re building an eCommerce store, then the WooCommerce builder provides eCommerce-themed widgets that you can drag and drop into your store, including <strong>Add to Cart</strong>, <strong>Product Rating</strong>, and <strong>Related Products&nbsp;</strong>widgets.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be using <a href=\"https://elementor.com/pricing/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Pro</a>, which at the time of writing was priced between $4.10 and $16.60 per month.</p><p>If you’re using the free Elementor plugin, then this tutorial will show you how to master the Elementor user interface and workflow. However, you <em>will</em> need an <a href=\"https://elementor.com/pricing/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Pro subscription</a> in order to complete all sections of this tutorial.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Install Elementor for WordPress<br></h2><p>Elementor Pro requires the free version of Elementor, so first we need to install and activate this free plugin:</p><ul><li>Log in to your WordPress account, if you haven’t already.&nbsp;</li><li>In WordPress’s left-hand menu, select <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li><li>Search for the <strong>Elementor</strong>&nbsp;plugin.</li><li>When the plugin appears, select <strong>Install Now &gt; Activate</strong>.</li><li>The free version of Elementor has now been added to your WordPress account.</li></ul><p>To upgrade to Elementor Pro:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Head over to the Elementor website, and <a href=\"https://elementor.com/pricing/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">purchase Elementor Pro</a>.</li><li>On the <a href=\"https://my.elementor.com/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor website</a>, log in to your account using the details contained in your purchase confirmation email.&nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Download plugin</strong>. Elementor Pro will now be downloaded as a ZIP file.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"If you havent already setup Elementor then youll need to purchase and download the Elementor Pro plugin\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-download-pro.png\"></figure><ul><li>Head over to your WordPress website.&nbsp;</li><li>In the left-hand menu, select <strong>Plugins &gt; Upload Plugin</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Choose file</strong>&nbsp;and then select the ZIP file that you just downloaded.</li><li>Select <strong>Install Now</strong>.</li><li>When prompted, click <strong>Activate Now</strong>.</li><li>You should now see a message asking you to activate your license; click <strong>Connect &amp; Activate</strong> and select <strong>Activate</strong>.</li><li>Log in to your Elementor account, if prompted.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Elementor Pro is now set up and ready for you to use!&nbsp;</p><h2>Custom 404 Pages Without the Hassle: Elementor's Ready-Made Templates <br></h2><p>Elementor comes with a selection of ready-made templates that you can use as the basis for your WordPress pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Since it’s the easiest way to create a 404 page, we’ll base our first 404 page around one of Elementor’s templates:</p><ul><li>In WordPress’s left-hand menu, select <strong>Templates &gt; Theme Builder</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Single</strong>&nbsp;tab. In Elementor, a single page is usually an individual post.</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Well be creating a single post so select Templates  Theme Builder  Singles\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-create-first-single.png\"></figure><ul><li>Select <strong>Add New Single</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>Template type&nbsp;</strong>dropdown and select <strong>Single</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>Select Post Type</strong>&nbsp;dropdown and select <strong>404 page</strong>.</li></ul><p>Give your template a descriptive name. When naming your template, don’t begin the name with <strong>404</strong>&nbsp;as the resulting permalink will redirect visitors to your homepage and not your 404 page.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"You can name your 404 template anything - just dont start that name with the numbers 404\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-create-template.png\"></figure><p>Click <strong>Create template</strong>. Elementor Pro will now display all the available 404 templates; select the template that you want to use.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"You can use any of Elementor Pros ready-made 404 templates\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-template-library.jpg\"></figure><p>Whenever you choose a template, Elementor will prompt you to import the document settings for that page, which will override any previous settings for your 404 page. Unless you have a specific reason not to, you’ll generally want to import the document settings for your chosen template.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, you have the 404 template open in the Elementor editor.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this is our first taste of Elementor, let’s take a few moments to master the editor’s fundamentals, before we start work on our 404 page.&nbsp;</p><h3>Exploring the Elementor Page Editor <br></h3><p>The Elementor live editor is divided into two sections:&nbsp;</p><h4>1. Live Preview Canvas</h4><p>To the right is the live preview canvas, where you can add widgets such as text, images, and buttons. You can also edit your widgets by changing their size and position, or remove unwanted widgets from your layout.&nbsp;</p><p>You add widgets to a page by placing them inside a wrapped box called a <em>section</em>. If you select a section in the live preview canvas, then Elementor will outline that section using a blue border.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"You can build your page design in the Elementor live frontend editor\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-border-section.png\"></figure><p>Each section contains one or more columns. If you click to select a column, then the live preview editor will outline that column in grey and display an icon in the column’s upper-left corner.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Each section consists of one or more columns which are outlined in a dotted grey line when selected \" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-column-page.png\"></figure><p>If you click to select a widget, then the live preview canvas will outline that widget using a solid blue border.&nbsp;</p><h4>2. Elementor Panel</h4><p>The Elementor Panel contains all the widgets that you can add to your page. Simply find the widget that you want to add, drag it from the Elementor Panel, and then drop it onto the live preview canvas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"To the left side of the screen is the Elementor Panel where youll find all of Elementors ready-made widgets\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-panel.png\"></figure><p>The Elementor Panel also contains various menus, sliders, and other settings that you can use to edit your widgets, such as selecting a new font for your text, adding a border to an image, or adding a color overlay.&nbsp;</p><p>When you select a widget in the live preview canvas, the Elementor Panel will display all the settings that are relevant for the selected widget. For example, if I select the <strong>Title&nbsp;</strong>widget, then the Elementor Panel will display all the settings related to editing text.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"The Elementor Panel updates based on the currently-selected widget\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-title-widget.png\"></figure><h3>Elementor Fundamentals: Building Your First Section <br></h3><p>Let’s look at how you can use the live preview canvas and Elementor panel to create a simple section consisting of multiple columns and widgets:&nbsp;</p><p>Add a new section, by clicking the little <strong>+</strong>&nbsp;button.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Elementor pages are made up of sections \" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-drag-widget-here.png\"></figure><p>Choose a structure for this section, which can either be a single column or multiple columns.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"When you create a section youll need to specify a structure for that section Elementor sections consists or one or multiple columns\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-select-structure.png\"></figure><p>At this point, you have a new section and a column—let’s add some widgets!&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In the Elementor Panel, select the dotted icon in the upper-right corner.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;tab is selected. You should now see a list of all the available widgets.&nbsp;</li><li>Find the widget that you want to use, and drag and drop this widget into your section.&nbsp;</li><li>In the live preview editor, click to select your widget; the Elementor Panel will now display all the settings that you can use to customize this widget.&nbsp;</li><li>Let’s add a second widget! In the Elementor Panel, click to select the dotted icon in the upper-right corner, and make sure the <strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;tab is selected.</li><li>Choose a second widget, and drop it into your section.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Using Elementor you can build complex pages simply by adding widgets to sections\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-basic-section-widgets.png\"></figure><p>You now have a simple section consisting of two widgets. There are a few ways in which you can edit this section:</p><h4>Drag and Drop to a New Location<br></h4><p>You can move this section to a new location.</p><p>Just hover over the section until the live preview canvas outlines the section in blue and displays three handles.

However, to make things more interesting I’ll cover a few widgets that you may want to add to your 404 page, even when you’re using a ready-made template.</p><h3>Help Visitors Navigate Your Site <br></h3><p>If you've already created a few menus for your website,&nbsp;then adding these menus to your 404 page can help create a consistent look and feel.</p><p>Elementor provides a&nbsp;<strong>Navigation menu&nbsp;</strong>widget.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"You can use the Navigation menu widget to create a simple bullet-point menu \" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-navigation-menu.png\"></figure><p>To set up a&nbsp;<strong>Navigation menu</strong>&nbsp;widget:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>In the Elementor Panel, select <strong>Navigation menu</strong>&nbsp;and drop this widget into a section.&nbsp;</li><li>Click to select the navigation menu widget that you just created.</li><li>In the Elementor Panel, open the <strong>Select Menu</strong>&nbsp;dropdown.</li><li>You should now see a list of all the menus you’ve created for your website; select the menu that you want to use.</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Add any of your websites menus to your 404 page using the Navigation menu widget\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-configure-nav-menu.png\"></figure><ul><li>In the <strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;textbox, give this menu an optional title.</li><li>When you’re happy with how your menu is configured, click <strong>Apply</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Alternatively, you can use Elementor’s <strong>New menu</strong>&nbsp;widget.</p><h3>Add a Search Bar <br></h3><p>You can help visitors find <em>exactly </em>the content they're interested in, by adding a search bar to your 404 page.</p><p>You can create a basic search field using Elementor’s <strong>Search</strong>&nbsp;widget.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"You can let visitors search for exactly the content they had in mind using Elementors Search widget\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-search-bar.png\"></figure><p>In the Elementor Panel, find the <strong>Search</strong>&nbsp;widget, drop it onto the desired section, and then click <strong>Apply</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Publishing Your First Custom 404 Page <br></h3><p>Once you’re happy with the changes you’ve made to your template, it’s time to publish your 404 page:</p><ul><li>In the Elementor Panel, select <strong>Publish</strong>.</li><li>In the subsequent popup, open the <strong>Include</strong>&nbsp;dropdown and make sure <strong>404 page</strong>&nbsp;is selected.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"When asked Where do youw ant to display your template select Include 404 page\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-publish-404.png\"></figure><ul><li><p>Click <strong>Save and close</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>You can now see your 404 page in action by deliberately entering an incorrect URL or using the following URL: <a>www.(your-website-url)/404</a>.</p><h2>Designing a 404 Page With Elementor's Theme Builder</h2><p>Perhaps you have a specific vision in mind; maybe you want to ensure your 404 page stands out from the crowd, or maybe you want to experiment with lots of different potential designs? In this section, we’ll build a 404 page from scratch, using Elementor’s Theme Builder.</p><p>Elementor Pro’s Theme Builder lets you customize every part of your WordPress theme, including areas that would normally require you to know CSS and PHP—or have a developer friend who’s willing to help you out!&nbsp;</p><p>Note that in the following screenshots I’m using the <a href=\"https://unblast.com/free-404-error-page-donut-template-ai/\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Donut Template graphic</a>. This resource is free to download, although the designer has a PayPal donation link if you want to thank them for their hard work.</p><p>To create a 404 page using Elementor’s Template Builder, first head over to the main WordPress dashboard. In the left-hand menu, select <strong>Templates </strong>and click&nbsp;<strong>Add New</strong>.</p><p>Open the <strong>Template type</strong>&nbsp;dropdown and select <strong>Single</strong>. Then, in the&nbsp;<strong>Select post type</strong>&nbsp;dropdown, choose <strong>404 page</strong>.</p><p>Give your template a descriptive name and click <strong>Create template</strong>. This will launch Elementor’s template library. Since we’re not using another template as a starting point, just&nbsp;close this window. You should now have a completely blank slate to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>Add your first section by clicking the little <strong>Add New Section</strong>&nbsp;icon. You can now choose a structure for this section; I’m using a single column.&nbsp;</p><p>Click to select the section that you just created and now, in the Elementor Panel, open the <strong>Content width</strong>&nbsp;dropdown and select <strong>Full width</strong>.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Make sure your section takes up the entire width of the screen\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-content-width.png\"></figure><p>Open the <strong>Height</strong>&nbsp;dropdown, and select <strong>Fit to screen</strong>.</p><p>Next, select the Elementor Panel’s <strong>Style</strong>&nbsp;tab.&nbsp;Click to expand the <strong>Background</strong>&nbsp;section. You can now set the background for your 404 page. You can choose from an image, gradient, video, or a solid color. I’ve opted for a plain white background, by selecting <strong>Classic&nbsp;</strong>and then choosing white in the color picker.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have our background sorted, let’s add an image! In the live preview canvas, click the little <strong>+</strong>&nbsp;icon. Then, in the Elementor Panel, find the <strong>Image</strong>&nbsp;widget and drop it onto your section.&nbsp;</p><p>Select the Elementor Panel’s <strong>Content</strong>&nbsp;tab and click <strong>Choose image</strong>&nbsp;and select the image that you want to display as part of your 404 page.&nbsp;You can now use the Elementor Panel to resize your image (I’m using 2048x2048) and change where the image appears within your section.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Use the Elementor Panel to increase or decrease the size of your image widget \" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-building-custom-404.png\"></figure><p>Next, I want to add some text explaining that this is a 404 page. In the Elementor Panel, find the <strong>Heading</strong>&nbsp;widget and drag it&nbsp;towards the section that contains your image; a blue panel should appear, indicating where this widget will appear when dropped.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m adding the <strong>Heading</strong>&nbsp;widget directly below my image.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Add some text to your 404 page by grabbing the Heading widget and dropping it onto your template\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-heading-widget.png\"></figure><p>In the Elementor Panel, make sure the <strong>Content</strong>&nbsp;tab is selected. Then, in the <strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;textbox, enter the text that you want to use.&nbsp;</p><p>You can now use the&nbsp;<strong>Style</strong>&nbsp;tab in the Elementor Panel to change the text’s appearance, including its size and alignment. In this tab, you can change the text’s color and font, add a shadow, and make other stylistic changes. Spend some time experimenting to see what effects you can create.</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Create more beautiful text bya dding effects such as shadows changing the typography or selecting a new color \" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-custom-page404.png\"></figure><p>When you’re happy with your text, reset the Elementor Panel by selecting the dotted icon in its upper-right corner. In the Elementor Panel, find the button widget and drop this widget onto a section; I’m placing my button directly beneath my <strong>Heading&nbsp;</strong>widget.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><img alt=\"Im going to add a button that links through to my homepage\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/369/posts/35555/image/elementor-wordpress-404-page-button.png\"></figure><p>In the Elementor Panel, select the <strong>Content</strong>&nbsp;tab.&nbsp;In <strong>Link</strong>, enter the desired location—for example, I’m linking to my website’s homepage.&nbsp;You can add an optional label to your button using the <strong>Text</strong>&nbsp;field; I’m using <strong>Go home</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can now style your button, e.g. by changing its size and where it’s positioned within the section.&nbsp;Select the Elementor Panel’s <strong>Style</strong>&nbsp;tab and make any subsequent stylistic changes. For example, I’m changing the button’s color to complement the rest of my 404 page.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you’re happy with your 404 page, it’s time to publish:</p><ul><li>In the Elementor Panel, select <strong>Publish</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>Include</strong>&nbsp;dropdown and select <strong>404 page</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Save &amp; Close</strong>.</li></ul><p>Your 404 page is now live! You can see your 404 page in action, either by visiting a URL that you know doesn’t exist or by heading over to <a href=\"https://www.(your-website-url)/404.\">www.(your-website-url)/404</a>.<br></p><h2>Web Design Made Easier, With Template Kits<br></h2><p>Why restrict yourself to one template, when you can install an entire template kit?</p><p>Elementor template kits, found on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/wordpress/compatible-with-elementor\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Envato Elements</a>, are themed collections of templates that provide all the pages your website could possibly need, including the homepage, <strong>Contact Us</strong>&nbsp;page, blog, archive, <strong>About Us</strong>&nbsp;page, and much more.</p><p>If you want to mix and match, then template kits also provide stand-alone blocks that you can drag and drop into your page layouts to create your own unique designs.&nbsp;</p><p>Template kits can take the pain out of designing and building a WordPress website. Simply choose your kit, generate all the required pages, make a few customizations, and then connect these pages together—and congratulations, you have a new website!&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you can use template kits to enhance an existing website, by adding designs and layouts that give your website an entirely new look and feel, with minimal effort.</p><p>Envato Elements provides a wide range of professionally designed template kits, ranging from flexible, multipurpose templates to industry-specific kits that were designed with your niche firmly in mind—whether that’s <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/petcare-pet-boarding-and-care-centre-template-kit-4RAUEW8\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">pet boarding</a>, <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/khubi-dermatologist-skin-care-template-kit-V6MNLC5\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">skincare</a>, <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/dma-digital-marketing-agency-template-kit-JBPWQ3V\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">digital marketing</a>, <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/eis-ice-cream-shop-template-kit-BNJRPYG\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ice cream</a>, or anything in between!&nbsp;</p><p>In my next post, I’ll show you how to create a 404 page using the Envato template kit of your choice. Since we’re working with a full template kit, after completing this section you’ll have access to a range of complementary templates covering all the most common webpages—perfect if you like your new 404 page so much that you decide to expand its design to other areas of your website!&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><p>In this tutorial, I covered three ways that you can use Elementor to build a custom 404 page. If you’ve been following along, then you should now have everything you need to design and publish creative, unique 404 pages that perfectly reflect your website’s branding, help visitors locate interesting content, and maybe even earn you a few additional sales.</p><div class=\"mediafed_ad\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

Use Opt-In Forms</h3><p>One of your biggest assets as an eCommerce store is your email list. Email lists provide a direct connection to your potential and existing customers. By adding opt-in forms to your website, you will be able to collect emails and market with a WooCommerce Mailchimp subscribe list. One effective way to collect emails from this opt-in form is to offer a free download in return for the user's email address. </p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/woochimp-woocommerce-mailchimp-integration/6044286\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"WooChimp Constructing Form\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1809/posts/34341/image/ad.png\"></a><figcaption>Creating an email opt-in form in the WP dashboard for the WooChimp plugin.</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Tag Your Email Subscribers</h3><p>As mentioned, no matter what type of WooCommerce website you are running, you will want to have opt-in forms to collect emails. The user emails collected should then be tagged in your email service provider so you can engage them in a targeted marketing plan in the future. </p><p>For example, if you are running an online clothing store and offer a free coupon for a discount on a pair of jeans, then you should tag the users that sign up on this opt-in form as \"Interested In Jeans.\" Then you can send specific emails on a new release of jeans or other discounts on jeans and the marketing campaign will be much more successful as the user had already shown interest in the jeans that were on your website. <br></p><h3>3. Customize Your Email Templates <br>\n</h3><p>As a business, you will want to take advantage of every opportunity to promote your brand. Every piece of content the customer or potential customer sees should reflect your brand identity. This includes the transactional WooCommerce emails that are sent out. When customizing the transactional emails, you will want to ensure that the company's logo is present as well as the brand's colors and fonts. </p><p>In another tutorial, I show <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-branded-woocommerce-emails-with-email-customizer-plugins--cms-33912\" target=\"_self\">step by step how to create branded WooCommerce emails</a>.</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-branded-woocommerce-emails-with-email-customizer-plugins--cms-33912\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1809/posts/33912/preview_image/Untitled-2.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-code\">WordPress Plugins</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">Create Branded WooCommerce Emails With an Email Customizer Plugin </div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Daniel Strongin</div></a></li></ul><p>While this may seem like only a minor change to the email templates, it will have a huge impact on the customer's perception of your brand.  replace me</p><figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/email-customizer-for-woocommerce/8654473\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"Email Customizer for WooCommerce Customize Email Template\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1809/posts/34341/image/em.png\"></a><figcaption>Customizing the \"received order\" email template</figcaption></figure><h3>4.

Leave contact forms on your website that allow interested leads to sign up and subscribe to your WordPress newsletter.</p><p>The plugin described in this tutorial can make an attractive signup pop-up for your website.</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-newsletter-email-subscription-popup-with-the-convertplus-wordpress-plugin--cms-33106\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1885/posts/33106/preview_image/Newsletter.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-code\">WordPress</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Make a Newsletter Email Subscription Popup With the ConvertPlus WordPress Plugin</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Esther Vaati</div></a></li></ul><h3>2. Do I Need to Know How to Code to Make an Email?</h3><p>Having a background in coding is helpful, but it's not a requirement.

This guide can help you decide which email template will work for you. </p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-guide-to-selecting-email-templates-for-ecommerce--cms-32089\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/30/posts/32089/preview_image/pre.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-webdesign\">Email Templates</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">A Guide to Selecting Email Templates for eCommerce</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Eric Karkovack</div></a></li></ul><h3>3. Why Are My Emails Not Converting?</h3><p>Low conversions can be caused by several reasons. But a lot of the time the cause is generic email content.
