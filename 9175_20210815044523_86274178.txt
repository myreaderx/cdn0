Some of them require a high level of security and protection. And we wanted to step up our game to provide such peace of mind to content teams. This quarter we reinforced this content security, adding:</p><p>1- Option to manually save content when data has not been auto-saved.</p><p>2- Security pop-up when users try to exit a screen that has unsaved information.</p><h4>Content</h4><p>Content production is not only writing. A great piece sometimes has a multiple-step workflow involving edition, designing, information verification, optimization, approval, translation, scheduling, and more. With that in mind, we set out to focus on improvements in all stages of content production. Starting with the redesign of hyperlinks and comment flow. Now, when users add a comment referencing a piece of content, both the comment card and the snippet are highlighted.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9MFVUWd3MpF2iCQ4\" /></figure><h4>Featured Images</h4><p>After all the positive feedback on the Publishing settings, now it is also possible to add featured images to blog posts even if there is no active integration with a blog or CMS.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9PL1pg3XWiByTflJVix2dA.gif\" /></figure><h4>Calendar Update</h4><p>From now on, any content type you create will be showing up in your calendar. Just set up a publishing date for your piece of content and it immediately shows up on your calendar. <br>If you have your final destination integrated (WordPress, Social Media, Hubspot), and your piece has gone through all the steps of the workflow, it gets automatically published.<br>If you haven’t integrated your final destinations, this can still help you visualize everything that is scheduled to happen throughout the month and plan accordingly.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w6MJPBYyXscIKN1OXOF6PQ.gif\" /></figure><h3><strong>Account Settings</strong></h3><p>Workflow’s users use Gravatar to edit their profile icons on the platform. We’ve also added an option into Account Settings that redirect our users to Gravatar to add their profile icon.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SWc_umkLNuAVxLBisgMOKg.gif\" /></figure><p>. . .</p><p><strong>What did you think of the top features for this quarter?</strong></p><p>Got any questions or suggestions for us?
