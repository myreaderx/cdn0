Stuff. Is. The. Sh*t. As a total home manicure fiend, I've tried nearly every nail brand out there — also, as the R29 Shopping team's resident Virgo, I'm naturally obsessed with all things cuticle care. I recently moved apartments which left my nails utterly wrecked and had been previously testing a fancy-pants brand (that will remain unnamed) of cuticle balm when this gem arrived at my door. <br><br>While the fancier stuff was perfectly nice, Hard As Hoof is a third of the price — and even if it weren't, I'd still like it <em>even more</em>. It has a semi-solid buttery texture that you need to emulsify with the heat from your fingers, so I like to scoop out a tiny amount and melt it as I rub it into my nails and cuticles. I also take <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34N0bI4\">vegan biotin</a> to help with splitting and nail growth but, a few weeks in, I already feel like a regular application of this stuff has really made a difference in the look and feel of my nails. <br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart (ASAP)</strong><br /><br /><strong>Onyx Professional</strong> Hard As Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jq1EIr\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996646.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=333&#38;height=500&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=333:500\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" /><figcaption><h3>LAPCOS Foot Mask<br></h3><br>Ever since I first included this precious gem in a previous iteration of the R29 <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-to-buy-with-100-dollars\">Shopping team’s monthly under-$100 MVPs</a>, this $6 foot mask has exploded in popularity (which fills my heart and feet with joy.) This minty treat truly feels like a spa day for your barkin' dogs — it really refreshes their rougher skin like nothing else I've tried. <br><br>They're exactly like a sheet mask, but for your feet: all you need to do is just slip 'em on, wait 10-15 minutes, remove, rub in any excess serum, and enjoy rejuvenated tingly toes.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart (ASAP)</strong><br /><br /><strong>LAPCOS</strong> Foot Mask, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CYqQpg\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9997234.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=3024&#38;height=4032&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=3:4\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" /><figcaption><h3>Korean Exfoliating Washcloth</h3><br>I penned an <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9875274/amazon-korean-exfoliating-washcloths-review\">entire love letter</a> to these viral washcloths. As soon as my story was published, I had people flooding my DMs (and R29 Slack) to profess their love for this true gem. <br><br>As I wrote in my review, I really appreciate how affordable they are — as body scrubs and products for KP can be *really* expensive and not everyone can (or wants to) spend a ton on just one or two products. But even more, I loved how after just one use I noticed touchably smoother skin on my upper arms where my KP bumps are most concentrated – no extra products required. Game.

I have <em>thicc</em> hair (as in two hairdryers going at once in the salon kinda <em>thicc</em>), so post showering I let my hair dry about 90% in an <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-towel-wraps\">Act &#38; Acre microfiber towel</a> before taking this tool to it. The result was super-smooth, shiny hair that was significantly less frizzy than when I just let nature do its thing. After sealing in everything with the cool shot, I just applied a pump of my favorite <a href=\"https://www.ulta.com/bbhairdressers-invisible-oil?productId=xlsImpprod16451024\">Bumble and bumble oil</a> to hydrate the ends. <br><br>A recent viral Tweet claims that the tool contributed to hair breakage, but I have yet to experience that personally after a little over one month's use.

I'm a big fan of dermaplaning add-ons for professional facials, but this was the first time I'd ever attempted it at home. The main benefit of dermaplaning and facial hair removal is that it instantly brightens your complexion; you may not notice an imperceptible layer of hair on your skin, but it can create a slight dullness effect. I'm pretty savvy when it comes to hair removal and can wield epilators, tweezers, and hard wax like it's NBD. An electric trimmer, however, was new territory but I was totally game. <br><br>It visually wasn't that different from the straight razor-type tools that professional estheticians use in spas — and I wasn't that surprised by the vibrating blade aspect. I followed the instructions, holding the trimmer at an angle, and started to make small upward strokes along my cheek (where there's some barely noticeable peach fuzz). I was instantly hooked to the dopamine rush of seeing tiny clumps of blonde-ish hair accumulate, leaving behind touchably smooth skin. I also ran it across my lady 'stache to get rid of any unwanted hair there, too! There are instructions to rinse and clean the blades after use, but I probably won't use the same one more than once for hygiene reasons (it comes with one replacement and then <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lzeztp\">two-packs are $6</a>).<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong><br /><br /><strong>Funstant</strong> Precision Eyebrow Razor Electric Facial Hair Remover, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32E42o5\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996694.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=1500&#38;height=1500&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=1:1\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" /><figcaption><h3>Cure Natural Aqua Gel</h3><br>This <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/japanese-beauty-makeup-products\">J-beauty skin-care find</a> has amassed a rabid fanbase stateside — and now I know why. Since there’s a renewed passion for all things <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9832186/satisfying-beauty-products-quarantine\">gross-but-satisfying beauty products</a> during quarantine, I haven’t been totally surprised to see this pop off across Amazon carts. If you haven’t tried an exfoliating peel gel before, here’s how it works: after cleansing your skin, you towel dry and apply a few pumps of the clear gel directly onto the skin with circular motions; within seconds, you’ll notice tiny pills of greyish (read: dead) skin start to flake off; rinse and voilà, visibly brighter plus touchably softer skin. <br><br>Unlike other <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chemical-peels-at-home\">at-home chemical peels</a> or exfoliating masks, I really love how this gel doesn’t cause any tingling sensation — since, sometimes, that can be too intense for more sensitive skin. In the past, I’ve smuggled this stuff back in my suitcase after visiting family in Tokyo — but now, I’ll take free Prime shipping over a 12-hour plane ride any day. <br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong><br /><br /><strong>Cure</strong> Natural Aqua Gel, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EM7www\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996638.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=500&#38;height=373&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=500:373\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /><figcaption><h3>Baby Foot Original Foot Peel Exfoliator</h3><br><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/baby-foot-peel-review\">The Baby Foot, the myth, the legend</a>. I've been a Baby Foot loyalist for years now — and, honestly, every other <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/03/83906/foot-peel-products\">foot peel</a> out there comes second fiddle. I can barely remember when my last salon pedicure was, but, if you're on the fence about going into the spa, then this peel is a formidable foe against calluses and generally lackluster feet. <br><br>I like to pop the serum-soaked booties on and queue up some Netflix; one hour later, rinse off and play a fun waiting game that lasts about four to six days. After which, you'll begin to notice flakes and/or sheets of skin peeling off and leaving behind a layer of fresh, supple foot skin. (I usually need a little bit of elbow grease to encourage the dead skin to flake off, so sometimes I'll break out my Revlon foot file on the next slide to help get that done.)<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong><br /><br /><strong>Baby Foot</strong> Original Foot Peel Exfoliator - Foot Mask, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WIpRAU\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9997684.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=3024&#38;height=4032&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=3:4\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" /><figcaption><h3>Revlon Pedi Expert</h3><br>If you're noticing a ~<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-foot-care-products\">foot theme</a>~ here, then it's no coincidence. It may be because we're spending more time barefoot in quarantine or it's because we just have a thing for feet. Either way, 2020 has been the year of taking care of our toes and this Revlon cheese grater (as it's affectionately become known amongst the R29 Shopping team) truly obliterated my calluses. <br><br>Within a few passes (don't overdo it so to not damage the skin or cut yourself!), the dry dead skin flakes right off before your eyes.

Out of all the products I signed on to test for this story, this one was the one I was sure would be a total disaster. After all, if I can’t even get a pimple patch to stay on my face 100% of the time, why would a giant foot-shaped sticker? Well, after road-testing this at a socially-distanced weekend at the beach, I am fully eating my words. I wear a size 5 shoe, so you can imagine my complete shock when the Small size lined up with my tiny foot almost perfectly. It was much thinner than I’d expected, which helped it adhere with a seamless fit and feel, and it even held up okay to its waterproof claims after I took a quick dip. Plus, it actually did make a difference in traipsing through hot, rocky sand to get to and from the boardwalk. Would I do it again?

Plus, there's no wrong way to use it: just pop it in your fridge or freezer and leave it there until the morning, noon, or night when you want to run its smooth chilled surface over your face, down your decolletage, or any part of your body.

I have a naturally darker complexion and get <em>really </em>tan if I’m out in the sun for more than ten minutes — my mom is Puerto Rican, we were both just born golden goddesses like J.Lo (at least, I’d like to think so). Anyway, I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this Amazon Choice tanner but, at the very least, I was crossing my fingers that I didn’t end up looking like <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/23/d1/3023d11637009c4a2fefada0a39d2ea4.jpg\">spray-tan-gone-wrong Anne Hathaway</a> in the (highly underrated) 2009 rom-com <em>Bride Wars</em>. <br><br>After showering and buffing my skin with my fave <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9875274/amazon-korean-exfoliating-washcloths-review\">Korean exfoliating washcloth</a>, I whipped out my tanning mitt and started applying a thin layer of the self-tanner onto my skin. I was worried that it would have That Fake Tanner Smell™, but I was pleasantly surprised that it actually smelled kinda nice and cocoa buttery. The formula was white and had the consistency of a thick body lotion, but absorbed onto my skin with large sweeping strokes onto my arms, legs, and chest. Next, I proceeded to stand in my bathroom naked for 15 minutes before putting on an oversized T-shirt to sleep in. Within a half-hour, I was left with very soft and hydrated skin. After watching <em>Selling Sunset</em> and eating dinner, I went to bed on my, ahem, white Brooklinen sheets. To my amazement, there was no transfer whatsoever! And, I woke up to visibly bronzer skin! <br><br>At the end of the day, I probably wouldn't repurchase since I don't self-tan (or real-tan, for that matter). But if you are looking for an affordable swap to your regular tube, then this will definitely get the job done.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong> <strong><em>(*If you use self-tanner)</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Beauty by Earth</strong> Self Tanner with Organic &#38; Natural Ingredients, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2E9BGcQ\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9281836.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=1048&#38;height=1048&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=1:1\" width=\"1048\" height=\"1048\" /><figcaption><h3>Belei Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes<br></h3><br>Do I wish they were biodegradable? Of course. That said, judging it solely on its ability to remove makeup and cleanse my skin, these Belei wipes pass the Amazon beauty gem test with flying colors. <br><br>If I had to judge it blind, I’d never guess that these were just $4.50 a pack: they feel durable, yet not too thick, and the micellar water formula whisks away foundation, lipstick, and any sort of makeup. Yes, including mascara — but, I really prefer not to use wipes around my eyes since it can be easy to pull or tug the delicate skin. These are also thick enough that I cut them in thirds making the whole pack a super-value.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong><br /><br /><strong>Belei</strong> Oil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes (Pack of 2), $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aCZYYs\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996657.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=581&#38;height=1500&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=581:1500\" width=\"581\" height=\"1500\" /><figcaption><h3>Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara</h3><br>I’ve tried <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-drugstore-mascara\">drugstore mascaras</a>, super expensive mascaras, and everything in between. This one is pretty freakin’ good. Since my lashes are naturally long, dark, and curly, I’m all about a mascara that lengthens and defines. This one definitely does that. <br><br>I tried both the regular and <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-waterproof-mascara\">waterproof versions</a>: both were pretty awesome. The waterproof one is slightly less jet-black than the other — and, in typical waterproof form, it took a little bit of elbow grease to take off. Both feature identical comb-like wands that created Bambi-long lashes that were fluttery and feathery (my favorite adjectives to describe eyelashes done right). My only gripe is that unlike more <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9984352/kosas-the-big-clean-mascara-review\">lash-care focused formulas</a>, it tends to wear a bit flaky and stiff.

(And for the record, pricey stuff breaks me out just as often as drugstore products!) However, I couldn’t ignore the, oh, you know, <em>27,000 reviews </em>that laud this $20 serum with the impressive (if true) before-and-after pics to back it up. After trying another <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Vo5RT\">popular vitamin C serum</a> from Amazon that had a really strong paint-fume-like smell that I was not keen to rub on my face, I was excited to give this one a shot. <br><br>Once it arrived, I applied a few drops onto the back of my hand and...nothing, no smell. It was totally clear, too — a good sign! A more skeptical sign: It was spotted on Khloé Kardashian’s Instagram. Questionable. I was still not expecting it to knock my socks off in any way, especially when my <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/01/220850/tatcha-violet-c-brightening-serum-review\">fave brightening serum</a> is over four times what TruSkin’s costs. However, after a week of testing it, I had yet to notice a breakout or irritation of any kind. Since I have some hyperpigmentation as a result of acne scarring, I didn’t expect to see any visible results even after a month of testing it; these things just take a lot of time. I am optimistic, though, that it might be a true diamond in the rough — so, I’m excited to stick with it and see if it rivals my beloved Tatcha.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart</strong> <strong>(but not promising any results on its behalf)</strong><br /><br /><strong>TruSkin Naturals</strong> Vitamin C Serum for Face with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EFCXsH\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996686.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=2560&#38;height=2560&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=1:1\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" /><figcaption><h3>Avarelle Acne Absorbing Cover Patch Hydrocolloid Spot Treatment</h3><br>As someone who’s fully been around the block with all things breakouts, I am somewhat of a connoisseur of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-acne-patch\">clear acne patches</a>. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lumb0e\">CosRx Acne Master Patch</a> is the gold standard.

First impressions: The tagline “Feel your face pulsate!” is kinda intense — but, in the fearless spirit of journalism, I scooped out a tiny amount into a bowl and followed the 1:1 instructions to add a bit of water and apply. <br><br>It was still quite chunky and solid, so I needed to add even more water in order to more easily apply it onto my skin (with a brush, which I highly recommend). The best way I can describe the color and texture is that creepy clay lady in <em>The Shining, </em>which is what my face looked like after I applied it. Per the instructions, I left it on for 20 minutes and...no pulsating? Maybe I have rhino skin, but I didn’t feel any tingling whatsoever. I will say, though, that my skin did feel and look more balanced and less greasy. It was, truthfully, a mess to clean up and I will probably need to Drano my sink now after the couple times I used it.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Skip</strong><br /><br /><strong>Aztec Secret</strong> Indian Healing Clay (Original, Pack of 2), $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fY5My1\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996678.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=500&#38;height=445&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=100:89\" width=\"500\" height=\"445\" /><figcaption><h3>Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (Version 2)</h3><br><em>So</em> much less chunky than the previous version!

Again, no pulsating. I did notice that my skin felt unusually dry the following day and, on any given day, I’m usually very oily. However, this was one was significantly easier to apply and clean up, and for that reason alone I'd recommend buying this one vs. the OG formula.<br><br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Cart (all though I can't say I'm as blown away as others on this product)</strong><br /><br /><strong>Aztec Secret</strong> Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Facial, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30CExCI\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996661.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=1001&#38;height=1001&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=1:1\" width=\"1001\" height=\"1001\" /><figcaption><h3>Beakey Makeup Brush Set</h3><br>Are they the best makeup brushes? Definitely not — there was some shedding even on the first use — but for just $10, I’d feel alright recommending this as a beginner or backup set for travel (when that happens again).<br><br>The set came packaged in a plastic bag with a small card describing each brush. My main gripe was that without any numbering or lettering on each brush, I was solely going off of appearance (and many are similar in size and shape) instead of knowing which brush was which — granted, it doesn’t really matter if it works for whatever you’re applying (especially if you’re not a brush purist anyway, like me). But, I definitely would’ve appreciated some clearer instruction here so I didn’t have to keep this tiny, very misplace-able piece of paper around to consult with each time I used one.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Skip</strong><br /><br /><strong>Beakey</strong> Makeup Brush Set, Premium Synthetic Kabuki (10+2pcs, Bl, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eQ0IKO\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9997171.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=2001&#38;height=2667&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=667:889\" width=\"2001\" height=\"2667\" /><figcaption><h3>Lee Beauty Professional Callus Remover Gel</h3><br>Okay, so I know that Baby Foot and the Revlon foot file appeared a few slides ago and you're probably thinking, <em>\"damn gurl, you're really into foot stuff!\"</em> Well, yes, I am — but, also, this foot-peel-in-a-bottle has some insane customer hype to back it up.<br><br>The reviews, while mostly effusive, also warned that if you don't follow the instructions carefully you risk irritating your skin. Also unlike any other foot product I'd tried, this one recommended that I wear gloves to apply it AND to only dab it onto my calluses — instead of all over, like with Baby Foot. This all made me a little nervous, TBH. But, after reading the bottle many times, I basically memorized the text and parked it on my bathroom floor to begin the process. After soaking my feet and buffing off some skin with my file, I squeezed a tiny amount of the clear and odorless gel onto one rough patch of skin by my big toe (and nowhere else!). I was wary of any stinging or burning sensations, but after five minutes there was nothing. I decided to rinse it off anyway (the absolute max is 10 min, but I definitely wasn't going to do that). After going in again with the foot file, the dead skin flaked right off and left behind very smooth (almost taut) skin. <br><br>I'm a little skeptical of how safe it is to use over the long term (and I'm scared of it accidentally making contact with any broken skin on my foot) — so, while I won't throw out the bottle, I probably won't repurchase it when there are other products I feel much safer using.<br><br><strong>Final Verdict: Skip</strong> <strong><em>(*Or proceed with lots of caution)</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Lee Beauty Professional</strong> 8oz Callus Remover Gel, $, available at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gDyELu\">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9996669.jpg?auto=webp&#38;width=1001&#38;height=1036&#38;quality=85&#38;crop=143:148\" width=\"1001\" height=\"1036\" /><figcaption><h3>Maxsoft Hair Scalp Massager Shampoo Brush</h3><br>As a total stan for scalp care, I was pretty pumped to try this rubbery brush.

So, if nothing else, I thought it would at least feel good. <br><br>However, when I eagerly reached for it after lathering a bit of shampoo in my roots, I felt...nothing? Even though the handle makes it easy to securely grip (like holding a Popsocket) it didn’t really do a better job of working the product into my scalp than my own fingers could.

The star busted out one of our favorite <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/90s-beauty-trends\">’90s throwback</a> looks of the night, reminding us all that she’s not only an actress and musician, but a fashion icon to watch.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palmer’s whole look — <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/90s-makeup-tutorial\">complete with smoky eye makeup and diamond choker</a> — was an homage to the decade of rhinestones, iridescent everything, and grunge, but nothing screamed <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noughties-fashion\">noughties pop culture</a> more than her updo: smoothed back into a high bun of sculpted curls, save two <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/10/8574717/face-framing-hair-color-streak-trend\">face-framing pieces</a> of sleek-straight hair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nostalgic look is clearly having a moment. Both Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion wore similar looks in <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/cardi-b-megan-thee-stallion-wap-cover-90s-updo-hairstyle\">photos promoting their new single “WAP.”</a> But unlike the last time this look was at the height of fashion — in the early ’00s — none of the women incorporated <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9923074/90s-hair-accessories-clueless-movie-trend\">glitter hairspray, stick-on jewels, or butterfly clips</a> into their respective hairstyles.

This challenge turned out to be an opportunity for artists and entertainers, like Palmer, to get creative with their performances — which proved to be groundbreaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/keke-palmer-2020-mtv-vma-beauty-hair-makeup-looks\">first woman of color to host the VMAs</a>, Palmer took the opportunity to speak to the power of music to impact and change culture. “As rough as it’s been, there have been incredible moments of inspiration that have given my generation hope,” the host said in her opening remarks. “We’ve seen heroes going above and beyond…And with the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9850840/black-artist-instagram-black-lives-matter\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, we’ve seen our generation step up, take to the streets, and make sure our voices will be heard. Enough is enough!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let it be known, coronavirus, or no coronavirus, we would like Keke Palmer to host all events from now on for her triple-threat abilities.

News of his impending Tuesday visit was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"quickly decried by state and city leaders (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/31/trump-defying-visit-kenosha-405944\" target=\"_blank\">quickly decried by state and city leaders</a>, including Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who sent a letter to the White House on Sunday asking Trump not to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I, along with other community leaders who have reached out, are concerned about what your presence will mean for Kenosha and our state,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048482-Evers-Trump-Kenosha-Visit-8-30-20.html\">Evers expressed in his letter</a>. “I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing. I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenosha mayor John Antaramian also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/30/907600155/mayor-of-kenosha-wisconsin-gives-update-on-citys-unrest?utm_medium=RSS&#38;utm_campaign=news\">expressed his disapproval with Trump’s visit</a>, noting on Sunday on NPR’s <em>Weekend Edition</em> that “All presidents are always welcome and campaign issues are always going on. But it would have been, I think, better had he waited to have for another time to come.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump, never one to let others stop him from doing what he wants to do, doubled down on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1300420725837266944\">his intent to visit Kenosha</a> on Monday, tweeting “If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now. Also, there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after a teenage white supremacist shot and killed two protestors in Kenosha just last week, it’s hard to imagine what Trump — who has stoked division and promoted white nationalism — would gain from visiting Kenosha at all. Though, if you look at his history, it might make more sense than immediately imaginable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has frequently provoked ongoing anti-racism protestors by calling white nationalists and even <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9771475/michigan-protesters-with-guns-social-distancing-trump\">anti-maskers “good people.”</a> In June, he denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and tweeted a video where <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9887807/trump-white-power-video-tweet-deleted-meaning\">people were clearly yelling “white power.”</a> It makes perfect sense now why Trump would want to go to Kenosha: If there’s a chance for him to fan the flames of chaos, he’ll take it, just as he has with supporting <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218939/james-fields-convincted-murder-charlottesville-heather-heyer\">white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville</a> and beyond, threatening to send the National Guard to major city protests like he did with Portland, and tweeting about retaliating against protesters after being hidden in <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9849319/white-house-lights-off-protest-meaning\">the White House bunker</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This visit will ultimately will benefit Trump, who, during an election season, has literally created a campaign out of the ongoing protests. At the Republican National Convention, the president made frequent remarks about Joe Biden’s role in persisting ongoing violence. The tag line “Biden’s America” was even used in front of images of protests aflame, that were later <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rnc-video-biden-america/\">proven to be from Barcelona</a>. Trump has done the same by attacking local officials of cities that have seen continued protests, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9997025/portland-shooting-trump-ted-wheeler-speech-response\">butting heads with Democratic leaders</a> and labeling them as instigators when they continue to plea for help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence has also tacitly peddled this message, saying at the RNC, “The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-trump-tussle-america-dangerous/story?id=72700925\">Joe Biden’s America</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what, exactly, does this say about Trump’s America? When local leadership are stepping over each other to beg him to stop stoking division and promoting violence, why is he so eager to keep doing it? Perhaps that’s something for voters to consider come November.</p>\n<p><strong>Like what you see?

I was the youngest person there. Healthy, in love, and at </em><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-fertility-questions\"><em>my ‘reproductive peak,’</em></a><em> I never considered that having children would be such a challenge. Motherhood was supposed to come naturally, ‘trying’ was supposed to be fun. Or, so it went for most everyone else. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But for my husband and I, the </em><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fertility-treatment-options-for-women-men\"><em>path to parenthood</em></a><em> would not be nearly so smooth. We encountered major detours and setbacks, then hundreds of needles, pills, and countless doctor’s appointments on our journey. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And now, amid predictions (and jokes) of </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-baby-boom.html\"><em>a post-quarantine baby</em></a><em> boom, we find ourselves anxiously waiting to see if our own family will be included in the forecast. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Age: </strong>27 <br><strong>Location: </strong>Denver, Colorado <br><strong>Occupation: </strong>Insurance Underwriter<br><strong>Household Income: </strong>$265K</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 2016 </strong><br><strong>We Get Married</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wedding-sex-stories\">our wedding night</a>, my husband and I have <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/safe-unprotected-sex-without-a-condom\">unprotected sex</a> for the very first time. The next morning, awash in newlywed optimism – but also, still a bit drunk on champagne and cake – I imagine the sweet baby we could be welcoming in nine months’ time. I’ve just turned 24 and, by today’s standards, it’s young to start a family. But my husband is 37, so we both agree we want to have kids earlier than later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We figure we’ll conceive at some point during our honeymoon over the next two weeks. By the time we get home, I figure there should be enough <a href=\"https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/hcg-levels-71048\">human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</a> in my system to be detectable by a pregnancy test. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While my husband is unpacking, I steal away to the bathroom and unwrap the First Response test I’d pre-purchased and hidden the month before for this occasion. As the screen blinks, my anticipation builds. I can’t wait to surprise my husband. I wonder if I should start pinning cute pregnancy announcement ideas to my Pinterest board, or maybe first get on Amazon and Prime myself a copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Expect-When-Youre-Expecting/dp/0761187480/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/138-6445330-7118844\"><em>What to Expect When You’re Expecting</em></a><em>.</em> My thoughts are interrupted when I notice the blinking stop. The screen yields a cold, unmistakable result: Not Pregnant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $13 </strong>for<strong> </strong>the pregnancy test. Those MFers are expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 2016 to January 2017 </strong><br><strong>We Keep Trying, But No Pressure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel a bit embarrassed still about my naiveté last month. Logically, I know that not every couple becomes <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9673393/friends-pregnant-jealousy-fertility\">pregnant on the first try</a>, but still I figured we’d be one of the lucky ones. And to be fair, up to this point I’ve only ever heard about how <em>easy</em> it is to become pregnant. My high school health class boiled sex education down to a simple equation: Unprotected sex = baby. And shows like <em>Teen Mom</em> and <em>I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant </em>made me believe pregnancy was something that just <em>happened</em> without any planning or effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I reel myself back in and commit to just enjoying my marriage for a few months. “Trying,” but not stressing. My friends are quick to point out that I <em>do </em>seem to have time on my side. This <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/self-care-is-hard\">forced zen</a> is fairly easy to uphold in the first month but it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain as time goes on. Even when I’m trying to relax, I still can’t help but hope. And when your hope is denied enough times, it starts to take an emotional toll. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>February 2017</strong><br><strong>Time to Get Serious</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By this point we’ve been trying for six months — a <a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/a/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pregnant\">benchmark upon which many couples achieve success</a>. I’m becoming disheartened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decide it’s time to do more than just <em>it</em>. I order <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/?tgif=d\">Ovulation Predictor Kits</a> and start monitoring my temperature and cervical mucus. (<em>Cringe. </em>This is the exact point at which our romantic life becomes more scientific than sexy.) My husband — ever the martyr — pledges to do his part by having sex with me every single night. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $30</strong> for ovulation strips, a basic thermometer, and a cute notepad for charting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>March to July 2017</strong><br><strong>What Gives</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say the definition of insanity is repeating the same actions over and over again and expecting a different result.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, by July I’m certifiably crazy. We keep doing everything right and yet, <em>no baby</em>. My life is now organized in an ever-repeating and emotionally exhausting loop of two-week seasons. The first half of every month is spent <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fertility-app\">tracking ovulation</a> and carefully timing intercourse, while the second half involves waiting to determine the outcome of our efforts. Insert <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pregnancy-test-emotional-results\">negative pregnancy test</a>; start cycle all over again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could record my emotions as closely as my<strong> </strong>basal body temperature (<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-ovulation-days-symptoms\">a sign of ovulation</a>) during this time, the chart would look like a seismograph. The needle on my heart oscillates wildly, rising with every slight abdominal twinge (must be implantation pains!), then plummeting upon the arrival of my period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a funny thing happens when you’re <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/relationship-advice-babies-fertility\">worried you may never be able to have a baby</a>: you start to see them everywhere. At every restaurant there’s a babbling little cutie trying to play peekaboo with you from the adjacent booth. An endless parade of strollers passes through your neighborhood, and at every turn there is a radiant woman cradling her bump. Then there are the baby shower invites, celebrity ‘baby watch’ segments in your favorite magazine, and baby formula samples that show up randomly in your mailbox. This all brings about a wrenching, inescapable kind of torment. Contrary to what internet trolls would have you believe, it isn’t just sour grapes over things not working out exactly as you planned, nor is it a feeling of entitlement. It is an earnest sorrow and a sincere form of grief. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband and mom keep trying to reassure me that things will work out, but their words — however well-intended —  feel empty and dismissive. It’s clear neither of them feel the same sense of urgency and prescient dread that I do. I just <em>know</em> something has to be wrong. To try to head off my worry, I guzzle <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pink-Stork-Fertility-Tea-Biodegradable/dp/B0746T6YYB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">fertility tea</a>. I even try going on the Whole30 dietary program, because a number of women in online chat boards I read have claimed going paleo helped their fertility — I figured it couldn’t hurt to try. (Spoiler: It didn’t work for me. It seemed to increase my grocery bill more than my chances of pregnancy.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, friends and extended family members started asking when we were going to have kids. I would have loved an answer to that myself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $78 </strong>for more OPK kits, pregnancy tests, and special tea. Our grocery costs also increased by about <strong>$800</strong> due to the Whole30 — you have to buy a lot of meat and extra ingredients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>August 2017</strong><br><strong>Finally, A Diagnosis</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re approaching a full year of trying — the very specific, but in many ways arbitrary, cutoff in the world of reproductive medicine that will <a href=\"https://resolve.org/what-are-my-options/insurance-coverage/infertility-coverage-state/#:~:text=All%20individual%2C%20group%20and%20blanket,that%20may%20cause%20iatrogenic%20infertility.\">qualify us under insurance</a> for limited diagnostic testing of fertility markers. By the end of this month, if not pregnant, we’ll begin to <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/229032/infertility-stigma-women-fertility-advice\">be considered “infertile.”</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anticipating long waitlists, I start making the calls to schedule preliminary tests for both my husband and me. Mine at a regular OB’s office, his at a reproductive endocrinologist (RE). The RE has an open slot at the end of the month. We decide to pay for <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/06/235245/male-infertility-fathers-day\">a semen analysis</a> out of pocket in order to avoid delays for insurance approval. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is an absolute trooper about it. Even though he isn’t fully convinced we have any real issues, he saddles up and does the damn thing. On the drive home, I’m almost giddy at the prospect of finally having some real insight into our situation. I subject him to a full interrogation: “What was it like in <em>the room?” “</em>Was there ‘entertainment’ provided?” “Was it any good?” “Did you think about me?” “Did you get it all in the cup?” You know, the real hard hitting questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m at work a few days later when he texts to let me know he’s received his results. He types out the three numbers relayed to him by the nurse: Sperm Count 2 million, Morphology 3%, Motility 64%. I immediately input them in Google. Two million strikes me as a lot of sperm, so I’m stunned when the first <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sperm-count/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374591\">hit from the Mayo Clinic reads “Low Sperm Count</a> — Indication for IVF treatment.”  Anything from 15 million to 200 million would have been normal. Two million was critically low. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, maybe because of the way infertility is popularly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=823699591145388\">portrayed as a female-centric issue</a>, I’d always assumed that whatever problem we were having rested with me. I’d honestly only booked my husband an appointment as a matter of procedure to rule him out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I text back: “Hon, let’s talk tonight”. He knows what kind of talk I mean. His reply is a single heart emoji.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $120</strong> for the semen analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September to October 2017</strong><br><strong>Discussing Our Options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the months leading up to our consultation with the RE (the earliest date we could book was in November), my husband and I run through all of the different possible scenarios going forward. We don’t yet have the full <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/40-year-old-woman-ivf-fertility-diaries\">picture of our reproductive health</a> (or lack thereof), but we know enough to realize that a natural, spontaneous conception just won’t be in the cards. Our path will require work, sacrifice, and the abandonment of any and all preconceived dreams we’ve held around how our future children will come to be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We both very much have the heart to adopt. It doesn’t so much matter to us that our child shares our DNA. We just want the opportunity to share our love. But in researching the adoption process, we became quickly discouraged. The average cost of <a href=\"https://www.americanadoptions.com/adopt/why_does_private_adoption_cost_so_much_money#:~:text=The%20cost%20associated%20with%20adoption%20will%20differ%20depending%20on%20the,ranges%20from%20%2440%2C000%20to%20%2450%2C000.\">adopting a newborn in the US is about $43,000,</a> and most couples can expect to spend anywhere from <a href=\"http://www.adopt.org/faqs#:~:text=The%20time%20frame%2C%20like%20the,years%20for%20a%20healthy%20infant.\">two to seven years on waitlists</a> before bringing a baby home. Fostering is much cheaper, of course, but we didn’t feel <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9827987/sia-adopted-two-teen-boys-foster-care\">prepared to parent an older child</a>, and I wasn’t sure I could handle the heartbreak of having to say goodbye to someone I’d come to love (in the likely event they were reunited with their biological family). Plus, in both cases there would be a lengthy pre-approval stage involving applications, home studies, background checks and more. Now 38, my husband is far from being ‘over the hill’, but his age is still a major consideration in all of this. We unfortunately don’t feel we can afford to gamble with what could wind up being years of time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716\">In vitro fertilization</a>, as unappealing as it sounded, was shaping up to be the most feasible course of action for us. My employer’s insurance has an infertility benefit that would significantly cut our costs (we’d be looking at around $20,000 out of pocket), and the average timeline for a single cycle is generally under a year. So long as the doctor felt we had a reasonable chance at success, we were ready to go all in.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>November 2017</strong><br><strong>Straight to IVF </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the incredible fortune of living in a state with two top ranked fertility clinics. I’ve heard high profile celebrities are known to fly in from LA to seek treatment here, and the doctor we are about to see is known for <a href=\"https://fertilitysuccessrates.com/#bystate\">high live birth rates</a> (the gold standard for measuring IVF success). At the office, the doctor  tells us that based on my husband’s sperm count alone there is virtually no way we will ever be able to conceive without medical intervention. We would have had better odds at winning the Powerball, he says. Then he goes on to promise that he will be able to get us pregnant. His overconfidence makes me skeptical, and the way he rattles off his stats and awards makes me feel like we are sitting through a timeshare pitch. Embryo transfers at this clinic have a 65% chance of resulting in a healthy, full term baby. Relative to the <a href=\"https://www.conceptionsrepro.com/fertility-success-rates.html\">roughly 40% average success rate for other practices in the country</a>, this sounds great, but I can’t help but think about the other 35% of couples for whom IVF didn’t work. I bet he gave them this same spiel. Plus, after so many months of failure, it’s hard to believe that our luck will ever change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is nodding enthusiastically though. He’s excited, which is sweet, but I’m annoyed watching him succumb to this doctor’s charms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrap up the meeting, and the doctor escorts us to the next room over. There, a coordinator runs through the logistics of our treatment plan. We would start that very day with blood draws to check for nutrient deficiencies, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/thyroid-info\">thyroid abnormalities</a>, and hormone imbalances. My husband would immediately begin taking supplements to enhance his sperm quality. Then, over the following weeks, I’d undergo several procedures to assess the health of my reproductive tract. If all of that checked out, we would be assigned a nurse and move on to officially start an IVF stimulation cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $550 </strong>for the consultation, blood work, and male fertility supplements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>December 2017 to January 2018</strong><br><strong>Additional Testing and More Issues </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like we just can’t catch a break. Every routine test seems to uncover some new problem that will further complicate our treatment. Blood tests established that <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/female-infertility/expert-answers/hypothyroidism-and-infertility/faq-20058311\">I have hypothyroidism</a> and I’m <a href=\"https://uscfertility.org/fertility-treatments/vitamin-d-fertility/\">vitamin D deficient</a>. That’s a problem because these issues have been found to negatively affect fetal development.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, an <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9469881/having-baby-getting-pregnant-at-40\">hSG (dye test)</a> shows that one of my fallopian tubes is blocked. A hysteroscopy (analysis of the womb via catheterized scope) reveals a uterine lining <a href=\"https://www.scrcivf.com/treatment-options/surgical-fertility-treatments/minimally-invasive/polyps/\">riddled with polyps</a>. My doctor says this could make embryo implantation difficult. Then, the coup de grace: Ultrasound evaluations of my ovaries determine that I have <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/polycystic-ovaries-symptoms#:~:text=PCOS%20symptoms%20are%20related%20to,even%20higher%20levels%20of%20testosterone.\">Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</a> (commonly referred to as PCOS), <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome#:~:text=Having%20PCOS%20does%20not%20mean,you%20can't%20get%20pregnant.\">which can cause issues with ovulation</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we thought was a relatively vanilla case of insufficient sperm turned out to be so, so much more complicated. My husband and I were just a shitstorm of fertility issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend the holiday months on various medications in an effort to correct my underlying conditions before starting <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9841260/fertility-diary-ivf-coronavirus\">the stimulation cycle (also called a stim cycle)</a>,  designed to stimulate the ovaries to produce an abundance of mature eggs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take prescription-dosage vitamin D, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682461.html\">Levothyroxine</a> (a synthetic thyroid hormone), and <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11285-7061/metformin-oral/metformin-oral/details\">Metformin</a> (a diabetes drug that is used off-label to improve symptoms of PCOS). I also take every one of the six different herbal supplements our doctor suggested to improve egg health, because, at this point, why not? My body has already become a giant science fair project. So start popping supps such as <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/q10-facts-products\">CoQ10</a>, and Acai Berry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $1,600</strong> for diagnostic procedures, medications, supplements, and monitoring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>February 2018</strong><br><strong>Stim Cycle </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the first of the month and I’m sitting on the couch half-watching <em>The Office </em>while listening for the doorbell. I’ve taken PTO so that I can be home to sign for the delivery of stim meds being overnighted from a specialty pharmacy in New Jersey. (Fun fact: <a href=\"https://resolve.org/what-are-my-options/medications/specialty-pharmacies/\">IVF meds are so specialized and controlled</a> that they are only available from a select few locations – you can’t just pull into the Walgreens drive thru and order them up.) When the delivery man finally arrives, I open the door and am taken aback by the size of the box being hoisted into my arms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m strangely excited. It’s a complicated, butterfly-in-stomach, Christmas-present-under-the-tree feeling that I hesitate to admit because I don’t want anyone thinking any part of this process is fun — it’s <em>not</em>. This box contains $3,200 worth of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9939161/fertility-diary-covid-19-cant-get-to-embryos\">needles and scary medications</a> I never wanted (certainly, I can think of a million more enjoyable ways to drop this amount of cash – Bahamas vacation, anyone?). But it also contains <em>promise</em>. Even if the contents of this box don’t ultimately bring us a baby, they represent a first big concrete step toward that goal. And even though I’ve already been taking a slew of medications and supplements, something about this giant prescription pinata sitting in front of me makes it all real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our cycle starts the very next morning. My husband is our self-appointed ‘shot-meister’ and is taking the role very seriously. He clears a ‘workspace’, wipes it down with a Clorox wipe (so extra) and organizes all of the meds, syringes, and needles in neat rows. Before we can begin mixing up the first medication, he insists on watching another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-EY_4P67Hs&#38;t=94s\">YouTube instructional video</a>. We have already seen several of these, not to mention that we also attended a multi-hour course at our clinic on how to prepare and administer shots. But he’s adorably nervous and doesn’t want to mess up his big job. So I humor him and watch the video once more for good measure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he decides he feels confident enough to proceed, he pokes the needle through the rubber membrane of the vial and draws up my first dose. “Let’s make a baby” I tell him, pinching my stomach and gesturing for him to start. “Wait” he says, “Kiss first!” He gives me an excited peck and holds the needle over my belly. He wavers for a second, then pushes into the little pooch of skin I’m holding between my fingers. It isn’t nearly as painful as I was expecting, but then again maybe I’m just high on anticipation and nervous energy. Still, though, it’s an intense and strange experience. My husband and I look at each other in bewilderment, then fumble a high-five that ends in a deep hug. We <em>did it</em>. Well, not all of it – not even close – but <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9487744/gay-couples-adoption-ivf-cost-becoming-parents\">the first shot</a> is always the hardest, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next 21 days, my life becomes completely <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9317142/cant-get-pregnant-woman-in-30s-fertility-diaries\">consumed by IVF</a>. Six days a week, for three weeks in a row, I report dutifully to the clinic for ‘monitoring’ appointments, which involve <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/transvaginal-ultrasound#:~:text=A%20transvaginal%20ultrasound%2C%20also%20called,This%20is%20an%20internal%20examination.\">transvaginal ultrasounds</a> to track follicle growth and blood draws to check hormone levels. Yep, more needles! Joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everywhere I go, I keep my phone glued to me, ringer on, waiting for my nurse to call with instructions for the next day’s dosages (it can, and often does, change day-to-day depending on your body’s response). I’m constantly thinking about how to time my day to accommodate for all the shots, pills, and patches that must be taken at different, specific times. Yet I’m also trying to remain competent in my full-time job, be sociable with my friends, and stay somewhat mentally well. It’s an impossible juggle, and one that I’m <a href=\"https://www.winfertility.com/blog/lonely-world-infertility/#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20signs%20that,making%20mountains%20out%20of%20molehills)\">performing mostly solo</a>, which is starting to really weigh on me. My husband, for as wonderfully supportive as he is, does not have to experience this in the same way. His body isn’t <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unexplained-infertility-ivf-costs-process-story\">bloating with hormones</a>, and he doesn’t have to check his modesty at the clinic door while stripping down naked in front of an ultrasound tech every morning. His privates get to stay private. And his work life gets to continue uninterrupted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are plenty of sweet moments where I truly feel we are in this together — when we sneak away from a dinner party to inject a clandestine shot in the bathroom, for example, or when we squeeze each others’ hands while anxiously awaiting the day’s test results — I’m frustrated by the overall inequity of the whole thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By day 20 of the stimulation cycle, I’m emotionally depleted but cautiously optimistic. My body has responded ideally to the medications, and in each of my ovaries there are 15 to 25 follicles of sufficient size to <a href=\"https://www.arcfertility.com/how-is-ivf-done-step-by-step/\">yield mature eggs</a> (which are necessary for the development of embryos). Everything seems to be in check, so the doctor orders us to administer a ‘<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/infertility/trigger-shot\">trigger shot</a>’ at exactly 10 p.m. in preparation for egg retrieval the next day. We are told this is extremely time sensitive, as a premature shot will cause the ovaries to release the eggs, making it impossible for them to be collected. Too late, and the eggs won’t be matured in time. We have to be precise down to the minute. No pressure or anything… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 9:30 we turn off the TV and go to prepare the shot, only to realize that we don’t have the proper syringe for it. This is the only shot that is to be given intramuscularly, so the other needles we have on hand won’t be long enough to substitute. We run around panicked for 25 minutes and still can’t find it, so we decide to use a mixing needle since it is roughly the same length and we are running out of time. This turns out to be a very painful mistake. While the mixing needle is the same <em>length</em> as a regular intramuscular needle, it is about three times as thick. The thing looks like a Halloween prop! Even my husband, who now fancies himself a needle expert, is sweating at the sight of it. But if there’s anything I’ve learned at this point in our IVF journey, it’s that I can (and often have to) do hard things in the name of our family. I buck up, pull my PJ pants down, and lie on top of our dog’s bed with my full moon hanging out. My husband’s phone alarm goes off, signaling that it is ‘time’. He hovers over me and makes a couple false starts before declaring ‘ok, I’m really going to do it this time!’ I can see in the reflection of our fireplace glass that he is closing his eyes while stabbing at me. My whole body clenches while he <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8864875/trying-cant-get-pregnant-31-year-old\">pushes the medication through</a>. <em>Ouch. </em>Remember how I said the first shot is the hardest? Yeah, I take that back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $3,200</strong> for medications, <strong>$7,800 </strong>for our first payment to the clinic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>February 2018</strong><br><strong>Egg Retrieval</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s retrieval day. My ovaries are now <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061025085444.htm\">the size of grapefruits</a> (for reference, a normal woman’s ovaries are about as big as almonds), and I’m ready for them to be deflated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today is also my husband’s time to shine. While I’m under sedation having my eggs surgically removed, he is performing his own sort of, ahem, extraction. Because our <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-ovulation-days-symptoms\">eggs and sperm need to be brought together as quickly</a> as possible to ensure successful fertilization, he must make another trip to the ‘fun room’ to provide a fresh batch of swimmers. Apparently he was very efficient in this task, as he later told me that my mom (who came with us for support) commented “that was fast” when he returned to the main waiting room. I’d like to believe it was because he was thinking of me, but something tells me the doctor-ordered month of abstinence had more to do with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I wake up, the nurse cheerfully tells me they retrieved 44 eggs. This sounds like a lot, and it is, but IVF is a total numbers game. <a href=\"https://www.rmact.com/fertility-blog/ivf-attrition-rate\">Eggs do <em>not</em> equal embryos</a>, and there are myriad factors complicating fertilization rates. From the 44 eggs retrieved, only 26 turned out to be mature, and of those, 18 fertilized normally. On day five post-retrieval, our embryos are frozen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $800</strong> for Anesthesia.<strong> $5,600</strong> for remaining balance with the clinic. This balance is for the transfer cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>March – April 2018</strong><br><strong>“Healing</strong>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our clinic does not do ‘fresh transfers’ (transfers of non-frozen embryos the week after egg retrieval), and I am now grateful for that fact. My belly is somehow even more swollen than before the retrieval, and I look a solid six months pregnant — an unfortunate and ironic circumstance I try desperately to hide under flowy tunics while at work the following week. I’m clearly still physically <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=stim+medication+effect&#38;oq=stim+medication+effect&#38;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.3086j0j4&#38;sourceid=chrome&#38;ie=UTF-8\">reeling from the stim meds</a>, and can’t imagine I’d be in an optimal place to nurture a growing life inside me at this point. As much as it sucks to wait even longer, I get it. I need the time to heal. The doctor places me on birth control pills to regulate my hormones for a couple months before we start a transfer cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell myself I’m going to use the next couple months to pursue joy in other non-baby-making aspects of my life. I’ll heal my soul alongside my body. So I do all the things I haven’t let myself do while focusing on our fertility, plus a few things I’ve always wanted to do just for the heck of it. I go on late nights out with my husband. I go on incredible hikes. I <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8443495/pole-dancing-classes-nyc\">take pole dancing lessons</a>. I drink all the beer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all feels restorative and <em>nice</em>. But to be honest, I don’t know that anything can quite shake the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/infertility-depression-mental-health-anxiety\">anxiety wrought by infertility.</a> It’s always hanging out in your periphery, and even as you try to cast your sights forward you can’t help but be distracted by it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: $300</strong> for ongoing medications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>May to June 2018</strong><br><strong>Transfer Cycle and Transfer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We receive another giant box of meds, along with a busy-looking cycle calendar with dosing instructions, times and appointments. For this cycle there are just eight appointments, and <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/12/133081/ivf-couples-infertile-sketch-comedy-show\">an average two shots a day</a> (verus up to four or five daily during the stim cycle). It seems comparatively manageable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three weeks pass so quickly and otherwise uneventfully that we are almost surprised to finally arrive at the day of transfer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a momentous day, but it begins without fanfare. I wake up, and, for the first time in almost a month, don’t have to worry about shots. I type up a few emails, set my out-of-office message for work, and pull on my go-to leggings. Then I fill a Nalgene with exactly 32 ounces of water (your<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9727789/35-year-old-woman-multiple-miscarriages-ivf\"> bladder must be full </a>in order for the uterus to be tilted in the correct position for catheter insertion) and prepare all our documents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the drive to the clinic, the gravity of what we’re doing hits us and my husband and I both erupt in smiles. I turn the radio up and blast cheesy ‘90s pop. We jam and shout the lyrics while I chug down my water. This is one of the best moments of my life. I look at my husband, grinning and jumping in his seat, and think how much I appreciate him for taking this wild ride for me. Ours is an unorthodox love story, and I hope we make a baby today so that I can one day tell them about it.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the clinic we are led back to the same room where I underwent my egg retrieval a few months before. But this time a nurse hands us a photo of the embryo we are transferring, which is <em>wild</em>. Sure we had to spend ourselves broke for the privilege, but how cool is it that <a href=\"https://www.advancedfertility.com/embryos.htm\">we get a picture of our baby when they’re just five days old</a>? I clutch it to my chest while the doctor guides me into the stirrups. He quickly goes over the procedure and then directs us to look at a large television monitor above his head. There, our embryo comes into focus. What looks like a giant tube enters stage right and sucks the embryo up and out of view. The embryologist emerges from the next room with the catheter (a giant tube) in hand, and slowly transfers it to the doctor’s hands. He expertly inserts it, then tells us to look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5g7L8fbZN4\">the ultrasound monitor</a> by my side. My husband grabs my hand. “Three, Two…” and on “One” we watch a bubble shoot across the screen. It’s instant waterworks. My husband chokes he’s crying so hard, which makes me laugh and pee and cry even harder. The doctor and nurse wish us luck and leave the room. We continue laying there for ten more minutes, smiling through tears with such love for that little embryo.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost</strong>: <strong>$1,740</strong> for medications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>August 2020</strong><br><strong>Here We Are Again </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That tiny bubble on the ultrasound screen became an amazing, vivacious baby girl. She is a naughty little ham and the absolute joy of our life. And we are endlessly grateful to have had success in <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-does-ivf-work-cost\">our first IVF cycle</a> as we realize that not all couples are so fortunate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now midway through another transfer cycle in the hopes of giving our daughter a sibling to complete our family. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s surreal and strange to be going through this all again, especially now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, this round feels familiar. The medications and procedures are the same, and the gracious clinic staff are all happy to see us back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also feels decidedly different. For one, I’m coming into it with a full heart. Thanks to my daughter, I’m not gripped by the same essential fears I felt before. I already have a family, and if I can grow it with the love of another child, all the better, but I’m genuinely so grateful for our little girl that it’s hard to ask for much more. I know I’m lucky. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, of course, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9676132/what-does-coronavirus-feel-like\">there is COVID-19</a>. This pandemic has not only caused deaths and job loss, but interrupted virtually everything for everyone, and <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9892177/iui-ivf-during-coronavirus\">fertility clinics</a> – not to mention patients – are no exception. Our cycle was postponed by several months while all centers for reproductive medicine (deemed nonessential) were mandated to close. Now that we have resumed, there are several cautionary measures in place that considerably alter the day-to-day experience of fertility treatment: Face masks, temperature screenings, and magazine-free waiting rooms are minor, yet eerie reminders of our changed situation. More significant is the fact that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9778839/ivf-cancelled-during-coronavirus\">all appointments must be attended alone</a>. This makes an already lonely experience even more isolating. I worry that all of the small, special, redemptive moments I shared with my husband the first round just won’t be possible this time. As it has with so many other things, Covid-19 is threatening to strip this process of its potential beauties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>We have paid almost<strong> $9,000 </strong>for this cycle. We’ve already maxed out our IVF benefit through my company, so this one is entirely out of pocket. Luckily, though, the transfer cycle is much more affordable without insurance coverage. The breakdown: $1,750 for medications; $2,050 for standard procedures conducted prior to cycle  such as a trial embryo transfer, a sonohysterogram to check that my C-section scar has healed internally, another polyp removal procedure, and a doppler ultrasound to test blood flow to uterine lining; and $5,100 to the clinic for the actual transfer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total cost: $31,631</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>For a long while, I was worried that I would become irreparably <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009564/#:~:text=While%20the%20infertility%20is%20not,life%20(7%2D12).\">scarred by my experience with infertility</a>. I had watched my best qualities – optimism, compersion, drive – erode, involuntarily, over the course of two years. I spent so much time, too much, at emotional odds with those closest to me. And I became bitter, something I’d never been before and had hoped never to be because it’s so toxic. Often upon confiding in friends and family, my feelings would be swatted aside with ‘at least’ and ‘it could be worse’ statements. And on a societal scale, people undergoing fertility treatments are also <a href=\"https://fertile.com/breaking-the-stereotypes-infertility-and-treatment/\">frequently painted as ‘desperate’ or ‘selfish</a>’, while IVF is characterized as an elective, elite procedure. The net effect of all of this brought an overwhelming sense of loneliness and emotional disenfranchisement, which really did a number on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, admittedly, this painful process also bore some unique, beautiful rewards. For one, my husband and I became even more deeply resolved in our love and commitment to one another, children or no children. Our <a href=\"https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-infertility-impact-your-marriage-and-relationship-4121098#:~:text=Just%20as%20infertility%20causes%20emotional,can%20do%20both%20at%20once!\">marriage was tested</a>, then proven, in a way many others are not. I’ve also emerged from this with more compassion. That adage we’ve all heard is now my personal creed. “Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, of course, there is our beautiful daughter who is the biggest reward of all (and hopefully her brother soon to be on the way). It’s only because of her that I’ve finally been able to openly reflect on our fertility journey. It was too painful when we were in the thick of it, then too scary once I became pregnant. But her presence has brought so much healing, and the emotional scar I thought would mark me forever is fading. It’s so light that I’ve barely even felt it <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/ivf-cancelled-coronavirus\">during this IVF cycle</a>. I have been mercifully unburdened by (most of) the fears that plagued me during our first round of treatment, even if I now face a new set of challenges brought on by COVID-19. Right now, like the rest of America, I’m just trying my best to appreciate and hold on to the things that matter most to me<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9466720/what-is-pandemic-coronavirus-meaning\">. The pandemic</a> has shown the world just how much is out of our control, but that is a lesson infertility taught me long before this pandemic. I realize that while parenting does not look the way I thought it would this year, neither did my path to becoming a parent in the first place. </p>\n<p><strong>Like what you see?

Mukwende wasn’t learning about what many conditions would look like on Black or brown skin. For example, <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15367-adult-jaundice#:~:text=Jaundice%20is%20a%20condition%20in,t%20need%20to%20be%20treated.\">jaundice</a>, which makes white skin look yellow, might look more subtle on a Black or Latinx person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At the time it made me feel a bit alienated,” he tells Refinery29. “I was seeing that I wouldn’t be able to identify some of the things we were learning on myself. I started asking, ‘<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/08/238500/black-dermatologist-diversity-problem\">how would I identify it on darker skin</a>?’ I couldn’t really get an answer.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 75% of the skin tones represented in medical textbook imagery were “light’ and only about 5% were “dark,” according to a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501717/\">paper featured in the<em> National Library of Medicine</em></a>. Even in South Africa — where <a href=\"https://welections.wordpress.com/guide-to-the-2014-south-african-election/race-ethnicity-and-language-in-south-africa/\">79.2% of the population considers themselves Black</a> — the majority of medical students are learning from textbooks featuring mainly white bodies, reported the paper’s co-author <a href=\"http://www.patricialouie.com/\">Patricia Louie</a>, PhD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Mukwende took matters into his own hands. With the help of professors, the 20-year-old created a manual called <a href=\"https://www.blackandbrownskin.co.uk/about-mentor\"><em>Mind the Gap: A Handbook of Clinical Signs in Black and Brown Skin</em></a><em>.</em> The book, which is free to download, features images depicting what conditions — from ulcers to chickenpox to eczema — look like on a variety of skin tones. This problem is so deeply ingrained that Mukwende says one of the hardest parts of this project was just finding images of conditions on non-white skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukwende’s handbook offers new, more inclusive language for healthcare workers to use, because current descriptors often assume a patient is white. “When we use terms such as a patient going “blue” around the lips we need to also acknowledge how this may appear differently on darker skins,” he explains. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9992436.jpg?width=853&#38;height=1024&#38;fit=bounds&#38;crop=853%3A1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But when Mukwende first conceived of the idea, doctors, friends, and folks at medical journals who he approached all <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-microaggressions-racial-gaslighting\">expressed doubt</a>. “So many people don’t think this is a problem, and they don’t realize the impacts of the problem,” Mukwende says. “Many people ignore it and didn’t see why it was so relevant.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“One factor that may contribute to this disparity is that the most commonly used <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-american-history-facts\">medical textbooks are written by white people</a>,” Louie, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Washington, tells Refinery29. “Because people commonly use their own lived experience as their point of reference, I think that the representation of darker skin tones was likely not part of the authors’ thought process when selecting images for these textbooks.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intentional or not, Louie says the absence of dark skin in learning manuals can be dangerous for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-bipoc.html\">BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color)</a>. “Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to receive a late stage diagnosis for skin cancer,” she explains to illustrate her point. “This may be because doctors are not trained to recognize how skin cancer presents on darker skin tones.<strong>” </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People [are] dying as a result of doctors not being able to correctly diagnose them,” Mukwende tells Refinery29. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of representation of non-white skin color in medical literature about skin-based symptoms — and the fact that at least some white physicians insist this lack of representation isn’t a “real” problem — is just another example of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9860285/medical-racism-in-healthcare\">medical racism</a>. Already, many cities and states across the country have been calling racism a public health crisis, as increasing attention is paid to all the ways that systemic and institutionalized racism harms Black people’s physical and mental health. Black people are more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and depression, research shows. They also represent about 23% of COVID-19-related deaths in the US, but make up only about 13% of the population. <strong> </strong>A 2015 study found that most healthcare providers appeared to have implicit bias, demonstrating a more positive attitude toward white people, and a more negative attitude toward BIPOC, reports <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638275/\"><em>The American Journal of Medicine</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[Findings] suggest that the impact of skin tone on health operates, in part, through increased exposure to discrimination among Black Americans with darker skin tone,” Louie says. She believes that medical schools should require a course on “the role that racism plays both within and outside the medical profession in shaping racial disparities in health.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Race <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112305\">would have no impact on health</a>, if racism did not systematically influence access to power, resources, and opportunities to help manage and avoid disease,” notes Louie, who says she was “thrilled” to hear about Mukwende’s project. “In order for doctors to properly treat minority patients, it is pertinent that they understand the role that structural racism plays in producing these disparities in the first place.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.refinery29.com/images/9992438.jpg?width=853&#38;height=1024&#38;fit=bounds&#38;crop=853%3A1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukwende says he’s already heard from doctors who’ve said they used his handbook to help treat patients. “It was like 24 hours [after the August launch] when someone reached out, and so it’s great to hear that it’s already having an impact,” he says. “That people are benefitting from the work.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the handbook came out, some of the same doctors and friends who told him this wasn’t a big problem realized the value in the work Mukwende was doing. “Once there was so much attention around it, they were convinced,” he says. “They saw the light we were seeing all those months ago.” </p>\n<p><strong>Like what you see?

When Long was released from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/28/us/ronnie-long-nc-wrongful-conviction-trnd/index.html\">Albemarle Correctional Institute</a> on Thursday, he declared that “It’s been a long road. But it’s over with. It’s over with now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he was 20-years-old, Long was charged with the rape of 54-year-old Sarah Bost <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9916255/asheville-north-carolina-reparations-city-council-vote\">in North Carolina</a> alongside burglary charges connected to the case; he was notably convicted by an all-white jury. Despite the scene of the crime containing <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ronnie-long-freed-44-years-prison-wrongful-conviction/\">hair and fingerprints not matching Long’s</a> own DNA, he was sentenced to 80 years in prison by the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Long never failed to maintain his innocence during his decades in prison, and it was a move that benefited him down the road. As it turns out, Concord police may have tampered with evidence that could clear long’s name: According to his attorney, 40 finger prints and a semen sample that were collected but never shared all did not match Long. Stephanie Thacker, a U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, called the hiding of the evidence following his trial and sentence “a troubling and striking pattern of deliberate <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9900573/amy-cooper-central-park-charged-prison-abolition-argument\">police suppression of material evidence</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with this revelation, the state maintained that nothing could be done to change Long’s sentence. At the request of Long’s lawyer, Jamie Lau, at the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9987762/how-to-make-friends-in-college-during-covid\">the coronavirus pandemic</a>, the Cabarrus County District Attorney’s office did eventually dismiss the charges against Long. He hasn’t, however, been cleared of both charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is real right here,” Long, with his wife AshLeigh and family members by his side, told a local news station <a href=\"https://www.wbtv.com/2020/08/26/ronnie-long-is-coming-home-attorney-says-court-will-vacate-nc-mans-conviction/\">upon his release</a>. “I’m trying to enjoy every minute of it. Every minute I’ve got left in my life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Long, his lawyer, and various political figures, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9965231/racism-in-workplace-white-employees-survey\">prejudice and racism</a> played a major role in his conviction. Judge James Wynn of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals drove home the fact that Long, “a Black man, was tried in ‘small town’ 1970s North Carolina by an all white jury for the rape of the white widow of a prominent local business executive” in a statement. Long now plans to contact North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and seek monetary compensation through a pardon of innocence.</p>\n<p><strong>Like what you see?

Falling into a generations-old cliché that casts young people as lazy and apathetic, Mrs. Obama <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/509551-obamas-discuss-pandemic-voting-anxiety-and-community-in-new\">said</a>, “The average young person knows more about the cereal they’re eating and the car they’re driving than they do about what the government actually does for them.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But being young isn’t always easy. Once again, young people are courageously putting their bodies on the line to fight police brutality. They’re <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8484435/greta-thunberg-generation-z-climate-change-anger\">organizing</a>, mobilizing, and teaching each other to do better. <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9864395/oluwatoyin-toyin-salau-death-body-found-tallahassee-twitter\">Oluwatoyin Salau</a>, for example, died doing just that. She would’ve turned 20 this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get a better understanding of what it’s really like to be a young organizer right now, Refinery29 caught up with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Thandiwe Abdullah (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thandiweabdullah/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Thandiwe Abdullah</a>, a 16-year-old activist whose work around police violence is embedded into the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9881950/protests-sit-in-black-lives-matter-one-month-progress\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>. Also a first-year student at Howard University, Abdullah’s activism focuses on mobilizing teenagers and defunding the police in the hopes of getting them out of schools. She’s been moving through political spaces since she was ten years old, taking notes from the politically active elders in her family. During a moment when Gen Z has become increasingly visible for its politics, Refinery29 talked to Abdullah about organizing at a young age, intergenerational collaboration, and why Gen Z can yell at a cop but is too anxious to make their own doctor’s appointments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gen Z is not here to save you. They’re just fighting for their future. </em><strong><em>For the Future</em></strong><em> spotlights young activists and goes beyond the myth of the Savior Generation. They’re not superheroes, they’re not untouchable, they’re simply young people pushing to make a difference in their own worlds.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refinery29: When it comes to political and activist spaces, how often do you find yourself being the youngest person in the room? Do you feel like that puts you at an advantage or do you find yourself working against that?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thandiwe Abdullah:</strong> I used to feel like that a lot more than I do now because when I started in BLM, I was ten years old and there were no people my age and it was very awkward to be sitting in those spaces. I was probably the only kid there, along with my siblings. But now, the way culture has shifted, it’s allowing for more young people to be involved in this work, even though I still sometimes find myself being the youngest person in a group of young people. All these young people are in their twenties or grown and I get it, there’s a lot more freedom when you’re that old, but I do think there’s a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of organizing even middle-school-aged kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m 16, but I’ve always come across as older. I think a lot of times people are surprised when I say that. I make sure to say it before I speak because immediately after I say something and I mention my age, it’s automatically used to discredit me or I get microaggressions like, “you’re so eloquent,” or “you’re so well-spoken,” which can also be racially charged too. I still hear stuff like that all the time. I was at a protest and I was talking about how police should not be the first responders for domestic abuse, and I talked about how I was abused and someone came up to me telling me how it was inappropriate that a girl my age was talking about this. Saying, “If you say you’re sixteen you shouldn’t be talking about this stuff.” So it’s a fact that a lot of people use age to discredit trauma, to discredit people’s stories, and to make you second-guess yourself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29: So it seems like people dismiss what you say because you’re young when you’re challenging the status quo or questioning the way things are done. Those are two things I think people often associate with youth – radicalism and curiosity. And it’s usually older people telling young people to “grow up” and deal with things as they are. As if only the young and naive think radical change is possible. Do you think being young affects your politics?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TA:</strong> I wouldn’t say that radicalism is only for youth but what I will say is that radicalism and creativity go hand-in-hand. And I think we’re taught that creativity leaves us as we grow up. So when we’re dismantling, we’re also building, and that can’t happen unless we’re radically imagining a better world. And unfortunately, that imagination and that creativity is something that we confine to young people. Young people are the dreamers, they have so much imagination, people often say, “ugh I wish I still had that.” We hear adults say that type of stuff all the time. When in reality, we do it to ourselves; old people can have that same creativity, that same imagination, that drive. But we literally box off generations and say, “this generation is creative and this generation is old.” I think if we get rid of that, any generation can be radicalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29: It seems like all eyes are on Gen Z right now and I wonder if it’s connected with how obsessed with youth we are as a society. It’s always about accomplishing as much as you can while you’re young. Does that weigh on you or your work at all?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TA:</strong> There’s a lot to unpack there but as a society, we fetishize youth a lot in a lot of weird ways. We unload a lot of our expectations on young people. Deep down, I feel like a lot of adults want this change. We’ve been spoon-fed that, when you get to a certain age, your time to do things is over. I was even talking to my mom about this, in Hollywood when you hit a certain age, especially women, you can’t act anymore. There’s nothing else for you to do so you take the money you made when you were younger and then you retire. There’s not much you can do when you’re old and we’ve been told that our entire lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel like adults and people who aren’t Gen Z have so much hope. I think they’re just excited, almost in a weird obsessive way. They want to watch. But they would rather watch Gen Z’s revolution from a screen than, like, be in the streets and do the work themselves, and partially, it’s because of what they’ve been told. Also who wouldn’t want to fulfill that role? You get to sit down and say you’re done: I’m done learning, I’m done being active, I’m done risking my life because I’m older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29:</strong> <strong>You’ve been able to build a platform partially because you can speak on behalf of your generation. It seems so many people and places are looking to get in on Gen Z’s popularity, but nobody is young forever.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TA: </strong>I think about it all the time. I’m not ashamed to admit it: I do use my age to get certain things or to draw people in because, unfortunately, these are things that exist. We have a weird obsession with youth, so why not? A lot of times, people don’t listen to me, so I do use my age to my advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, I always have this weird anxiety about my age. The older I get, the less people will want to pay attention to me, the less important my voice becomes. Which is really weird because when I was young – I still am – but when I was younger, I would think no one would listen to me unless I’m an adult or no one would hear what I had to say. I wanted to grow up so quick just because I thought it was better. But now I’m at the point when I realize that there’s this window of youth where it’s the perfect mix of being able to use that youth but also being old enough to the point where people think you are educated, and you are worth listening to. So I think I’m in that window now, but I’m so scared because it’s so small and I think a lot of other youth organizers feel like, as soon as I hit this age, will my work still be important? Will my work still go places?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29: Right, so we have older people dismissing Gen Z and talking down to young people. But it’s obvious that Gen Z is taking charge at this crucial moment. Do you think there’s a bit of antagonism or miscommunication between Gen Z and older generations?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TA:</strong> I think Gen Z, we’re getting better at it. I think we’re just very wary of old people. Part of being radical is that we don’t like ageism, which is rampant in our politics, in our community, in our culture. Looking at political offices, who occuppies those positions, who is passing the harmful legislation? A lot of the times it is older people and a lot of the times younger people are barred from these high political offices. I think there is just this distrust, we feel excluded. And it’s not just a Gen Z thing, I’m sure that every generation felt this way when they were young. But I think it has created this division and mistrust alongside the thing about not learning or being open, and that makes it hard to connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, people like Bernie Sanders, Gen Z loves him and it’s because he embodies so much of the things we like. Maxine Waters, all of these amazing older folks, we love you. Because they get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29: So as a young person, as a member of Gen Z, what do you personally think Gen Z does really well? What’s good about Gen Z?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TA: </strong>Gen Z <em>is</em> very anxious and we’re weird, like, the tweets about how we’re too scared to make a doctor’s appointment but we’ll yell at cops are so true. I think we’re very good with the turnout – if something happens, best believe there will be a rally the next day, we’ll make flyers, circulate. We’re very good at getting people to show up however they can with either donations, or petitions, or calls to action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R29: Do you think it’s fair for people to say things like, “Gen Z is going to save us all”? Does that feel encouraging or does it add unnecessary pressure?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not your saviors, we’re doing the bare minimum, stop unloading all of your hopes and dreams on youth. Do it yourself. We’ll be alongside you but at the end of the day, it’s not our job to save the entire universe, we’re not superheroes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Like what you see?
