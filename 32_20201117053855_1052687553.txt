And it's actually quite a bit more interesting than the sound bite summary. </p><p>For 30 years <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8bvGDaYAAAAJ&hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">I've been studying</a> 18-to-29-year-olds, an age group I call “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Emerging_Adulthood/MUtRBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=emerging+adulthood+winding+through+20s&printsec=frontcover\" target=\"_blank\">emerging adults</a>\" to describe their in-between status as no longer adolescents, but not fully adult. </p><p>Even 30 years ago, adulthood – typically marked by a stable job, a long-term partnership and financial independence – was coming later than it had in the past. </p><p>Yes, a lot of emerging adults are now living with their parents. But this is part of a larger, longer trend, with the percentage going up only modestly since COVID-19 hit. Furthermore, having grown kids still at home is not likely to do you, or them, any permanent harm. In fact, until very recently, it's been the way adults have typically lived throughout history. Even now, it's a common practice in most of the world.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Staying home is not new or unusual</h2><p>Drawing on the federal government's monthly <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Current Population Survey</a>, the Pew Report showed that 52% of 18-to-29-year-olds are currently living with their parents, up from 47% in February. The increase was mostly among the younger emerging adults – ages 18 to 24 – and was primarily due to their coming home from colleges that shut down or to their having lost their jobs.</p><p>Although 52% is the highest percentage in over a century, this number has, in fact, been rising steadily since hitting a low of 29% in 1960. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Emerging_Adulthood_and_Higher_Education.html?id=3B9tDwAAQBAJ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The main reason</a> for the rise is that more and more young people continued their education into their 20s as the economy shifted from manufacturing to information and technology. When they're enrolled in school, most don't make enough money to live independently.</p><p>Before 1900 in the United States, it was typical for young people to live at home until they married in their mid-20s, and there was nothing shameful about it. They usually started working by their early teens – <a href=\"http://www.jeffreyarnett.com/articles/ARNETT_Learning_to_stand_alone.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">it was rare then for kids to get even a high school education</a> – and their families relied upon the extra income. Virginity for young women was highly prized, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Front_Porch_to_Back_Seat/Jsd8LhrgkLoC?hl=en&gbpv=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">so it was moving out before marriage that was scandalous</a>, not staying home where they could be shielded from young men.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>In most of the world today, it is <a href=\"https://wordpress.clarku.edu/ljensen/wp-content/blogs.dir/164/files/2013/11/2012-JSI-Jensen-Arnett-Going-Global-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">still typical for emerging adults to stay home until at least their late 20s</a>. In countries where collectivism is more highly valued than individualism – in places as diverse as Italy, Japan and Mexico – parents mostly prefer to have their emerging adults stay home until marriage. In fact, even after marriage it remains a common cultural tradition for a young man to bring his wife into his parents' household rather than move out.</p><p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ndHLVuzcgqsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA33&dq=pension+system+history+%22developed+countries%22&ots=ymGgSZZzX5&sig=gVmgl_BBooZ3lm7f7riagGHeYGs#v=onepage&q=pension%20system%20history%20%22developed%20countries%22&f=false\" target=\"_blank\">Until the modern pension system arose about a century ago</a>, aging parents were highly vulnerable and needed their adult children and daughters-in-law to care for them in their later years. This tradition persists in many countries, including the two most populous countries in the world, India and China.</p><p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Habits_of_the_Heart.html?id=5DQHmykT6u4C\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In today's individualistic U.S.</a>, we mostly expect our kids to hit the road by age 18 or 19 so they can learn to be independent and self-sufficient. If they don't, we may worry that there is something wrong with them.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>You'll miss them when they're gone</h2><p>Because I've been researching emerging adults for a long time, I've been doing a lot of television, radio and print interviews since the Pew report was released.</p><p>Always, the premise seems to be the same: Isn't this awful?</p><p>I would readily agree that it's awful to have your education derailed or to lose your job because of the pandemic. But it's not awful to live with your parents during emerging adulthood. Like most of the rest of family life, it's a mixed bag: It's a pain in some ways, and rewarding in others.</p><p><a href=\"http://www2.clarku.edu/clark-poll-emerging-adults/pdfs/clark-university-poll-emerging-adults-findings.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In a national survey of 18-to-29-year-olds</a> I directed before the pandemic, 76% of them agreed that they get along better with their parents now than they did in adolescence, but almost the same majority – 74% – agreed, \"I would prefer to live independently of my parents, even if it means living on a tight budget.\"</p><p>Parents express similar ambivalence. <a href=\"http://www2.clarku.edu/clark-poll-emerging-adults/pdfs/clark-university-poll-parents-emerging-adults.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In a separate national survey I directed</a>, 61% of parents who had an 18-to-29-year-old living at home were \"mostly positive\" about that living arrangement, and about the same percentage agreed that living together resulted in greater emotional closeness and companionship with their emerging adults. On the other hand, 40% of the parents agreed that having their emerging adults at home meant worrying about them more, and about 25% said it resulted in more conflict and more disruption to their daily lives.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>As much as most parents enjoy having their emerging adults around, they tend to be ready to move on to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Getting_to_30.html?id=F65XSqY_qasC\" target=\"_blank\">the next stage of their lives</a> when their youngest kid reaches their 20s. They have plans they've been delaying for a long time – to travel, to take up new forms of recreation and perhaps to retire or change jobs.</p><p>Those who are married often view this new phase as a time to get to know their spouse again – or as a time <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-is-at-risk-for-a-gray-divorce-it-depends\" target=\"_blank\">to admit their marriage has run its course</a>. Those who are divorced or widowed can now have an overnight guest without worrying about scrutiny from their adult child at the breakfast table the next morning.</p><p>My wife, Lene, and I have direct experience to draw on with our 20-year-old twins, who came home in March after their colleges closed, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/how-coronavirus-changed-college-for-over-14-million-students.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an experience shared with millions of students nationwide</a>. I'll admit we were enjoying our time as a couple before they moved back in, but nevertheless it was a delight having them unexpectedly return, as they are full of love and add so much liveliness to the dinner table.</p><p>Now the fall semester has started and our daughter, Paris, is still home taking her courses via Zoom, whereas our son, Miles, has returned to college. We're savoring these months with Paris. She has a great sense of humor and makes an excellent Korean tofu rice bowl. And we all know it won't last.</p><p>That's something worth remembering for all of us during these strange times, especially for parents and emerging adults who find themselves sharing living quarters again. It won't last.</p><p>You could see this unexpected change as awful, as a royal pain and daily stress. Or you could see it as one more chance to get to know each other as adults, before the emerging adult sails once again over the horizon, this time never to return.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/146979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/jeffrey-arnett-1160487\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Arnett</a>, Senior Research Scholar, Department of Psychology, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/clark-university-2129\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Clark University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Also called the Black Plague, this terrible illness afflicted Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s, with new outbreaks over several centuries. It killed about a third of the European population when it began – nearly 20 million people. Over a few years, the total for the extremely contagious plague is estimated to have reached as high as 200 million victims globally. </p><p>The bubonic plague first came to Europe in 1347, aboard 12 trading ships from the Black Sea that docked at the Sicilian port of Messina. Most of the sailors on those ships were either dead or terribly ill, covered in black boils full of blood and pus. By the time the authorities tried to send these ships away, it was too late and the plague started spreading. This was due, in particular, to the fact that the disease did not only transmit through air but also through the bites of infected fleas and rats. These were plentiful in Europe of the time, and a real mainstay aboard ships, which carried the plague from port to port. The illness also spread to livestock like cows and sheep and even chicken.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4a7cdb7e2e605c63a1df5b8bdda096bc\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"af530\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDc1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTc5NzI0MX0.IbLuKhr8C2W_Ey5x_WurodGweNVQMEz7c6uhzzdOEGg/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The origin of the disease was likely in Asia and goes as far back as 2,000 years ago. The plague is an ancient pestilence that has profoundly decimated the world on different occasions but none as bad as when it hit in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Caused by the bacterium <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis\" target=\"_blank\">Yersinia pestis</a>, the plague resulted in terrifying symptoms. As <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/black-death\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> by the History Channel, the Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio described the afflictions that came with the plague in no uncertain terms: \"In men and women alike, at the beginning of the malady, certain swellings, either on the groin or under the armpits…waxed to the bigness of a common apple, others to the size of an egg, some more and some less, and these the vulgar named plague-boils.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d4255464ad6722e54d293425b7fa23af\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"8a57e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDc1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzIyNzE0NH0.TnS41IDv3Xue7RPgSf1CqXtRFsVK5CzIWAxVevE6cFc/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Attacking the lymphatic system, the plague also brought with it fever, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches and pains. Unfortunately, available medieval treatments like bloodletting certainly weren't too pleasant and did little to stem the tide of the Black Death. Neither did the belief of many that the plague was a punishment from God. This resulted in the purging of \"heretics\" like the massacres of thousands of Jews in 1348 and 1349 and a whole class of self-flagellating people who went from town to town beating themselves in penance.</p><p>What finally ended the Black Death? It went away for periods of time but would come back for a new round during several centuries like its resurgence in London in 1665-1666, when it killed about 100,000 – a quarter of the city's population. The eventual weakening of the pandemic was likely due to the practice of quarantining infected people that originated in Venice in the 15h century and is still with us today. Improved sanitation, personal hygiene, and medical practices also played a role in ultimately slowing the plague's terror march. Still, annually there are about 1,000 to 3,000 cases of the plague even in the modern world.</p><h3>Plague 101 </h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a2903287de389afd6de3a609241535ac\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYnMXEcHI7U?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/0RK2KUN1ZLs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDczMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzOTA0MTM3MX0.pFhQ3SYN-kwPVBq_jqmS04m-CJwXiDYMI9MUrVBjvE8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C156&height=700","linkMd5":"2a1ba2e2e68e242134d290c6609971ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn10@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-27-768_5b2a2c4515b8c261.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":17994,"destBytes":17994,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDczMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzOTA0MTM3MX0.pFhQ3SYN-kwPVBq_jqmS04m-CJwXiDYMI9MUrVBjvE8/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C156&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn10@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-27-768_5b2a2c4515b8c261.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDc1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTc5NzI0MX0.IbLuKhr8C2W_Ey5x_WurodGweNVQMEz7c6uhzzdOEGg/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn23@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-46-047_af530556463ab6b0.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MDc1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzIyNzE0NH0.TnS41IDv3Xue7RPgSf1CqXtRFsVK5CzIWAxVevE6cFc/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn30@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-48-831_8a57e5b3dabe8c9b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/0RK2KUN1ZLs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-38-43-567_cb10dc32b378eeb8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591507465},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:27","title":"Actually, New York is half socialist already","link":"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/new-york-socialism","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODE2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODA0NDEwOX0.D2E5YhUURfYmrLv9GA0ImqgdxFlLAIggM6tkbypfvp0/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>As this 1895 map proves, the political argument about socialism in the United States is not new at all.</li>\n <li>The map makes the point that socialism isn't foreign or alien, but as American as the pavements (and parks) of New York.</li>\n <li>It shows 'concrete socialism' in red, and 'private enterprises' in white - each make up about half of the city.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>A dirty word</h3>\n<br />\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8c1f0514ed0e636acd1c3bde36c96eb3\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"caf81\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODE3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDE3OTI3M30.CbcS1_4wcEAhUrSHfJ6kR1I9MRgHVWyKSZDbjMLbxK4/img.jpg?width=980\" />\n<p>Socialism is a dirty word in American politics.

One group of participants played a brain-training video game called \"Mind Frontiers,\" while another group played crossword games or number puzzles.</p><p>\"Our findings and previous studies confirm there's very little evidence these types of games can improve your life in a meaningful way,\" said Wally Boot, an expert on age-related cognitive decline at FSU who was involved in the study. Another 2017 report monitoring the cognitive skills, brain activity, and decision-making abilities of young adults, concluded that brain-training games \"<a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318374\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">do not boost cognition</a>.\" </p><p>What brain games likely do is make you better at playing that specific brain game. Learning is the result of two potential processes that happen to neuron cells in the brain. One is called \"long term potentiation,\" in which already existing connections between neurons are strengthened by firing together in reaction to incoming signals. The other is called \"dendritic spine growth.\" In this process, neurons form new connections with each other by wiring together through a process in which the surface area of dendrites (antenna-like structures that make up the receiving end of a neuron) increases allowing for more neurons to connect with one another. </p><p>In short, \"cells that fire together wire together,\" and when you play brain games, neural connections in the brain network that are engaged while performing the tasks in the game are strengthened. Thus, you may become a genius at solving a particular word puzzle, but there is little evidence to suggest that you will become any better at other puzzles, let alone enhance your cognitive abilities in general. And because those puzzles are so decontextualized from situations you would likely encounter in real life, they are probably useless. </p><p>This was backed up by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009838/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a 2018 study</a> in which neuroscientists at Western University in Ontario, Canada, investigated if the cognitive skills acquired from brain-training tasks could be transferred to other tasks that engage the same brain regions. They found no evidence to support that idea. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00248/full\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video games may do more for your brain.</a></p><h3>Brain teasers don't reflect future job performance</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3fada375c74e57b7a214b19a0c6a10f8\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"e143b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODU2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzQyODgwOH0.LcOdRnyLQz6bKyI6N5WGmodQYL2_elOY4K3EArC-s-w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C405%2C0%2C405&height=700\"/><p>So brain puzzles may not do much to boost IQ, but does the ability to work through brain teasers predict intellect or job performance? Afterall, Google, once notorious for its use of brain teasers in job interviews, decided they were \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">a complete waste of time</a>\" years ago. (A list of some of the tech giant's interview questions <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/15-google-interview-questions-that-used-to-make-geniuses-feel-dumb-2012-11#how-many-golf-balls-can-fit-in-a-school-bus-1\" target=\"_blank\">can be found here</a>, for those curious.)</p><p>\"They don't predict anything,\" Laszlo Bock, senior vice president of people operations at Google, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told the New York Times</a> in 2013. \"They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.\"</p><p>The reason is that while the brain teasers may measure how fast an individual can generate a smart or accurate solution to an abstract problem under pressure, they have little to do with future problems the employee will encounter in the job. Furthermore, the environment in which the brain teaser is asked favors certain personality traits that may be irrelevant to job performance and which do not necessarily reflect intelligence. For example, an introvert whose nerves may impede his or her ability to communicate a quick and creative solution in the context of a job interview. Or, perhaps, a detail, sensory-oriented individual whose problem-solving strength lies in tangible and immediate situations rather than abstract imaginings. </p><p>In short, an employee who can come up with high quality ideas and solutions in situations relevant to a specific job role is far more valuable than one who can come up with a fast idea to a brain teaser that has nothing to do with the company's goals. </p><h3>Better brain boosters</h3><br/><p>The science on brain training games and teasers is a mixed bag. However, if you're looking for more effective ways to boost your cognition or prevent cognitive decline, here are some that are better backed by research:</p><ul><li><strong>Run or walk.</strong> Several studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that govern thinking and memory are greater in volume in individuals who regularly exercise as opposed to those who don't. What's more, some research has found that engaging in regular exercise of moderate intensity over six months to a year is correlated with an increase in the volume of selected brain regions. Most of this research has focused on aerobic exercise.<br/><br/> </li><li><strong>Meditate.</strong> Multiple studies have shown that regular mindfulness meditation increases grey matter in the brain, which equates with more neuronal activity and better performance, in certain areas. Research has also found that mindfulness meditation <a href=\"http://jtoomim.org/brain-training/Zeidan2010_Mindfulness_Meditation.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">improves cognition</a>.<br/><br/> </li><li><strong>Socialize. </strong>Frequent social activity may help to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships\" target=\"_blank\">delay cognitive decline</a> in old age and boost current cognition. This is because social situations and the development of relationships requires our minds to engage multiple neural networks that are relevant to healthy daily function.<br/><br/> </li><li><strong>Prioritize nutrition.</strong> \"Brain-boosting\" foods like fish, dark chocolate, antioxidant-rich berries, and foods with B vitamins like eggs can help build and repair brain cells. </li></ul><p class=\"\"><br/></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/WDmISNDr0Zw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 21:43:17 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MTMzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODY2MDM5MH0.AEE1fPr5t3fEDXmziWJiiBL-sQmUZE3utjj5IKKF944/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C359%2C0%2C203&height=700","linkMd5":"3693151239442b160b047e8eb71da96f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-39-770_5fc91c6a148d7362.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":36540,"destBytes":36540,"author":"Molly Hanson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4MTMzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODY2MDM5MH0.AEE1fPr5t3fEDXmziWJiiBL-sQmUZE3utjj5IKKF944/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C359%2C0%2C203&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-39-770_5fc91c6a148d7362.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODU2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODE5MTU3NX0.WnGU3mz2yMZx1IdQKUOhmvOmry_vjuWrBD3nzy4Yy0w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-43-743_0cf0e3a86962fd82.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODU2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzQyODgwOH0.LcOdRnyLQz6bKyI6N5WGmodQYL2_elOY4K3EArC-s-w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C405%2C0%2C405&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn61@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-43-774_e143b515d4930dbb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/WDmISNDr0Zw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-38-43-686_c44432070ecd11c2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591507465},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:27","title":"Researchers use CT scans to digitally peek at ancient Egyptian mummies","link":"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/ct-image-mummy","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3OTczMi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTc2MDUzNn0.N14oDSPZC7SdjZ7TAltZ0mIMW9FZQdfXWhDwpU5YnIE/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C373&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Three long dead Egyptians recently had their CT images taken. </li><li>The scans revealed what was, and was not, done during their mummification. </li><li>The finds shed more light on how the Egyptians were inspired by the Greeks and Romans.</li></ul><hr/><p> Beyond being great villains in horror films, mummies are excellent tools to learn about the past with. With these well-preserved corpses, you can learn about what people were like in life by reviewing what they left behind. If you get enough of them, you can start to make generalizations about how entire populations lived. <br/> <br/> The Egyptians liked to bury mummies with possessions that they might take with them into the afterlife. Because of this, their tombs often reveal the lives they lived, the art styles of the time, what objects they found important enough to take with them into the beyond, and other details that might otherwise be lost to history. <br/> <br/> One of the difficulties of using mummies to learn about these things is that they can be challenging to wrap back up after pulling back the bandages. Luckily for us, modern technology has made doing that obsolete. Recently, a team of researchers created CT scan images of three mummies and published their <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240900#sec007\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">findings</a>. </p><h3>They look pretty good for being 2000.</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e52682068e52705d2252c8ca1be19c18\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"2939a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3OTczOS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMDM0OTA3OH0.-D0YZ-3earUCZ7IWMOR5B2ZAX2fUyyRvzEokjROgJM8/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C55%2C0%2C1434&height=700\"/><p> The three mummies scanned are the only known examples of \"stucco-shrouded portrait mummies.\" As opposed to being buried in a coffin, these three were placed on wooden boards then wrapped in a textile and a shroud. They were then decorated with plaster, gold, and a whole-body portrait revealing what they looked like, how they styled their hair, and what they wore in life. All three were once buried in Saqqara, the great Necropolis just south of <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/painted-ancient-egyptian-mummies-ct-scan.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Giza</a>. <br/> <br/> They date back to the Late Roman Period in Egypt, and all three of them have had very exciting afterlives filled with stories about their discoveries and shifting ownership. Now, thanks to modern technology, we can learn about their lives. <br/> <br/> The CT scan shows that the man was between 25 and 30 years of age when he died and that he had several cavities and unerupted teeth. He was only 164 cm tall (around 5'4\"). Several of his bones are broken, though this is believed to be the result of careless handling by whoever discovered the remains.</p><p>Most curiously, there is no evidence that his brain was removed during the mummification process, as was standard in other cases. It also seems that few embalming chemicals were used to preserve him. This suggests that he was just wrapped, painted, and buried and that dehydration is what kept his corpse so well preserved. <br/> <br/> The woman was between 30 and 40 years old and stood at 151 cm (4'9\"). She shows signs of arthritis in her knees. Like many other Egyptians, she was buried in fine jewelry. Several necklaces appeared on the scan, suggesting she was well off. For reasons unknown, nails were also found in her abdomen. Like her male counterpart, her brain was not removed during mummification, <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/archaeologists-finally-peer-inside-egyptian-mummies-first-found-in-1615\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">either</a>. <br/> <br/> The last mummy was that of a girl in her late teens. She showed signs of having a benign tumor on her back, and all of her internal organs were still intact. Her coffin contains hairpins, suggesting that she wore her hair up as depicted in her portrait.  </p><h3>How does this change our understanding of Egyptian life and death? </h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHV0My7KibM\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Finding hairpins with the remains is noteworthy, as only a few other such examples exist.
