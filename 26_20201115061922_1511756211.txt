Circuit on Tuesday, calling for a review of actions by CFIUS (Trump’s committee on foreign investment in the United States).</p>\n<p>TikTok had earlier asked for an extension, but never heard back, it said.</p>\n<p>Or, as the winning headline put it, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline\">courtesy of The Verge</a>: &#8220;TikTok says the Trump administration has forgotten about trying to ban it, would like to know what’s up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a statement, TikTok said:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;For a year, TikTok has actively engaged with CFIUS in good faith to address its national security concerns, even as we disagree with its assessment. In the nearly two months since the President gave his preliminary approval to our proposal to satisfy those concerns, we have offered detailed solutions to finalize that agreement – but have received no substantive feedback on our extensive data privacy and security framework.</em></p>\n<p><em>Facing continual new requests and no clarity on whether our proposed solutions would be accepted, we requested the 30-day extension that is expressly permitted in the August 14 order. Today, with the November 12 CFIUS deadline imminent and without an extension in hand, we have no choice but to file a petition in court to defend our rights and those of our more than 1,500 employees in the US. We remain committed to working with the Administration — as we have all along — to resolve the issues it has raised, but our legal challenge today is a protection to ensure these discussions can take place.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>After getting the reminder, the Commerce Dept. on Thursday said it wouldn&#8217;t enforce the order that required TikTok to shut down, citing a preliminary injunction against the shutdown last month that came about as a result <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/tiktok-stars-got-a-judge-to-block-trumps-tiktok-ban/\">of the lawsuit by TikTok stars</a>, who claimed the app&#8217;s closure would impact their ability to make an income. However, it also appealed that same ruling, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/the-u-s-government-sends-mixed-messages-about-tiktoks-future/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">leading to further confusion.</a></p>\n<p>The question now is how will the incoming <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/12/cybersecurity-202-biden-administration-could-mean-reset-us-war-tiktok/\">Biden administration proceed</a> with regard to the Trump TikTok ban. Though Biden has criticized Trump&#8217;s China policy, concern over TikTok was one that saw bipartisan support. Biden even said <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-ban-biden/biden-says-he-sees-tiktok-as-a-matter-of-genuine-concern-idUSKBN26938G\">during a campaign stop in September</a> that it was worrisome that a Chinese operation would have access to over 100 million young people in the U.S.</p>\n<h2>Election results send conservative apps up the charts</h2>\n<p>After a nerve-wracking week of election results which devolved into political chaos as Trump rallied his base to believe <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election\">baseless</a> claims of fraud, a number of right-wing Trump supporters turned to alternative apps for social media and news.</p>\n<p>The App Store&#8217;s top charts, which are determined by a combination of downloads and velocity, among other factors, soon featured a new set of alternative apps, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/\">led by</a> free speech network Parler, which found itself in the No. 1 spot. (It&#8217;s since slipped thanks to Walmart&#8217;s Black Friday <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/black-friday-walmart-deals-available-now-99-cordless-vacuum-194-airpods-pro-and-more/\">sales</a>, which sent the retailer&#8217;s app flying up to No. 1.)</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2073831\" style=\"width: 339px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2073831\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2073831\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?w=329\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=145,300 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=768,1587 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=329,680 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=743,1536 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=991,2048 991w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6490.jpg?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2073831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot from App Store</p></div></p>\n<p>According <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias\">to one estimate</a>, Parler saw 980K downloads from November 3 through November 8. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/technology/parler-rumble-newsmax.html\">Other apps</a> also benefitted from the election drama, including social network MeWe (now No. 10 on the iPhone Top Free Apps chart in the U.S. and right-wing news network Newsmax TV (No. 7).</p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook and Twitter &#8212; which increasingly use fact-checking services to label or, in extreme cases, hide false claims behind an extra click &#8212; alternative apps do not. But they are not neutral platforms by any means. The verified account from &#8220;Team Trump&#8221; was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/parler-app-free-speech-influencers/\">among those that automatically greeted</a> new Parler users, for example. Right-wing politicians like senator Ted Cruz and representative Devin Nunes as well as other conservative personalities have set up shop on Parler, too.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dXGK9CFD31\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/\">&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;&#8216;Free speech&#8217; social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden&#8217;s election win&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/embed/#?secret=dXGK9CFD31\" data-secret=\"dXGK9CFD31\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As a result, the community is lopsided. Users are posting to amplify their beliefs among those who largely feel the same as they do. And, because Parler does not combat misinformation and conspiracy theories with fact-checking, it&#8217;s already been targeted by a conspiracy theory of its very own. A Photoshopped image of a Fox News ticker spread confusion on Parler this week, as the modified image claimed that George Soros owned the social network. The conspiracy got enough traction that Parler founder John Matze had to post that it was not true. But Parler&#8217;s true origins and ownership are still being discussed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear to what extent the conservative apps represent a new wave of social media with long-term staying power, given that any relative newcomer to the space will still ultimately have to compete with very large networks, like Facebook&#8217;s 2 billion users. Though smaller than Facebook, Twitter&#8217;s 330 million monthly active users is still much larger than Parler&#8217;s monthly active user base <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-conservatives-parler-surges-amid-election-misinformation-crackdown-n1247333\">of about 4 million</a> (its active users are around half of its registered users, which is now 8 million.)</p>\n<p>Larger platforms have resources to pour into more than just the basics of keeping the servers running. And, to date, that&#8217;s led to the demise of numerous other would-be Facebook rivals. The few apps that manage to grow a following these days are those that get a majority of younger, mainstream users, like TikTok and Snapchat.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your political leanings, I think we can all agree there was a lot of this going on this week:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2073829\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38FzXsA.jpg?w=539\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38FzXsA.jpg 539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38FzXsA.jpg?resize=132,150 132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38FzXsA.jpg?resize=263,300 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38FzXsA.jpg?resize=44,50 44w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\" /></p>\n<h2>Instagram Redesign</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2072808\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2072808\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2072808\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png 5355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=2048,1307 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Launch-Image-Home-Reels-Shop.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2072808\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>\n<p>Instagram this week put its TikTok competitor Reels front-and-center in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">redesigned version of its app</a> by giving it the center position on its new navigation bar.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Eighteen months ago, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> self-driving car unit, Uber Advanced Technologies Group, was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Now, it’s up for sale and a competing autonomous vehicle technology startup is in talks with Uber to buy it, according to three sources familiar with the deal.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aurora-innovation\">Aurora Innovation, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the startup founded by three veterans of the autonomous vehicle industry who led programs at Google, Tesla and Uber, is in negotiations to buy Uber ATG. Terms of the deal are still unknown, but sources say the two companies have been in talks since October and it is far along in the process.</p>\n<p>An Uber spokesperson declined to comment, citing that the company&#8217;s general policy is not to comment on these sorts of inquiries. An Aurora spokesperson said it doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation.</p>\n<p>The talks could falter. But if successful, they have the potential to triple Aurora’s headcount and allow Uber to unload an expensive long-term play that has sustained several controversies in its short life.</p>\n<h2>Uber has &#8216;been shopping&#8217;</h2>\n<p>Shedding Uber ATG would follow a string of spin-offs or other deals in recent months that has narrowed Uber’s focus and costs into core areas of ride-hailing and delivery. Two years ago, Uber’s business model could be described as an &#8220;all of the above approach,&#8221; a bet on generating revenue from all forms of transportation, including ride-hailing, micromobility, logistics, package and food delivery and someday even autonomous robotaxis.</p>\n<p>That strategy has changed since Uber went public and has further accelerated as the COVID-19 pandemic has upended the economy and fundamentally changed how people live. In the past 11 months, Uber has dumped shared micromobility unit Jump, sold a stake in its growing but still unprofitable logistics arm, Uber Freight and acquired Postmates. (The Postmates acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020).</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MmW5voxBUd\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/\">Uber leads $170M Lime investment, offloads Jump to Lime</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Uber leads $170M Lime investment, offloads Jump to Lime&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/embed/#?secret=MmW5voxBUd\" data-secret=\"MmW5voxBUd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Uber ATG has been the company’s last big, expensive holding. Uber ATG holds a lot of long-term promise and high present-day costs; Uber reported in November that ATG and &#8220;other technologies&#8221; (which includes Uber Elevate) had a net loss of $303 million in the nine months that ended September 30, 2020. In its S-1 document, Uber said it incurred $457 million of research and development expenses for its ATG and &#8220;other Technology Programs&#8221; initiatives.</p>\n<p>Four sources within the industry told TechCrunch that Uber “has been shopping” ATG to several companies, including automakers this year. Sources have also told TechCrunch that Uber ATG was facing a potential down round, which might have been an additional motivator behind the talks with Aurora.</p>\n<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017, is focused on building the full self-driving stack, the underlying technology that will allow vehicles to navigate highways and city streets without a human driver behind the wheel. Aurora has attracted attention and investment from high-profile venture firms, management firms and corporations such as Greylock Partners, Sequoia Capital, Amazon and T. Rowe Price, in part because of its founders Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson.</p>\n<p>Urmson led the former Google self-driving project before it spun out to become the Alphabet business Waymo. Anderson is best known for leading the development and launch of the Tesla Model X and the automaker&#8217;s Autopilot program. Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, helped launch Uber&#8217;s efforts in autonomy, ultimately heading the autonomy and perception team at the Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Aurora has grown from a small upstart to a company with 600 employees and operations in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Texas and Bozeman, Montana, home of Blackmore, the lidar company it acquired in 2019. About 12% of Aurora’s current workforce previously worked at Uber, according to records on LinkedIn.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eHbzXcaEaa\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/\">Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup Blackmore</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Fresh off a $530M round, Aurora acquires lidar startup Blackmore&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/embed/#?secret=eHbzXcaEaa\" data-secret=\"eHbzXcaEaa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Despite that growth, Aurora is still dwarfed by Uber ATG, the self-driving subsidiary that is majority owned by Uber. Uber ATG has more than 1,200 employees with operations in several locations, including Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Uber holds an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519188316/d767435d8k.htm\">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. Its investors hold a combined stake of 13.8% in Uber ATG.</p>\n<p>Uber’s public leap into autonomous vehicle technology began in earnest in early 2015 when the company announced a strategic partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Center. The agreement to work on developing driverless car technology resulted in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-uber-a-friend-or-foe-of-carnegie-mellon-in-robotics-1433084582\">Uber poaching dozens of NREC researchers</a> and scientists. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A year later, with the beginnings of an in-house AV development program, Uber, then led by co-founder Travis Kalanick, acquired a self-driving truck startup called Otto.</span></p>\n<p>The acquisition was troubled almost from the start. Otto was founded earlier that year by one of Google’s star engineers, Anthony Levandowski, along with three other Google veterans: Lior Ron, Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later.</p>\n<p>Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn&#8217;t a party to either arbitration. While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"85PUJSILxx\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/uber-settles-lawsuit-with-waymo/\">Uber settles lawsuit with Waymo</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Uber settles lawsuit with Waymo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/uber-settles-lawsuit-with-waymo/embed/#?secret=85PUJSILxx\" data-secret=\"85PUJSILxx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Under the settlement, Uber agreed not to incorporate Waymo&#8217;s confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That was calculated at the time to be about $244.8 million in Uber equity.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the Otto acquisition, Uber estimated it could have 75,000 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2019 and be operating driverless taxi services in 13 cities by 2022, according to court documents unsealed and first reported on by TechCrunch. To reach those ambitious goals, the ride-hailing company was spending $20 million a month on developing self-driving technologies.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5DFlYrsHqK\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/ubers-self-driving-car-unit-was-burning-20-million-a-month/\">Uber&#8217;s self-driving car unit was burning $20 million a month</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Uber&#8217;s self-driving car unit was burning $20 million a month&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/ubers-self-driving-car-unit-was-burning-20-million-a-month/embed/#?secret=5DFlYrsHqK\" data-secret=\"5DFlYrsHqK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Uber never came close to hitting those targets, a mission that was derailed by technical hurdles as well as the lawsuit with Waymo, its troubled relationship with Lewandowski and the fatal crash in March 2018 involving one of its self-driving test vehicles in Tempe, Arizona.</p>\n<p>Uber halted all testing following the crash and has been slowly ramping up its more public-facing operations over the past 18 months. The expensive undertaking of developing autonomous vehicles prompted Uber to spin out the company in spring 2019 after it closed $1 billion in funding from Toyota, auto parts maker Denso and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.</p>\n<p>The spin-out, which occurred about one month before Uber’s debut as a publicly traded company, had been the subject of speculation for months. It was seen as a way for Uber to share the expensive load with other investors and allow it to focus on its core competencies and nearer-term profit goals.</p>\n<h2>What Aurora gains</h2>\n<p>Troubles aside, Uber ATG has two important and critical features that make it attractive to Aurora: talent and Toyota.</p>\n<p>The Japanese car giant had already invested $500 million into Uber prior to the 2019 injection of cash. At the time, the two companies announced their intention to bring pilot-scale deployments of automated Toyota Sienna-based ridesharing vehicles to the Uber ridesharing network in 2021, “leveraging the strengths of Uber ATG’s self-driving technology alongside the Toyota Guardian advanced safety support system.”</p>\n<p>The 2019 investment into the Uber ATG unit deepened Toyota’s relationship with the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While Uber was facing off against Waymo in the trade secrets lawsuit, Aurora launched with a bang. Within 18 months, Auora had secured several kinds of partnerships with Hyundai, Byton and VW Group. Some have fizzled, while there have been new gains, notably with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The musical chair-like changes underscores the sheer number of hopeful players in the self-driving business &#8212; a market that is still full of commercial and technical unknowns &#8212; and the fickleness of incumbent car makers in search of the best tech and deal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VW Group, which had touted its Aurora partnership in January 2018, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/vws-partnership-with-self-driving-car-startup-aurora-has-ended/\">confirmed to TechCrunch</a> in June 2019 that “activities under our partnership have been concluded.” VW Group ultimately put its capital behind Argo AI, another autonomous vehicle technology developer that had locked up backing and a customer deal with Ford.</p>\n<p>While Hyundai does have a minority stake in Aurora, it also went ahead and locked in a joint venture in fall 2019 with autonomous driving technology company Aptiv. Under the deal with Aptiv, both parties took a 50% ownership stake in the new joint company that is now called Motional. The combined investment in Motional from both companies will total $4 billion in aggregate value (including the value of combined engineering services, R&#38;D and IP).</p>\n<p>Still, Aurora has had its wins. The company raised $530 million last spring in a Series B round led by Sequoia with &#8220;significant investment&#8221; from Amazon and T. Rowe Price. Aurora&#8217;s post-money valuation at the time was $2.5 billion. More recently, sources <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the industry say that Aurora is abuzz with activity, particularly around the office of David Maday, the company&#8217;s new vice president of business development who led General Motors&#8217; corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team for 21 years.<br />\n</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FThlxtHsoq\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/amazon-sequoia-invest-in-self-driving-car-startup-aurora/\">Amazon, Sequoia invest in self-driving car startup Aurora</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon, Sequoia invest in self-driving car startup Aurora&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/amazon-sequoia-invest-in-self-driving-car-startup-aurora/embed/#?secret=FThlxtHsoq\" data-secret=\"FThlxtHsoq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Aurora has always stated that its full driving stack — the combined suite of software and hardware that provides the brains for an AV — would be vehicle-agnostic, but some of its early testing and partnerships suggested it was focused on robotaxi applications, not logistics. Aurora started talking more openly last year about applying its technology to long-haul trucking and has become more bullish on that application, particularly following its Blackmore acquisition.</p>\n<p>Aurora announced in July 2020 that it was expanding into Texas and planned to test commercial routes in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area with a mix of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans and Class 8 trucks. A small fleet of Pacificas were expected to arrive first. The trucks will be on the road in Texas by the end of the year, according to the company.</p>\n<h2>The Jump precedent</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s unclear is how an acquisition of Uber ATG might be structured; and more importantly, if it will retain any interest in the enterprise. Even with the expected depletion in Uber ATG’s valuation, it would be seemingly out-of-range for Aurora unless it was able to secure additional outside investment or structure the deal in a way that would allow Uber to keep some equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is precedent for the latter. Earlier this year, Uber led a $170 million investment round into Lime. As part of the complex arrangement, Uber offloaded Jump, the bike and scooter-sharing unit, to Lime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rumors that Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was keen to get rid of Uber ATG have popped up from time to time in the past year. But as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, Khosrowshahi and other executives began to focus on its core competency of ride-hailing and double down on delivery. In addition to its micromobility unit and the Uber Freight spin-off, it has divested itself internationally of a number of regional operations that were proving too costly to grow in competition with strong local rivals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was on the heels of the Jump deal that interest in selling off Uber ATG ramped up, according to two sources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One investor in the industry described it as an interesting Plan B for Uber, a deal that would allow the company to take ATG off the books, while potentially getting to benefit from a little upside.</span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/F-7iN5MzV40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 22:01:06 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"54447090e54ae8286a76fe347a251f09","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-004_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-03-843_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn67@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-06-123_4ce014f9aaeadbae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=F-7iN5MzV40:SQmzM-4_yDs:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-07-241_135ce8ea5bfc5ff9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-06-130_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/F-7iN5MzV40":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn46@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-19-03-908_472346a985302f42.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421118977},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","title":"NextView Ventures closes its fourth fund with $89 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2073991","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/nextview-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nextview-ventures\">NextView Ventures, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a Boston-based venture capital fund, has raised an $89.6 million fund, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1799458/000179945820000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\">SEC filings. </a>The firm’s fourth fund, its largest to date, is oversubscribed, with <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1799458/000179945820000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\">early documents indicating</a> a $70 million goal.

That sounds familiar.</p>\n<p>Initially, when looking at the data set, we were going to note that consumer fintech startups are having a great year, while it appears that certain B2B fintech categories were pulling back. Indeed, after raising $3.7 billion in 2019, consumer-facing fintechs in North America and Europe have already raised $5.9 billion in 2020.</p>\n<p>But that growth story was dwarfed by the figures on

id=\"speakable-summary\">Online education has been one of the hotspots in the tech world this year, as people turn to e-learning tools to fill in the gaps variously arising from closed schools, closed offices, social distancing and more time on our hands at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And that is giving a big bump to education startups, which are raising money to capitalise on the growth opportunity.</p>\n<p>In one of the latest developments, <a href=\"http://udemy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy</a> &#8212; which provides a marketplace currently numbering some 130,000 video-based courses across 65 languages, ranging from learning Python or how to photograph better, through to mastering mindfulness and business analytics &#8212; is raising up to $100 million in a Series F round of funding that would value the company at up to $3.32 billion.</p>\n<p>The company has filed paperwork for the fundraise in Delaware, first discovered by Justin Byers and the team at <a href=\"https://primeunicornindex.com/udemy-secures-100m-series-f-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prime Unicorn Index</a>. It&#8217;s not clear if the round has closed, and whether the full amount was raised (or indeed, more).</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Contacted for a response, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/udemy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"udemy\">Udemy <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> didn&#8217;t deny the report but also declined to say anything for the moment. &#8220;We have a company policy where we don’t comment on speculations,&#8221; a spokesperson said to me via email. &#8220;We don’t have a comment at this time but I’ll reach out if anything changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The fundraise would be a strong move for Udemy, which only closed its Series E earlier this year &#8212; a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$50 million round</a> that catapulted the company to a $2 billion+ post-money valuation.</p>\n<p>But that was in February, before the novel coronavirus really took hold of the world. Since then, startups focused on education have been seeing a surge of business starting in the spring of this year, and as a result, also a surge of attention from investors who see a good moment to back rising stars.</p>\n<p>Just looking at some of the most recent deals, last week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/udacity-raises-75m-in-debt-says-its-tech-education-business-is-profitable-after-enterprise-pivot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udacity </a>announced a $75 million debt round and said it was finally profitable. In October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kahoot</a> announced a $215 million round from SoftBank.

(And Prime Unicorn, incidentally, also noted that <a href=\"https://primeunicornindex.com/duolingo-secures-35m-series-h-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duolingo</a> is also raising money, up to $35 million at a valuation of $2.21 billion if all shares are issued. We&#8217;re still digging on that lead.)</p>\n<p>When Udemy last raised money, earlier this year, the president of the business division told me it had clocked up 50 million students that purchase courses in an à la carte format, while enterprise customers &#8212; which include Adidas, General Mills, Toyota, Wipro, Pinterest and Lyft in a list of some 5,000 in all &#8212; use a subscription model.</p>\n<p>It looks like its business users have grown and now number over 7,000, according to <a href=\"https://about.udemy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">figures</a> on its site, with total course enrollments now totalling 400 million to date. That could point to the opportunity that Udemy is now exploring with more capital.</p>\n<p>But to be clear, the filing does not detail who is in this latest round, nor what the purpose of the fundraising is.</p>\n<p>As we wrote at the time of the round in February, that fundraise came from a single, strategic investor, the Japanese educational publisher Benesse Holdings, which partners with Udemy in Japan. Benesse&#8217;s bigger business includes developing educational content for children and courses for adults, both online and in-person, and for other educational brands that it owns, such as <a href=\"http://berlitz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Berlitz</a>, and Udemy helps Benesse develop content for those various efforts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0nqXJMIpoo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/udacity-raises-75m-in-debt-says-its-tech-education-business-is-profitable-after-enterprise-pivot/\">Udacity raises $75M in debt, says its tech education business is profitable after enterprise pivot</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Udacity raises $75M in debt, says its tech education business is profitable after enterprise pivot&#8221;

which also shows.</p>\n<p>The original <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> was an incredibly influential game. Its sequel, <em>Dark Souls</em>, was more popular and improved on the first quite a bit, but much of what made the now major series good had already been established. &#8220;Souls-like&#8221; is practically a genre now, though the originals are unsurprisingly still the <em>nonpareil</em>.</p>\n<p>The comparative few who played <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> were elated to hear that it was being remade, and by Bluepoint at that (who also remade the legendary <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>), but worried that the game might not stand up by modern standards.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Can an old game, the essentials of which are a decade behind its descendants, be given a really, really, really <em>ridiculously</em> good-looking coat of paint and still act as a blockbuster next-gen debut? Well, it kind of has to — there&#8217;s no other option! Fortunately the game really does hold up, and in fact makes for a harrowing, cinematic experience despite a few significant creaks.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to give a full review of the game itself; let it suffice to say that, although it looks and runs much better, the core of the game is almost entirely unchanged. Any review from the last decade is still completely relevant, down to the &#8220;magic is overpowered&#8221; and &#8220;inventory burden is annoying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a next-gen gaming experience, however, <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> is as yet without comparison. It serves as a showcase not only for the PS5&#8217;s graphical prowess, but its sound design, haptics, speed and OS.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2073893\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2073893\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2073893\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2073893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>\n<p>First, the graphics. It&#8217;s clear that Sony and Bluepoint intended this to be a truly lavish remake, and the game&#8217;s structure — essentially five long, mostly linear levels — provides an excellent platform for breathtaking visuals carefully tuned to the user&#8217;s experience.</p>\n<p>The environments themselves are incredibly detailed, and the various enemies you fight very well realized, but what I kept being impressed by was the lighting. Realistic lighting is something that has proven difficult even for top-tier developers, and it&#8217;s only now that the hardware has enough headroom to start doing it properly.</p>\n<p><em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> doesn&#8217;t use ray-tracing, the computation-heavy lighting technique perennially on the cusp of being implemented, but the real-time lighting effects are nevertheless dramatic and extremely engaging. This is a dark, dark world and the player is very limited as far as personal light sources, meaning the way you experience the environment is carefully designed.</p>\n<p>Although the detailed armor, props and monsters are all very nice, it&#8217;s the realistic lighting that really sets them off in a way that seems truly new and beautiful. Dynamic range is used properly, to have actually dark areas illuminated dramatically, such as the still-terrifying Tower of Latria.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2073891\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2073891\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2073891\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/demons-souls-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2073891\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>\n<p>The game isn&#8217;t a huge leap over the best the PC has to offer right now, but it does make me excited for game designers who really want to use light and shadow as gameplay elements.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, don&#8217;t bother with the &#8220;cinematic&#8221; option versus &#8220;performance.&#8221; The latter keeps the game silky smooth, which for <em>Souls</em> games is a luxury, and the other setting didn&#8217;t improve the look much if at all, while severely affecting the framerate. Skip it unless you&#8217;re taking glamour shots.)</p>\n<p>Similarly sound is extremely well done in the game, though I&#8217;m cautious about hyping Sony&#8217;s &#8220;3D audio&#8221; — really, games have had this sort of thing for years on many platforms. Having a decent pair of headphones is the important bit. But perhaps the PS5 offers improved workflows for spatializing sound; at all events in <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> it was very good, with great separation, location and clarity. I have reliably dodged an enemy attack from offscreen after recognizing the characteristic grunt of an attacking foe, and the screeches and roars of dragons and boss monsters (as well as the general <em>milieu</em> of Latria) were suitably chilling.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2065845\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2065845\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2065845\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg\" alt=\"A Sony DualSense controller seen from above.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"659\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=1536,989 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=2048,1318 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualsense-hero.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2065845\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>\n<p>This combined well with the improved haptics of the DualSense controller, which seemed to have a different &#8220;sensation&#8221; for every event. A dragon flying overhead, a demon stomping the ground, a blocked attack, an elevator ride. Mostly these were good and only aided immersion, but some, like the elevators, felt to me more like an annoying buzz than a rumble, like holding a power tool. I hope that developers will be sensible about these things and identify vibration patterns that are irritating. Fortunately the intensity can be adjusted universally in the PS5&#8217;s controls.</p>\n<p>Likewise the adaptive triggers were nice but not game-changing. It was helpful when using the bow to know when the arrow was ready to release, for instance, but beyond a few things like that it was not used to great advantage.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rIdDU3bA6C\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/hands-on-sonys-dualsense-ps5-controller-could-be-a-game-changer/\">Hands-on: Sony&#8217;s DualSense PS5 controller could be a game changer</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Hands-on: Sony&#8217;s DualSense PS5 controller could be a game changer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/hands-on-sonys-dualsense-ps5-controller-could-be-a-game-changer/embed/#?secret=rIdDU3bA6C\" data-secret=\"rIdDU3bA6C\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Something that had a more immediate effect on how I played was the incredibly short load times. The Souls series has always been plagued by long load times when traveling and dying, the latter of which you can expect to do a lot. But now it&#8217;s rare that I can count to three before I&#8217;m materializing at the bonfire again.</p>\n<p>This significantly reduces (but far from eliminates) frustration in this infamously unforgiving game, and actually makes me play it differently. Where once I could not be bothered to briefly travel to another area or the hub in order to accomplish some small task, now I know I can return to the Nexus, fuss around a bit with my loadout and be back in Boletaria in 30 seconds flat. If I die, I&#8217;m back in action in five seconds rather than 20, and believe me, that adds up real fast. (Load times are improved across the board in PS4 games running on the PS5 as well.)</p>\n<p>Aiding this, kind of, is the new fancy pause screen Sony has implemented on its new console. When hitting the (annoyingly PS-shaped) PS button, a set of &#8220;cards&#8221; appears showing recent achievements and screenshots, but also ongoing missions or game progress. Pausing in Latria to take a breath, the menu offered up the ability to instantly warp to one of the other worlds, losing my souls but skipping the ordinarily requisite Nexus stop. This will certainly change how speedruns are accomplished, and provides a useful, if somewhat immersion-breaking option for the scatterbrained player.</p>\n<p>The pause menu also provides a venue for tips and hints, in both text and video form. Again, this is a funny game to debut these in (I don&#8217;t count <em>Astro&#8217;s Playroom</em>, the included game/tech demo, which is fun but slight), because one of the <em>Souls</em> series&#8217;s distinctive features is player-generated notes and ghosts that alternatively warn and deceive new players. In another game I might have relied on the PS5&#8217;s hints more, but for this specific title they seem somewhat redundant.</p>\n<p>As arguably the only &#8220;real&#8221; PS5 launch title, <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> is a curious but impressive creature. It definitely shows the new console to advantage in some ways, but the game itself (while still amazing) is dated in many ways, limiting the possibilities of what can be shown off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Certainly the remake is the best (and for many, only) way to play a classic, and for that alone it is recommended — though the $70 price (more in Europe and elsewhere) is definitely a bit of a squinter. One would hope that for the new higher asking price, we could expect next-generation gameplay as well as next-generation trimmings. Well, for now we have to take what we can get.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fLrywlT6mh\"><p><a

class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tScott Kirsner is CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.innovationleader.com/\">Innovation Leader</a>, a research and events firm that focuses on innovation in Global 1000 companies, and a longtime business columnist for The Boston Globe.\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Startups need to live in the future. They create roadmaps, build products and continually upgrade them with an eye on next year — or even a few years out.</p>\n<p>Big companies, often the target customers for startups, live in a much more near-term world. They buy technologies that can solve problems they know about today, rather than those they may face a couple bends down the road. In other words, they’re driving a Dodge, and most tech entrepreneurs are driving a DeLorean equipped with a flux-capacitor.</p>\n<p>That situation can lead to a huge waste of time for startups that want to sell to enterprise customers: a business development black hole. Startups are talking about technology shifts and customer demands that the executives inside the large company — even if they have “innovation,” “IT,” or “emerging technology” in their titles — just don’t see as an urgent priority yet, or can’t sell to their colleagues.</p>\n<p>How do you avoid the aforementioned black hole? Some recent research that my company, <a href=\"https://www.innovationleader.com/\">Innovation Leader</a>, conducted in collaboration with <a href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home.html\">KPMG LLP</a>, suggests a constructive approach.</p>\n<p>Rather than asking large companies about which technologies they were experimenting with, we created four buckets, based on what you might call “commitment level.” (Our survey had 211 respondents, 62% of them in North America and 59% at companies with greater than $1 billion in annual revenue.) We asked survey respondents to assess a list of 16 technologies, from advanced analytics to quantum computing, and put each one into one of these four buckets. We conducted the survey at the tail end of Q3 2020.</p>\n<p>Respondents in the first group were &#8220;not exploring or investing&#8221; — in other words, &#8220;we don’t care about this right now.&#8221; The top technology there was quantum computing.</p>\n<p>Bucket #2 was the second-lowest commitment level: &#8220;learning and exploring.&#8221; At this stage, a startup gets to educate its prospective corporate customer about an emerging technology — but nabbing a purchase commitment is still quite a few exits down the highway. It can be constructive to begin building relationships when a company is at this stage, but your sales staff shouldn’t start calculating their commissions just yet.</p>\n<p>Here are the top five things that fell into the “learning and exploring&#8221; cohort, in ranked order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Blockchain.</li>\n<li>Augmented reality/mixed reality.</li>\n<li>Virtual reality.</li>\n<li>AI/machine learning.</li>\n<li>Wearable devices.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technologies in the third group, &#8220;investing or piloting,&#8221; may represent the sweet spot for startups. At this stage, the corporate customer has already discovered some internal problem or use case that the technology might address. They may have shaken loose some early funding. They may have departments internally, or test sites externally, where they know they can conduct pilots. Often, they’re assessing what established tech vendors like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Cisco can provide — and they may find their solutions wanting.</p>\n<p>Here’s what our survey respondents put into the &#8220;investing or piloting&#8221; bucket, in ranked order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Advanced analytics.</li>\n<li>AI/machine learning.</li>\n<li>Collaboration tools and software.</li>\n<li>Cloud infrastructure and services.</li>\n<li>Internet of things/new sensors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the time a technology is placed into the fourth category, which we dubbed &#8220;in-market or accelerating investment,&#8221; it may be too late for a startup to find a foothold. There’s already a clear understanding of at least <em>some</em> of the use cases or problems that need solving, and return-on-investment metrics have been established. But some providers have already been chosen, based on successful pilots and you may need to dislodge someone that the enterprise is already working with. It can happen, but the headwinds are strong.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the survey respondents placed into the &#8220;in-market or accelerating investment&#8221; bucket, in ranked order:<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ff8dzt7GrZc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:02:59 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"9a7953d6d4a1f899492308fa10c561de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-004_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-03-843_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn54@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-03-923_697b8f9368f9b515.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ff8dzt7GrZc:VCUfJZlE6sE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn89@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-19-04-922_26c46a63f5c5ea4a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-06-130_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ff8dzt7GrZc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-19-04-928_e9f9d2f4eb3bb21d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421118973},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","title":"Google pulls the plug on Expeditions VR app, migrates tours to Arts & Culture","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2073975","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/11/13/google-expeditions/\">today announced</a> that it is ending support for Expeditions.

Before we get into pricing this IPO and guessing what the company might be worth, let&#8217;s strive to understand what portion of its 2020 business gains could stem from the pandemic — and might not persist into the future.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not being pessimistic; we merely want to better understand the company. And DoorDash agrees with our general thrust, writing in its S-1 filing that &#8220;58% of all adults and 70% of millennials say that they are more likely to have restaurant food delivered than they were two years ago,&#8221; adding that it believes &#8220;the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated these trends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even more, elsewhere in its filings DoorDash states plainly that COVD-19 led it to experience &#8220;a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace [gross order volume] due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery and take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform.&#8221; The company then went on to warn investors that the &#8220;circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rates in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace [gross order volume] to decline in future periods.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not idly speculating.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s observe how DoorDash&#8217;s growth accelerated from 2019 through 2020 and then peek at how the company&#8217;s economics improved during the same period, giving the company a shot at adjusted profitability for the full year, a nearly unheard of result in the on-demand market.</p>\n<h2>Growth</h2>\n<p>DoorDash generates revenue when a customer orders food via its service, splitting the total bill of food costs, taxes, fees and tips, distributing them to itself, the merchant creating the goods and the delivery person.</p>\n<p>In an &#8220;illustrative&#8221; example that DoorDash notes its 2019 &#8220;approximate average per-order information,&#8221; the split works out as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bill:</strong> $32.90</li>\n<li><strong>Merchant:</strong> $20.10, or 61%</li>\n<li><strong>DoorDash:</strong> $4.90, or 15%</li>\n<li><strong>Delivery person:</strong> $7.90, or 24%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the company is giving us old data and DoorDash&#8217;s performance has been stellar this year in terms of generating more gross profit, I wonder what has happened amidst 2020&#8217;s upheaval. But, the old numbers do for what we need, which is to understand the link between gross order volume (GOV) and DoorDash revenue. When the former goes up, the latter goes up.</p>\n<p>So, as orders rise:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2073816\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?w=611\" alt=\"\" width=\"611\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" /><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PONX0wj98xs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 19:28:43 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?w=611","linkMd5":"8710bb84e2533b0920f80312bd1b4955","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-434_b4d86fd93a40bde1.webp","destWidth":611,"destHeight":354,"sourceBytes":10242,"destBytes":10242,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-12.53.26-PM.png?w=611":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-434_b4d86fd93a40bde1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-004_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-03-843_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn38@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-04-960_2575c5249e43709a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PONX0wj98xs:9JV4Lqpj5pE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn40@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-079_5e0e9264b955b986.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-06-130_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PONX0wj98xs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn66@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-16-051_07eb011bbcf34bf9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421118955},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","title":"Getaround tops up $25M debt financing to its $140M Series E","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2073755","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Silicon Valley peer-to-peer car rental startup <a href=\"https://www.getaround.com/\">Getaround</a> has secured <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/horizon-technology-finance-provides-25-million-venture-loan-facility-to-getaround-301172251.html\">a $25 million loan</a> from Horizon Technology Finance Corporation.

Unlike other mobility companies, Getaround doesn&#8217;t own the cars, trucks and SUVs on its rental platform, a benefit that could help the company weather a short downturn.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vzsJ2xT231\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/top-mobility-vcs-on-the-risks-and-rewards-in-partnering-with-giants-like-amazon/\">Top mobility VCs on the risks and rewards in partnering with giants like Amazon</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Top mobility VCs on the risks and rewards in partnering with giants like Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/top-mobility-vcs-on-the-risks-and-rewards-in-partnering-with-giants-like-amazon/embed/#?secret=vzsJ2xT231\" data-secret=\"vzsJ2xT231\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pLeyN-Yb1Bk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:38:51 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e95171d46aba0af8e8d16a52d1d1217d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-004_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-03-843_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn66@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-05-141_89764e89f2dc8907.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pLeyN-Yb1Bk:uCIMOvwznEQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-19-06-114_7b60e4ad19bc7d99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-06-130_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pLeyN-Yb1Bk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn49@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-03-874_8fc0a3cefb85c074.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421118956},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","title":"Nintendo’s Mario Game & Watch is a choice gaming stocking stuffer","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2071585","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/nintendo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nintendo\">Nintendo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> will never stop mining its past for new nostalgia-based products, but at least it tends to do so with aplomb and occasionally even generosity.

If you watch for a while he&#8217;ll moonwalk, mount a pipe and perform other hijinks. You can switch the background from normal to hills to mushroom platforms. I wouldn&#8217;t use it as a watch, but if you don&#8217;t want to pull your phone out while you&#8217;re playing, there you go.</p>\n<p>For $50 it may seem a little steep, and perhaps it is. If this had Marios 1 through 3 on it I would consider it a bargain, especially considering the ability to come back to the game time after time — I&#8217;d work my way through the epic-length third game with pleasure.</p>\n<p>As it is, however, it&#8217;s hard to justify the price — except, of course, as a gift to a Nintendo-loving friend or loved one. That&#8217;s why I suspect these will sell like hotcakes this holiday season. With no new Switch hardware, no N64 mini and no must-have games on Nintendo&#8217;s platforms, it&#8217;s looking a bit dry, but a Game &#38; Watch is just silly enough — and decent enough — a device to sate the hunger of a retro-minded gamer for a few days.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TbD3r67TPB\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/nintendo-rips-the-seal-off-the-next-generation-of-nostalgia-but-fans-fret/\">Nintendo rips the seal off the next generation of nostalgia, but fans fret</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Nintendo rips the seal off the next generation of nostalgia, but fans fret&#8221;

Now it has filed an S-1, revealing its financials as it nears a long-intended IPO. These innards show an exciting business — and a larger story about how the year is going for tech companies in general.</p>\n<p>When the company filed initial public offering paperwork back in February, it was coming off of an expensive year of growth in 2019. The California state legislature was passing laws, meanwhile, that directly targeted its gig-economy labor model. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/doordash-files-to-go-public/\">Then the pandemic hit. More from Alex Wilhelm</a>:</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>DoorDash has grown incredibly rapidly, scaling its revenues from $291 million in 2018 to $885 million in 2019. And more recently, from $587 million in the first nine months of 2019 to $1.92 billion in the same period of 2020. That is 226% growth in 2020 thus far&#8230; How high-quality is DoorDash’s revenue? In the first three quarters of 2019, the company had gross margins of 39.9%, and in the same period of 2020 the figure rose to 53.1%, a huge improvement for the consumer consumable delivery confab.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The other jolt of good news for the company arrived last week. A California ballot proposition passed that preserved the contractor model it relies on for deliveries.</p>\n<p>World events did not take a breath, though. A COVID-19 vaccine appeared on the horizon this week, and could lead to the pandemic ending as soon as next year. Will this be bad for DoorDash&#8217;s business? Alex took <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/\">another look at the numbers for Extra Crunch</a>, and didn&#8217;t come away with a clear answer. On the one hand, the company has been making ongoing investments in its delivery platform technology, which has helped to drive the success this year already. On the other hand, the S-1 is open about post-pandemic reality — profitability is going to decline. Alex:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To buy into the DoorDash IPO, especially at its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex/status/1327313096587829248\">currently floated $25 billion price</a>, you have to believe that the company’s revenue <em>growth</em> will slow modestly at <em>most</em>. Otherwise the price makes no sense. Bearish investors who might expect the company to post negative growth in Q3 2021 won’t pay any price for DoorDash shares, but in between the two camps is a mess of vaccine timings, shifts in consumer behavior and macroeconomic questions that could determine how many American families can afford delivery. All of which will impact DoorDash’s future growth rates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those looking further out, DoorDash stock is about how you think the pandemic is going to change the world for the long term, or not. Are we going to be using DoorDash more often now for deliveries? Are we going to be at home as much in the first place? Or are we going to go back to offices, stores and restaurants like we did before?</p>\n<p>Speaking of investors, Danny Crichton illustrates why it pays to bet on the world changing. The company has raised nearly $2.5 billion over the years. Today that includes an 18.2% ownership stake by Sequoia, 22.1% by the SoftBank Vision Fund, and 9.3% by Singapore&#8217;s GIC. As he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/\">writes for Extra Crunch</a>, the founding executives Tony Xu, Andy Fang and Stanley Tang each own around 5% — smallish wedges of a growing pie. Maybe that is too much dilution? Or maybe, considering all of the other delivery companies that have failed or gone sideways, this is the pinnacle of success in the sector.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2071234\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2071234\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2071234\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg\" alt=\"A health care worker holds an injection syringe of the phase 3 vaccine trial, developed against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by the U.S. Pfizer and German BioNTech company, at the Ankara University Ibni Sina Hospital in Ankara, Turkey\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg 2126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229305344.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2071234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Dogukan Keskinkilic/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)</p></div></p>\n<h2><em><strong>The Vaccine</strong></em></h2>\n<p>We all knew that at some point solutions would be figured out.

It’s somewhat complicated to do this, not least because they are sprawled across a number of Tencent properties and, unlike Ant, don’t go by a single brand or operational structure — at least, not one that is obvious to the outside world. However, when you tease out Tencent’s fintech activity across its wider footprint — from direct operations like WeChat Pay through to its sizeable strategic investments and third-party marketplaces — you have something comparable in size to Ant, and in some services even bigger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1159174\" style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1159174\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1159174\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png 754w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-18-at-1-38-19-pm.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1159174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/the_progressive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the_progressive <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flickr <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a> under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CC BY-SA 2.0 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a> license.

Here&#8217;s more, from his guest column for Extra Crunch this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Earlier this year, we launched <a href=\"https://solitaired.com/\">Solitaired</a>, a casual gaming platform that ties card games to educational experiences and brain training. We’re still early, but signs are encouraging: Our average time on site is 30 minutes, more than three times that of our earlier business. Even better, users come back often, on average returning more than five times per month. Since we’re now in the gaming space, we should have expected these metrics, but they still blew our expectations away. We’ve also found that the downsides can be mitigated. For example, high engagement has led to strong virality, driving down our CAC and increasing our growth. In-app purchase abuses can be tempting for game developers, but by focusing on user growth KPIs, we don’t have the desire to go down those routes. Lastly, the threat of Big Tech is there, but at present most of their attempts have yet to strike a chord among users. More importantly, that’s why choosing a market so massive that even individual Big Tech players can’t dominate is key: With a market this size, you can shoot for the stars, miss the moon and still do well for yourself.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Around TechCrunch</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/pioneers-of-in-space-refueling-and-manufacturing-join-tc-sessions-space-2020/\">Pioneers of in-space refueling and manufacturing join TC Sessions: Space 2020</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/nasas-head-of-human-spaceflight-kathy-lueders-will-join-us-at-tc-sessions-space/\">NASA’s head of human spaceflight, Kathryn Lueders, will join us at TC Sessions: Space</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/get-fast-money-for-your-space-startup-at-tc-sessions-space-this-december/\">Get fast money for your space startup at TC Sessions Space this December</a></p>\n<h2>Across the week</h2>\n<p><em>TechCrunch</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/this-startup-is-betting-that-you-want-to-binge-remote-work-content/\">This startup is betting that you want to binge remote-work content</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/calling-dublin-vcs-be-featured-in-the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-european-vc/\">Calling Dublin VCs: Be featured in The Great TechCrunch Survey of European VC</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/\">Human Capital: The gig economy in a post-Prop 22 world</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/\">‘Free speech’ social network Parler tops app store rankings following Biden’s election win</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/renewable-power-represents-almost-90-of-total-global-power-capacity-added-in-2020/\">Renewable power represents almost 90% of total global power capacity added in 2020</a></p>\n<p><em>Extra Crunch</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/square-and-paypal-earnings-bring-good-and-bad-news-for-fintech-startups/\">Square and PayPal earnings bring good (and bad) news for fintech startups</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/what-i-wish-id-known-about-venture-capital-when-i-was-a-founder\">What I wish I’d known about venture capital when I was a founder</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/conflicts-in-californias-trade-secret-laws-on-customer-lists-create-uncertainty/\">Conflicts in California’s trade secret laws on customer lists create uncertainty</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/what-weve-learned-about-working-from-home-7-months-into-the-pandemic/\">What we’ve learned about working from home 7 months into the pandemic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/dear-sophie-what-does-a-biden-win-for-tech-immigration/\">Dear Sophie: What does Biden’s win mean for tech immigration?</a></p>\n<h2>#EquityPod</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/th-os-r-ptinal-th-dllrs-r-mndtry/\">From Alex</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Hello and welcome back to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA\">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/equitypod\">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</em></p>\n<p><em>The full Equity crew was on hand to debate the current venture capital market, curious about how risk-on, or risk-off things really are today. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannycrichton\">Danny</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_\">Natasha</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alex\">I</a> framed the conversation around a number of news items from the week, including:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://wrkfrce.com/\">Wrkfrce</a> has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/this-startup-is-betting-that-you-want-to-binge-remote-work-content/\">launched</a>, and we wanted to chat more about the future of niche media, bringing The Juggernaut’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/the-juggernaut-seed/\">own recent round</a> and the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1930012/join-our-mission-to-make-business-better-as-quartz-becomes-an-independent-media-company/\">Quartz shakeup</a> into the conversation.</em></li>\n<li><em>And on the media front — always a risky venture capital investing domain — Spotify has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/\">snapped up another podcasting company</a>, this time paying $235 for Megaphone.

Holgado, who is Black, worked at CZI from September 2018 through August 2020.</p>\n<p>“Despite its social justice rhetoric, CZI is not a welcoming environment for Black employees,” Holgado’s complaint states. “Black employees are underpaid, undervalued, denied growth opportunities, and marginalized. Black employees who want to advance within the organization are shut down and labeled as too assertive or aggressive, while non-Black employees are favored and encouraged. When Black employees have communicated these concerns to CZI leadership, CZI has responded defensively and failed to address the underlying issues. CZI has utterly failed to ‘build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future’ for its Black employees.”</p>\n<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, CZI denied the claims.</p>\n<p>“While we take any allegation of discrimination seriously and will do so here, this former employee’s specific allegations were previously raised internally, independently investigated, and found to be unsubstantiated,” the spokesperson said. “The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is committed to fair treatment, access, and advancement for all members of the CZI team. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind, full stop.”</p>\n<h3>DEI nuggets from DoorDash’s S-1</h3>\n<p>Food delivery company DoorDash filed its paperwork to go public today. It’s a long document, so I’ve pulled out the relevant items related to DEI and labor.</p>\n<p><strong>DoorDash says it’s committed to diversity and inclusion in its S-1, despite never having released a diversity report</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>At DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the cities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has ‘room at the table’ and the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>DoorDash also seems to be proud of the fact that none of its 3,279 employees have unionized:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>DoorDash, like other gig economy companies, is also gearing up to pursue Prop 22-like legislation in other states:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>As such, the passage of the 2020 California ballot initiative is likely to have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, several other states where we operate may be considering adopting legislation similar to the 2020 California ballot initiative, which we would expect to increase our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions and could also adversely impact our results of operations.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Spora Health launches primary care provider network for Black people and POC</h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2070773\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2070773\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2070773\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2070773\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spora Health</p></div></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/spora-health-launches-primary-care-network-for-black-people-and-people-of-color/\">Spora Health launched</a> its One Medical-like primary care provider network for Black people and people of color.</p>\n<p>“An equitable healthcare system has never existed in America, especially for Black folks and that is the goal,” Spora Health  founder and CEO Dan Miller told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Spora Health, which recently closed a $1.2 million seed round, is a primary care provider for Black people and people of color. Initially, Spora Health is taking a telemedicine approach, but eventually plans to open physical locations.</p>\n<h3>Lyft on passage of Prop 22</h3>\n<p>“As we look to the future, the win on Proposition 22 in California was a landmark achievement and a major victory for drivers, our industry and the broader Lyft community,” <a href=\"https://investor.lyft.com/static-files/adfd1bd4-f094-4724-8b6c-5caf1e5b3fd8\">Lyft President John Zimmer said in Lyft’s earnings report this week</a>. “The campaign was successful because it ultimately reflected the desires and priorities of drivers. More than 120,000 drivers signed up to be part of the effort to pass Prop 22 – they rallied, they volunteered, they shared their stories. Voters saw that and stood in solidarity with them. We look forward to continuing our conversations with policymakers across the country.”</p>\n<p>Similar to Uber, Lyft is also looking to explore similar legislation across the country. On the earnings call, Lyft CEO Logan Green said Prop 22 provides a model for other states.</p>\n<h3>Uber and Lyft request rehearing on case that upheld preliminary injunction</h3>\n<p>Uber and Lyft both filed a petition for rehearings in the case brought forth by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. Last month, an appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that would force Uber and Lyft to classify their drivers as employees. But now that Proposition 22 has passed, Uber and Lyft want the court to determine if the injunction is still appropriate.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft will likely still face lawsuits over worker classification in California since the recently-passed proposition can not be applied retroactively. According to Bloomberg Law, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/california-gig-workers-still-can-sue-for-wages-after-prop-22\">those legal options</a>, however, will be limited and damages will be capped.</p>\n<h3>Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on Prop 22</h3>\n<p>In a joint statement, the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called Prop 22 a “devastating blow to the rights” of gig workers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/11/california-prop-22-is-a-devastating-blow-to-the-rights-of-app-based-workers/#_edn3\">Here’s a snippet</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No worker should face exploitative or otherwise abusive work conditions, but many app-based workers do. We urge app-based companies to bring their wage and labor policies and practices in line with international human and labor rights standards. We urge the government of California to explore other legal avenues for holding companies accountable for respecting workers’ rights. Finally, we urge the United States Congress and the United States Department of Labor to protect the rights of app-based workers, such as through legislative and regulatory action that helps ensure a living wage, paid sick and family leave, and workers’ compensation for illness and injury.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"newsletter__block__header\">\n<h3>Biden promises to get gig workers the “benefits and protections they deserve”</h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2070946\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2070946\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2070946\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\" width=\"680\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=1536,1047 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=2048,1396 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2070946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TOPSHOT &#8211; Former vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden (L) and Senator from California and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris greet supporters outside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware, at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention, held virtually amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, on August 20, 2020.

The administration goes on to describe how gig workers are misclassified and therefore deprived of their rightful benefits and protections.</p>\n<p>“This epidemic of misclassification is made possible by ambiguous legal tests that give too much discretion to employers, too little protection to workers, and too little direction to government agencies and courts,” the site states.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Biden says he will work with Congress to create a federal standard that is modeled on the ABC test. Whether Biden follows through with that promise, however, has yet to be seen.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adv8g/biden-promised-to-reclassify-gig-workers-but-how-will-he-actually-do-it\">read more</a> about how gig workers feel about the upcoming Biden administration as it relates to labor over on <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adv8g/biden-promised-to-reclassify-gig-workers-but-how-will-he-actually-do-it\">Vice</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/qeJqab90ka0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 23:00:55 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gettyimages-512266184.jpg?w=680","linkMd5":"9bbb4b49abc85ba8dab0893643ddc662","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn37@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-504_c8e9c1a79287e8cb.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":470,"sourceBytes":90182,"destBytes":90182,"author":"Megan Rose Dickey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gettyimages-512266184.jpg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn37@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-504_c8e9c1a79287e8cb.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Assets-Press.001.jpeg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn5@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-19-04-998_5f0c1c2cda059d24.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-harris-GettyImages-1228132294.jpg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn74@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-19-05-004_54a34d8025ba04b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-39-312_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-19-06-004_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-03-843_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-19-04-003_517621f86a9d92ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=qeJqab90ka0:9jyrHBPs42U:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn70@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-05-145_22be4470b25f2472.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_4/2020/11/15/06-19-06-130_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/qeJqab90ka0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn37@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-19-15-982_5daf04a5c14f56c8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421118940},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:38","title":"As COVID surges, what can data tell us about Airbnb’s recovery?","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2073947","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><em>This is The TechCrunch Exchange, a newsletter that goes out on Saturdays, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/\">based on the column of the same name</a>. You can sign up for the email <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">DoorDash filed to go public on Friday, meaning we’ll have at least one more unicorn IPO before 2020 comes to a close. For a high-level look at its numbers, I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/doordash-files-to-go-public/\">wrote this</a>, Danny covered who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/the-vc-and-founder-winners-of-doordashs-ipo/\">will profit from the deal</a>, and I noodled on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/\">the impact of COVID-19 on its business</a>.</p>\n<p>I bring all that up because there is another COVID-19 impacted unicorn that we are expecting to see go public in very short order: Airbnb.</p>\n<p>When Airbnb <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/airbnb-has-confidentially-filed-to-go-public/#:~:text=In%20a%20turn%20of%20fortune,an%20IPO%20filing%20this%20month.\">filed to go public in August</a>, it seemed like a solid plan. The company was widely reported to be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/understanding-airbnbs-summer-recovery/\">on an upswing from its COVID-doldrums</a>, the public markets <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii/\">were hot for growth and tech shares</a>, and the pandemic’s caseload in the United States was coming down from its summer highs. It looked great for Airbnb to wrap its Q3, drop its public S-1 with the new numbers, and laugh all the way to the bank after showing investors that even a global pandemic and travel industry depression couldn’t stop it.</p>\n<p>And yet. The United States and world at large are now in the midst of the worst COVID-19 spike yet, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kr00ney/status/1327339099917873152\">consumer spend is going down</a> right before we get the company’s S-1. November feels less winsome for an Airbnb recovery than August or September did. Still, when Airbnb files &#8212; next week, the scuttlebutt indicates, so get ready &#8212; we’ll only have a look at its numbers through the third quarter.</p>\n<p>That’s effectively the same timeframe for a dataset that the folks at <a href=\"https://www.cardify.ai/\">Cardify</a> sent over and I dug through. Per the company, which tracks real-time consumer spend data, here’s a look at how well Airbnb recovered ahead of its larger industry after the initial recession in pandemic lodging spend:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2073950 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.24-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.24-PM.png 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.24-PM.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.24-PM.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.24-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" /></p>\n<p>Impressive, right? Sadly for Airbnb, the initial boom of demand through late June into July tapered as time continued.</p>\n<p>Zooming in somewhat, here’s Airbnb spend data from July 2020 through the end of October, the first month of Q4, compared to the same period of 2019:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2073951\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.39-PM.png?w=620\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.39-PM.png 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.39-PM.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.39-PM.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-3.06.39-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>Declines, then, but still an encouraging set of data for the company regardless. I would not have expected Airbnb spend &#8212; via third-party, admittedly &#8212; to be this strong.</p>\n<p>The trend of folks renting a house for a month seems to have diminished somewhat, in case you are factoring that into your mental math concerning Airbnb revenues from the above charts. Cardify told TechCrunch that after peaking at around +70% in the March-April timeframe, “average booking sizes have now normalized and are approximately 30% higher on a YTD basis.”</p>\n<p>There is weakness in October, the charts show, but that appears to be at least partially seasonal given the 2019 line, so I don’t want to over-ascribe rising COVID cases as the cause. The drooping line, however, was echoed in similar <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/\">SimilarWeb</a> data that was also shared with The Exchange. The dataset concerned accommodation booking volume around the world for a number of travel services, including Airbnb. Its data tracking the US market showed that a bookings recovery through September that made up some ground on March lows was undercut by October declines. Europe’s bookings’ recovery peaked in July and has been falling ever since. Asian volume is creeping higher, but down sharply from prior levels.</p>\n<p>It was a mixed picture, but as Airbnb is doing better than its broader industry per Cardify, the aggregated data could be leading us to be more pessimistic than we otherwise need to be. We’ll see shortly what the real numbers are, but I couldn&#8217;t help but share what I was reading with you. On to the S-1!</p>\n<p><em>Before DoorDash filed, we were going to talk about Brex today in this space after Airbnb. But, since we got extra busy, expect those notes early next week on The Exchange.</em></p>\n<h2>Market Notes</h2>\n<p><em>The week was super busy with earnings, so I’ve collected a few notes from calls with select companies after they reported. Apologies to everyone&#8217;s’ favorite reporting firm, but we’re space-limited.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Appian</strong> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3633206-appianplus-15-on-earnings-smasher-provides-q4-and-fy-guidance\">crushed</a> earnings expectations. What drove the low-code application development services’ growth forward? According to CEO Matt Calkins, it wasn’t a single thing. Instead, the company’s performance was driven by a long ramp he said, though he did also state that the concept of low-code has reached the public consciousness in new, higher levels during the last few quarters.</p>\n<p>Why? The year’s chaos pushed companies into new patterns faster than they had anticipated. Chalk this result up to the accelerating digital transformation being real, which is good news for startups. (For more on Appian and the low-code space, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps/\">head here</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Alteryx</strong> gave The Exchange an earnings first, providing both its newly former CEO Dean Stoecker and its new CEO Mark Anderson to chat results. The company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3632548-alteryx-eps-beats-0_25-beats-on-revenue\">crushed Q3 expectations</a>, but its Q4 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3633215-sell-side-weighs-in-alteryx-tumbles-on-soft-q4-outlook\">projections</a> did not excite investors. What was up? Anderson argued that ARR growth, not forward GAAP revenue projections, is the most transparent and clear view of an expanding software company, to paraphrase his thinking. You can’t ignore revenue, he said, but given the nuances in how revenue is counted, pay attention to ARR.</p>\n<p>Alteryx has a solid ARR target for 2021. We’ll see how investors view its Q4 results and if they align their thinking to that of the new CEO. Alteryx’s former CEO is bullish, saying that in time the market will realize that analytics is at the epicenter of digital transformation. And his company will be there with code to sell.</p>\n<p>Moving along, earlier this week I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/5-vcs-discuss-the-future-of-saas-and-software-after-pfizers-vaccine-breakthrough/\">asked a number of VCs about the software venture capital market</a> in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/positive-vaccine-news-punishes-pandemic-boosted-companies-like-zoom-peloton-etsy/\">Monday’s sharp selloff</a> and my question about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/\">what might happen to public and private software companies</a> if other stocks suddenly became more attractive &#8212; strong vaccine news on Monday was later overwhelmed by surging cases as the week went along, but on Monday Zoom lost billions in value as investors fled.</p>\n<p>One set of responses came in late, but I wanted to share them all the same as they were more bullish than I anticipated. In the view of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laela-sturdy-376543/\">Laela Sturdy</a>, a general partner at Alphabet <strong>Capital G</strong>, “private software investors are unlikely to change their investing patterns much as a result of fluctuations in the public market,” adding later that “public market changes would have to be very extreme &#8212; as in 30 percent or more &#8212; in order to impact growth stage valuations.”</p>\n<p>The connection between public valuations and trading patterns and private capital deployment exists, but how closely the two are linked depends on what’s happening at any given moment, and it appears that at the moment private investor excitement about software is durable.</p>\n<p>Sturdy explained why that may be: “Long-term secular trends around cloud adoption, automation and AI, data, security, fintech infrastructure, and the ongoing rapid acceleration of digital transformation will help tech companies maintain their status as the darlings of growth investors in both the private and public markets.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hopin raised $125 million at a $2.125 billion valuation after scaling to $20 million in ARR in under a year. Wow.</li>\n<li>Square and PayPal earnings <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/square-and-paypal-earnings-bring-good-and-bad-news-for-fintech-startups/\">augur well for fintech startups overall</a>, though it appears that most fintech money is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/\">going to only the latest-stages of that niche</a>. (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/truebill-series-c/\">TrueBill just raised $17 million, notably</a>.)</li>\n<li>Udemy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/filing-online-learning-marketplace-udemy-is-raising-up-to-100m-at-a-3-32b-valuation/\">wants $100 million more</a>.</li>\n<li>What’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/as-public-investors-reprice-edtech-bets-whats-ahead-for-the-hot-startup-sector/\">ahead for edtech startups</a> now that edtech stocks are taking hits?</li>\n<li>Menlo Security <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/menlo-security-announces-100m-series-e-on-800m-valuation/\">landed $100 million more at an $800 million valuation</a>. Not bad!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>\n<p>And finally, the rest of the stuff that I couldn’t get to this week. Here we go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chatted with <a href=\"https://www.cic.vc/\">Cambridge Innovation Capital</a>, a neat venture capital firm from Cambridge in the U.K. &#8212; not the Cambridge on the American East Coast. More to say here, but the good news is that hubs of innovation really are maturing into startup factories the world around.</li>\n<li>I got my hands on an early copy of a survey of LPs put together by <a href=\"https://allocate.gp/\">Allocate</a>.

Still, it largely took Americans by surprise when, as the U.S. began to shut down to slow the spread of Covid-19 in March, schools grappled with how to move forward with online classes.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a matter of altering students&#8217; curriculum. Many lacked either internet access or home computers &#8212; and some lacked both. According to USAFacts, a non-partisan organization funded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer,  <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/internet-access-students-at-home/\">4.4 million households</a> with children have not had consistent access to computers for online learning during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a problem that two Stanford students, Isabel Wang and Margot Bellon, are doing everything in their power to address, and with some success. Through their six-month-old 501(c)(3) outfit, <a href=\"https://www.bridgingtech.org/\">Bridging Tech</a>, they&#8217;ve already provided more than 400 refurbished laptops to children who need them most &#8212; those living in homeless shelters &#8212; beginning with students in the Bay Area where there are an estimated 2,000 homeless students in San Francisco alone.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, it began as a passion project for both, though both sound committed to building an enduring organization. They always cared about the digital divide; now they&#8217;ve seen too much to walk away from it.</p>\n<p>Wang, for her part, grew up in the affluent Cleveland, Oh., suburb of Shaker Heights, which has &#8220;always had racial tensions,&#8221; she notes. (The best-selling novel &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.celesteng.com/little-fires-everywhere\">Little Fires Everywhere</a>&#8221; is set in the same place, for the same reason.) Partly as a result of &#8220;racism in our community,&#8221; Wang became involved early on in public health initiatives that address those from underserved backgrounds, and part of that focus centered on <a href=\"https://www.shaker.org/protected/ArticleView.aspx?iid=6G22IP2&#38;dasi=2YY\">equitable access to education</a>.</p>\n<p>Bellon, a biology major who met Wang at Outdoor House, a student-initiated outdoors-themed house at Stanford, had similar interests early on, she says. Growing up in San Mateo, Ca., she volunteered in homeless shelters in high school and in college, experiences that made her aware of the challenges created by a lack of access to technology. For many, just getting WiFi can mean having to linger outside a Starbucks, she notes, and often, the only computer available is inside a library.</p>\n<p>As the world shut down in the spring, Bellon realized these options were no longer available to the many people desperately needing them, just as Wang was coming to her own worried conclusions. The friends joined forces and now <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">30 other volunteers, almost all fellow Stanford students, are also contributing to the effort.</span></p>\n<p>So far, Bridging Tech has been most focused on securing laptops for students lacking access to tech. Citrix Systems and Genetech have been among the bigger donors, but it&#8217;s easy to imagine that the nascent organization could use far more help from the region&#8217;s many tech giants.</p>\n<p>Once it has lightly used computers in its possession, they are distributed to a handful of refurbishers with which Bridging Tech has partnered. All guarantee their work for a year. One of these partners, <a href=\"https://www.c2sdk.org/\">Computers 2 Kids</a> in San Diego, also provides clear instructions so that children can get up and running without much assistance.</p>\n<p>Bellon says that homeless shelters in the Bay Area typically have <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonfamilies.org/\">tech volunteers</a> who help children turn on the computers and get set up, and that organizations like <a href=\"https://www.sheltertech.org/\">ShelterTech</a> have partnered with Bridging Tech to ensure these young computer recipients also have access to WiFi.</p>\n<p>The devices are also gifted permanently.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Bridging Tech has also launched a tutoring program, as well as a mentorship program based on more skill-based activities like computer science.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces for two college students who not so long ago were primarily focused on getting through the next assignment. That&#8217;s not keeping them from barreling ahead into other geographies based on the traction they&#8217;ve seen in Northern California. Bellon says that they&#8217;ve already talked with shelters in New York, L.A. Boston, Washington, Atlanta, and a handful of other cities.</p>\n<p>As they&#8217;re made more aware by the day, all around the country, disadvantaged kids who&#8217;ve been forced into distance learning because the pandemic are falling further behind their peers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not an issue that the federal or state governments are going to solve alone without more resolve. Consider that about one in five teenagers in America said in a 2018 Pew Research Center survey that they are often or sometimes unable to complete homework assignments because they <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/26/nearly-one-in-five-teens-cant-always-finish-their-homework-because-of-the-digital-divide/\">don&#8217;t have reliable access to a computer or internet connection</a>. In the same survey, one quarter of lower-income teens said they did not have access to a home computer.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest questions for Wang and Bellon is how they scale their ambitions. Right now, for example, the computers being refurbished by Bridging Tech are being delivered to shelters directly by volunteers who drive them there. Bridging Tech doesn&#8217;t yet have the network or infrastructure elsewhere to ensure that the same happens in other cities.</p>\n<p>Both founders are aware of their limitations. Wang says very explicitly that Bridging Tech needs not only more device donations but could also use the skills of a grant writer, a marketer, and a development professional who can help introduce the outfit to other potential partner organizations. &#8220;We&#8217;re college students, so anything people can teach us is very valuable,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>She also readily concedes that Bridging Tech &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have the process nailed down for in-kind donations in other cities, so we&#8217;re mostly beginning to purchase those devices.&#8221; (One way it&#8217;s doing this is via an organization called <a href=\"https://www.whistlesell.com/\">Whistle</a> that pays users for their old devices but also enables them to donate the proceeds.)</p>\n<p>Still, the two want to keep at it, even after Wang returns to school and Bellon moves on next year to a master&#8217;s program.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a more equitable society,&#8221; says Bellon, tech clearly needs to be equitable. &#8220;Covid has exacerbated these issues, but you need tech for everything and that&#8217;s not going away.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a
