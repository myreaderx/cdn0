In the case of strain produced by a\r\nsharp tip pressing at the center of a suspended TMDC membrane, the excitons are transported to the\r\npoint of the highest strain at the center of the membrane. This effect, exciton funneling, can be\r\nused to increase photoconversion efficiency in TMDC, to explore exciton transport and to study\r\ncorrelated states of excitons arising at their high densities. Here, we analyze the limits of\r\nfunneling efficiency in realistic device geometries. The funneling efficiency in realistic monolayer\r\nTMDCs is found to be low, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2053-1583/8/1/015010/tdmabbabfieqn1.gif]\r\n{$ \\lt$} 5% both at room and low temperatures. This results from dominant diffusion at room\r\ntemperature and short exciton lifetimes at low temperatures. On the other hand, in TMDC he...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":6527,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b97044c33ac05247f4748f1e3855a351","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Moshe G Harats and Kirill I Bolotin","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605679985385}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 14:13:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 14:13:05","feedId":6527,"fetchDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:13:05 +0000","fetchMs":51793,"handleMs":14,"totalMs":51809,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d4510fc825f54523eea4f1b6f606b860","hostName":"us-52*","requestId":"6fa172ba9326492c934c860eb1a5791d_6527","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:33:05","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:13:20","id":6527,"name":"2D Materials - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/2053-1583/?rss=1","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn45@2020_3/2020/09/06/04-13-20-112_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for 2D Materials","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605679933578,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":51794,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":14,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
