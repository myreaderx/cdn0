Now, however, at this unknowable point on the map of contagion, I seem to have skipped forward a couple of tracks and, like a badly scratched LP, feel about 20 years older than I was last March.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">It struck me last weekend when, in an angry fit of boredom and in an effort to escape refilling the shagging dishwasher for the hundredth time that week, I got into my dented motor car, put my foot on the accelerator and, with no particular destination in mind, ended up parking on Dublin’s Merrion Square. I turned the engine off just as twilight was flashing the moon a nighty-night wink.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Saturday night and the city lay open like an empty suitcase. Bar a lone garda diligently surveying the lonesome air outside the side entrance to the Dáil, Merrion Square was deserted. Maybe in his isolation, he was trying to figure out – given some of our elected officials’ penchant for a suntan and a party – just who needed protection from whom.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Baggot Street swung empty, Stephen’s Green creaked open on a rusty hinge.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">There was life on Grafton Street; a busker loud and mournful belted out his bespoke lyrics: “I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain falling on Dublin town.” I silently answered in the affirmative. I’ve known this city in many a deluge, mate, I’m just deeply unfamiliar with it in a drought.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">I found myself following the bruised thighs of a young girl in booty shorts, as she and her similarly attired friend wove their way down the sparsely populated street.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">It was a chilly August evening; the lacy edges of the child’s flimsy cotton shorts skimmed her goosepimpled, patchily spray-tanned skin. I’m of the opinion that anyone can and should wear whatever they damn well like, but sometimes you’d question the whimsical cruelty of the fashion industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"related-articles--instream has-3\"> \n</aside> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Outside Dunnes Stores, closed for the night, people, mainly men, quietly queued up for food from a mobile soup kitchen. I was struck by their stillness, their ordinariness, their unremarkable shoes and jackets, their backpacks hanging from hunched shoulders, their prosaic faces looking at the ground.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">They are us, I thought. We are them.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">The food line stretched down beyond Chatham Street, where a pale young girl sat on the pavement, drinking soup from a paper cup, her thin back propped against a litter bin.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">I walked then down a sidestreet splitting at the seams with beautiful, silky-haired young thangs, nails like talons, their velvet skin puckered up from the cold. Their mouths opening and closing like swollen fish, spilling out their secrets, they too queued up, for entry to a busy bar. &nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">A boy sitting hunkered up on the street near Grogan’s caught my eye as I passed. He looked so like the son of a friend of mine – solidly built, blonde, brown-skinned, strong – but this boy’s face was steeped in rage.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">“What are you f**king looking at?” he roared, shaking me out of my reverie. I looked at the ground and walked on, hoping not to feel his hand on my shoulder.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  Aungier Street might as well have had tumbleweed blowing down it; on either side, closed-up shops and empty buildings \n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"no_name\">You are not invisible, I reminded myself. You’ve lost your city-born air of indifference, lost the ability to notice things while seeming to notice nothing. Stalled in suburbia for however many months now, you’ve morphed into Gormless Gertrude, fresh off the bus from Bally-go-shag-me-sideways, wandering the city streets, bewildered and agog.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Aungier Street might as well have had tumbleweed blowing down it; on either side, closed-up shops and empty buildings. I walked past a whole terrace of vacant-eyed properties spitting neglect. I know so many people looking for homes who could, if rents were affordable, populate this city with imagination and industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Camden Street was another island of youth, taxis spilling out girls in scrappy sandals and boys in muscle-fit T-shirts. It was reviving, energising, to drift along in the wake of their perfumes.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Quite by chance I bumped into a friend, and in that way that Dublin can sometimes conjure, the night lifted and we went to a bar, talked, ate noodles from paper boxes.</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Baggot Street before midnight. I watched a young man whip a plastic sack from a skip and crash its contents on to the street.&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Driving back to the burbs, the night echoed to the music of shattered glass.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","feedId":9924,"bgimg":"https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4342885&origw=1199","linkMd5":"e1b2f4590d8e5f6dfe02cbe367d4e4dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/06/04-43-21-518_dd336807e282b629.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":315,"sourceBytes":95209,"destBytes":27366,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4342885&origw=1199":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/06/04-43-21-518_dd336807e282b629.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599367370303},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","title":"Dupes and Duplicity","link":"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/","description":"<p>On March 7, 1775, a handsome young apothecary named Robert Perreau entered a London bank with a simple, if somewhat extravagant request. He wanted to take out a £5,000 loan (equivalent to just under $1 million today) from the bank’s owners, the Drummond brothers. As collateral for the loan, Perreau offered a bond for £7,500 signed by the wealthy and respectable William Adair⁠⁠—in other words, if Perreau didn’t pay back the £5,000 on schedule, Mr. Adair would cover the bank’s loss, plus a 50 percent profit. </p> \n<p>Though the effective interest rate Perreau offered was unusually high, withdrawing cash using someone else’s cash as collateral was an otherwise common way of securing credit in the 18th century. Similar to co-signing agreements today, it was a system based on personal reputation, and a relatively safe bet for lenders, if not for the rich guarantors whose friends might abuse their trust. The only way it could go wrong for the bank was if the bond itself⁠⁠—that is, the wealthy person’s promise to cover the loan⁠⁠—was forged. In this case, Robert Perreau was a successful businessman with plenty of assets, and Adair was known to have signed bonds for the Perreau family in the past. The Drummonds themselves had made previous loans to Perreau for other forms of collateral. By all appearances, it should have been a straightforward and safe investment for the Drummonds, especially considering the temptingly high payout.</p> \n<p>But on this day, Henry Drummond had a gut feeling that something was wrong. He asked whether Perreau had personally seen Adair sign the bond. Perreau admitted that he hadn’t, but insisted there could be no question of its authenticity: Adair’s lawyer and his personal servant had both witnessed the bond, he pointed out, placing their own unique signatures just under Adair’s. But the other Drummond brother⁠⁠—coincidentally also named Robert⁠⁠—was equally insistent. He knew Adair personally, and this was <i>not</i> his handwriting. </p> \n<p> Seemingly unruffled, Robert Perreau took back the bond and promised to sort out the matter with Adair. Two hours later, Perreau returned, claiming a fortuitous run-in with Mr. Adair just as the man was heading out for a lengthy excursion on horseback. Adair could not come himself, Perreau explained⁠⁠—due to the horseback riding, naturally⁠⁠—but Adair had of course verified that the signature on the bond was his own. As for the differing penmanship, Adair had confided that his hands had become shaky with age⁠⁠—an understandably embarrassing situation that should not be dwelled upon further⁠⁠—and told Perreau to tell the Drummonds that all was well and to accept the bond without delay. </p> \n<p>Instead, the Drummonds asked to keep the bond overnight and render a decision in the morning. Perreau readily agreed.</p> \n<figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n <div class=\"image-container\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.0746268656716\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/robert-perreau-b.jpg\" alt=\"A contemporaneous portrait of Robert Perreau\" title=\"A contemporaneous portrait of Robert Perreau\" />\n </div>\n <figcaption>\n  A contemporaneous portrait of Robert Perreau\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Upon his return the next morning, the Drummonds reiterated their misgivings, and suggested that the three of them should go visit Mr. Adair together. Again, Robert Perreau seemed happy to comply. His attitude changed dramatically, however, once they arrived at the estate, where Adair confirmed what the Drummonds had suspected: the signature was not his, nor had he ever met Robert Perreau in his life.</p> \n<p>“Surely, sir, you are jocular!” cried Robert.</p> \n<p>“It is no time to be jocular when a man’s life is at stake,” replied Henry Drummond gravely. Indeed, the banking industry was still wobbling on foal’s legs in the 18th century, and forgery was considered a particularly heinous crime against the public trust: two-thirds of those convicted were sentenced to execution, a rate second only to murder.</p> \n<p>“Well, then, I have been sent on a fine errand!” Robert declared. He told the men they should locate his sister-in-law, Caroline, who happened to be married to his identical twin brother, Daniel. <i>She</i> could explain everything.</p> \n<p>Despite his winding and patently unbelievable tale, this last part turned out to be true. Robert did, in fact, have a twin brother, so close in appearance that even friends had trouble distinguishing them. What’s more, Daniel’s wife Caroline was not at all shocked to be summoned to the Adair estate by the local constable. Standing before the group of angry men, she seemed completely at ease and in control of the situation. First, she asked to speak to Robert Perreau alone, but the Drummonds refused. She then asked for a private audience with Mr. Adair, but he, too, refused. Finally, the two bankers agreed to speak with Caroline in a separate room while they waited for the constable to return once more with her husband, Daniel.</p> \n<p>Once the doors were closed, Caroline made a startling confession: it was she who had forged the bond and instructed her clueless brother-in-law to cash a loan on it. Her remorse was both deep and eloquent⁠⁠—it was only a silly game played by a bored housewife, she lamented. Robert was a good man with children to support, and she would be utterly heartbroken if he were arrested for her foolishness.</p> \n<p>Despite Caroline’s flowing tears and prostrate pleading, the Drummonds were skeptical. How could a delicate woman possibly imitate a <i>man’s</i> handwriting? It must be that sweet Caroline was altruistically covering for her brother-in-law’s misdeeds, the Drummonds decided, perhaps even in fear of him. For that matter, where was her husband in all of this? How could they even be sure that it <i>was</i> Robert who had come to them yesterday, or who had returned the second time with tales of elderly socialites on horseback?</p> \n<p>So Caroline offered the bankers a demonstration⁠⁠—as long as they agreed to destroy it afterward, so the evidence could not be used against her. According to the Drummonds, Caroline reproduced the fake signature on the bond perfectly, then burned the paper in the fireplace. When they emerged from the parlor, they found Caroline’s husband, Daniel, lounging rather indifferently on the sofa, while Robert continued to vehemently argue his complete ignorance of the situation to Adair. It really was amazing, the Drummonds noted: the brothers were like the two heads of Janus, as identical in looks as they were different in demeanor.</p> \n<p>The Drummonds conferred with Adair, and he reluctantly agreed to let Robert go⁠⁠—for now. Daniel’s role in the crime was left unexamined, while Caroline’s apparent masterminding was written off entirely. By her own admission she was guilty, but dragging her before the magistrate after she’d made such a noble sacrifice to save her brother-in-law seemed, well… undignified.</p> \n<p>The Perreau family exited William Adair’s house that day as free individuals, albeit with varying opinions on the narrowness of their escape. Robert continued to fret about his perceived culpability⁠⁠—knowingly or not, he had been the one to present the forged bond, and either the Drummonds or Adair could withdraw their forgiveness at any time. Caroline, meanwhile, exuded a breezy satisfaction, convinced that the consequences of her confession were as surely behind them as Adair’s glowering face. Daniel, as always, split the difference: he may have privately shared his brother’s concerns, but he knew better than to contradict his wife. He urged his brother to be patient, and assured him that if they just carried on as they always had, the situation would soon fade from memory.</p> \n<center>\n •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•\n</center>\n<br>\n <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"image-container\">\n   <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.3899613899614\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rudd-b.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Caroline Rudd\" title=\"Portrait of Caroline Rudd\" />\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>\n   Portrait of Caroline Rudd\n  </figcaption>\n </figure> <p>If Robert Perreau was telling the truth⁠⁠—if he had, indeed, been taken for a rube by his conniving sister-in-law⁠⁠—then he would hardly have been the first. From a young age, Margaret Caroline Rudd had an almost supernatural ability to manipulate those around her, especially when it came to men. Her opinion of the opposite sex was no doubt cemented in her formative years, after she was expelled from boarding school at the tender age of 13 for so-called “illicit relations” with a staff member. Social mores of the time placed blame firmly upon the victim, at least if the victim were female, and local gossip could barely keep up with the flirtations and affairs that supposedly followed. At 17, Caroline ran off with an English soldier whose regiment was stationed near her small Irish hometown, but his commanding officer promptly sent her home again. Undeterred, she continued courting military men⁠⁠—who offered both a secure income, and an escape from the drudgery of rural life⁠⁠—until she won the heart of another young soldier named Valentine Rudd. Ten days after meeting, the two were married.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even a respectable soldier’s salary was not enough to satisfy Caroline’s apparent taste for luxury. Within a year, Rudd and his new wife were deeply in debt, and he was forced to send her to live with his parents in England while he continued his deployment. This gave young Caroline the opportunity to work on a new kind of charm: talking people out of their money. Rudd’s family was well off, and before long she had convinced her in-laws to pay off all the couple’s debts, and send her to London to await the day when Rudd could secure an officer’s commission⁠⁠—which, she assured them, was right around the corner.</p> <p>In reality, Rudd was underperforming in his job, and unsuited to military life in general. Instead, he surprised Caroline by retiring early so he could join her in London. Living on a half-pension had not been part of her plans, but it turned out the constant presence of her husband was an even bigger irritation. Before long, Caroline ran off with an upstairs neighbor by the name of Benjamin Read.</p> <p>This was doubly unkind to Rudd, as along with any emotional anguish he may have suffered, Caroline’s betrayal left him in a delicate financial situation. Technically, divorce was legal in 18th-century Britain, but in practice dissolving a marriage was nearly impossible due to the high burden of proof and prohibitive cost. And without a divorce, a husband was assumed to be responsible for his wife no matter the state of their relationship. Thus, when Caroline and her new beau failed to pay the rent on their lovenest, the landlord instead came after Rudd to clear their debt⁠⁠—and when Rudd couldn’t pay, he was arrested and thrown in prison.</p> <p>Like the institution of marriage, penal institutions of the time were also very different from their modern counterparts: conditions were squalid, disease was rampant, and jailers had no obligation to provide even basic necessities for their residents. Those who didn’t bribe the guards for upgrades like bread, water, and blankets were likely to die before even a short sentence had been served, and those in debtor’s prison were especially unlikely to have such funds.</p> <p>Caroline fared only somewhat better than her destitute husband. The relationship with Read soon faltered, and she was forced to support herself through prostitution. Regardless of how she may have felt about this new mode of employment, historical evidence seems to indicate that she was an excellent practitioner. Caroline’s status as an articulate, well-dressed, and putatively middle-class woman earned her an equally sophisticated clientele, and she charmed more than one “acquaintance” into vouching for her with local merchants. During this time she also began experimenting with forged promissory notes to extend her credit further, although her initial attempts were not always successful⁠⁠—as one merchant disdainfully pointed out to her, the handwriting of both the guarantor and the recipient was the same.</p> <p>More impressive than her mercantile and horizontal exploits, however, was the fact that Caroline successfully talked Rudd into a reconciliation once he was finally released from prison three months later. It had all been a terrible mistake, she told him, and she still loved him as much as ever. Rudd had organized the sale of some family property from behind bars, and had a little money left over after paying all her outstanding debts⁠⁠—including not only the apartment where she’d shacked up with Benjamin Read, but also several merchants she’d skipped out on while her husband was jailed. Somehow, the heartbroken Valentine saw his way to forgiveness and a new apartment for the two of them. Or perhaps he just decided it was more financially prudent to keep her close at hand, since he was on the hook for her debts regardless. Either way, it didn’t matter: just three weeks after Caroline reunited with her husband, Benjamin Read showed back up in London claiming he’d received a large inheritance, and she absconded with him again.</p> <p>In November of 1767, a general notice appeared in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>:</p> \n <blockquote readability=\"12\">\n  <p>Whereas Margaret, wife of Valentine Rudd, gentleman, has withdrawn herself from her husband, this is therefore to caution all persons against giving her credit on her husband’s account, as he will not pay any debts she contracts.</p>\n </blockquote> <p>Though she had moved in under her middle name, Caroline’s new landlady connected the dots and kicked her out. Yet through her feminine wiles (or perhaps plain old blackmail), Caroline managed to convince the same landlady’s husband to vouch for her with a different lodging house. Of course, she never paid there, either, and the new landlord tracked down Rudd and once again had him arrested for her debt. Rudd entered his advertisement into evidence, and made a passionate plea for mercy based on his wife’s semi-permanent lover and profligate spending, but the judge was unmoved. A husband was responsible for his wife, period, and only a divorce could sever that obligation. So Valentine Rudd returned to debtor’s prison once more, with the only consolation that his name was so fully tarnished by now that Caroline could no longer secure even a single night’s lodging on the promise of it.</p> <p>Caroline and Benjamin Read took up a new set of rooms posing as rich Irish nobles, and conned their way into another few months of rent-free living, but eventually, Read’s father came to London to bail out his son and sever him from all bad influences, Caroline included. (Since the new landlord didn’t know Caroline’s real identity, her imprisoned husband was, for the time being, safe.) Whether by necessity or choice, the senior Read left exactly one debt unpaid in London, and allowed his son to be placed in debtor’s prison back home in Dublin until he could pay it off or learn his lesson, whichever came first. Unfortunately, it was neither⁠⁠—just a few months later, Read died in prison, most likely from infectious disease.</p> \n <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"image-container\">\n   <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.0029411764706\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Marshalsea_prison_London_18th_century_3.jpg\" alt=\"Marshalsea, an infamous debtor's prison in 18th century London\" title=\"Marshalsea, an infamous debtor's prison in 18th century London\" />\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>\n   Marshalsea, an infamous debtor's prison in 18th century London\n  </figcaption>\n </figure> <p>Rudd emerged from his own prison sentence alive, but broken. Once again, Caroline begged for reconciliation, and once again, Rudd agreed. She no longer made any secret of her profession, and he made no attempt to control his rage. One landlady during this time reported that Caroline would bring johns into their apartment while Rudd drank and fumed in the adjacent room, and “at times he beat her, not moderately, but very severely.” Finally, in March of 1769, Caroline left her husband for good, and rather than wait for his inevitable arrest for new debts, Rudd fled to France.</p> <p>Though she was again homeless, Caroline quickly worked her way back up to respectability as a <i>grande horizontale</i>, and business improved significantly after she connected with a pimp named Andrew White. Like Caroline, White understood that it was far more lucrative to make weak men <i>love</i> rather than <i>lust</i>, and the two concocted numerous schemes to keep her patsies on the hook for the long haul. Sometimes he posed as her husband, other times her footman, but Caroline always presented quite believably as a fine lady of impeccable class and wit, and for several months they stayed one step ahead of London’s doe-eyed men and star-struck property holders. Eventually, however, one particularly shrewd landlady caught them in the act of sneaking out unpaid, and White and Caroline were arrested.</p> <p>There are no records of what transpired immediately after⁠⁠—but somehow, Caroline spent only a few hours in prison before being released, while White would not be heard from again for many years. But Caroline didn’t need him anymore, anyway. She had her established clients, and a host of high-society connections to procure more. Blackmail and fraud were occasional sources of income, but for the most part she lived a lavish life as the mistress of a rotating cast of thoroughly beguiled, and often foreign, men. A certain reputation with the locals was inevitable, after all⁠⁠—yet even those who knew for certain that she had fleeced friends often found her irresistible when their turn came. She was by all accounts quite average in beauty, but as historian Sarah Bakewell put it, “Caroline had <i>wit</i> in the full eighteenth-century sense of the term: insight, intellect, adaptability, cynicism, and the ability to use language as a deadly weapon.” She could talk her way into, and out of, anything, at least as long as the listener was male. Some of her lovers included the poet John Boswell (who wrote extensively of her wickedness even as he continued to visit her nightly), the Marquis of Granby (who died carrying a mind-boggling £37,000 in debt, due in no small part to Caroline), and possibly even King George’s brother, the Duke of Cumberland.</p> <p>One lover in particular was notable for his irrational level of devotion, even among such crowded company. Joseph Salvador was a wealthy Jewish man with broad tastes, who was reportedly “of such an amorous disposition that every woman was alike to him.” Perhaps he enjoyed a certain element of role-playing in his pursuits, or perhaps his eyesight was truly bad, but Caroline took advantage of his polygamous desires by posing as no fewer than four different women, all of them yearning for his physical (and more importantly, financial) affections. Of course, a change of dress and hair color was not enough to fool anyone with their wits about them, and Salvador’s servants tried to warn him repeatedly that the same woman was collecting jewels and gifts from him under different personas⁠⁠—often multiple times in the same day⁠⁠—but Salvador dismissed these concerns. This was also when Caroline mastered the art of using different styles of handwriting, in order to send letters to Salvador from each of his different paramours. Yet when Caroline’s own servant told Salvador that she had seen her mistress writing each of the letters she held in her hand for delivery, he refused to hear it. </p> <p>At one point, Caroline agreed to marry Salvador, then called off the wedding after the finery had been purchased. Often she would take furniture and belongings directly out of his home, once filling two horse-drawn carts she’d brought along for the purpose. She also frequently expressed a need to travel⁠⁠—usually to visit her “royal relatives” in the countryside, which was at least more plausible than the time she claimed she wanted to join a convent in France. Salvador would pay for the cost of the journey, as well as new clothes so she could arrive in style, then Caroline would contrive to send letters from wherever she was supposed to be until it was time for him to send her money for the trip home. After one such staycation, she returned to Salvador in tears, claiming that her jealous, abusive husband had accosted her abroad and demanded half the value of the expensive jewelry that Salvador had given her for the trip. In the ensuing struggle, Caroline said, the jewels had fallen into the river, and she simply could not forgive herself for losing such a heartfelt representation of his love. Salvador immediately purchased her a second set. Occasionally, she would simply send him a note that read, “Send me fifty pounds now, or you will not see me tomorrow.” Salvador always paid.</p> <p>Such was the state of Caroline’s power when, in the spring of 1770, she first became acquainted with the dashing and insouciant Daniel Perreau. Like almost every detail of their relationship, later accounts would conflict wildly about when and where they actually met. According to Daniel, they were introduced by a mutual friend in April, and he invited her to a masquerade ball the following night. According to others, the ball itself was their first meeting, complete with locked eyes across a crowded room à la Romeo and Juliet. Caroline, for her part, insisted that she didn’t meet Daniel for another several weeks⁠⁠—after the masquerade ball, but more significantly, after he formally declared bankruptcy on May 4. Daniel himself was no stranger to living a luxurious life well beyond his means, and in this, the two were a perfect match. Convincing a court to wipe free one’s debts, rather than consigning the borrower to debtor’s prison, was itself a feat of persuasion that seems more like Caroline’s strength than Daniel’s, but whatever the timing, all accounts agree that by the end of May the two were living together as husband and wife⁠⁠—the existence of Caroline’s actual husband notwithstanding.</p> \n <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n  <div class=\"image-container\">\n   <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.2080536912752\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Thomas-Girtin-London-1775-1802-St.-Pauls-Cathedral-from-St.-Martins-le-Grand-London-b.jpg\" alt=\"St. Paul's Cathedral from St. Martin's-le-Grand, Thomas Girtin, late 18th century\" title=\"St. Paul's Cathedral from St. Martin's-le-Grand, Thomas Girtin, late 18th century\" />\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>\n   <i>St. Paul's Cathedral from St. Martin's-le-Grand</i>, Thomas Girtin, late 18th century\n  </figcaption>\n </figure> <p>Daniel, in fact, knew nothing of Rudd’s existence until the estranged husband made a surprise return to London in October of that year, now fully delusional from a combination of poverty and paranoia. He told friends that Caroline’s “network” had conspired to ruin every opportunity he had come across in France, and that he had been “robbed, cheated, and persecuted… where-ever I have been.” When he tried to break down the door of Daniel and Caroline’s new living quarters, Caroline hastily explained her brave escape from an abusive marriage, and told Daniel that they would only be safe in more secure⁠⁠—and more expensive⁠⁠—housing. Daniel, of course, complied. Fortunately for the couple, Rudd’s friends convinced him to leave town once more, and Rudd spent the remainder of his life in destitution at an almshouse for the poor, forever cursing the name of Margaret Caroline Rudd.</p> <p>Few, however, knew her by that name anymore. Most assumed she was Caroline Perreau, which she and Daniel happily encouraged, though they couldn’t formally be married. This polite fiction was strengthened by the arrival of one baby, and then a second⁠⁠—yet even motherhood seemed no more than an incidental tool for Caroline, one she could easily set aside whenever a pose of childlessness suited her better. In addition to her many previous aliases and identity scams, she was also known during this time as Margaret Youngson, Peggy, Mrs. Shee, and Mrs. Gore⁠⁠—a name that she freely admitted was fake when she used it, because the so-called Mrs. Gore was purportedly in hiding as the secret daughter of Bonnie Prince Charlie, pretender to the throne of England. Several of these identities continued to visit her old mark Salvador during her courtship with Daniel, who would again maintain that he had no knowledge of her extracurriculars. Certainly Salvador knew about Daniel to some degree, since Caroline told him at one point that Daniel was demanding a duel for her honor, and would only be satisfied with a large influx of cash.</p> <p>Women, however, were harder for Caroline to win over, most especially Robert Perreau’s wife, Henrietta. While Daniel had spent his youth hopping from industry to industry, failing to establish trade businesses everywhere from the Caribbean to the Canadian frontier, Robert had steadily worked his way up from a traditional apprenticeship to a thriving apothecary business on London’s posh Pall Mall. Henrietta was not especially pleased when Daniel had arrived in London to tempt her husband with his flashy lifestyle and penchant for gambling, but she was downright hostile toward Caroline’s influence over the both of them. As Henrietta saw it, Robert had always been the proper, obedient, well-behaved twin, and they didn’t need Daniel or his mistress intruding on their virtuous prosperity.</p> <p>Or perhaps Robert wasn’t so innocent after all. His detractors would later paint him as a hypocrite full of secret vices, including gambling losses and mistresses of his own. He seemed more than happy to collude with Daniel in various financial schemes once his brother arrived in London, and some said it was actually Robert who directed Daniel to the coffee house where he made an unsavory (not to mention unsteady) income as a stock-jobber, betting on various political and economic events of the day. But it’s easy to understand how Henrietta, at least, believed her husband to be the clear victim among the three.</p> <p>Whether Henrietta was right about what lay in Robert’s heart, the fact remained that he had spent several years entangling both his social and financial affairs with those of his brother, and as of 1775, he had participated in the shockingly bold scam against the Drummond brothers involving a forged £7,500 bond in William Adair’s name. The three had been let go, thanks to Caroline’s moving confession, but either the Drummonds or Adair could choose to press charges against Robert or Caroline at any time. Nor was that the only sword looming over their heads: in the months prior, bonds supposedly signed by “William Adair” had been used to secure three other loans for the Perreau brothers⁠⁠—two in Robert’s name, and one in Daniel’s. The bankers who had made these loans remained unaware of the Drummonds’ discovery for now, but if word got around before the Perreaus could pay off the balances and take back the evidence, they would not escape arrest again.</p> <p>Despite her ever-confident demeanor, Caroline did seem to recognize the danger they were in. She attempted to sell some jewels to pay off the outstanding loans, but couldn’t secure a buyer quickly enough. She asked one of Adair’s relatives to intervene with him on their behalf, but was met with icy rejection. Worse, Robert himself tried to contact Adair three days after the initial confrontation, and the latter’s response made it clear that he had not forgotten the incident, and had most likely decided to alert the authorities after all. So on the evening of March 11, out of options and increasingly desperate, Caroline and the twins bundled themselves into a carriage and sped off down the narrow streets of London, planning to flee the country.</p> <p>Robert clearly had the most to lose. Both Daniel and Caroline could start anew in France or elsewhere with minimal difficulty, but Robert was leaving behind a loving family and a thriving business. In truth, Caroline and Daniel had three young children by now as well⁠⁠—one of whom had been used to extort money from poor Salvador, though he had never seen the child he thought was his⁠⁠—but they apparently didn’t consider it necessary to bring the children along for the escape, nor did Caroline and Daniel seem to have any concrete plan for what would happen to the children in their absence. At any rate, before the carriage had traveled more than a few blocks, Robert changed his mind, or else acted on a plan he’d been contriving since the scene in William Adair’s parlor. On the pretense of having forgotten something, he climbed out of the carriage, then dashed around the corner to the magistrate’s office on Bow Street and declared that he wished to testify against Margaret Caroline Rudd in a case of forgery.</p> <p>Here, again, accounts differ as to what actually occurred. According to the police blotter in the <i>Annual Register</i>, </p> \n <blockquote readability=\"24\">\n  <p>. . . A gentleman came to the Public Office, in Bow Street, in company with a woman elegantly dressed, and inquired for one of the Magistrates. . . . The parties were introduced, when the man, after a short preface in which he acquainted the Justice that his name was Robert Perreau, and that he had lived as an apothecary, for some time on Golden Square, in great reputation, said he was come to do himself justice, by producing the person who had given him a bond for £7,500, which was a forgery. The woman denying the circumstance, and the parties mutually upbraiding each other, Mr. Addington thought proper, as there was a great appearance of an iniquitous combination, to commit them both to Tothill-Fields Bridewell for further examination.</p>\n </blockquote> <p>According to Daniel, all three of them were actually in the room at the magistrate’s office, though it is a fact that he⁠⁠—or one of the brothers, at least⁠⁠—was not arrested until a day or two later. Meanwhile, the apparently calm presence of Caroline during the extended introductions reported in the blotter doesn’t precisely jibe with the image of a woman who knows that she is about to be betrayed. She was no stranger to sneaky exits and speedy pursuits, and it seems unlikely to imagine her climbing out of the carriage and following Robert into the magistrate’s office just as escape was in her grasp. Then again, Caroline was nothing if not brash and overconfident. She had already taken one huge and unnecessary gamble by demonstrating her handwriting skills to the Drummonds, being apparently certain that she could talk her way out of any consequences. Like Daniel, she had no qualms about disagreeing with the public record of events, insisting that in fact the two brothers had been the ones to enter the office, while she’d waited outside, ignorant of their plot against her.</p> <p>Once the three were in custody, with the threat of death by hanging weighing heavily over each, their stories diverged even further. Caroline claimed that she had been covering Daniel’s constant gambling debts since the beginning of their relationship; Daniel insisted it was the other way around. Robert continued to claim no knowledge of the forgeries, despite cashing in on several in the name of a man he’d never met. Caroline admitted to her skill with handwriting, but claimed that Robert had been the one who instructed her to forge the signature, and that Daniel had threatened to harm her with a knife if she did not comply. Daniel admitted to posing as Robert on at least one occasion, but claimed he only did it because he’d received a letter from William Adair instructing him to do so⁠⁠—which he only now, upon somber reflection, realized was a fake from Caroline.</p> <p>In fact, Daniel claimed, Caroline had been controlling both him and Robert for years through the use of clever letters and impersonation from friends. Starting at least three years prior, he said, a man who identified himself as her cousin had come to stay with them, though Daniel had not been especially fond of his demeanor. This cousin⁠⁠—of supposedly royal lineage through the Stewart line, as Caroline claimed to be, and quite possibly the pimp Andrew White in reality⁠⁠—had fostered a friendly relationship between Caroline and the wealthy James Adair, a relative of William’s. Even after the supposed cousin left, Daniel explained, Caroline continued to return to the house each evening with money that she claimed James Adair had given her out of a general fondness for their family, and all of the various financial schemes that Daniel and Robert had participated in had been at the recommendation⁠⁠—though never in person⁠⁠—of their kind benefactor and his extended family. Daniel even said that he’d wanted to name their first son after James, but that Caroline had discouraged it, lest Mrs. Adair get the wrong idea.</p> <p>This, in fact, was Daniel’s justification for the roundabout method of securing loans on bonds from William Adair: James Adair’s wife was the jealous type⁠⁠—Daniel said that Caroline said⁠⁠—and might jump to false conclusions if she knew how much money her husband was lavishing upon Caroline. Caroline, for her part, claimed that none of this ever happened. All of her money, from the very beginning, had been a lump sum from her abusive but wealthy husband Rudd (who was conveniently unavailable to testify otherwise), and irresponsible Daniel had been frittering away her savings ever since.</p> <p>One thing all three had in common was maintaining their appearance as upper-crusters with plenty of cash to spend. Caroline dressed for the initial deposition in a gown of striped silk and an ermine fur cloak, while the Perreau brothers wore fine frock coats and hats laced with gold. The presiding magistrate, Sir John Fielding, could not be impressed one way or the other⁠⁠—he was legally blind, though he reportedly could identify as many as 3,000 repeat offenders from the streets of London by voice alone⁠⁠—but there were more than enough in the audience to show off for. News of such an audacious crime, committed by such high-status individuals, had spread fast, and the proceedings had to be moved more than once to accommodate the ever-growing crowd of spectators, most of whom had bribed their way in for better seats.</p> <p>As was so often the case, Caroline was given deference by the men presiding over the hearing, while her male co-conspirators received none. She was released on bail, consisting of £200 from her own pocket, plus another £100 each from two men in the audience who did not know her personally, but had been moved by her tearful description of Daniel’s knife at her throat. Robert and Daniel Perreau, on the other hand, were remanded to prison to await their trials. Technically, they were being accused of separate crimes: Robert was to be tried for soliciting and then attempting to cash in on the bond he had presented to the Drummonds, as well as two previous forgeries cashed at the bank of Sir Thomas Frankland. Daniel was accused of the same actions for the single loan taken in his name, held by Dr. Thomas Brooke. When Robert Perreau turned Caroline in to the police, he had hoped for immunity in exchange for testifying against her. Instead, to his horror, the court granted immunity to Caroline to testify against both brothers.</p> <p>One friend who visited the twins in prison noted their dramatic difference in behavior, as Robert “covered his face with his handkerchief, and bursting into tears, sobbed aloud,” while Daniel cheerfully extended his hand, “with as much apparent ease and nonchalance as if receiving company in his own elegant mansion in Upper Harley Street.”</p> <p>One of the oddities of dividing the twins’ cases was that each individual complainant was free to pursue or drop their charges as they saw fit. Sir Thomas Frankland, especially, concluded that the perpetrator he was circumstantially connected to was not, in fact, the real villain. Robert’s name may have been on his particular unsupported loan, but after hearing the initial depositions, Frankland concluded that Daniel and Caroline were the most guilty. Frankland quietly dropped his charges against Robert, and instead orchestrated an agreement between Daniel and his creditor, Dr. Thomas Brooke, to seize Daniel’s house and divide the proceeds between all of the Perreaus’ creditors. In this way, Frankland could get his vengeance on Caroline as well, since she was still living in the house while awaiting her husband’s trial. Evicting Caroline would require a cooperative signature from Daniel, but he no longer seemed to care what happened to his duplicitous pretend-wife and the spacious rooms she was once again calling home. He signed the form, and Caroline was again put out on the streets.</p> <p>Now that he expected to be paid in full from the proceeds of Daniel’s house, Brooke was inclined to drop his charges against Daniel, just as Frankland had dropped his against Robert⁠⁠—but Frankland advised against it. Nor was he the only one who still wanted to see Daniel receive his comeuppance. Caroline would later claim that Robert’s wife, Henrietta, had personally convinced Brooke not to drop his case against Daniel. Robert, after all, would still have to face trial against the Drummonds, and how could it possibly be fair for the no-good twin and the strumpet to walk free when Robert was the least guilty of them all?</p> <p>Plenty of others had come to the same conclusion, judging by the lengthy letters and opinion pieces that were now being published every day in the local papers. The financial excess of the crime and its glamorous high-class defendants had captured the public’s attention right at the moment in history when newspapers became widespread in London and society gossip transformed into real currency. If Caroline hoped to have any future in London after the Perreau Affair, as it was quickly becoming known, salvaging her reputation would be paramount. So she went to work defending herself in a serialized editorial in the <i>Morning Post</i>, laying out her original deposition in even more dramatic detail, and wasting no opportunity to smear those who had wronged her. </p> <p>Almost immediately, anonymous authors began to publish competing narratives, signed with colorful pseudonyms like “Justice,” “No Puffer,” and “Jack Spy.” Some were clearly merchants and former friends who had not forgotten old wounds, while others appeared to be servants of either Caroline or her lovers, gleefully revealing everything from scandalous liaisons to the peculiar grooming habits of the rich. Those who didn’t want to bother penning their own screeds could still participate by offering up old letters sent to them by the now quite famous trio, which readers would comb through for the barest hints of credibility or vice. Daniel and Robert had to rely on supporters to argue their innocence⁠⁠—and both had their rabidly loyal factions⁠⁠—but Caroline answered all comers herself, addressing each mention of her with a tone of haughty indignation while conveniently dodging the most damning pieces of evidence. She claimed Henrietta had stolen dresses from her and never visited Robert in prison; she predicted Frankland would destroy even her youngest children before he would admit his basic inferiority to her; she accused the long-silent Salvador of being a pickpocket and con man.</p> <p>Of course, newspaper publishers were happy to print anything that promised to entice their readership, regardless of the objectivity or veracity of their tales. At one point, a letter purporting to be from Caroline’s uncle in Ireland⁠⁠—who in truth had had no contact with her since her first scandal at boarding school⁠⁠—was supposedly verified in its authorship by the <i>Morning Post</i>. The editor satisfied himself by writing to the letter’s return address, which was in London rather than Ireland, asking for written confirmation from the letter-writer that he was who he claimed to be. “Uncle John” wrote back that yes, he was Caroline’s true and honest uncle, and the <i>Post</i> ran the letter, despite the obvious linguistic similarity to Caroline’s own passages about herself. Even when war broke out in the American colonies and some began predicting a formal declaration of independence, a larger portion of column space remained dedicated to the Perreau Affair in nearly all the London papers. It was the court case of the century.</p> \n <center>\n  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•\n </center><br>\n  <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n   <div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.3090909090909\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perreaus.jpg\" alt=\"The brothers Perreau testifying at Old Bailey\" title=\"The brothers Perreau testifying at Old Bailey\" />\n   </div>\n   <figcaption>\n    The brothers Perreau testifying at Old Bailey\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure> <p>After three months of growing anticipation, Robert Perreau’s trial finally began on 1 June 1775. Caroline, who had once again managed to secure money and lodging from friends, arrived well-dressed and ready to play the part of a helpless damsel. But before she could take the stand to testify against her ostensible brother-in-law, the presiding judge made a surprise proclamation: Caroline’s evidence was unnecessary to the case, and would not be heard. The magistrates who had offered her immunity had no legal standing to do so, the judge declared, and Sir Thomas Frankland was ready to press charges against her for the forgeries presented to him. Shocked and furious, Caroline was removed from the courtroom on the spot and locked in Newgate prison to await a formal hearing.</p> <p>It was a dramatic but short-lived interruption, as the court quickly got on with the business of Robert’s trial. The prosecution presented the expected evidence from the Drummonds, including Robert’s now-obvious lies about encountering William Adair on horseback and his “shaky” handwriting, as well as a brief statement from Frankland about the other loans going unpaid⁠⁠—though without any mention of their forgery, since that was to be designated as Caroline’s crime. William Adair himself did not bother to appear, and his relative James was so tersely literal in his answers as to have practically no effect. It was clear that Robert <i>had</i> presented a forged bond, knowingly or not, and was <i>perhaps</i> in the kind of financial straits that might tempt a man to commit fraud, but the defense had done well at highlighting Caroline’s signature on the bond, not to mention her confession to the Drummonds. </p> <p>As the prosecution rested and the defense began, Robert read an impassioned 90-minute statement that had been ghostwritten by an eloquent supporter on his behalf. He implored the jury to consider that even the most upright, well-intentioned man could be conned:</p> \n  <blockquote readability=\"13\">\n   <p>Many and recent instances have occurred of men of much more enlightened understanding than I can claim, who have been made the dupes of adventurers less able and less artful than she . . . and yet, when I have either heard or read their stories, I have thought I should not have been [trapped] into the same snares. They and the world in general must think the same of me; but they must recollect, that they are commenting on a plot after it is detected – they are reasoning upon the deception of a juggler, when the whole process of the trick is laid open.</p>\n  </blockquote> <p>Robert admitted to his lie about speaking to William Adair personally⁠⁠—it had, of course, been Caroline he’d gone to see during his two-hour absence from the Drummonds. She’d left and returned with the horseback riding excuse, and he’d seen no harm in adjusting the message ever-so-slightly when he believed it to be completely true. He pointed out how his behavior consistently matched with one who believed he was innocent, first leaving the bond overnight with the Drummonds, then readily agreeing to visit Adair in person, then voluntarily presenting himself to the magistrate’s office when he could have easily escaped. His conduct, he said, was “absolutely irreconcilable with every idea of guilt.”</p> <p>What’s more, the defense had witnesses of their own. A family friend⁠⁠—though never one to Caroline⁠⁠—testified that he had frequently heard her speak of her supposed connection to James Adair, and had personally seen papers at both Daniel’s and Robert’s homes purporting to be from William Adair. As for the general disposition of Caroline, “she has told me very often, so and so, when I am a lady, I shall do so and so.” One of Daniel’s footmen testified that he had personally seen Caroline writing letters in a false hand claiming to be from William Adair, and that she had paid him to lie to Daniel about who delivered them, or to say that James Adair had visited when he had not. Another servant and one of the Perreaus’ sisters both testified to the same. Daniel testified to both men’s innocence, though he was cagey when asked about his own statements to the Drummonds. This was followed by no fewer than 24 character witnesses who attested to Robert Perreau’s diligence, honesty, and good standing in the community.</p> <p>The defense had every reason to feel hopeful. Aside from the mountain of evidence in their favor, the twelve men of the jury had watched Caroline be accused and dragged out of the courtroom that very morning. And indeed, they deliberated for just ten minutes.</p> <p>“Guilty, upon the third count, of uttering and publishing the bond, well knowing it to be forged.”</p> <p>It was a crushing blow. And if the jury had convicted such an upstanding citizen as Robert, how could they possibly find the drunken gambler living in sin with his mistress to be a more sympathetic character? Daniel’s trial must have seemed like a waste of time for everyone. Sure enough, both the prosecution and the defense seemed to put in far less effort the next morning, and Daniel himself abandoned the similarly long, heart-rending statement he had planned to deliver (though he would later publish it, alongside many more tales of woe from the “unfortunate Perreaus.”) Instead, he read only the following:</p> \n  <blockquote readability=\"15\">\n   <p>My Lord, I received the bond from Mrs. Rudd as a true bond of Mr. William Adair’s. I did really believe it to be a genuine, authentic, and valid bond; and I solemnly protest, by all my hopes of happiness here and hereafter, so villainous an intention of defrauding any man of his property never entered my mind. I adjure the Almighty to assist me, in my present and dangerous situation, as I speak here before you.</p>\n  </blockquote> <p>The defense called largely the same witnesses as before, though the handful of character witnesses willing to speak on Daniel’s behalf did so ambivalently, at best. Daniel’s jury deliberated for even less time than Robert’s had: guilty as charged.</p> <p>Sentencing for the brothers took place four days later, in a rapid-fire proceeding alongside other criminals whose trials had concluded in the previous weeks. Without fanfare, the single word “death” was pronounced for both.</p> <p>Still, there were appeals to be waged, and Caroline was awaiting her own trial after being stripped of her immunity. If she were found guilty, the Perreaus’ lawyers would have significant standing to have their clients’ verdicts overturned, or at least have their sentences reduced to transportation; i.e., shipment to a brutal labor camp in the American colonies. Then again, transportation was a markedly less attractive option for the King’s courts in 1775, since the colonies were no longer cooperating and recent shipments seemed to have a way of getting dumped into the harbor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, press coverage surrounding the three cases continued to increase. Scores of editorials and open letters to the judge appeared on Robert’s and Caroline’s behalf⁠⁠—though very few on Daniel’s, with only one letter-writer bothering to mention that “[his] conviction may very possibly be just, but, by the Lord, I cannot believe it legal.” Others praised the court’s findings, referring derisively to “the uncommon pains that have been taken to save Mr. Robert Perreau” while asserting that the claims laid out against Mrs. Rudd were also “very probably true.” </p> <p>Caroline kept up her publishing pace as well, though her tone shifted during this time from one of melodrama to hard logic. She was, after all, quite skilled at using others’ words against them, and made the straight-faced counterargument that if a wife were truly the sole subject of her husband⁠⁠—a fact that had been brandished against her, since how could Daniel have compelled her with threats if they were not legally married?⁠⁠—then Robert’s wife, Henrietta, was surely more guilty of accomplice in <i>his</i> crimes than she was in Daniel’s. How, indeed, could she logically be guilty at all, when the twins had already been found so under just and due process? She also demanded much sympathy over the conditions of Newgate prison, though in truth she had it far better than most, and certainly more so than the twins. Somehow, through all of this, she had retained several wealthy (and almost certainly male) friends and benefactors, who paid for her to have a private cell, decent food, and regular visitors, such as the milliner who would bring silks for her to choose from, so that she could have a new dress sewn for each court appearance.</p> \n  <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n   <div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"0.63529411764706\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/old-bailey-b.jpg\" alt=\"The Old Bailey\" title=\"The Old Bailey\" />\n   </div>\n   <figcaption>\n    The Old Bailey\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure> <p>There were, it turned out, several such appearances to be made, as the court fought over whether Caroline should have been granted immunity, both originally and now. The prosecution argued that immunity was for accomplices, and as Mrs. Rudd was now claiming innocence, she could not therefore have been one. The defense countered that she had taken the magistrate’s offer only as a way to save herself, knowing in her heart her own innocence but not understanding the complexities of such masculine practices as law; furthermore, if the prosecution was accepting here and now that she was no accomplice, then no trial was necessary and they could all go home. In the end, the judge ruled that she would have neither bail, nor immunity⁠⁠—yet despite Caroline’s supposed ignorance of the law, she personally cited an obscure legal precedent for throwing out her trial, or at least delaying it by several months, which was granted. She now had until September to figure out a plan.</p> <p>But distractions abounded. First, there was the matter of Caroline’s house and belongings, currently in Sir Thomas Frankland’s hands. Now that Daniel was a convict, all of his property was forfeit to the state⁠⁠—raising the question of whether such forfeiture occurred at the time of the crime (before Frankland had seized it), or at the time of conviction (by which point Daniel possessed nothing). Caroline sided with the national interest, partly because she hated Frankland, but mostly because, as everyone kept reminding her, she was not Daniel’s legal wife, and therefore many of the seized items⁠—such as expensive dresses and jewelry⁠—belonged to her alone, and would be returned by the state more readily than Frankland.</p> <p>Second, there was the matter of her children. By now the three of them were each living in different places: the eldest, Susan, was staying with an old friend of Daniel’s, which he had arranged immediately upon his incarceration. (When Caroline had demanded that the other two be sent with her, Daniel said they could go to a workhouse, for all he cared. “Poor Stewart and Caroline was more like their mother,” the elder Caroline complained bitterly.) The younger two had been housed for a time with the children’s nanny, Hannah Dalboux, but payment for their care had been irregular, so the middle child had been passed off to another family while Dalboux continued to wet-nurse baby Caroline, born only a month or so before the forgery took over their lives. </p> <p>Since then, however, Dalboux had testified for Daniel at his trial, painting Caroline in a negative light and leaving her not at all inclined toward the woman. She filed a claim for Dalboux to surrender the child, but Dalboux’s lawyer disingenuously retorted that the notice had not been properly served in person⁠⁠—which, of course, the imprisoned Caroline could not do⁠⁠—therefore they could not be certain that it came from the child’s actual mother. In response, Caroline’s lawyer, John Bailey, dutifully presented a verified letter to the court, but when an officer attempted to serve it, they found both Hannah and the baby were gone. It was soon discovered that Thomas Frankland and Henrietta Perreau had both been making frequent visits to the Dalboux residence, the former most likely paying for the baby’s care and the latter ferrying them back and forth to visit the twins at Newgate prison. A series of argumentative letters were published in the <i>Post</i> between Caroline and Hannah⁠⁠—who claimed she was only waiting for the payment she was owed, <i>ransom</i> apparently being a more sympathetic crime than <i>kidnapping</i>⁠⁠—and Hannah’s husband was at one point arrested for a physical altercation with Caroline’s lawyer. Eventually the matter was resolved, though it’s unclear where the baby went next, only that she never came to stay with Caroline in her cell.</p> <p>When September arrived, Caroline’s lawyers again contrived for another three-month delay, until finally, her trial began on 8 December 1775. The line for spectator seats formed before dawn, and was mostly filled with Caroline’s supporters. Three judges presided, as well as three lawyers for each side, plus a number of High Court officials who had taken a professional⁠⁠—or more likely personal⁠⁠—interest in the case. With so many people crammed into the room, the most spacious seat was ironically the small prisoners’ dock, where Caroline would sit for the duration of the trial. Its short walls were lined with spikes to deter those with thoughts of a quick escape, and hung with garlands of strong herbs to disinfect the “diseased miasma” that generally wafted from defendants lodged at Newgate. Throughout the 11-hour ordeal, Caroline would be seen passing dozens of notes to her attorneys, but otherwise she remained the epitome of dignified composure. One writer noted that “had the whole tenor of Mrs. Rudd’s conduct through life been equal to her behavior since the ungenerous attempt to sacrifice her, she would be an object of universal admiration.”</p> \n  <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n   <div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"1.4342629482072\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rudd-at-bar-of-old-bailey-b.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Rudd in the witness box at the Old Bailey\" title=\"Caroline Rudd in the witness box at the Old Bailey\" />\n   </div>\n   <figcaption>\n    Caroline Rudd in the witness box at the Old Bailey\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure> <p>The prosecution called their first witness: Henrietta Perreau. The defense moved to block her testimony, given Henrietta’s obvious stake in seeing Caroline convicted and thus her husband freed, but the judges ruled she could continue. Henrietta testified in great detail as to the bond Caroline had given her husband as well as several conversations she’d overheard, and the defense lawyers contentiously questioned how she could possibly remember so much, given that she’d never seen a bond before and should have been playing hostess to other guests at the time. “I have the happiness to have a good memory,” Henrietta replied coldly.</p> <p>Next came Thomas Frankland, who gave basic evidence regarding the loans he had issued. Hoping to paint Frankland as greedy and dishonest, the defense honed in on certain items that had been seized from the Perreau household, and Frankland played dumb for several minutes as the defense tried to force him to admit that they logically must have been Caroline’s, and not part of Daniel’s property.</p> <p>“By whom did you suppose the gowns and petticoats and other women’s apparel were worn?” asked one of Caroline’s lawyers incredulously. “By the two Perreaus?”</p> <p>“They might go in masquerade,” retorted Frankland.</p> <p>Regardless of the answers they eventually wrenched from him, the defense had made their point. Frankland appeared bitter and obstructionist at every turn, compared to the guileless angel perched in the prisoner’s dock.</p> <p>Several more witnesses followed, including bankers who made it clear that while the loan may have been in Robert’s name, Daniel (and by extension Caroline) had spent the money. The prosecution’s final witness was Christian Hart, a former housemaid to Caroline who had not appeared at either Robert’s or Daniel’s trials. Hart was nervous, and had clearly rehearsed her testimony. She had good reason to be afraid, as she was about to betray a very dangerous woman.</p> <p>Hart’s testimony centered around a recent pair of visits she had made to Newgate prison, to see “the best mistress I ever lived with.” Caroline had begged a series of favors from her, Hart explained, and Hart had been quite willing at first, delivering several messages and offering a room in her lodging house to Caroline, should she ever be released. But Caroline had other plans for that empty room.</p> <p>Hart produced a stack of papers for the court, which she said that Caroline had given to her on the second visit. The papers were a detailed statement, in Caroline’s handwriting but from Christian Hart’s perspective, describing how, over the course of several months, Hart had seen Henrietta Perreau in her lodging house forging various bonds with a mysterious man, and more recently, Henrietta had used the room for a meeting with Thomas Frankland, during which Hart overheard them conspiring to pin the blame for Robert’s forged bond on Caroline. According to Hart, Caroline had given her this written statement, and asked Hart to sign it and deliver it to Caroline’s lawyer. Instead, Christian Hart had written at the bottom, “I received this paper from Mrs. Rudd on 5th July, 1775,” and turned it over to the magistrate.</p> <p>It was a shocking turn of events, and the defense made little headway against it, other than to highlight the fact that Christian Hart had not initially intended to turn the papers over, but her husband had demanded it. Mrs. Hart’s husband took the stand to corroborate her story, and a few other witnesses confirmed that the handwriting was indeed one of Caroline’s many styles. </p> <p>The prosecution rested, no doubt confident of the mortal wound they had just delivered. But the defense had their own star witness up their sleeve.</p> <p>The defense called solicitor John Bailey, Caroline’s original lawyer⁠⁠—who had been helping her from prison these past six months, and had once gotten into a fistfight with Hannah Dalboux’s husband on her behalf. The only reason Bailey wasn’t on her current defense team was because he would be testifying. And his story was, indeed, as shocking as Christian Hart’s.</p> <p>According to Bailey, he had been in the cell with Caroline when Hart visited the second time, though Christian Hart had testified they were alone. Caroline claimed that Hart had brought her “a very strange incredible story” on her first visit, which Caroline herself couldn’t possibly believe, but she would nonetheless be grateful if her lawyer sat in on any future visits with Mrs. Hart. When Mrs. Hart did arrive the second time, testified Bailey, it was <i>she</i> who had asked Mrs. Rudd to write down her own story, so that she could be sure of all the facts and wouldn’t trip up from nervousness when conferring with her husband. As proof, Mrs. Rudd had made a second copy for herself, in full view of Christian Hart, and had her lawyer write upon it: “This account was taken down in writing, in the presence of counsellor John Bailey, from Christian Hart’s own words and dictating . . .”</p> <p>The matching stack of papers was produced, and a brief performative back-and-forth took place between the old and new guard, confirming that Bailey remembered delivering this paper to Caroline’s current lawyers the day after it was written, and that they remembered receiving it from him. Christian Hart’s testimony was not, it seemed, a shock after all⁠⁠—the defense team had known about it the whole time. Though he declined to name names, Bailey vaguely testified that he had the impression Mrs. Hart had been sent by someone to trick Caroline into writing a false story in her own hand, for the precise purpose of “betraying” her in court.</p> <p>The prosecution rebounded well on cross-examination, revealing that Bailey had not, in fact, delivered the second copy of the papers to the other lawyers until <i>after</i> visiting the Harts’ house that evening⁠⁠—and had perhaps only done so in response to learning that Mr. Hart had delivered his wife’s copy to the magistrate, rather than allowing her to sign it or destroy it. What’s more, the papers themselves were not identical, as Bailey had implied. His copy was significantly shorter, and altered key words and phrases in almost every sentence. One of the judges even remarked aloud for the jury, “It is plainly a paper wrote from recollection,” rather than a copy made with the original still at hand. But at the end of the day, the jury was being asked to weigh the word of a respected lawyer against a lowly former housemaid, who had already shown herself willing, at a minimum, to ignore damning evidence, were it not for her husband’s fear that Caroline intended to “hang you and me and all the world.”</p> <p>The final nail in the coffin was a brief testimony from an employee at Newgate prison, who reported that she had seen Bailey and Hart together in Caroline’s cell. If it seems difficult to believe that Caroline could convince both her own jailer and lawyer to lie on her behalf, one must only consider that, if they were telling the truth, others must have been telling equally galling lies⁠⁠—and Caroline, at least, had a demonstrable history of such schemes. The only mystery is how she possibly managed to pull it off, again and again.</p> <p>In his final address to the jury, the presiding judge instructed the twelve men to effectively ignore Christian Hart’s testimony, and everything that came after it. The only relevant questions were whether Caroline had signed William Adair’s name on the bond (as Daniel’s servant had testified that he had seen her do), and whether she had caused that bond to be used by Robert Perreau (as Henrietta and a second servant had corroborated). Everything else, extraordinary though it might be, carried only a loose implication as to the credibility of Henrietta Perreau and nothing more. “The prisoner has produced no evidence of any kind whatever,” he reminded them, “[except] what observations she made herself on the characters of the persons who have appeared against her.”</p> \n  <figure class=\" entry-image\" data-embiggen=\"true\">\n   <div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" data-height-ratio=\"0.72352941176471\" data-lazy-load-src=\"https://damn-8791.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/newgate-prison-b.jpg\" alt=\"Newgate Prison\" title=\"Newgate Prison\" />\n   </div>\n   <figcaption>\n    Newgate Prison\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure> <p>It didn’t matter. In thirty minutes, the jury returned, and the foreman displayed a visible smile at Caroline. He delivered the verdict of “not guilty,” and a cheer erupted from the packed room of spectators. Later, one of the jury would claim that he was the sole voice in favor of acquittal during initial deliberations, and had successfully won over the other eleven⁠⁠—but whether that is true is as much up in the air as any words ever spoken on her behalf.</p> <p>One thing, however, was certain: the Perreaus now had no hope for a retrial. All that remained was the possibility of a pardon. Hundreds of letters poured into the appellate court in support of Robert, many declaring that Daniel’s death was acceptable and should be sufficient payment for both of their crimes. Daniel himself wrote a moving letter asking only for his brother’s life to be spared. Henrietta and her children visited the Queen personally, and she seemed much moved by the widow- and orphans-to-be, but was apparently unable to sway King George III to leniency. The King also received a petition on Robert’s behalf signed by 78 bankers and merchants of London. But in general, King George deferred all such matters to Viscount Weymouth, the Secretary of State in charge of finalizing pardons and executions. In the last days before the execution was to take place, Weymouth received just one letter strongly in favor of executing them both⁠⁠—from Margaret Caroline Rudd.</p> <p>Legally, she had nothing to lose if they were spared, but she’d already seen what the wrath of betrayed men looked like at the hands of Valentine Rudd. She wasn’t going to leave any loose ends. In addition to reiterating all her previous allegations, Caroline claimed in her letter to have additional witnesses to Robert’s shameful character, who had not testified at her trial only because her counsel had thought it “most honourable for me to be acquitted upon the case of the prosecution – to which I cheerfully consented, as I wished not to expose the Perreaus more than was absolutely requisite for my own vindication.”</p> <p>The Viscount recommended no pardon, and the King did not issue one. On the morning of 17 January 1776, as many as 30,000 spectators assembled near the gallows and along the route from the prison. Estimates are hard to confirm, but it was by all accounts the largest crowd that had ever attended a public execution in London⁠⁠—though Caroline herself was not, apparently, among them. Between the surging bystanders and snowy conditions, the three-mile journey took over two hours, during which time the Perreaus conferred with a chaplain inside their covered coach, while the lower-class prisoners scheduled for execution rode in the open, alternately cowering or grandstanding for the mob. </p> <p>Three scaffolds had been erected: one for the Perreaus, one for three lesser criminals, and a hasty, makeshift structure far off to the side for the group’s two Jewish prisoners. The hangman placed hoods over each man’s eyes, though he had to loosen the formal scarves around the twins’ necks before the nooses could be properly fitted. The Perreau brothers, now openly weeping, reached out and took each other’s hand, then the cart they were standing on was driven out from beneath them. Onlookers said their hands stayed firmly clasped until the deed was done.</p> <p>Never before had a pair of twins been executed simultaneously, and the moving nature of their final moments caused an improbable swerve in public sympathies after their deaths. The Perreaus had maintained their innocence to the end, even to the chaplain⁠⁠—which would have endangered their souls, if untrue, and therefore inspired a swell of posthumous regret from the general public. The daily press moved on, but more permanent forms of print endured, including full-length works from Christian Hart and several anonymous authors who claimed to have known the trio personally. As with modern media-heavy scandals, everybody got a book deal⁠⁠—and none were complimentary to Caroline.</p> <p>Though she changed her name and attempted to lay low in the years following her trial, Caroline’s infamy was too widespread for it to do much good. She continued to rely on the benevolence of lovers, whose overall status declined steadily over time, and she spent almost a year in debtor’s prison between 1787 and 1788. By the age of 50, she was said to be living in prison voluntarily alongside her current beau as he served his own sentence.</p> <p>Rumors of Caroline’s death cropped up steadily over the years, and the exact details are not certain, but the most reliable is probably an announcement from <i>The Times</i> in 1797, which read simply, “The once celebrated Mrs. Rudd died a short time since in an obscure apartment near Moorfields’.” At the very least, it seems to have been taken as fact by one particular resident of an almshouse in Ireland: the destitute Valentine Rudd was, as it turned out, still very much alive, and shortly after receiving news of Caroline’s death that year, he married another resident of the almshouse named Judith. They continued to live there together in austere matrimony until his death some 11 years later.</p> </br></br>","descriptionType":"text/html","feedId":9924,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6a743554b88e9a5208556f9d9591b9cb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.damninteresting.com/dupes-and-duplicity/data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAAZQTFRFgYGBAAAAqeg2zgAAAAxJREFUeNpiYAAIMAAAAgABT21Z4QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599367370304},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","title":"Collections: Bread, How Did They Make It?

Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field. The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p> \n<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2> \n<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process. There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice. When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing. Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat. While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’ As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p> \n<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high. Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields. Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img data-attachment-id=\"4363\" data-permalink=\"https://acoup.blog/535232001/\" data-orig-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1667,2500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"535232001\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=683\" src=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4363\" srcset=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=683 683w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=1366 1366w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=100 100w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=200 200w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\">\n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1915-0823-0-749\">Via the British Museum</a>, a Japanese color woodblock print (1855) showing rice farmers working in the fields.\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas; one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest). In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p> \n<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common). The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water. Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive. The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields. Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p> \n<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant. That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two. Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice. While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm. Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p> \n<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency\">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>. My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice. But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p> \n<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2> \n<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside. We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p> \n<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive. Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat. Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1. As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img data-attachment-id=\"4365\" data-permalink=\"https://acoup.blog/1613316772/\" data-orig-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1565,1406\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1613316772\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4365\" srcset=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=150 150w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=300 300w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=768 768w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg 1565w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\">\n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1939-0311-0-6-56\">Via the British Museum</a>, a map made of Kaliwungi, Java (1807) showing a collection of rice fields. Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>. Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones. Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water. In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p> \n<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p> \n<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol\">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation. So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land). The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img data-attachment-id=\"4357\" data-permalink=\"https://acoup.blog/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised/\" data-orig-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4357\" srcset=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=150 150w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=300 300w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=768 768w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\">\n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_production_in_China#/media/File:Terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg\">Via Wikipedia</a>, terraced rice paddies in Yunnan, China, showing how uneven land can be terraced to create level fields which can be carefully flooded.\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>The result of this, so far as I can tell, is that in well-watered areas, like much of South China, the human landscape that is created by pre-modern rice cultivation is both <strong>more dense</strong> and <strong>more uniform in its density</strong>; large zones of very dense rice cultivation rather than pockets of villages separated by sparsely inhabited forests or pasture. Indeed, pasture in particular seems in most cases almost entirely pushed out by rice cultivation. That has <em><strong>very significant</strong></em> implications for warfare and I have to admit that in reading about rice farming for this post, I had one of those “oh!” moments of sudden understanding – in this case, how armies in pre-modern China could be so large and achieve such massive local concentrations. <a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2019/10/04/collections-the-preposterous-logistics-of-the-loot-train-battle-game-of-thrones-s7e4/\">But as we’ve discussed</a>, the size of an army is <a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/\">mainly constrained by logistics</a> and the key factor here is the ability to forage food locally, <strong>which is in turn a product of local population density.</strong> If you <strong>effectively double</strong> (or more!) <strong>the population density, the maximum size of a local army also dramatically increases</strong> (and at the same time, a society which is even more concentrated around rivers is also likelier to allow for riverine logistics, which further improves the logistical situation for mass armies).</p> \n<p>But it also goes to the difficulty many Chinese states experienced in maintaining large and effective cavalry arms without becoming reliant on Steppe peoples for horses. Unlike Europe or the Near East, where there are spots of good horse country here and there, often less suited to intensive wheat cultivation, most horse-pasturage in the rice-farming zone could have – and was – turned over to far more productive rice cultivation. Indeed, rice cultivation seems to have been <em>so</em> productive and suitable to a sufficient range of lands that it could push out a lot of other kinds of land-use, somewhat flattening the ‘<a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/\">ideal city</a>‘ model that assumed wheat and barley cultivation.</p> \n<h2>Labor Relations</h2> \n<p>Moving to the next level of abstraction, pre-modern rice cultivation also relies to different degrees on labor as compared to capital inputs (like work animals) compared to wheat cultivation, which in turn seems to lead to different patterns in the status of farmers and their relationship to large landholders (I say <em>seems</em> because I’d like to see more studies, but I should note that what I am laying out here is a key argument of Bray, <em>op. cit.</em>).</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img data-attachment-id=\"4367\" data-permalink=\"https://acoup.blog/1442078001/\" data-orig-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1072,1380\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D40&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1377524566&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1442078001\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=233\" data-large-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=795\" src=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=795\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4367\" srcset=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=795 795w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=117 117w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=233 233w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=768 768w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg 1072w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px\">\n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1865-0520-236\">Via the British Museum</a>, a British drawing (1793-1796) by William Alexander from am album of images from China showing two methods of watering a rice field. Rice irrigation systems often also contained complex inlet and outlet systems, Bray (1986) has some excellent diagrams of them which are, alas, not in the public domain!\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p><strong>We’ve discussed how wheat (and barley) cultivation is pretty dependent on the availability of work animals to draw plows and provide manure, both of which can significantly increase the productivity of the farm</strong>. As discussed above, <strong>rice cultivation</strong>, while it <em>can</em> benefit from fertilizer (especially more modern ‘fast growing’ rice varieties), but isn’t nearly as dependent on manuring as intensive wheat cultivation can be. At the same time, deep plowing could actually be <em>counter-productive</em> in a rice paddy, because the plow could break up or cut through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardpan\">hardpan </a>at the base of the soil which prevents the water from simply draining out into the water-table. Consequently, while effective plows emerge in China in the fourth century AD, they tend to be shallow and thus less reliant on animal traction (which consequently caused Westerners seeing Chinese agriculture to assume it was ‘primitive,’ which seems more than a little silly given that those shallow plows were managing <em>higher yields</em> than contemporary pre-modern or early-modern Western agriculture); hoe-farming is also common, especially because the extensiveness of rice farming discussed above often means that pasture for traction animals was scarce, but manpower was abundant.</p> \n<p>On top of this, while both rice and cereal grains have to be threshed and winnowed in fairly similar processes, the subsequent processing is quite different. Where wheat and barley are milled down to a powder (flour), rice is generally pounded and sometimes polished. Rice processing of this sort seems generally to have been done with much smaller <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_pounder\">rice pounders</a> made of common materials available to poorer farmers. <strong>Consequently while the pre-modern wheat farmer might be reliant on a mill owned by a local miller, large landholder or even the state, the rice farmer was less reliant on this form of outside capital.</strong></p> \n<p>At the same time, the high productivity of rice production meant that labor was relatively abundant in the countryside, as households could subsist on <em>much smaller farmers</em>. But this in turn seems to have shaped the development of rice farming techniques. Wheat- and barley-farming technologies (plows, mills, mechanization) tend to act as <em>labor substitutes</em>, allowing a given amount of labor to farm more land and thus produce more food. In effect, the goal here is to substitute scarce labor and sometimes scarce land with capital. <strong>In contrast, increasingly sophisticated rice-farming technologies</strong> (and I do want to stress – rice farming gets quite sophisticated in the pre-modern, especially with complex irrigation systems) <strong>focused on ways that <em>more labor</em> can be employed to produce more food out of the same amount of land</strong> <strong>and capital</strong>.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img data-attachment-id=\"4360\" data-permalink=\"https://acoup.blog/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150/\" data-orig-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"700,547\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4360\" srcset=\"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg 700w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=150 150w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\">\n  <figcaption>\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_pounder#/media/File:COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_Bandoeng_TMnr_10011150.jpg\">Via Wikipedia</a>, a photo (1908) of an Indonesian woman using a traditional rice pounder to process rice in a village near Bandung, Indonesia.\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>As a consequence of this, Bray argues, we see different patterns of relationships between the landholding elites and the small farmers. Because the small rice farmer was <em><strong>less reliant on the capital of the large landholder</strong></em> (in the form of plow-teams, manure and mills), while the large landholder was <strong>more reliant on the labor of the small farmer</strong> (because rice cultivation was so labor intensive), rice farmers tended to get a somewhat better deal. While we see the same range of farming relationships, from smallholding free-farmers to non-free farmers, Bray notes that systems of tenancy dominate the rice-farming countryside in the great majority of places where rice cultivation has long predominated. That’s not to say that being a small rice farmer was fantastic – fewer rice farmers seem to have been serfs or slaves, but at the same time, fewer rice farmers seem to have owned their own farms. And landlords in rice economies were still in a commanding position, in no small part because all of that labor went into what were essentially capital improvements (irrigation and the paddies) to land that they, not the farmer, owned. </p> \n<p>Nevertheless, tenancy conditions tended to be more favorable in rice-farming areas than in wheat-farming ones, with a lower portion of the total harvest going to the landlord. Thus the irony that precisely because labor was so abundant, rice farming tended towards labor-intensive methods and solutions, which in turn improved returns to labor (compared to returns to capital), putting the small farmers, despite their abundance, in a marginally better bargaining position.</p> \n<h2>Hydraulic Empires?</h2> \n<p>Now we reach the more speculative end of the discussion and I know that at least some of you reading that section title cringed a little bit. Let’s indulge in some intellectual history (or the fancy term ‘historiography’ which is the history of the history, as it were).</p> \n<p>Writing in 1957, Karl August Wittfogel published <em>Oriental Despotism</em>, which argued that the common thread between ‘oriental’ states (which was to include Egypt, Mesopotamia, Alexander’s Empire, the Abbasids, <em>all of freakin’ China</em>, among others) was that they were systems of “total” state power and control (thus ‘despotic’) and that this total power was a consequence of “hydraulic despotism” with certain definable characteristics. Moreover, he argued that these systems of power were functionally impervious to internal disruption or fragmentation (only to outside invasion). it is a basic thesis that still seems to crop up from time to time in the popular imagination and even among intellectuals who should know better. Naturally, the assumption here is that if irrigation-oriented agriculture leads to ‘hydraulic despotism’ then rice (particularly wet-rice, being by far the most common and most productive form), the quintessential irrigation-only-crop, ought also to be associated with ‘despotism.’</p> \n<p>This thesis, influential in its day, <strong>has not stood up well <em>at all</em> to improved study of many of these places</strong>. Perhaps most notably, scholarship on almost all of the supposed ‘hydraulic despotisms’ has tended to draw their despotic nature into question. For one example, Achaemenid rule, often presented as the paradigmatic example of ‘Eastern Despotism’ (which is certainly how the Greeks viewed it, but no one thinks well of their imperial neighbors), on closer inspection seems if anything to have allowed quite a significant degree of local autonomy. The Great King was often a less ‘despotic’ overlord than the Athenian Assembly, if one had to choose who to be a subject to. Likewise, the study of pre-Achaemenid economic systems in Egypt and Mesopotamia over the last 50 years have tended to peel back the idea that the state dominated the economy and society to the exclusion of all other factors; in many ways this is a steady series of victories for the archaeologists whose efforts allow us to ‘see’ the commoners and their activities more clearly. And in almost all of the supposed ‘hydraulic’ societies, the last several decades have seen quiet revolutions in the scholarship brought on by increased exposure to the local sources, rather than reliance on what European-language sources said about these societies from the outside.</p> \n<p>Moreover, our better understanding of the chronology of these states has tended to undermine Wittfogel’s assertion that <em>state formation itself</em> was caused by the demands of canal-building and irrigation (I discuss what I consider a far more compelling <a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/\">model of state-formation-through-agrarian-warfare here</a>). And the supposition that supposed hydraulic empires <em>never</em> crack up from the inside or fragment is one that can only be made at great remove; close inspection of almost any of these societies show them as doing <em>exactly</em> that thing, often several times. China, in particular, is both Wittfogel’s key paradigmatic example and also a real problem for his model: no dominating established priesthood, frequent peasant rebellions and multiple periods of significant fragmentation. And to top it off, not clearly ‘despotic’ in any particular sense (in many cases the supposed essential ‘despotism’ of China relies on assuming the great antiquity of things which were peculiar to the Qing Dynasty – themselves not an indigenous ‘hydraulic’ dynasty but an ethnically distinct foreign one – or the modern Chinese state). Thus key parts of Wittfogel’s argument about supposed ‘hydraulic societies’ engaging in ‘the Asiatic mode of production’ (as an aside – any theory which asserts an ‘Asiatic’ mode of <em>anything</em> is pretty much guaranteed to be nonsense; Asia is, as veteran Risk players will know, <em>very big</em> and consequently <em>extremely diverse</em>) <strong>seem more premised on outdated exoticizing stereotypes about ‘despotic easterners’ and less on the actual history of the many societies of Asia.</strong></p> \n<p>Which isn’t to say that I think the changes brought on by rice cultivation have <em>no effect at all</em>. Once we dispense with simplistic, outdated stereotypes about ‘despotism’ (which has more to do with state <em>behavior</em> than <em>state capacity</em>), it is still possible to note that rice cultivation can create areas of much higher population density with a greater degree of agricultural surplus. For pre-modern states, which are essentially extractive ventures that feed off of the surplus of the countryside, it is not hard to see how a compact, effectively immobile surplus-generating population <em>positioned along often navigable waterways</em> would provide a very strong starting ‘base’ compared to a more diffused population (as in much of Europe). Though even that needs caveats, given that the earliest centralized governments in China emerged not in the rice-farming south, but in the wheat-farming north.</p> \n<p>The issue may be less about control of water than about density, distance and communication; we’ve already seen the scale of <a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2019/10/04/collections-the-preposterous-logistics-of-the-loot-train-battle-game-of-thrones-s7e4/\">difficulties of trying to move over a large land-based empire</a> (unless you are <a href=\"https://acoup.blog/2020/02/28/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iv-desert-power/\">Steppe nomads with a completely different subsistence system</a>). It’s hard not to notice how, even after periods of fragmentation, states in places like Egypt, Mesopotamia and China <em>keep forming around the large, navigable rivers</em> that bind the region together (but note that while sloppy scholarship often presents this as if the same state is reemerging over and over again, these are in fact often <em>very different</em> states occupying the same place).</p> \n<p>It does seem to be the case, at least from my limited reading, that rice cultivation <em><strong>does</strong></em> tend to shift power away from the large landholding class as compared to wheat farming. Sometimes that power went to the officials of the state who might be directly managing large-scale irrigation and water networks; sometimes, as Bray notes, it went down to the farmers, who might be communally managing water supply (often through long-established understandings with local elites which carried the force of tradition and custom) and whose labor commanded a greater portion of the value of their production. Rice cultivation <em>may</em> contribute to more centralized states (which is <em>not</em> the same this as more despotic ones), but honestly I haven’t seen what I’d consider ‘slam dunk’ scholarship on this point yet.</p> \n<p>All of which is to say that while there are some quite importance differences in pre-modern subsistence agriculture with rice rather than with wheat, <strong>many of the basic patterns reassert themselves</strong>. Poor farmers, often trapped in tenancy or effective debt peonage are common, they appear to frequently rely heavily on horizontal social networks and vertical ties instead of heavy involvement in the market economy as a way of minimizing risk and the living standards, judged by nutrition, are broadly similar. I haven’t gotten into it here, but even in economies where rice dominates, farmers diversify both between different crops and even different varieties of rice to minimize risk, just as our wheat-farmers do.</p> \n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\">\n <div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\">\n  <div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\">\n   <h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-161773962-4315-5f5355100bad1\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20200826#blog_id=161773962&amp;post_id=4315&amp;origin=acoupdotblog.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=161773962-4315-5f5355100bad1&amp;domain=acoup.blog\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-161773962-4315-5f5355100bad1\">\n  <h3 class=\"sd-title\">Like this:</h3>\n  <div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\">\n   <span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> \n   <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span>\n </div> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 05:04:41 +0000","feedId":9924,"bgimg":"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=683","linkMd5":"74fd25c12dc4cc4c7988454a07f767b8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn49@2020_1/2020/09/06/04-43-21-561_36467f49ff34d17b.webp","destWidth":683,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":99936,"destBytes":99936,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/535232001.jpg?w=683":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn49@2020_1/2020/09/06/04-43-21-561_36467f49ff34d17b.webp","https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1613316772.jpg?w=1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn73@2020_3/2020/09/06/04-43-23-384_0dab8b05ba591ef9.webp","https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/terrace_field_yunnan_china_denoised.jpg?w=1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_2/2020/09/06/04-43-23-377_55a3c1420a1230d4.webp","https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1442078001.jpg?w=795":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn62@2020_4/2020/09/06/04-43-23-360_bb54a545c6864fd7.webp","https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/collectie_tropenmuseum_rijst_stampen_in_de_dessa_bandoeng_tmnr_10011150.jpg?w=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn69@2020_6/2020/09/06/04-43-23-393_615d2d637b1f4e61.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599367370304},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","title":"Dickheads","link":"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/dickheads","description":"<div>\n <img src=\"https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dancey-TieGuy-Graeber.jpg\" class=\"ff-og-image-inserted\" />\n</div>\n<p class=\"parabody\"><span class=\"dropcap\">S</span>ome people (me, for instance) put a great deal of energy into organizing their lives so that they’ll never have to wear a tie. I’ve often wondered why this should be. Why should ties have such symbolic power? It’s not as if other parts of a formal suit—white shirts, tailored slacks, vests, or blazers—inspire the same sort of indignation. Somehow, it feels as if tying the necktie around your neck marks a final act of closure. It’s the act that transforms all those items into a suit, with all the suit implies, whether it’s the power of the boardroom or the ceremonial formalities of weddings and funerals—that whole world of official business over which men in suits invariably preside. No doubt, part of the objection to the tie is to the pure arbitrariness of the thing. A tie serves no function. It doesn’t hold your trousers up or keep you warm. But at the same time, it’s uncomfortable, so much so that putting it on does somehow feel like a gesture of submission, a reluctant pledge of allegiance to everything the suit is supposed to represent.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Still, if you think more about it, there’s something peculiar going on here—a kind of paradox. Yes, a tie embodies the message of the suit, but in many ways it’s the very opposite. After all, the rest of the suit is almost entirely bereft of decorative elements. Suits tend to be dark, sober, boring. Ties are supposed to be the exception. The tie is the one place where you’re allowed to add a little color, to express yourself a little. Why, then, should the one thing that’s least like the rest of the suit somehow feel like it embodies the message of the whole?</p> \n<p class=\"parasectionhed\">Ready, Aim, Attire!</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Formal male clothing wasn’t always boring. In Elizabethan times, for instance, men—particularly rich and powerful ones—were just as inclined as women to deck themselves out in flashy jewelry and bright decorative colors, and even (as in the court of Louis XIV) to wear wigs, powder, and rouge. All this changed in the eighteenth century, a period some historians of dress have referred to as the age of the “Great Masculine Renunciation.” Suddenly, male clothing was expected to be less ornamental, more generally businesslike than women’s. Eventually, something very much like the modern business suit began to emerge: uniform, dark in color (the more serious the context, the darker it should be) with little or no patterning—its very dullness embodying seriousness of purpose.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">The modern business suit appeared around the time of the Industrial Revolution, and it embodied the spirit of the emerging bourgeoisie. Such men scoffed at aristocratic fops as parasites. They saw themselves instead as men of action, defined by their ability to direct and transform the world. They were producers; aristocrats were mere consumers. And in this new bourgeois order, consumption was to be the domain of women, who continued to wear powder, lipstick, necklaces, and earrings (though usually not quite so extravagantly), even as their husbands gave them up.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">This transformation explains a number of curious usages surviving in our own formal clothing: notably, the way a blazer can still be referred to as “sports jacket,” even though you wouldn’t want to run a race in one. In fact, the business suit derives not from aristocratic formal wear, but from hunting clothes—this is why fox-hunters, for instance, still wear something very much like one. Both uniforms are a kind of active wear, adopted by a class of people who wanted to define themselves through their actions.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"> \n <p>Couldn’t we say that a tie is really a symbolic displacementof the penis, only an intellectualized penis, dangling not from one’s crotch but from one’s head?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Actually, I suspect that the ultimate derivation of the business suit is from a suit of armor. The suit, after all, encases your body, covering as much of it as possible; what minimal openings to the world such clothes do afford—at your neck and sleeves—are bound tightly together by ties and cuff links. The contours of the body are thus obscured, in striking contrast with women’s formal wear, which, even in covering the body, constantly hints at revealing it, and particularly at revealing its most sexualized aspects. Skirts, even when they cover the lower half of the body completely, tend to form an open-ended cone whose apex is between the legs, and except in the most prudish times, there has been some gesture toward revealing the cleavage. It’s almost as if the staid uniformity of men’s attire is meant to efface individuality just as its design is meant to make the body itself invisible; women’s formal wear, on the other hand, makes the wearer both an individual and an object to be seen. Indeed, the conventions of higher-class fashion ensure that any woman wearing such an outfit is obliged to devote a good deal of time and energy to monitoring herself to make sure too much is not revealed and, more generally, to constantly thinking about what she looks like.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">And this is still true. Just recall the bifurcated fashions at the sexual battleground of your high school prom. The guys all dressed identically. They were, in effect, sporting a uniform. But if two girls wound up wearing the same dress, then oh, what a scandal.</p> \n<p class=\"parasectionhed\">The Frail Gaze</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">It seems to me that this very effacement of individuality is itself one way of expressing power. The French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that the eighteenth century (the period that saw the emergence of the business suit) marked a profound transformation in how power came to be exercised in Europe and America. In a feudal order, Foucault suggested, power existed in order to be seen. It was enshrined in the very bodies of the king and nobles, which were on continual display in portraits, pageants, and court ceremonial. Common folk were faceless spectators. The modern bureaucratic state reversed all this: suddenly, it was the powerful who were faceless, depersonalized abstractions, as it was they who did the inspecting, examining, and monitoring of everybody else.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">What Foucault was really talking about were two different modes of exercising power that always exist, in any society. Sometimes the general struts about showing off his medals, and sometimes he’s inspecting the troops, who are expected to keep eyes fixed firmly into space. Indeed, the most powerful way to represent power has always been to refuse to represent it. That’s why God or spirits in so many traditions cannot be shown in images; it’s also why the way to show that something is truly powerful is to hide it, to render it invisible, ineffable, unknowable, utterly featureless and abstract. That which is unknown, Thomas Hobbes once remarked, is for that reason unlimited. It could be anything; therefore, you have to be prepared to assume it could <em>do</em> anything as well.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">I suggest a simple formula: To express power through display is to say to those over whom one exercises it, “Behold, see how I have been treated. I have been treated this way because of who I am. Now you, too, must treat me this way.” Kings cover themselves with gold as a way of saying that you must cover them with gold as well. To refuse any such display, in contrast, is to say, “You simply have no idea what I am capable of.”</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">If this formula is true, the generic quality of formal male clothing, whether donned by factory owners or functionaries, makes some sense. These uniforms define powerful men as active, productive, and potent, and at the same time define them as glyphs of power—disembodied abstractions. Women’s formal attire, with its flounces and fripperies, sequins and whatnots, defines its wearer as something that you look at, as a passive object, but at the same time makes her bodily, specific, and even unique. (The word “specific” is originally derived from the Latin <em>specere</em>, meaning “to look at.” It’s the same root as gives us “spectacle,” “inspection,” and “specimen.”) John Berger’s famous analysis of European oil painting, <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, noticed that the social presence of a man in such quintessentially bourgeois settings always turned on what he was assumed to be able to do (the “promise of power” he embodied), while that of a woman turned on her appearance, which was taken to indicate how she has treated herself—and therefore what it is acceptable to do to her. Robert Graves summed it up even more precisely; in the world those oil paintings represent, “Man Does; Woman Is.” (Only it’s not clear that Graves meant this as a criticism!)</p> \n<p class=\"parasectionhed\">Semiotics of the Barn Door, Open</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">So what does any of this have to do with neckties? Well, at first glance, the paradox has only deepened. If the message of the suit is that its wearer is a largely invisible, abstract, and generic creature to be defined by his ability to act, then the decorative necktie makes little sense.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">But let’s examine other forms of decoration allowed in formal attire and see if a larger pattern of sartorial power begins to emerge. Decoration that’s specific to women (earrings, lipstick, eyeshadow, etc.) tends to highlight the receptive organs. Permissible men’s jewelry—rings, cuff links, fancy watches—tends to accentuate the hands. This is, of course, consistent: it is through the hands that one acts upon the world. There’s also the tie clip, but that’s not really a problem. The tie and the cuff links seem to fulfill their functions in parallel, each adding a little decoration to tighten a spot where human flesh sticks out, namely the neck and wrists. They also help seal off the exposed bits from the remainder of the body, which remains effaced, its contours largely invisible.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">This observation, I think, points the way to the resolution of our paradox. After all, the male body in a suit does contain a third potentially obtrusive element that is most definitely not exposed, something that, in fact, is not indicated in any way, even though one does have to take it out, periodically, to pee. Suits have to be tailored to allow for urination, which also has to be done in such a way that nobody notices. The fly (which is invisible) is a bourgeois innovation, much unlike earlier aristocratic styles, such as the European codpiece, that often drew explicit attention to the genital region. This is the one part of the male body whose contours are <em>entirely</em> effaced. If hiding something is a way of declaring it a form of power, then hiding the male genitals is a way of declaring masculinity itself a form of power. It’s not just that the tie sits on precisely the spot that, in women’s formal wear, tends to be the most sexualized (the cleavage). A tie resembles a penis in shape, and points directly at it. Couldn’t we say that a tie is really a symbolic displacement of the penis, only an intellectualized penis, dangling not from one’s crotch but from one’s head, chosen from among an almost infinite variety of other ties by an act of mental will?</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Hey, this would explain a lot—why men who wear bow ties are universally taken to be nerds, for example. True, a bow tie could be taken for a pair of testicles. But even so, bow ties are small, and they point in entirely the wrong direction. Mafiosi wear ties that are too fat and colorful; dissipated sophisticates wear thin ties; cowboys wear string ties that produce the effect you might expect from wearing a bow tie and a regular tie at the same time—ordinarily, this would be too unsubtle, but cowboys are mythic he-men who can get away with it. (James Bond can also get away with a bow tie, but then he’s basically just a giant penis anyway.)</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Professional women have faced endless problems over what to wear around their necks. Wearing a tie is considered sexually provocative, threatening. It’s telling that this is the only aspect of traditional male attire women have <em>not</em> been allowed to adopt. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was some effort to develop flouncy bows as an alternative, but that didn’t really work out. The expedient today is not to put anything at all in the open space revealed by the jacket, and just let the absence speak for itself.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">You can take it from here. But let me end with a last observation about gender. As an anthropologist, I am aware that one of the most common features of patriarchy—and this is true in a surprising number of places, from Africa to Sweden to New Guinea—is some idea that women produce naturally (they bear children) and that men produce culturally (they create society). Stated outright, this is an obvious lie—pretty much everywhere you go you can find women doing most of the work of producing society too. So the message of the patriarchs has to be communicated obliquely. And I suspect that traditional formal clothing is one such statement.</p> \n<p class=\"parabody\">Think of it this way: if none of us wore any clothes, then it would be the male genitalia sticking out visibly, while women’s would remain largely hidden. Maybe the entire point of formal attire to invert this possibility, to say, “Yes, in nature, it is women who have mysterious hidden powers of creation, but once we get all dressed and civilized, it’s precisely the other way around.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 19:33:00 +0000","feedId":9924,"bgimg":"https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dancey-TieGuy-Graeber.jpg","linkMd5":"fe3c9f5b0d77b8b5e3d0aef5bcd38084","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/06/04-43-21-704_6b36c74571c2c690.jpg","destWidth":0,"destHeight":0,"sourceBytes":1294244,"destBytes":1294244,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dancey-TieGuy-Graeber.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/06/04-43-21-704_6b36c74571c2c690.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599367370303},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:42:50","title":"What Ails America","link":"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/09/03/what-ails-america","description":"<figure data-id=\"71451\" data-usage-terms=\"3,60,2020-09-03\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-71451\" src=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1222922339.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1042\" srcset=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1222922339.jpeg 1600w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1222922339-125x81.jpeg 125w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1222922339-768x500.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\">\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n   <small>Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</small>First responders at the Riverside University Health Systems Medical Center, Moreno Valley, California, May 15, 2020\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>I was in Germany when I got sick. Late at night in Munich on December 3, 2019, I was admitted to a hospital with abdominal pain and then released the next morning. In Connecticut, on December 15, I was admitted to the hospital for an appendectomy and released after less than twenty-four hours. In Florida on vacation, on December 23, I was admitted to the hospital for tingling and numbness in my hands and feet but released the following day. Then I began to feel worse, with a headache and growing fatigue.</p> \n<p>On December 27, we decided to return to New Haven. I had not been satisfied with treatment in Florida, and I wanted to be home. But it was my wife, Marci, who had to make the decisions and do the work. On the morning of the twenty-eighth, she packed everything up and got our two kids ready to go. I was a burden. I had to lie down to rest after brushing my teeth and after putting on each article of clothing. Marci arranged for wheelchairs at the airports and got us where we needed to be.</p> \n<p>At the Fort Myers airport I sat in a wheelchair with the children on a curb while she returned the rental car. As she remembers the journey, “You were fading from life on the flight.” At the Hartford airport she wheeled me from the plane straight to a friend’s car and then stayed with the kids to wait for the luggage. Our friend had not known what was happening; she looked at me in the wheelchair, said “What have they done?” in Polish, shook her head, and got me into the front seat. I lay down flat as she sped to New Haven, because my head hurt less that way.</p> \n<p>I struggled to get admitted to the emergency room in New Haven. I had to use a wheelchair to get from the parking lot to the lobby of the emergency department. Another friend, a doctor, was waiting for me there. When I was admitted to the emergency room at midnight, I used the word <em>malaise</em> to describe my condition to the doctor. My head ached, my hands and feet tingled, I was coughing, and I could barely move. Every so often I was seized by tremors.</p> \n<p>Although I did not understand this then, I had a severe infection in my liver, which was leaking into my bloodstream. I had an abscess the size of a baseball in my liver, and the infection had spilled into my blood. I was in a condition known as sepsis; death was close.</p> \n<p>The nurses guarding the entrance to the emergency room did not seem to take me seriously, perhaps because I did not complain, perhaps because the friend who advocated for me, though a physician, was a black woman. She had called ahead to say that I needed immediate treatment. That had no effect.</p> \n<p>After the better part of an hour sprawled between a wheelchair and a table in the lobby, I finally got into the emergency department. Nothing much happened then, so I reflected on what I had seen as I stumbled from the lobby to an emergency room bed. I have been in emergency rooms in six countries, and have a feel for them. Like most American emergency departments, this one was overflowing, with beds lining the hallways. In Florida six days before, the overcrowding had been even more severe. I felt lucky in New Haven that night to get a small area to myself: not a room, but a sort of alcove separated by a yellow curtain from the dozens of other beds outside.</p> \n<p>After a while, the curtain started to bother me. Getting attention in emergency rooms is a matter of figuring out who staff are and catching someone’s eye. I couldn’t see people passing when the curtain was closed, and so it was hard to decipher the uniform colors and the name badges and ask for help. The first doctor who opened the curtain decided that I was tired, or perhaps had the flu, and gave me fluids. My disconcerted doctor friend tried to suggest that my condition was something more serious.</p> \n<p>“This is someone who was running races,” she said. “And now he cannot stand up.”</p> \n<p>My friend told the resident that this was my second emergency room visit within a few days, so extra attention was warranted. The resident left unconvinced, and with the curtain partway open behind her, I caught a glimpse then of the two nurses who had admitted me and heard what they said as they passed: “Who was she?” “She said she was a doctor.” They were talking about my friend. They laughed. I couldn’t write this down then but did later in the diary I kept while I was in the hospital: racism hurt my life chances that night; it hurts others’ every moment of their lives.</p> \n<p>I was tested, slowly, for flu, for this and that, with little result. I had undergone my appendectomy in the same hospital two weeks earlier, but no one in the emergency department seemed inclined to look at my electronic record. I had brought a folder with the printouts and a CD from the Florida hospital, and I had just enough presence of mind to offer it to the doctors. They were not interested. “We do things our own way,” said the resident. The doctors and nurses seemed unable to complete a sentence, let alone think about my case as something with a history.</p> \n<p>I could see, or rather hear, why they were distracted.</p> \n<p>A drunk beyond the curtain to the right, an older lady from the sound of her voice, kept crying out “Doctor!” or “Nurse!” A second alcoholic, to the left, was a loquacious homeless man. When asked for his belt, he riffed on the idea of the “Belt of Orion,” comparing himself to the hunter and rapist of Greek mythology. Whenever approached by a female doctor or nurse, he said, “You belong to me; don’t try to fight it.” One of the nurses declared that she didn’t belong to anyone.</p> \n<p>Two policemen sat just beyond the curtain, observing two wounded young men. With nothing much to do, the cops moved closer together, just in front of my curtain, and loudly talked the night away. I learned how the police department organizes its shifts. I heard stories of drunk driving, abandoned vehicles, domestic assault, and, the favorite theme, rumbles in the open air that the police were powerless to stop. Some of the stories were funny, like the one about the woman who was caught, shovel in hand and dirt on her knees, undoing the gardening work of her neighbor.</p> \n<p>The two police officers preferred different topics: the one bureaucracy, the other criminality. The one who liked to talk about crimes used the terms <em>unperson</em> and <em>unpeople.</em> In George Orwell’s novel <em>1984,</em> an <em>unperson</em> is someone who has been expunged by the state, someone of whom all trace has been erased. It seemed, though, that the policeman had in mind African Americans he regarded as criminals. I wanted to speak to him about that but lacked the strength.</p> \n<p>I was fading. After three hours in my alcove, my fever reached 104. My blood pressure crashed: 90/50, 80/40, 75/30, 70/30. I was hanging somewhere in between. Sepsis kills people, and mine was not being treated.</p> \n<p>*</p> \n<p><em>Malaise</em> means weakness and weariness, a sense that nothing works and nothing can be done. Malaise is what we feel when we have a malady. <em>Malaise</em> and <em>malady</em> are good old words, from French and Latin, used in English for hundreds of years; in American Revolutionary times they meant both illness and tyranny. After the Boston Massacre, a letter from prominent Bostonians called for an end to “the National and Collonial Malady.” The Founding Fathers wrote of malaise and malady when discussing their own health and that of the republic they founded.</p> \n<p>In America today, malady is physical illness and the political evil that surrounds it. We are ill in a way that costs us freedom, and unfree in a way that costs us health. Our politics are too much about the curse of pain and too little about the blessings of liberty.</p> \n<p>When I got sick, freedom was on my mind. As a historian, I had spent twenty years writing about the atrocities of the twentieth century. Recently I have been thinking about how history defends against tyranny in the present and safeguards freedom for the future. The last time I stood before an audience, I was giving a lecture about how America could become a free country. I hurt that evening, but I did my job, and then I went to the hospital. What followed has helped me to think more deeply about freedom, and about America.</p> \n<p>When I stood before the lectern in Munich on December 3, I had appendicitis. That condition was overlooked by German doctors. My appendix burst, and my liver became infected. At the time of my appendectomy, the doctors in New Haven had noted a lesion in my liver but had neglected to treat it, or examine it again, or order another test, or even mention it to me. I was discharged from the hospital the day after that surgery, December 16, with too few antibiotics and no information about that second infection. When I was admitted to the hospital in Florida on December 23 with tingling and numbness in my limbs, I had not known to tell the doctors about my liver. Again, I was discharged after a day.</p> \n<p>In the emergency room in New Haven on December 29, everyone dismissed the possibility that my condition had to do with my appendix or my recent surgery. It seemed unthinkable to the doctors in New Haven that their colleagues had done something wrong. This sort of clan thinking is an elementary error, the kind we all make under stress.</p> \n<p>The doctors in New Haven did think that the doctors in Florida might have made a mistake. As it became clear that I had some kind of bacterial infection, they suspected meningitis arising from a spinal tap performed in Florida. The New Haven doctors therefore performed a second spinal tap but were distracted even as they punctured my back and searched for the spinal fluid. The resident made an obvious mistake, penetrating my spine through the wound of the previous puncture, which is to say at the putative site of infection. The attending physician had to tell her to pull the needle back out.</p> \n<p>People are much poorer at almost every task when they are close to a cell phone; both physicians had kept theirs turned on and close by. I was hunched over a bed with my face against a wall; I know that their phones were present because they rang three times during the procedure. The first was the most memorable. After reinserting the long needle in my spine at a second point, the resident jumped in reaction to her ringtone. Bent over the railing of my bed, I did my best not to move.</p> \n<p>My body was at the mercy of the doctors’ permanent distraction. My friend had called the surgeon who performed my appendectomy; she did not remember the liver finding and did not, at this or any other time, mention that it was in the record. If the attending physician and the resident in the emergency department hadn’t been distracted, they could have taken a moment to look up the record of my previous surgery themselves, noted the liver problem, and spared me the second spinal tap. If they had been able to talk to me for a moment longer, I could have shown them my Florida record, which indicated elevated liver enzymes, a clue as to what was happening. I had even circled those results on the paper, but I couldn’t get anyone to pay attention to them. If the two doctors had silenced their cell phones before the spinal tap, they could have done what they thought they needed to without shaking a needle in my spine.</p> \n<p>Like everything that happened, this wasn’t my bad luck or the doctors’ bad intentions. It is the nature of the system that doctors are harried and make mistakes.</p> \n<p>On December 29, after seventeen hours in the emergency room, I had an operation on my liver. Lying on my back in a hospital bed early the next morning, tubes in my arms and chest, I couldn’t ball my fists, but I imagined that I was balling my fists. I couldn’t raise my body from my bed on my forearms, but I had a vision of myself doing so. I was one more patient in one more hospital ward, one more set of failing organs, one more vessel of infected blood. But I didn’t feel that way. I felt like an immobilized, infuriated me.</p> \n<p>When I look now at the pages of my hospital journal, stained by saline, alcohol, and blood, I see that the New Haven sections, from the last days of the year, concern the powerful emotions that rescued me when I was near death. The first words I wrote in New Haven were “only rage lonely rage.” I have felt nothing cleaner and more intense than rage amid deathly illness. It came to me in the hospital at night, giving me a torch that ignited amid kinds of darkness I hadn’t before known.</p> \n<p>*</p> \n<figure data-id=\"71452\" data-usage-terms=\"3,60,2020-09-03\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-71452\" src=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1221856797.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"997\" srcset=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1221856797.jpeg 1600w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1221856797-125x78.jpeg 125w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1221856797-768x479.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\">\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n   <small>Jeffrey Basinger/Newsday via Getty Images</small>The emergency room at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Oceanside, New York, April 13, 2020\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>Had I died, my death would have been all too typical, a passing into sad statistics. Far too many Americans have needlessly departed life this year. Far too many Americans are too close to death all the time. Although we have been promised ever-longer lives, life expectancy in our country peaked six years ago, in 2014.</p> \n<p>The beginning of life in this country is frightening and uncertain. Care of expectant mothers is wildly uneven and grossly inadequate. Black women often die in childbirth, and so do their babies. The mortality rate of babies borne by African-American women is higher than in seventy other countries. America as a whole does worse than forty countries in infant mortality. Young adulthood has lost its charm. Unless something changes, millennials will live shorter lives while spending more money on health care than Gen-X parents or boomer grandparents. The prime of life is not what it once was. Middle-aged white men are committing suicide and drugging themselves to death in astonishing numbers. Middle-aged white women in the South are dying before their time.</p> \n<p>Our system of commercial medicine, dominated by private insurance, regional groups of private hospitals, and other powerful interests, looks more and more like a numbers racket. We would like to think we have health care that incidentally involves some wealth transfer; what we actually have is wealth transfer that incidentally involves some health care. If birth is not safe, and is less safe for some than for others, then something is wrong. If more money is extracted from young adults for health care, but they are less well than older generations, something is wrong. If the people who used to believe in the country are killing themselves, something is wrong. The purpose of medicine is not to squeeze maximum profits from sick bodies during short lives but to enable health and freedom during long ones.</p> \n<p>Our malady is particular to America. We die younger than people in twenty-three European countries; we die younger than people in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, and Lebanon); we die younger than people in our own hemisphere (Barbados, Costa Rica, Chile); we die younger than people in other countries with histories of British settlement (Canada, Australia, New Zealand). Other places keep passing us in the longevity charts. In 1980, when I was ten, Americans lived on average about a year less than inhabitants of countries of comparable wealth. By 2020, when I was fifty, the difference in life expectancy had grown to nearly four years. It is not that other countries have more knowledge or better doctors. It is that they have better systems.</p> \n<p>The gap between the United States and other countries grew in 2020, since no democracy mishandled the coronavirus pandemic as we have done. People in Japan and Germany, in South Korea and Austria, and indeed in all rich democracies, were at less risk than we were, because their governments treated them better, and because they had better access to information and care. It was already far too easy to die in this country before the novel coronavirus arrived in the United States. Our botching of a pandemic is the latest symptom of our malady, of a politics that deals out pain and death rather than security and health, profit for a few rather than prosperity for the many.</p> \n<p>The new coronavirus ought to have been taken seriously from the time of my hospitalization, which is when it was documented. In January 2020, we should have acquired a test for the novel coronavirus, tracked the new disease down, and limited its reach. This could easily have been done. Far poorer countries did it. Americans infected with the coronavirus should all have had access to hospital beds and ventilators, and the doctors and nurses who treated them should have had enough masks and gowns. A virus is not human, but it is a measure of humanity. We have not measured up well. Some two hundred thousand Americans are dead for no reason at all.</p> \n<p>Our malady makes pollution deaths, opioid deaths, prison deaths, suicides, newborn deaths, and now mass graves for the elderly all too familiar. Our malady goes deeper than any statistic, deeper even than a pandemic. There are reasons why we are living shorter, unhappier lives. There are reasons why a president thinks he can keep Americans ignorant during a pandemic and exploit our confusion and pain. Our malady leaves us isolated, uncertain where to turn when we hurt.</p> \n<p>America is supposed to be about freedom, but illness and fear render us less free. To be free is to become ourselves, to move through the world following our values and desires. Each of us has a right to pursue happiness and to leave a trace. Freedom is impossible when we are too ill to conceive of happiness and too weak to pursue it. It is unattainable when we lack the knowledge we need to make meaningful choices, especially about health.</p> \n<p>The word <em>freedom</em> is hypocritical when spoken by the people who create the conditions that leave us sick and powerless. If our federal government and our commercial medicine make us unhealthy, they are making us unfree.</p> \n<p>“The whole history of the progress of human liberty,” as Frederick Douglass reminds us, “shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle.” It will be a struggle to heal our malady. The struggle begins when we claim health care as a human right.</p> \n<p>*</p> \n<p>My body was not well cared for during the early hours of December 29. Fluids brought my blood pressure up some, but no meaningful treatment took place. The doctors and nurses could not spend more than a few seconds at a time with me and rarely made eye contact. They ran their blood work, forgot the results, misreported them, ran off. The permanent distraction of doctors and nurses is a symptom of our malady. Each patient has a story, but no one is following the story.</p> \n<p>For five hours, from about one to about six in the morning, I had trouble remaining conscious. While I was in this suspended state, the sounds from beyond the curtain never ceased. My brain formed the words uttered by everyone around me, but I was no longer mediating the stimuli. I was not in charge, or there was not enough left of me to be in charge. The policemen’s conversation kept coming through, as did the drunken shouts, the squeak of shoes on the floor, the wheeze of an automatic door, the slap of a hand on the button that opened it, the knock of a bed against it. The curtain to my alcove followed the bodies of people passing by or danced with a draft from beyond.</p> \n<p>When I closed my eyes in the early morning hours, I could still see the moving curtain. The rippling became hypnotically regular, from right to left, like an invertebrate sea creature undulating with the waves. The color of the curtain deepened from yellow to ochre. An inky black around the edges replaced the fluorescent white of the lights outside.</p> \n<p>Each time I closed my eyes, the rippling ochre curtain beckoned. I tried to keep them open. The blood pressure reading behind me provided a point of focus. Each time I turned back from my vital signs toward the curtain, though, I would eventually have to close my eyes. Then the color of the curtain would change to ochre, its movements would become darkly voluptuous, and I would remember.</p> \n<p>My whole life did not rush before my eyes. It was rather that my ability to suppress memories dissolved. A few images of childhood came on heavy, with punching force. I could no longer induce them to make way for other memories or for new thoughts. It was strange to be a spectator of the real, rather than a referee.</p> \n<p>The memories of adulthood were less about what befell me and more about what I learned from others. When I concentrate on what I read, I have a very good memory. Much of my thirties and forties I spent reading first-person accounts of the Holocaust and other German crimes, Stalinist mass shootings and famine, ethnic cleansings, and other atrocities. These came now, too, unbidden, a thousand jabs: one after the other, book after book, document after document, photograph after photograph.</p> \n<p>Something in me paused over a Jewish orphan taken in by childless Ukrainian peasants: “You will be like a daughter to us,” they said, she remembered, I remembered. Something in me hesitated over the story of a woman whose special gift, as she hid Jews in her apartment, was to behave as if nothing extraordinary were taking place. Poise. Existential poise. A certain photograph I had looked at regularly for twenty-five years appeared before my eyes again: a Polish Jew named Wanda, full of self-possession. Wanda had refused the German command to go to the Warsaw ghetto in 1940 and kept her two boys safe throughout the war. Her husband, their father, was murdered.</p> \n<p>It went on, the black and white of remembered words and images, the ochre curtain rippling in the background, neither near nor far, neither on this side nor that. I was with others. At first I was uneasy with the society of the dead, but this passed. I had learned from them. In some way I remembered what they remembered. Wanda’s younger son grew up to become a historian, who approved my dissertation fifty-five years after his mother had saved him from the ghetto. Twenty years after that, I found the record of what his mother had done and wrote about it myself. Life is not just inside people; it passes through people.</p> \n<p>It was the ochre curtain I didn’t like; it was the passage into death, repulsive and seductive, that I feared. I never drew it in my diary; I remember it too well.</p> \n<p>*</p> \n<figure data-id=\"71453\" data-usage-terms=\"3,60,2020-09-03\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-71453\" src=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1214355886.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1214355886.jpeg 1600w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1214355886-125x82.jpeg 125w, https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1214355886-768x504.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\">\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n   <small>Misha Friedman/Getty Images</small>Outside St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, New York, March 23, 2020\n  </figcaption></img>\n</figure> \n<p>I was in sepsis for a long time. Britain’s National Health Service recommends that antibiotics be administered to a septic patient no later than one hour after admission to a hospital. My father-in-law, a physician, was trained that the doctor should see to this personally. In my case I had to wait eight hours, until after that surreal second spinal tap. Nine hours after that test’s negative result, the curtain was drawn, and my bed was pulled from the alcove into an operating room. Someone had finally looked at my scans from the time of the appendectomy and noticed the neglected liver problem. A new scan then showed that the abscess in my liver had grown very large during the two weeks it was ignored. After an urgent procedure to drain my liver, I was wheeled to a hospital room, the one where I would spend the last two days of 2019 and the early part of 2020. After my postoperative care was mishandled, I underwent another procedure on my liver, to add two more drains.</p> \n<p>I was released weeks later with nine new holes in me: three from the appendectomy, three for liver drains, two from spinal taps, and one in my arm for the tube that channeled the antibiotics I inject. My hands and feet are still tingling, from what my neurologist now believes is nerve damage caused by my immune system when it reacted to an overwhelming threat.</p> \n<p>As I write, I am still in treatment: taking medication, undergoing tests, and seeing doctors. For me, writing is part of the treatment. My own malaise has meaning only insofar as it helps me understand our broader malady. I remember places where I should not have been, things that should not have happened, not to me nor to anyone else, and I want to make sense of them.</p> \n<p>After I was discharged from the hospital in New Haven, I heard that colleagues were astounded that my wife and I hadn’t called in powerful patrons to protect me when I was in the emergency room. That had not occurred to us. If the system does work that way, it should not. If some Americans have access to health care thanks to wealth or connections, they will feel pleased because they are included and others are not. Such a feeling turns our human concern about health into a silent yet profound inequality that undermines democracy. When everyone has access to decent care at minimal cost, as is true for almost all of the developed world, it is easier to see fellow citizens as equal.</p> \n<p>Part of our malady is that there is nothing in our country, not even life and not even death, where we take the proposition that “all men are created equal” seriously. If health care were available to everyone, we would be healthier not only physically but also mentally. Our lives would be less anxious and lonely because we would not be thinking that our survival depended on our relative economic and social position. We would be profoundly more free.</p> \n<p>Since health is so elemental to existence, confidence about care is an important part of freedom. If everyone can assume that treatment will be available when necessary, they can turn their minds and their resources to other matters, make freer choices, pursue greater happiness. If, on the other hand, people think that care is preferential, then those who are on the inside start to take pleasure from the suffering of those who are on the outside. If health care is a privilege rather than a right, it demoralizes those who get it and kills those who do not. Everyone is drawn into a sadistic system that comes to seem natural. Rather than pursuing happiness as individuals, we are together creating a collective of pain.</p> \n<p>And so our malady concerns us all. We all take part in the collective of pain. Those of us who are doing better are harming those who are less well-off. When health care is competitive the winners do wrong to others, but they also get worse care themselves. Distracted by their relative advantage, they do not see that by harming others they are also harming themselves. If health care were a right, we would <em>all</em> have better access to treatment and would all be liberated from the collective of pain. Health care should be a right, not a privilege, for the sake of our bodies, and for the sake of our souls.</p> \n<hr> \n <p><strong>This article is adapted from <a
