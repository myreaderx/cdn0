It lays the foundation to provide things like auto-completion, rename, and more across editors.</p>\n<p>And today, we&#8217;re excited to bring it to Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>For some background, our team went through a series of customer calls to understand their workflows and pain-points. After talking with lots of these customers, we noticed a high number of <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet\">ASP.NET</a>/<a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet-core\">ASP.NET Core</a> users were building their front-end in Angular. Unfortunately, outside of standard Visual Studio editor features (such as code completions, IntelliSense, Go to Definition and etc), there isn&#8217;t much support for Angular.</p>\n<p>That is why we decided to bring the <a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/language-service\">Angular Language Service</a> for a better customer experience. The extension will bring in Angular code completions, Angular Diagnostic messages and Quick Info. Go to Definition will be coming soon.</p>\n<p><em>Please note you will need to have a minimum version of 16.5.0 of Visual Studio to use this extension</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"usage\" class=\"mume-header\">Usage</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-download-the-extension-from-the-visual-studio\" class=\"mume-header\">1.

Using <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/research/group/prose/\">PROSE</a> (PROgram Synthesis by Example), IntelliCode synthesizes generalized edit scripts that take your code from the “before editing” state to the “after”. When IntelliCode suggestions discovers that it can apply one of these scripts in your code, IntelliCode lets you know via the Visual Studio lightbulb in the margin and when you hover over the affected code. In both the lightbulb and by hovering over the affected code, IntelliCode offers actions to apply the suggestion for you. The underlying technology is like the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/flash-fill-gives-excel-smart-charge/\">Excel’s Flash Fill feature</a> and is described in <a href=\"http://aka.ms/repetitive-edits\">this research paper</a>.</p>\n<p>This is not just tracking text changes – IntelliCode is aware of the syntactic structure of your code. Syntactic awareness allows IntelliCode to detect cases where the variable names in your refactoring examples differ, but the essential structure of the change is the same.</p>\n<p>If you do not like a suggested change you can select the ignore option on the lightbulb, and we will not bother you about that detected pattern again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"let-us-know-what-you-think\">Let us know what you think!</h3>\n<p>We would love to hear about your experiences as you try this new feature.

While these changes benefit all Visual Studio users, they are especially helpful if you need to work across Azure AD tenants that have enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) policies. That’s because these improvements help preserve your authenticated state, which removes the need to re-enter your credentials outside your organization’s policy requirements.</p>\n<p>With today’s demands for more secure environments, Conditional Access (CA) policies such as MFA have become more common place. Azure AD offers a wide range of CA policies to secure access to your resources, and while Visual Studio 2017 offered support for these policies, if you work across multiple MFA enabled tenants, you likely experienced the need to constantly re-enter your credentials inside Visual Studio. Today, I’ll show you how we’ve resolved the problem in the latest version of Visual Studio 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"system-web-browser-authentication-flow\">System web browser authentication flow</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most impactful change we made, is to allow you to use your system’s default web browser to authenticate your accounts. If you access resources across multiple tenants that enabled MFA policies, using this new flow should help minimize the need to re-enter credentials.</p>\n<p>To enable this workflow, go to Visual Studio&#8217;s Options dialog <strong>(Tools &#62; Options…)</strong>, select the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab and pick <strong>System web browser</strong> under the <strong>Add and reauthenticate accounts using:</strong> dropdown:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-230000\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/word-image.png\" width=\"767\" height=\"428\" /></p>\n<p>Once the option is enabled, you can sign in or add accounts to Visual Studio as you normally would, via the Account Settings dialog <strong>(File &#62; Account Settings…)</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-230001 size-large\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/add-a-new-personalization-account-to-visual-studio-1024x673.png\" alt=\"Add a new personalization account to Visual Studio.\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/add-a-new-personalization-account-to-visual-studio-1024x673.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/add-a-new-personalization-account-to-visual-studio-300x197.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/add-a-new-personalization-account-to-visual-studio-768x505.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/add-a-new-personalization-account-to-visual-studio.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>This action will open your system&#8217;s default web browser, ask you to sign into your account, and validate any pending MFA request.</p>\n<p>While this will help minimize the need to re-enter your credentials, please note that Visual Studio may still prompt for credentials based on your company’s CA <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime\">session management policies</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"individual-tenant-filtering\">Individual tenant filtering</h2>\n<p>Previous versions of Visual Studio offered the option of scoping down to a single Azure AD tenant by applying a filter. While helpful, and since you couldn’t multi-select, you had to constantly switch your filter to fit your needs. In addition, your selection had no impact on your authentication experience, as you still needed to always authenticate against all your tenants.</p>\n<p>You might be happy to know that we have redesigned the filtering experience. The new version allows you to multi-select tenants and it impacts your authentication experience. For example, applying a filter also removes the need to authenticate against tenants not selected by the filter, and also hides their respective resources from Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>To filter out tenants, open the Account Settings dialog <strong>(File &#62; Account Settings…)</strong> and click on <strong>Apply filter</strong>:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-230002\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/apply-filter-.png\" alt=\"Apply filter.\" width=\"604\" height=\"430\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Filter account</strong> dialog will appear, allowing you to select which tenants you want to use with your account:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-230003\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/select-account-to-filter-.png\" alt=\"Select account to filter.\" width=\"398\" height=\"361\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"authenticate-across-all-tenants-on-signing-in\">Authenticate across all tenants on signing-in</h3>\n<p>Based on your company’s CA policies, tenants on your account could be associated with a very strict set of policies such as a specific IP range or a domain join requirement. If you already know you won’t be able to meet those requirements, attempting to authenticate against these tenants will negatively impact your productivity.</p>\n<p>To avoid dealing with those tenants, you can now disable the “Authenticate across all Azure Active Directories on signing-in” option. Disabling the option allows you to only authenticate with your account’s default tenant (if you are using a Work or School account it will likely be the organization’s tenant), and ignore or filter out all other tenants. Consequentially, sign-in operations such as when launching Visual Studio, will be faster. However, it also means that you need to manually select any additional tenants you’d like to work with, allowing you to fully customize the tenants and resources that will show up in Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>You can select this capability in the dialog that’s presented when you first launch Visual Studio:</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-230004\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/word-image-1.png\" width=\"431\" height=\"520\" /></p>\n<p>You can also choose this option via the Options dialog <strong>(Tools &#62; Options… &#62; Accounts):</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-230005\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/word-image-2.png\" width=\"761\" height=\"424\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"try-it-out-and-let-us-know-what-you-think\">Try it out and let us know what you think!</h3>\n<p>We are eager to know how these features fit your workflow and account configurations.

Customizations that differs from the default Visual Studio behaviors that your audience are already familiar with often cause confusion too.</p>\n<p>Here are some typical barriers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code is too small</li>\n<li>Text in tool windows and menus is too small</li>\n<li>Custom toolbar button layouts</li>\n<li>Extensions that change the behavior of Visual Studio</li>\n<li>Custom color themes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, to remove as many barriers as possible, we need a fresh install of Visual Studio without any customizations. Yikes!</p>\n<p>Or we can use Presentation Mode to open an instance of Visual Studio that looks exactly like a fresh install. Here’s what you get with a Presentation Mode instance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Default settings, window layout, theme, and keyboard shortcuts</li>\n<li>No extensions (other than machine-wide ones)</li>\n<li>No settings synchronization with the <em>normal</em> Visual Studio instance</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can then customize any settings to configure Visual Studio for your demo or workspace. For example, change the font sizes to 18 for the <em>Text Editor</em> and 12 for the <em>Environment</em> or whatever value makes you happy. When you close Visual Studio these settings will be preserved for the next time you use Presentation Mode.</p>\n<p>There are two ways of entering Presentation Mode:</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-easy-way\">The easy way</h2>\n<p>Install the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.Tweaks\">Tweaks extension</a> and open any solution, project, or file in Visual Studio. That ensures that the extension fully initializes. Now you can right-click the Visual Studio icon in the Windows task bar to open in Presentation Mode.</p>\n<p>This makes it super easy to start a new Presentation Mode instance of Visual Studio.</p>\n<p><div style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"cta_button_link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wMJIYz9lvU&#38;list=PLReL099Y5nRc-zbaFbf0aNcIamBQujOxP&#38;index=19\" style=\"text-transform: titlecase; display: inline-block; background-color: #5C2D91; color: white; padding: 10px; margin:10px 0; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">Watch demo of Presentation Mode</a></div></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-also-somewhat-pretty-easy-way\">The also somewhat pretty easy way</h2>\n<p>This is how the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.Tweaks\">Tweaks extension</a> mentioned above does it under the hood. You can do the same thing yourself if you don’t want to install the extension.</p>\n<p>Open the Developer Command Prompt or Developer PowerShell and execute the following line:</p>\n<p><code>devenv /RootSuffix <em>Demo</em></code></p>\n<p>You can swap the word <em>Demo</em> with whatever other word you want to create yet another isolated instance type. That might be useful for situations where you want different customizations depending on what type of project you’re working on.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may want certain extensions and window layouts only when doing web development. This gives you that flexibility.</p>\n<p><div style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"cta_button_link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifdKuAiV4I4&#38;list=PLReL099Y5nRc-zbaFbf0aNcIamBQujOxP&#38;index=10\" style=\"text-transform: titlecase; display: inline-block; background-color: #5C2D91; color: white; padding: 10px; margin:10px 0; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">Watch demo of customized instances</a></div></p>\n<p>Having the ability to isolate Visual Studio for various development scenarios and demo purposes is quite powerful. They are also easy to create and well supported – even in older version of Visual Studio.

ONNX Runtime works with popular frameworks and makes it easy to integrate into different serving environments by providing APIs covering a variety of languages including Python, C, C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript – we used the .NET Core compatible C# APIs to integrate into the <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW17507816 BCX8\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"FieldRange SCXW17507816 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW17507816 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun CommentStart SCXW17507816 BCX8\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">Microsoft Python Language Se</span></span><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW17507816 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW17507816 BCX8\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">rver</span></span></span></a>.</p>\n<p>Quantization is an effective approach for model size reduction and performance acceleration if the accuracy drop introduced by low bit width numbers approximation is acceptable. With the post-training INT8 quantization provided by ONNX Runtime, the resulting improvement was significant: both memory footprint and inference time were brought down to about a quarter of the pre-quantized values, comparing to the original model with an acceptable 3% reduction of model accuracy. You can find details of the model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, accuracy and performance in the <a href=\"https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/pythia-ai-assisted-code-completion-system\">research paper</a> we published at the 2019 KDD conference.</p>\n<p>The final gate of the release to production was doing online A/B experimentation comparing the new LSTM model and the previous production model. The online A/B experimentation results in the Table 2 below showed about 25% improvement on top-1 recommendation precision (the precision of the first recommended completion item in the completion list) and 17% improvement on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank\">mean reciprocal rank</a>(MRR), which convinced us the new LSTM model is significantly better than the previous production model.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_230380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-230380\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-230380 size-full\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/IntelliCode_DL_img5.png\" alt=\"A/B testing result showing significant metrics' improvements\" width=\"686\" height=\"210\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-230380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Table 2.

This feature automatically decodes managed COM objects referenced by native pointers allowing you to fully inspect values in the Locals Window.</p>\n<p>I am incredibly fortunate to have been using the Microsoft stack since the 90s! #getoffmylawn During that time there have been some truly transformational leaps in the technology that have helped developers like me provide solutions to customers across multiple industries.</p>\n<p>A few years back I helped with the design and support of an incredibly successful online banking platform, however, the core design was developed in the late 90s and early 2000s which meant there was significant reliance on COM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-com\">What is COM?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal\">COM</a> is a distributed, object-oriented standard for creating binary software components that can interact, it succeeded <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/about-dynamic-data-exchange\">DDE</a> (now that is going back <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />) and became the foundation technology for Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/ole-and-data-transfer\">OLE</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/activex-controls\">ActiveX</a> technologies.</p>\n<p>COM permits objects to live within a single process or in other processes, and they can also be instantiated on remote servers (using DCOM &#8211; Distributed COM). We refer to COM as a binary standard as objects can be written in different languages. COM also defines how objects work together over a distributed environment and has security features that govern system and component integrity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-heterogenous-systems-in-visual-studio\">Debugging Heterogenous Systems in Visual Studio</h3>\n<p>When .NET was introduced in the early 2000s it was intended to supersede COM, however, my old dev team had already created a compelling set of services for a long list of satisfied customers.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for us COM and .NET are complementary development technologies. The .NET Common Language Runtime provides bi-directional integration with COM. This meant that COM and .NET applications and components could take advantage of each other’s functionality. This protected our existing investments in COM while allowing us to take advantage of .NET at a deliberate and cost-effective cadence.</p>\n<p>Even with this cooperation between technology stacks some of the debugging experiences in Visual Studio fell short especially for full variable inspection. This was especially true if you had a native code base that consumed COM objects implemented in managed code.</p>\n<p>When a COM client calls a .NET object, the common language runtime creates the managed object and a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper\">COM callable wrapper (CCW)</a> for the object. Unable to reference a .NET object directly, COM clients use the CCW as a proxy for the managed object.</p>\n<p>The original debugging experience in Visual Studio showed a COM interface pointer for the managed implementation object as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table\">vtable</a> with no discernable values (A vtable, virtual method table, is how COM binds a method call to its implementation at run time).

That would get especially inconvenient if data binding or the data source didn&#8217;t yet exist. We wanted to give you a way to see your controls filled with data during the design-time development. That&#8217;s why we are introducing a new feature called design-time data. Now, for each XAML property for built-in controls, you can easily set a value visible only in the designer and not compiled into your binaries. To use this functionality, simply put a <strong>d:</strong> in front of the property you want to mock, and the designer will do the rest.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_230166\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-230166\" style=\"width: 1276px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-230166\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignTime.png\" alt=\"Image 167GADesignTime\" width=\"1276\" height=\"54\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignTime.png 1276w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignTime-300x13.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignTime-1024x43.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignTime-768x33.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1276px) 100vw, 1276px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-230166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Design-time Data in Visual Studio 2019 v16.7</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This will allow you to see the values from the properties with <strong>d:</strong> in the designer. When your application is running, it will have values specified in the same properties without <strong>d:</strong>. This technique works for WPF .NET Core and UWP projects for all built-in controls that come with the frameworks. In the future, we are look to add support for third-party and improved custom control improvements.</p>\n<h5>XAML Designer Refresh Button</h5>\n<p>Next, we introduce the XAML Designer Refresh Button.  You no longer need to close and re-open the designer view to resolve rendering issues. You can simply press the refresh button located in the bottom-left icon near the zoom level indicator.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_230165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-230165\" style=\"width: 349px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-230165 size-full\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignerRefreshButton.png\" alt=\"Image 167GADesignerRefreshButton\" width=\"349\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignerRefreshButton.png 349w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GADesignerRefreshButton-300x71.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-230165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Designer Refresh Button in Visual Studio 2019 v16.7</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h5>XAML Code Editor</h5>\n<p>Finally, the XAML code editor shows color icons next to the color code for WPF.

It is especially useful in embedded scenarios where your target system may not have the resources to run gdb.</p>\n<p>We’ve also extended our support for different Linux distributions and shells. For example, you can now set the default shell to zsh using <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/linux/connectionmanager-reference?view=vs-2019\">ConnectionManager.exe</a> by setting the new “shell” property.</p>\n<p>If you are using MSBuild to build your Linux applications, you can now use Ninja to speed up your incremental builds.

Select <strong>Add ‘DebuggerDisplay` attribute. </strong>This will add the debugger display attribute to the top of your class and generate an auto method that returns ToString() which you can edit to return the property value you want pinned in the debugger.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_230163\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-230163\" style=\"width: 761px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-230163\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAAddDebuggerDisplay.png\" alt=\"Image 167GAAddDebuggerDisplay\" width=\"761\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAAddDebuggerDisplay.png 761w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAAddDebuggerDisplay-300x158.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-230163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Add a Debugger Display Attribute to a Class in Visual Studio 2019 v16.7</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h5>Profiler</h5>\n<p>In Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7, we have added a new .NET <strong>Performance Counters tool</strong> the profiler to help you  visualize and analyze <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters\">dotnet counters</a>. Dotnet counters are high level performance metrics such as cpu usage or exception count, that give you insights into how your application is performing. By looking at these metrics, you will be able to more quickly diagnose the type of performance bottleneck your application is facing. To run this tool, select <strong>Debug -&#62; Performance Profiler -&#62; Checkmark .NET Performance Counters </strong>within Visual Studio.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_230172\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-230172\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-230172\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAProfiler-1024x716.png\" alt=\"Image 167GAProfiler\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAProfiler-1024x716.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAProfiler-300x210.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAProfiler-768x537.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/167GAProfiler.png 1429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-230172\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">.NET Performance Counters Tool in Visual Studio 2019 v16.7</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>We heard feedback from you that getting and studying the performance counters was cumbersome using the command line so now you will be able to see the counters right from within Visual Studio. Furthermore, in addition to seeing the value of the counters in a table like you were previously you can see the values of counters in graphs. This should highlight trends in how a particular counter’s value changes over time which were difficult to visualize before.</p>\n<h4>Extended support for Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7</h4>\n<p>Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 is the third supported servicing baseline for Visual Studio 2019. Consequently, Enterprise and Professional customers needing to adopt a long term stable and secure development environment are encouraged to standardize on this version.  As explained in more detail in our <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/productinfo/vs-servicing-vs\">lifecycle and support policy</a>, version 16.7 will be supported with fixes and security updates for one year after the release of the next servicing baseline.</p>\n<p>Now that version 16.7 is available, version 16.4, our last released servicing baseline, will be supported for an additional year and will go out of support in October 2021. Prior minor versions 16.0, 16.1, 16.2, 16.5 and 16.6 are no longer under support.  These intermediary releases received servicing fixes only until the next minor update was released.</p>\n<p>You can acquire the latest most secure version of Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 in the downloads tab of the <a href=\"https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?q=Visual%20Studio%202019\">Subscriptions portal</a>.  For more information about Visual Studio supported baselines, please review the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/productinfo/vs-servicing-vs\">support policy for Visual Studio 2019</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-in-visual-studio-2019-v16-8-preview-1\">New in Visual Studio 2019 v16.8 Preview 1</h3>\n<h4>Git Integration</h4>\n<h5>Easier Navigation Through the Git Repository Window</h5>\n<p>Since we&#8217;ve first released it, we&#8217;ve made several modifications to the Git Repository window to more easily navigate through it.

Looking into your database tier requires specific tools, now you can quickly and easily investigate using the database profiling tool in Visual Studio’s Performance Explorer!</p>\n<p>When it comes to diagnosing the performance of web application, one thing we’ve heard in dozens of conversations with developers, is that the database tier of an application is usually a prime suspect for what is causing sluggishness within an application. However, a quick internet search reveals just how challenging it can be to investigate those issues, most solutions require installing a separate tool, gathering huge SQL traces, or changing your application’s code to get the information you need.</p>\n<p>In order to make this process less cumbersome and complicated, we’ve developed the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/analyze-database?view=vs-2019\">Database tool</a> found within the Performance Profiler in Visual Studio to help you gain deep insight into the database tier of your application. You can see exactly what helpful information about what database activities happen during the execution of your application, such as which queries and transactions are the longest running, which connection string each query is using and perhaps most importantly, where in your code those queries are being made.</p>\n<p>Follow the simple example below to see how you can use this tool to pinpoint places in your code that interact with your database and could potentially be improved for meaningful performance gains for your users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-the-tool\">Using the tool</h3>\n<p>Imagine for example you have an online store such as the excellent ASP.NET Core example <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb\">eShopOnWeb</a>, this is a great sample application that exercises a lot of the features of .NET Core and uses a SQL database with Entity Framework. After following the directions on the GitHub project page to build and launch the site, take a few moments to click around, filter the catalog and fill your shopping cart with a few items.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-230093 size-large\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb-1024x774.png\" alt=\"Image eshoponweb\" width=\"640\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb-1024x774.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb-300x227.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb-768x581.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb-1536x1162.png 1536w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/eshoponweb.png 1773w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>Even using the browser’s developer tools there is no way to identify exactly when a database query is happening or if it might be causing a delay during an action like filtering the catalog as seen in the screenshot above. Using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/analyze-database?view=vs-2019\">Database tool</a> we can capture the exact database activity that happens during any user action and investigate further.</p>\n<p>To do so we’ll simply open the Performance Profiler in Visual Studio by clicking Debug &#62; Performance Profiler or using the keyboard shortcut Alt + F2 and selecting t<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">he checkbox next to &#8220;Database&#8221; to enable the tool. For a more accurate profile, run your application in Release configuration instead of Debug. Then click start to launch and begin profiling your application.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-230207 aligncenter\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/launch_page-1-1024x682.png\" alt=\"Image launch page\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/launch_page-1-1024x682.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/launch_page-1-300x200.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/launch_page-1-768x512.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/launch_page-1.png 1117w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>Interact with your application in the ways you&#8217;re interested in investigating, then when you&#8217;re ready to examine the data, click &#8220;Stop Collection&#8221; in Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>After collection is stopped, Visual Studio will quickly process the data collected and display a table of the queries that happened during your profiling session along with a graph that shows when and how many queries happen over time. Right clicking on any column header reveals the columns available that could help you order, and analyze the activity you recorded. This can make spotting anomalies  very quick, such as a long running query that only affects a few records or a query using the wrong connection string.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-230092 aligncenter\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/columns.png\" alt=\"Image columns\" width=\"208\" height=\"163\" /></p>\n<p>After identifying a query that warrants further investigation, finding where in the code this query happens is as simple as right clicking on the row, and selecting “Go To Source File”!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-230094 size-full\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/database.png\" alt=\"Image database\" width=\"873\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/database.png 873w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/database-300x185.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/07/database-768x472.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px\" /></p>\n<p>Whenever possible the tool will immediately take you the line or block of code that executed the query in question, saving you the often tedious task of digging through a complex code base.</p>\n<h3 id=\"try-it\">Try it!</h3>\n<p>This feature can be found in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or later and works with .NET Core projects  using either <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-overview\">ADO.NET</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/\">Entity Framework Core</a>. This tool also works on traces collected using <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace\">dotnet trace</a> which means we can collect data anywhere that .NET Core runs (including Linux!) and analyze that data in Visual Studio. To see how to use dotnet trace check out the documentation found <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/documentation/dotnet-trace-instructions.md\">here</a> and use the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/a0aaa5c80a2bea4ce6dc9b00c0f1d7242be0b42b/docs/Features-overview.md#response-files\">response file</a> available for download <a href=\"https://aka.ms/dotnet-trace/database_providers.rsp\">here</a> to enable the correct event providers.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear how you are using this tool and any feedback that can help us make diagnosing issues and writing performant code an even better experience!
