Google Play Books Partner Center yesterday which touted a new (?) promo code feature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">Dear Partner,</p>\n<p align=\"left\">We’re launching a new marketing tool for publishers: <strong><span class=\"il\">promo</span> code campaigns</strong>. <span class=\"il\">Promo</span> code campaigns can be used to offer select customers a free or discounted book without lowering your book’s list price in the store.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">With <span class=\"il\">promo</span> <span class=\"il\">codes</span>, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer discounts to customers in 75+ countries</li>\n<li>Distribute free books to generate buzz or reviews</li>\n<li>Create deals to integrate with marketing campaigns or event promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"left\">With <span class=\"il\">promo</span> code campaigns, you have three different discount options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free</strong> allows customers to redeem the book at no cost</li>\n<li><strong>Percentage off (ebooks only)</strong> allows customers to receive a percentage discount off the book’s list price.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixed price promotion </strong>allows customers to purchase the book for a lower fixed price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"left\">After creating a <span class=\"il\">promo</span> code campaign, you can share the promotion with your customers via a code and hyperlink (URL) to the Play Store, where they can redeem the code. You can create up to 5,000 <span class=\"il\">codes</span> per campaign and up to 3 <span class=\"il\">promo</span> code campaigns per month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can read more about it in the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/books/partner/answer/9827742?p=books_promo_codes\">Play Books help pages</a>.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but after Google announced the launch of a <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/13/google-play-books-now-pays-a-70-royalty-in-60-countries/\">70% royalty</a> offer last week,  I was expecting them to launch new tools and services you could use to promote sales in Play Books.</p>\n<p>This is a good development, although I do not know if it will have much impact. Based on the response from authors last week, Play Books&#8217; share of the ebook market is negligible. Consumers don&#8217;t want to shop there, and releasing promo codes isn&#8217;t going to change that.</p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/23/google-play-books-now-offers-promo-codes/\">Google Play Books Now Offers Promo Codes</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=sHOQrboGJRY:-jzlXOxNvWc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=sHOQrboGJRY:-jzlXOxNvWc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=sHOQrboGJRY:-jzlXOxNvWc:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/sHOQrboGJRY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:17:32 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-play-books-rental-open-road-media-1.png?resize=620%2C397&ssl=1","linkMd5":"fb6591e2698ddec35638fc848926f485","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-40-760_f6922f9ac11cb8cd.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":397,"sourceBytes":36844,"destBytes":36844,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-play-books-rental-open-road-media-1.png?resize=620%2C397&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-40-760_f6922f9ac11cb8cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn74@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-43-199_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn61@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-43-323_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-43-200_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/sHOQrboGJRY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn78@2020_1/2020/10/27/16-53-43-681_c5d58a04f2608ba4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817599517},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:19","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:19","title":"E-ink to Launch New Kaleido Screens by Year’s End (Digitimes)","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=141439","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-139289\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=467%2C620&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=467%2C620&#38;ssl=1 467w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=188%2C250&#38;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=113%2C150&#38;ssl=1 113w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?w=681&#38;ssl=1 681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Remember how I told you back in August that Onyx <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/08/10/onyx-is-planning-a-7-8-nova2-color-ereader/\">teased a 7.8&#8243; color ereader</a> based on the Boox Nova2?</p>\n<p>Well, <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20201023PD207.html?mod=2\">Digitimes</a> says that the screen unit for that larger ereader is going to ship this year.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"P1\">E-paper solution provider E Ink Holdings (EIH) plans to launch new colored e-paper solutions based on its second-generation Print Color Technology before year-end 2020, according to industry sources.</p>\n<p class=\"P2\">The new colored e-paper solutions will target mainly e-book reader and e-notebook applications and will also enable device makers to enlarge the sizes of their products to 8-10 inches instead of the current mainstream 6-inch segment, said the sources.</p>\n<p class=\"P1\">Due to strong demand for its colored e-paper solutions, the company is currently expanding the backend module capacity at its plant in Yangzhou, China, which will boost its capacity significantly after completion at year-end 2020, the sources said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case you were wondering, &#8220;Print Color&#8221; is the name E-ink uses for the tech that goes into its Kaleido screens (see the <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/color-technology.html\">E-ink website</a>). The reason that it&#8217;s referred to as &#8220;second-gen&#8221; is because Kaleido screens are the second generation of E-ink screens to use a color filter layer on top of a grayscale screen. (The first-gen screens were the Triton screens.)</p>\n<p>Digitimes is not a reliable source, so you should not put a lot of hopes in this. Also, production bugs are unpredictable, and have frequently caused delays to release schedules.</p>\n<p>But wouldn&#8217;t it be great if it came true?</p>\n<p>Can you imagine what it would be like if Onyx or Dasung launched a 13&#8243; E-ink monitor?</p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/23/e-ink-to-launch-new-kaleido-screens-by-years-end-digitimes/\">E-ink to Launch New Kaleido Screens by Year&#8217;s End (Digitimes)</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8o5F2az22_Q:HtJKLuB3hQU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8o5F2az22_Q:HtJKLuB3hQU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=8o5F2az22_Q:HtJKLuB3hQU:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/8o5F2az22_Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 13:38:24 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=467%2C620&ssl=1","linkMd5":"794cc47d7d21a42a82f3c3bc97f41582","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn6@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-34-718_2bac348248bc4dbf.webp","destWidth":467,"destHeight":620,"sourceBytes":42846,"destBytes":42846,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaleido.png?resize=467%2C620&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn6@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-34-718_2bac348248bc4dbf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn74@2020_3/2020/10/27/16-53-43-199_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn61@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-43-323_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/27/16-53-43-200_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/8o5F2az22_Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2020/10/27/16-53-43-265_b1ecc69c6f4129c8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603817599518},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:19","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 00:53:19","title":"Barnes & Noble’s Nook Service Still Crippled by Hack","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=141524","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/40650713152_e4924295c2_h.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-141525\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/40650713152_e4924295c2_h.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/40650713152_e4924295c2_h.jpg?resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/40650713152_e4924295c2_h.jpg?zoom=2&#38;resize=620%2C300&#38;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>It has been over two weeks since hackers <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/13/all-of-barnes-nobles-computer-systems-are-down-and-i-do-mean-all-of-them/\">had their way with B&#38;N&#8217;s servers</a>, and the retailer still hasn&#8217;t fully recovered.</p>\n<p>The hack, which has since been confirmed as <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/14/barnes-noble-is-now-informing-customers-about-data-stolen-during-saturdays-hack/\">a ransomware attack</a>, originated in B&#38;N&#8217;s corporate offices before spreading to their servers, store computers, and even the cash registers. All parts of B&#38;N were affected, and while most functionality was restored within a few days, B&#38;N&#8217;s Nook service is still only semi-functional.</p>\n<p>And that includes the author side, as well as the reader. I got <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2020/10/13/all-of-barnes-nobles-computer-systems-are-down-and-i-do-mean-all-of-them/#comment-1716354\">a comment</a> last night from an author whose book launch has been delayed as a result of B&#38;N&#8217;s server issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is even effecting the authors back end of Barnes &#38; Noble. Unfortunately my book was supposed to go live on the 22nd, we get vague updates about how the “dashboard is working” but they are “still working on other issues”….it’s not the 26th? oof. I know one other author who hasn’t had their book live since the hack day itself. every day authors can’t sell books after the pre-marketed publish date is a wasted sales day, every day is a missed book sold opportunity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over on the reader side, I can report first hand that my library of Nook ebooks is still mostly inaccessible. I have two Nook accounts, and the one with my thousands of Fictionwise purchases cannot be accessed via the B&#38;N website and it is still not syncing with the Nook app on my Android smartphone. My second, test account can be accessed via the B&#38;N website, but it&#8217;s also not syncing with the Nook app.</p>\n<p>Just about the only thing that can be accessed from the Nook app are new purchases made in the app itself.</p>\n<p>This could not happen at a worst time for B&#38;N. We going into the holiday sales period during a time when ebook sales are increasing as a result of the pandemic. This would have been a great opportunity for B&#38;N to reinvigorate ebook sales and start turning around its digital division, but instead this is looking more like another nail in Nook&#8217;s coffin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jjbers/\">jjbers</a> via <a
