Yes, it's still part of the RF lens system. Yes, it's still got a full-frame sensor - but it's a 20-megapixel one, designed with action shooting in mind.</p><p>The R6's sensor is also capable of shooting in conditions as low as -6.5EV, which means it can autofocus is conditions like moonlight or even candle light. It is, on the basis of that, a consumer camera with no rival when it comes to low-light shooting, which is quite the accolade.</p><p>The R6 is certainly no slouch, then, thanks to the latest Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus system - which is capable of automatically detecting faces, eyes, and even animals in order to track them in real time.</p><p>Canon described the R6 to Pocket-lint as the mirrorless embodiment of the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/141439-canon-eos-6d-mark-ii-review-one-of-the-most-versatile-full-frame-dslr-cameras\" rel=\"\">EOS 6D II</a> (because of its full-frame sensor) and the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/131682-canon-eos-7d-mark-ii-review-king-of-quality\" rel=\"\">EOS 7D II</a> (for its fast shooting capabilities). The shutter can actuate at 12 frames per second (20fps in electronic shutter mode), making light work of fast-moving subjects.</p><p>Although the R6 doesn't have the resolution to match the R5 when it comes to video capabilities (i.e. there's no 8K here), it can shoot 4K at 60fps (oversampling from a 5.1K frame).</p><p>Elsewhere there's a vari-angle touchscreen LCD, paired with a built-in 3.69m-dot electronic viewfinder (EVF) - ensuring versatile use whether you're shooting from the eye or the waist.</p><p>As the body is polycarbonate - not magnesium alloy as is typical - it's also ultra-light, plus it's weather-sealed too.</p><p>The Canon EOS R6 will be available from 27 August, priced £2,499.99 for the body, or £2,849.99 with the 24-105mm STM kit lens included in the box. That might be just enough to lure you away from a traditional DSLR.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152768-cameras-news-canon-eos-r6-image1-3bivl8nly7.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"0caf20aac38938597001131b2a6576ac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-50-773_cfecf8c030f225c0.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":58393,"destBytes":38084,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152768-cameras-news-canon-eos-r6-image1-3bivl8nly7.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-50-773_cfecf8c030f225c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209016},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Panasonic Lumix G100 vlogging camera tracks faces & isolates voices in audio first","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/panasonic/152607-panasonic-lumix-g100-mirrorless-vlogging-face-voice","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-9r3djdpigx.jpg?v1\"> <p>As the vlogging world gathers momentum, traditional camera makers are setting their sights onto the portable video camera market. The Panasonic Lumix G100 is one such product - but a camera with many points of difference that help set it apart from its competition.</p><p>The G100 comes with OZO Audio by Nokia - it's the first time this technology has been used in a consumer camera - which can utilise the three on-board cameras to isolate audio. It's even clever enough to use face-detection tracking and isolate audio to that specific area - matching face to voice for the best possible quality without interference.</p><p>Principally the G100 is part of the Lumix G range, meaning it's an interchangeable lens mirrorless camera. You can switch out lenses as you wish, adjusting the camera's capabilities as a result. Primarily, however, we suspect most will use this small-scale package with the 12-32mm ultra-compact zoom lens - which comes as part of the kit package - for its wide-angle capabilities.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-ldv9joghzs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>While most G series cameras aren't huge by any means, the G100 is considerably smaller than its G series cousins. This isn't a replacement for anything that already exists in the range - it's Panasonic's answer to other small-sensor alternatives, such as the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/152266-sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-release-price-specs\" rel=\"\">Sony ZV-1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/148530-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-review-3-camera-video\" rel=\"\">Canon PowerShot G7 X III</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lumix G100 comes with a vari-angle screen which can be maneuvered to the side of the camera for self shooting. If you'd rather use a viewfinder then a high-resolution one in built-in - it offers 3,680k dots, which is more than many pro-grade digital cameras - which will be great for shooting when in bright sunlight.</p><p>Video quality is 4K at 30fps maximum (the frame crop is 1.47x though), while slow-mo options are also available. Vlog-L is included if you wish to grade content.</p><p>There's also built-in electronic image stabilisation (EIS) which combines with lens optical image stabilisation (OIS) to produce a 5-axis system that can negate the 'bounce' when walking and counter handshake that's often magnified when shooting one-handed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-08svjsqknm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>Designed with the social media minded as its users, there's also a Frame Marker feature which permits vertical video or puts coloured borders on the screen to show you, say, the 5:4 ratio for Instagram. Then there's a dedicated Send Image button to push footage to a smart device via the Lumix Sync app with ease.</p><p>The Panasonic Lumix G100 will be available from the end of July 2020, priced £589 body-only, £679 with the 12-32mm kit lens. Order either before 31 August 2020 and you'll get a free DMW-SHGR1 tripod grip to use with the camera.</p><p>squirrel_widget_270682</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-9r3djdpigx.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"f116238be8d7950030ace3e86634911d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-977_e8f0be231e1e361f.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":58273,"destBytes":25916,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-9r3djdpigx.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-977_e8f0be231e1e361f.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-ldv9joghzs.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-37-20-184_f0bd3f782be0eccc.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152607-cameras-news-panasonic-lumix-g100-image1-08svjsqknm.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-37-18-429_0079cd0f1e7651cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209016},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"29 fantastic photographic firsts","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141060-fantastic-photographic-firsts","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/141060-cameras-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image1-2inpsotauz.jpg?v1\"> <p>Photos serve an important purpose in life. They capture precious moments, funny moments, once in a lifetime moments and many more. With the rise of social media, we're snapping and sharing more photos than ever. According to a recent survey, more than 2.5 trillion photos were shared online in 2016 alone, more than 30 times the amount of photos we took in the 1990s.</p><p>Among the several trillion photos taken over the years, there have been many photo firsts and we've done our research to find the best of them. So join us as we take a trip down a visual memory lane of the photographic milestones of the past 190 years.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image2-sv0au46k2h.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"520\" /></p><h2>First photograph made in a camera</h2><p>The oldest surviving photograph is the View from the Window at Le Gras, taken in 1826 or 1827 by Nicéphore Niépce. It was taken on a camera obscura which projects the image being taken through a pinhole in a screen, where it is then shown as a reversed and inverted image.</p><p>The image on the original plate is quite hard to distinguish, but thanks to modern technology it's been manually enhanced to show buildings and the surrounding fields of the Le Gras estate. It's been voted as one of the 100 most important photographs in the world.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image3-8hrisd2zxv.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"537\" /></p><h2>First picture of a person</h2><p>Louis Daguerre was friends with Niépce, and after Niépce's death in 1833, Daguerre continued to experiment with various and eventually created the Daguerreotype process. He's also responsible for taking the first photo to feature people.</p><p>Taken in 1838 at the Boulevard du Temple, in Paris’ 3rd arrondissement, the long exposure means that that all the traffic in the street has vanished, but two men are clearly visible in the bottom left, who, thanks to one having his boots polished by the other, have remained static long enough to become visible on the negative.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image4-fuz5fq63jq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"982\" /></p><h2>First photographic&nbsp;self-portrait&nbsp;</h2><p>Before we called them ‘selfies’ and we flitted around with smartphones, there was a breed a photographer such as American Robert Cornelius, who did things the hard way.</p><p>A man of infinite patience he is credited with creating the first ever photographic self-portrait in 1839, a feat that required him to sit motionless in front of his camera of a 15 minute exposure.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image5-s7pbddi69a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"732\" /></p><h2>First photographic hoax</h2><p>The accolade of the first staged photograph goes to a one Hippolyte Bayard. Bayard was considered Daguerre's rival, as he came up with his own photography method called the direct positive process. Bayard wanted to be considered <em>the&nbsp;</em>pioneer of photography, but&nbsp;Daguerre beat him to it. As a reaction, Bayard took a photo of himself drowning in water, claiming he had killed himself, when in fact it was all staged.</p><p>He even wrote a full paragraph on the back of it, claiming \"The Government which has been only too generous to Monsieur Daguerre, has said it can do nothing for Monsieur Bayard, and the poor wretch has drowned himself.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image6-mvrp7x9t4q.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"589\" /></p><h2>First real \"news\" photo</h2><p>Despite the name of the photographer who took this 1847 image being lost to the passage of time, this Daguerreotype image of a man being arrested in France by soldiers is widely regarded as the first photograph of a news event.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image7-y3vg7f8euv.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"882\" /></p><h2>First aerial photo</h2><p>The first aerial photo on record is a view of Boston in 1860 at a height of 2,000 feet. Back then photographer's didn't have drones, so this photo was taken from a hot air balloon. It's titled \"Boston, as the Eagle and Wild Goose See it\".</p><p>However, French photographer Nadar (real name Gaspard-Félix Tournachon) is credited as being the exponent of aerial photography in 1858, but unfortunately, none of his work has stood the test of time.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image8-egfb5x3vzf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"1036\" /></p><h2>First photo of a U.S. President</h2><p>As is often the way with images from the early years of photography – just because an image is first doesn't mean it survives. So it is with the early pictures of the U.S. Presidents. On 8 March 1841, William Henry Harrison became the first sitting president to be photographed but sadly the image taken on the day of his inauguration speech has been lost.</p><p>It is, therefore, this&nbsp;1843 image of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President, that has become the oldest surviving image of a Commander in Chief, despite it being taken over a decade after he left the office.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image9-0reovmhuul.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"612\" /></p><h2>First durable&nbsp;colour&nbsp;photo&nbsp;</h2><p>Colour images started appearing in the late 1840s, but the techniques of the day were so laborious and the results so fragile, that it wasn’t until 1861 that the first durable colour image was produced.</p><p>The image, called Tartan Ribbon, was created by photographing the same subject three times, using red, green, and blue filters over the camera's lens. When the pictures were developed, they were printed onto glass sheets and then shone onto a wall via three different projectors – each fitted with a coloured lens that matched the filter used to take the original picture.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image10-f7lvaihym1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h2>First&nbsp;halftone photograph ever printed in a newspaper</h2><p>Halftone refers to the technique of producing an image using several small black dots of varying size and spacings. It's an optical illusion of sorts, as the human eye sees the dots as a gradient.</p><p>The first printing of a halftone photograph was in the 4 March 1880 issue of The Daily Graphic, an American newspaper. The image in question was \"A Scene in Shantytown, New York\".</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image11-qkrg5vewvi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"294\" /></p><h2>First photo taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle</h2><p>Having narrowly survived falling 200 feet from a captive airship, American aerial photographer George R. Lawrence pioneered a safer technique for getting his 22kg cameras to elevated vantage points.</p><p>Through the use of kites, Lawrence was able to capture amazing images such as this one of the ruins of San Francisco following the 1906 Earthquake. The image sold like wildfire netting the photographer $15,000 – almost $400,000 by today’s standards.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image12-2hxi5qpvtd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"729\" /></p><h2>First photo of an atomic bomb being detonated</h2><p>As is often the case throughout its history, photography has often been used to document the very best, and the very worst of mankind’s achievements.</p><p>On July 16th, 1945 the first ever atomic bomb was detonated at the Trinity Site in New Mexico. Of all the numerous images taken of the blast, Jack Aeby's is the only colour photo of the blast to have emerged well exposed enough to show the fireball in all its terrifying glory.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image13-1v9g4x2rqy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"591\" /></p><h2>First photo of&nbsp;the Earth as seen from Space</h2><p>On October 24th, 1946 The White Sands Rocket, officially referred to as V-2 No.13 took the first ever photograph of the Earth from Space.</p><p>Captured using a DeVry 35mm camera the picture was taken from an altitude of 65 miles (104.6Km), 5 times higher than any other picture taken before.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image14-nlqodybdfn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"964\" /></p><h2>First Playboy front cover</h2><p>Ever the showman, when Hugh Heffner launched Playboy magazine in December 1953 he knew he needed something big to woo his potential readers, and they didn’t come much bigger than Marilyn.</p><p>Thanks in part of Marilyn’s star power, along with there being very little direct competition for the startup magazine, Heffner quickly sold all 53,000 copies printed and the publishing icon was born.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image15-tzegjyqorh.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"796\" /></p><h2>First photo to win World Press Photo contest</h2><p>The World Press Photo of the Year is considered as one of the most prestigious press photography competitions in the world.</p><p>It was this image from 1955 of a rider falling off his motorcycle during the Motocross World Championship at the Volk Mølle course that won Danish photographer Mogens von Haven the inaugural title.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image16-wernp2hq6b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"912\" /></p><h2>First digital image</h2><p>Russell A. Kirsch is credited as the man who produced the first digital image. While working at the National Bureau of Standards, Kirsch and his team developed a digital image scanner.</p><p>The first image scanned was of a photo of Kirsch's three-month-old son, captured at one bit per pixel.

It was Bradley Cooper that got to press the shutter button.</p><p>Since then, the photo has become the fastest retweeted image to date, amassing&nbsp;more than&nbsp;3.4 million retweets</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image26-woyvfhyttx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"748\" /></p><h2>First photo of a potato to sell for over $1m</h2><p>No, we kid you not. In a world where photography has long vied to be treated equally to art, it's hardly surprising that photographs should start selling for crazy insane amount of cash.</p><p>There have been several stories over the last few year’s of individual photographs changing hands for vast sums of money but for sheer understated elegance you can’t go beyond a potato photographed by Kevin Absoch.</p><p>For the uninitiated, American photographer Abosch specialises in celebrity portraits and has developed a cult following. It was during dinner at the artist's Paris home in 2015, where a European businessman saw ‘Potato #345’ hanging on the wall and had to have it, regardless the cost, which was a cool million dollars.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image27-8qg0hjmdu6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"1121\" /></p><h2>First photo to get over 10 million likes on Instagram</h2><p>With over 700 million users, it was only a matter of time before a photo uploaded to Instagram would get over 10 million likes. It happened in February 2017 when Beyonce uploaded a photo announcing that she and partner Jay-Z were expecting twins.</p><p>The image has now gained more than 11 million likes and over 500,000 comments.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-news-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image28-fiwr4wx3xs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"224\" /></p><h2>First Gigapixel photo</h2><p>In 1998, underwater photographer Jim Hellemn started to photograph the Bloody Bay Wall off the Cayman Islands. Shooting for 10 days straight over 23 dives, Hellemn painstakingly captured a 20 ft by 68-foot area of the wall in 280 overlapping frames.</p><p>Post-processing of the shots took 6 months with Hallemn using a drum scanner to import each frame into a Mac G4 at 4000ppi. All 18GB of RAW data got combined to create a stunning 1.77 Gigapixel final image. When the project was completed in 1999, it was believed that Hallemn had made the largest image ever created outside of the scientific community.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image29-jllq9w41jg.jpg\" /></p><h2>First photo of the far side of the moon</h2><p>In January 2019,&nbsp;China's Chang'e 4 lunar probe made a soft touchdown on the far side of the moon. At that point, the probe snapped the first photo of that region. The image represented a number of different firsts as it was also the first time that area of the moon had been explored.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141060-cameras-feature-29-fantastic-photographic-firsts-image30-6bknjq1h0w.jpg\" /></p><h2>The first photo of a Black Hole</h2><p>In April 2019, another historic feat was achieved with the help of an&nbsp;international network of radio telescopes called the <a href=\"https://eventhorizontelescope.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Event Horizon Telescope</a>. This system was used to capture the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">first image of a Black Hole</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Although perhaps not the most impressive photo (many would complain about it being \"blurry\") the image itself is actually incredible when you take a look at the facts surrounding it. The first of which is the fact that this Black Hole, known as M87, is located&nbsp;53 million light-years away from Earth. It's also a terrifying sight as it is&nbsp;6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun. It's huge, powerful and utterly dangerous. The effort that went into capturing this image is also impressive.

Whether that's because of countless movies down the years or more modern entries like Westworld and <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/reviews/rockstar/147087-red-dead-redemption-2-review\" rel=\"follow\">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, it's a consistently interesting time.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/151936-photos-american-west\" rel=\"follow\">These old photos from the American West will make you yearn for a better time</a></li> \n </ul><p>Even better, it's a time that coincided with the first instances of photography, and that means that there are plenty of old photos out there showcasing the diversity of life back then.</p><p>We've gathered together another selection of some of the most interesting photographs we've found for your browsing pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-omqjs5jpwb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hunting</h2><p>We all know that it was a more brutal time, when trophy hunting was more widely accepted than it is around the world now. This grizzly bear, though, is of particular note, and not just because of how impressively massive it is. It was actually shot by General Custer, who would later go down in infamy for his foolish military tactics.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image2-e27ifpzauw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Training dummies</h2><p>Before you get worried, as you'll see from the annotation on this photograph, the horses you see in it are alive and well, merely being trained in battlefield tactics. That said, given the guns being wielded on both sides, it's more than a little depressing to consider that horses were trained to act as cover like this.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141060-fantastic-photographic-firsts\" rel=\"follow\">29 fantastic photographic firsts</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image3-cderbukvoi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Quite a view</h2><p>Turning away from that more brutal side of things, this view over the intersection between the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers is extremely romantic, not least because of the young woman surveying it to the left of the frame. In the background you can see some long buildings that are suggestive of barracks or other mass accommodation.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image4-yrk0tc7unj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Skating along</h2><p>This picture is from Montana, and shows a skating party taking advantage of frigid weather to enjoy an excursion - don't miss the big shaggy black dog the group on the left has brought with them. It's rare to see images with families and children in this setting.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image5-pxcuyh57db.jpg\" /></p><h2>Adverse conditions</h2><p>Cold weather generally didn't make for fun and games like the skating we saw before, though - for people on the move it meant treacherous conditions and hard riding, as this column shows. At least they're all wrapped up against the cold.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image6-xincqwgblj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Speakeasy</h2><p>A bar in the old West has something extraordinarily evocative to it. This is The Good Old Days canteen from Fort Keogh in Montana, pictured in the early 1890s, in case the mustaches on show didn't give you a hint.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/140183-retro-gadgets-you-can-buy-that-will-remind-you-of-the-glory-days\" rel=\"follow\">Amazing retro gadgets you can buy that will remind you of the glory days</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image7-zo0jrmst51.jpg\" /></p><h2>Tools of the trade</h2><p>Blacksmiths might not be a particularly common brand of tradespeople now, but they were key links chains of infrastructure in the West, helping with all manner of tooling and repairs, from carriages to horseshoes.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image8-fm8kobonzw.jpg\" /></p><h2>A stained history</h2><p>Of course, one of many uncomfortable truths of this period of history is the treatment of indigenous people all around America. This image shows native Americans welcoming President Chester A. Arthur, a rare image of concord.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image9-684m0qutb9.jpg\" /></p><h2>All a-flutter</h2><p>As camera technology pushed ever forward, pictures were able to become less and less posed and formal. This image of a cavalry unit performing practice sabre manoeuvres is a perfect example, packed with motion and dust.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image100-7zzqcfuvji.jpg\" /></p><h2>Not much of a jail</h2><p>Of course, the West is also famous for its gangs and robbers, and its sheriffs and deputies - a lawless time that would slowly be reeled in. If you ended up on the wrong side of the law things could get pretty rough for you. Just consider this jail in Clifton, Arizona, carved out of the very cliff face. We wouldn't fancy spending much time in there.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141224-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken\" rel=\"follow\">The most famous ghost photographs ever taken</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image111-tu47cahqqp.jpg\" /></p><h2>The force</h2><p>This photograph of Dodge City, Kansas' \"Peace Commissioners\" paints a real picture - the serious looks on their faces, the varied and eye-catching differences between their coats and hats. These were the law-keepers when there wasn't much law.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image122-dbsw8sfrpo.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rough justice</h2><p>Another form of justice is represented here by Judge Roy Bean, holding a court session of sorts as he judged horse thieves. As the sign for beer might have hinted, this building was both the courthouse and the saloon for locals, making it an interesting dual-purpose place.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-w5ixzvkssx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Toil</h2><p>While the cowboys and sheriffs might take the limelight, the reality is that most Americans in the West at the turn of the century faced a hard life of work and little play. These workers on a vineyard show that even if in rudimentary surroundings, industries were starting out.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/151839-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos\" rel=\"follow\">The shortlist for the 2020 Sony World Photography Awards is full of gobsmacking photos</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-vrp3utcloe.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rest</h2><p>You could probably rely on being able to relax after dark, though, as this party is doing at a ranch in Idaho, complete with characterful timber construction, furs and, of course, an astonishing collection of guns.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-v2q6lejzh0.jpg\" /></p><h2>Arable</h2><p>Depending on where you washed up, yours could be the only property for miles around, leading to isolated but stunningly beautiful scenes like this one, taken in Montana, with the mountains rising up in the background.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-jxmeqnhcpg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Backbreaking work</h2><p>This might look some sort of military endeavour, but it's actually an irrigation trench in the process of being dug in Arizona, largely by native American labour. This is a showcase of just how much physical labour was required.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/148556-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs\" rel=\"follow\">33 incredibly interesting photos from history</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-jvysc1zhit.jpg\" /></p><h2>Family life</h2><p>Meanwhile, families continued to live and have children, as demonstrated by this group from Mormon Lake in Arizona (we can't be sure whether they themselves were Mormons - the place name, though amusing, might be unrelated).&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152026-cameras-feature-more-images-from-the-american-west-are-a-window-to-another-time-image1-hoktodlawu.jpg\" /></p><h2>Houseproud</h2><p>As anyone who's played Red Dead Redemption 2 through to the end knows, building a house at this time took, well, time. This group might quite have finished the house behind them, but they look might proud of it regardless, and fair enough.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 12:47:00

GoPro has some hints on <a href=\"https://gopro.com/news/mastering-hero7-night-photo-mode?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-gopro&amp;utm_content=later-1967261&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">how to take awesome nighttime photos like this on its site</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image14-zqoklpxmvr.jpg\" /></p><h2>Swimming with the locals</h2><p>This is what selfie sticks should be used for. This GoPro user has really set a high-bar for underwater photos with the local dolphins. A fantastic view of nature thanks to the compact action camera.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image7-tpaf3hxk4d.jpg\" /></p><h2>A wintery view</h2><p>A smashing wintery view of the world captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/k_wicksy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Kyle Wicks</a> with a GoPro Hero 7 Black. A colorful sunset scene with an ice-covered view of the landscape and a lone person in the midst of it all.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image15-hyvnloj1bq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Something with a little more bite</h2><p>On the opposite end of the underwater spectrum, this GoPro photo is slightly less chilled out. A massive shark shows off his razor-sharp teeth for all to enjoy - or at least cower in fear from. Hopefully, this GoPro user was safe inside a cage.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image4-2s7lvcfplb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Footprints in the sand</h2><p>Mitchell Pettigrew is an amateur photographer with an eye for landscape photography and an undeniable talent. He's capable of capturing some nifty views with his GoPro, as this simply awesome shot shows. His <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shipwreckphotography/\" rel=\"follow\">Instagram feed</a> is also worth checking out.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image16-ymwd86pgma.jpg\" /></p><h2>Underwater paradise</h2><p>GoPro cameras certainly allow for an interesting range of underwater photographs. This one shows brilliantly blue waters and a casual swim with the local fishes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image17-bomdq0hrl4.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fun with flippers</h2><p>Another snap we're jealous of. These waters look warm, peaceful and welcoming. We wish we were there too!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image18-dtkbzdtb8q.jpg\" /></p><h2>Man's best friend</h2><p>Pooches enjoy a swim too or maybe a quick surf? The versatile action cam isn't just for underwater shots and high-octane sports but is brilliant at capturing photos of pets in the wild too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image159-c68mzgub9s.jpg\" /></p><h2>A starry lighthouse</h2><p>This incredible photo was posted on Instagram along with some expert tips on achieving the same results with a GoPro Hero 7:</p><p>\"I've always wanted to photograph the stars, so I headed to the Fingal Head Lighthouse to try it out. During a&nbsp;#LongExposure, your&nbsp;#GoPro&nbsp;has to be very still, so I mounted it to the Shorty Mount. I set the GoPro to Night Photo Mode and used the following ProTune settings: Shutter Speed 30s, ISO 800, Sharpness Low, Auto WB.&nbsp;#ProTip: Toggle on RAW Format for maximum control over your image while editing.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image19-49qha1xlkl.jpg\" /></p><h2>A cooling paddle for piggy</h2><p>This GoPro user had an unexpected visit in the form of a piggy looking for a cooling dip in the water. The crystal clear waters are certainly inviting, so we can't blame him. The result of the encounter makes for a fairly awesome photo too.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image20-7guc3fy4oi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Below the blue</h2><p>Now you're just showing off. This chap is up to some underwater shenanigans for sure. We love the submerged view of the clouds though. Another fantastic GoPro photo from inviting waters.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image21-06fzl5shol.jpg\" /></p><h2>Catching some waves</h2><p>This photo is certainly more the style we'd expect to see from GoPro users. An action shot from a surfer catching some waves.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image22-w93nhbqjrc.jpg\" /></p><h2>A cave with a view</h2><p>Another surfing shot, but this one is calm and colourful. These sorts of images show just how versatile the GoPro cameras can be. They're not just great for video, but for landscape and portrait shots too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image23-anjczf0ybe.jpg\" /></p><h2>Up, up and away</h2><p>On the wing of a glider or light aircraft, the humble GoPro gives us a brilliant view of the world from high above the earth. This image shows us the beautiful surrounding sights as one GoPro user carries out some incredible aerobatic stunts.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image24-y38knu6hgr.jpg\" /></p><h2>Over the top</h2><p>Some pretty spectacular views over the mountain tops. More proof that a good camera mount can make for some incredible views captured with your favourite action cam.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image25-svxtpzk4so.jpg\" /></p><h2>A line in the sand&nbsp;</h2><p>The compact GoPro captures some fairly cool views of the surroundings too. A wide angle lens makes for some interesting views, especially when combined with the unusually shaped landscape.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image26-iabqosv37y.jpg\" /></p><h2>A rider's reflection&nbsp;</h2><p>Here a GoPro user takes a brilliant shot on the road ahead as seen through the reflection in their visor. GoPro cameras are a popular choice of bikers anyway, but we're particular fans of this snap.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image27-sogkruabon.jpg\" /></p><h2>Getting back to nature</h2><p>The GoPro is an amazing tool for outdoor photos, wherever you might be. This snap from the woods as the sun rises captures the beauty of nature perfectly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image28-gqjvdyb2kx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Liquid lines</h2><p>A perfectly timed photo of a wave breaking with brilliant clarity. This image shows the amazing and surprising photographic powers of the GoPro. It's not just for video.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image29-vrlahypfwg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Way above the concrete jungle</h2><p>Another aeroplane wing shot shows a fantastic view above a city. The streets below almost seem quiet and empty.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image30-hu2vqrahlg.jpg\" /></p><h2>High-speed colours</h2><p>There's nothing quite like a high-speed shot from a sports car. This image shows how GoPro cameras can be put to good use to create some brilliant tricks with the light too. The result is a colourful photo which almost makes it look like the car is travelling at light speed.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image31-btwn3dwxkz.jpg\" /></p><h2>A skyline with a view</h2><p>It's not just aerial photos that the GoPro makes light work of. These cameras are also strong favourites among parkour enthusiasts. You'll often see these sorts of vertigo-inducing snaps from high above the rooftops.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image32-atx7pfgsvm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Painting with light</h2><p>Sparklers, fireworks and more can be combined with GoPro's clever camera settings to create works of art like this where shapes and patterns are created from light. We love the colours of this one too - the glow of the light reflecting brilliantly on the surroundings under the night sky.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image33-bf8xxrgv6z.jpg\" /></p><h2>Waiting for rescue</h2><p>We're hoping these chaps were on some sort of exercise, rather than being stranded at sea while waiting for rescue. It's certainly interesting to see the variety of situations GoPro cameras have been used in if nothing else.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image34-dlfntpqfy9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hanging out with the birds</h2><p>Another view you're not likely to see every day and another interesting use of a selfie stick too. This image shows two airborne fellows finding a new friend high in the sky. We're not sure the feathered chap is as happy to see them as they are it though.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image35-ousl1vaiuy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Balloons for everyone</h2><p>A magnificent view of the world with balloons of all shapes and sizes being released into the skies. Crowds of onlookers stretching out as far as the eye can see admiring the view.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image161-cjwmioffzx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Avoiding the storms</h2><p>This GoPro user managed to capture an awesome shot of two helicopters riding above the clouds near&nbsp;Mokra Gora, Serbia. This breathtaking view is just one of many fantastic snaps the photographer has posted on his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ivan.poucki.9/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Instagram account</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image36-3de9sitpgx.jpg\" /></p><h2>A spiky hilltop sight</h2><p>The world is full of hidden beauty and wonder. Some of the sights are highly unusual. We love these breathtaking views of the world below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image37-co76grznqd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Don't look down</h2><p>Another precarious view from the mountaintops. This high-up view of the world shows some spectacular sights of the world below, if with a little dangerous drop over the side. Not for those afraid of heights, but brilliant to observe from afar.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image38-syfn4ax2xe.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hello up there</h2><p>We don't know what's going on here. Some impressive aerobatics no doubt. Impressively timed photos are almost certainly the best.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image39-a4juwrftxe.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fishing for rainbows</h2><p>The ocean often makes for cracking GoPro photos of one kind or another. This image of a rainbow is particularly impressive - it's not often you get to see both ends of the rainbow at one time. But where's the pot of gold? Maybe there's some sunken treasure.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image40-lj5gm3ixvp.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wrestling with the crowd</h2><p>One man climbs up for a better view of the crowd, a sea of faces stretching off into the distance. Another example of an unusual photo that shows just how versatile GoPro cameras can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image5-bntpxv2dko.jpg\" /></p><h2>A view from turbulent waters</h2><p>Putting the GoPro's waterproof housing to maximum use, Marcus Rodrigues captures a magnificent&nbsp;underwater view. The water's surface appears to be rough and angry but there's a pleasant calm below which this swimmer is briefly enjoying on the way up to the surface.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image6-lbxyfgahjj.jpg\" /></p><h2>The supported ascent</h2><p>Putting their GoPro to spectacular use,&nbsp;Niqolas Ruud shows us what it's like to climb a steep mountain face, supporting teammates and fellow climbers along the way. The wonder of our planet stretches out before them as these three lone climbers make their way onwards and upwards. How small and insignificant they appear before the mighty landscape below them.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image8-b5sutmwjfg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Palm tree paradise</h2><p>We look on with envy at this view of paradise snapped by Mark Baechtold. Not the usual action shot we'd expect from a GoPro, but certainly a marvellous view of a beautiful sunset.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image9-0imz1rw4py.jpg\" /></p><h2>A calm view from a mountaintop tent</h2><p>There's something thoroughly humbling about this view captured by Marc Ruffini. He sits at the edge of his tent, sipping from a flask and basking in the glory of the magnificent mountains sprawling out before him. We'd imagine there was a fair amount of effort that went into scaling this mountain to get to this viewpoint in the first place, so hopefully, the reward was worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image10-bdh9sdlsko.jpg\" /></p><h2>A new underwater friend</h2><p>Last but not least on our list is a submission from last year by Alex Robert. This fantastic photograph captures the cheerful face of a magnificent marine mammal swimming in the waters of Laguna Beach, California.&nbsp;</p><p>Some pretty spectacular images, we're sure you'll agree and we'll expect to see more GoPro photos like this in future.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image11-ygd4ckvk0l.jpg\" /></p><h2>An eagle-eyed view</h2><p>At the opposite end of the spectrum comes this snap from the Western plains of Mongolia. Here, GoPro photographer&nbsp;Lauren McGough captures spectacular snow-covered views of the sweeping mountains while out on a hunt with a group of nomadic Kazakhs.</p><p>The accompanying golden eagles are tagging along to help out with the hunt, blissfully unaware of the majesty they add to the photograph.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image12-ixzgbiv1s3.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cliff-hanging for views</h2><p>Dangling from the mountain tops of&nbsp;Yangshuo, China,&nbsp;Chuang Liu snaps a breath-taking view during&nbsp;a heart-pounding climb. An impressive feat of endurance and masterful photography in a single shot.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image13-wufxmsrdhi.jpg\" /></p><h2>What lies beneath</h2><p>Another snap of a wonderful underwater swimmer captures what looks like someone diving for buried treasure while the captain of the boat keeps watch. &nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image140-pctkyqbgsa.jpg\" /></p><h2>Sliding ride</h2><p>Action is the name of the game.&nbsp;Merlino Nicolas can be seen here tearing up the dirt roads with a perfectly timed slide.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image137-qkj93qgxsn.jpg\" /></p><h2>The door of everything</h2><p>Sometimes a simple photo can be both beautiful and make us feel insignificant at the same time. This incredible snap shows a brilliant view of the world captured by&nbsp;Nicolas Lavilla Calahorra:</p><p>\"It is the great door that opens our eyes to the great world that surrounds us. It makes us feel small but we are big in our&nbsp;hearts,&nbsp;and immense in our possibilities\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image138-puda3tswlr.jpg\" /></p><h2>Skiing in Valmalenco</h2><p>An amazing image with astounding views of the ski slopes in&nbsp;Valmalenco. This ski-height photo is certainly an interesting perspective and perfect inspiration for other GoPro users.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image41-9vp3tw8ynl.jpg\" /></p><h2>A tight fit</h2><p>A view from a kayak shows a narrow passage through the waterway with colourful cliff faces rising on either side. We'd imagine paddling down this tight river was tricky, but it certainly makes for a good photo.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image42-4ucz9xbhtq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Kicking up some dirt</h2><p>Fast fun and frolics is the name of the game here as a dirt bike is put to brilliant use in the desert. Kicking up a storm of sand for a brilliant photo.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image43-ugoudb3y2l.jpg\" /></p><h2>Up, up and away</h2><p>A much more peaceful view from above the clouds. We're not quite sure how this GoPro photo was taken, but there's no denying it's awesome. The angry fire of the hot air balloon contrasting wonderfully with the fluffy clouds in the background.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image44-elcxu6htpi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Falling into the fall</h2><p>GoPro cameras regularly get used for daring feats. Some of them insane, some a little more dangerous. This chap is taking a long tumble into the water below. A raging storm of dust on one side and rushing water on the other make for some interesting colours in the waters below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image45-dz2jd8vmcj.jpg\" /></p><h2>A bit snappy</h2><p>This chap does not appear too happy to be snapped, but there's no denying this is an incredible underwater nature shot. Human and wildlife swimming together in harmony.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image46-l4garispyg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mountaintop range</h2><p>Another staggering view from high above the ground below. This user has snapped a breathtaking image from a mountaintop which gives an impressive panorama of the surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image47-tsc7d5xwyk.jpg\" /></p><h2>An interesting sky</h2><p>This photo proves that GoPro cameras are even capable of snapping brilliant skyline images. A variety of colours, a lighting storm and even some calm reflections make for an awe-inspiring view.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image48-qfja83tg0n.jpg\" /></p><h2>A peaceful paddle</h2><p>As well as images of chaos and high-speed thrills, GoPro cameras can also capture nature at its finest and most peaceful. This amazingly colourful photo shows an astounding view of a crystal clear lake and incredibly still waters too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image49-aeq0ddjkey.jpg\" /></p><h2>An electrifying view</h2><p>A smashing view that's turned the sky a brilliant shade of purple. Lightning strikes across the sky almost make it look like it's shattered and is about to fall down on our heads.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image50-zym6tv1el0.jpg\" /></p><h2>Making a splash</h2><p>A GoPro user makes a bit of a splash through the waters with a bike ride through the surface. We love the colours of this one and the way the camera positioning makes it look like the rider is surfing across the surface, rather than ploughing through the waters.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image51-qhg6j9mbws.jpg\" /></p><h2>An unusual proposal</h2><p>Why wait for the right moment when you can just get down on one knee at the top of a mountain? This is almost certainly one of those times when a photo is required to show as proof when people don't believe the story.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image52-opp8qzn4yt.jpg\" /></p><h2>Vertical ascent</h2><p>Jets often make for truly spectacular GoPro photos and videos. This video is undeniably impressive, not just for the surroundings but for the method of photography too. How often do you get to see planes in a vertical ascent like this?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image53-voenjphxof.jpg\" /></p><h2>Lines and laps</h2><p>An underwater shot captured in what appears to be a long and narrow swimming pool creates some interesting visuals as the lines below reflect and refract on the water's surface above.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image54-v8aqizx61u.jpg\" /></p><h2>A relaxing view</h2><p>A GoPro doesn't need to be used to constantly capture endless fun, they're also great for snapping relaxing views of nature too. What's more relaxing than taking it easy in a hammock hung between two trees surrounded by lapping waters?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image55-yplqazein5.jpg\" /></p><h2>Racing on two wheels</h2><p>GoPro cameras are great a capturing speed as well as still shots. This photo creates a brilliant view of the world as a cyclist passes down a street surrounded by colourful graffiti.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image56-pydbjm501z.jpg\" /></p><h2>What lies beneath</h2><p>Hikers, climbers and parkour enthusiasts often snap some brilliant and breathtaking views of our world from high-up. The GoPro lens is ace at capturing a wide view of the world and is perfect for photos like this one.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image57-ozi6gelkw4.jpg\" /></p><h2>A bridge to heaven</h2><p>This long bridge appears to stretch off into infinity. It leaves us wondering if you could touch the clouds if you walked far enough and just reached up into the skies.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image58-7dl24rvqul.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rafting rapids</h2><p>We're not sure we'd want to take this makeshift raft over intense rapids, but it certainly makes for a fantastic view over relatively calm waters.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image59-7sc8hmx2gn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Reflecting on the world</h2><p>These images of mirror-like bodies of water appear a solid favourite with kayaking GoPro users. It's easy to see why too as the peaceful beauty of nature is amazingly appealing.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image60-wv3gufsrm9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Man overboard</h2><p>We're not sure if this skydiver has just exited the hot air balloon or happened to pass by on his way down to the ground below. Either way, it makes for another cracking GoPro photo that we love.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image61-zqbgyrv6xv.jpg\" /></p><h2>An upward journey</h2><p>We'd assume this ride required a lot of energy and a strong disposition. Steep drops and breathtaking view from the mountaintops make for the risk and reward balance.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image62-usjq3ohkib.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rapid fun</h2><p>We bet this sort of shot requires a strong mount, but GoPro cameras are waterproof and robust - especially when combined with the right housing. This means there are plenty of awesome photos like this - with the action cameras attached to paddles of fun-loving watersports enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image63-3nzyf9s0g2.jpg\" /></p><h2>Feline frolics</h2><p>As far as we know, cats aren't generally fans of water, but this little furball looks fairly chilled out. The view is also spectacular.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image64-j6wvya7p20.jpg\" /></p><h2>Doggy boarding</h2><p>You've seen the dog on the skateboard, but have you ever seen a pooch on a surfboard? We certainly haven't. If any camera is going to be used for this sort of shot it's no surprise it's a GoPro.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image65-8ywzixsrvj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Relaxing by the water</h2><p>Yet another chilled out view of the world that makes us long for a peaceful beach retreat and a tall cocktail.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image66-kmfasfirgq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Swimming with the fishes</h2><p>We love these sorts of underwater snaps of people swimming with dolphins. A memory of a lifetime captured on the smallest camera you're likely to own.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image67-kapkidsmbf.jpg\" /></p><h2>A walk in the heavens</h2><p>Another vertigo-inspiring view from a great height. This GoPro user has managed to capture a fantastic sight above the clouds.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image68-sztamwebqh.jpg\" /></p><h2>An incredible seaside</h2><p>As if the view from the town below isn't good enough - with brilliant clear waters washing into the bay - this GoPro user has given us an even more spectacular sight. Colourful and cleverly posed.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image69-cqiyzvdf5r.jpg\" /></p><h2>A lovely spot for a dip</h2><p>There's nothing better than discovering a peaceful place where you can dive in for a relaxing swim. This jetty leads to the perfect waters and also makes for a brilliant photo too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image70-iultvdcfrp.jpg\" /></p><h2>A skaters-eye view</h2><p>Mounting a GoPro on your skateboard, longboard or other low-slung transport device is a brilliant way to get a new perspective on the world. This unusual view not only makes for a cracking video it also makes for fantastic photos too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image71-gltmbg7zer.jpg\" /></p><h2>Submerged swimming</h2><p>As long as you don't let the waves wash your GoPro away, these cameras are fantastic for taking underwater and half-submerged photos. This image is one of many on our list and a small sample of the thousands out there.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image72-gqsho4amep.jpg\" /></p><h2>Emerald oceans</h2><p>Since they're robust and waterproof, these cameras make for brilliant tools for taking snaps of the ocean and the power of nature. At this level, they're also perfect for capturing beautiful wave breaks.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image73-otfc4euazb.jpg\" /></p><h2>A shower of light</h2><p>Another photo captured with a GoPro that shows painting with light. These sorts of photos look fantastic and give the appearance of fire raining down from above.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image74-yh7mzanptg.jpg\" /></p><h2>A sea wall with a view</h2><p>Much more than just a way to protect the bay from the waves, this seawall also makes for a brilliant photography spot. All it took was an eye for detail and perfect timing to capture a calm ocean and a brilliant backdrop.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image75-pkftysnsz9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Watch your step</h2><p>Sometimes it's better not to look down. This precarious looking bridge across rough waters doesn't look terribly inviting but it does offer a pretty awesome view of the world below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image76-x7jskhslla.jpg\" /></p><h2>Nature in the garden</h2><p>Sometimes you don't even need to venture away from home to get some incredible photos. This visitor to the birdbath was captured on a GoPro, the owner was just lucky it wasn't a magpie.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image77-rilgtzchoi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rolling, rolling, rolling</h2><p>Another selfie stick and skateboard combination makes for a fast-paced GoPro photo with super results. We really enjoy how fluid these sorts of photos are too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image78-4fy1jfdxpk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Swimmers and surfers</h2><p>A brilliant view from both above and below the water. Several photographers appear to be trying to capture different images of the surfer as he passes by. We'd love to see the rest of the results too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image79-owv1sm0xrg.jpg\" /></p><h2>One man and his pooch</h2><p>A simple selfie of one man and his furry friend taking a ride. We're not sure this is particularly safe, but there's no denying it's awesome.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image80-yq7we9ffop.jpg\" /></p><h2>A close encounter</h2><p>Another cracking photo of an underwater encounter with local wildlife. We love these animal close-ups and seeing creatures captured in their natural environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image81-fweiszmsnw.jpg\" /></p><h2>One-handed fun</h2><p>Another GoPro combined with watersports fun. This image is brilliantly framed to show the awesome reflection in the waters below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image82-wujld8vzch.jpg\" /></p><h2>Catching some waves</h2><p>A surfer clings to their GoPro as they head off into the waves and the results are awesome. Simple photos like this are what GoPro cameras are built for. Just be sure not to drop them!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image83-a9qvgyfa1j.jpg\" /></p><h2>Top of the world</h2><p>There's certainly got to be some freedom at the top of these mountains. The views are staggering and make a wonderful end to what was no doubt a tough upward trek to the peak.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image84-5ewzuhjs3m.jpg\" /></p><h2>The downward tumble</h2><p>Another favourite use for GoPro cameras is capturing the view on the way down when parachuting from a plane. With a simple head mount, some fairly fantastic views can be captured for all to see.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image85-gxh2qy0ikd.jpg\" /></p><h2>A close-up with nature</h2><p>This sort of snaps shows how versatile GoPro cameras can be. It's just as possible to capture an amazing animal portrait as it is a bonkers surfing selfie. The results are amazing too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image86-0zafzid92t.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wing rider</h2><p>Gliders, sun shots and even a helicopter, this GoPro photo has it all. Aerial aerobatic fun captured for us all to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image87-lpgixxjytn.jpg\" /></p><h2>A topsy-turvy view of the world</h2><p>A group of parachutists take a fall to earth while holding hands. Makes for a cracking photo and if you look closely you'll see a multitude of GoPro cameras strapped to helmets too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image88-wzcziip7uf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Still waters and sunshine</h2><p>Calm waters, check, sun on the horizon, check, another fantastic GoPro photo, check. You can't go wrong with a still water shot, a solid GoPro photography favourite.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image89-yxxqmwd9lt.jpg\" /></p><h2>Horseback adventures</h2><p>No, this is not a screenshot from Red Dead Redemption 2, it's a real-life snap from the wild. Fantastic landscape and running waters make for thoroughly peaceful surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image90-jja5mbr7qt.jpg\" /></p><h2>Parachuting in style</h2><p>This guy is clearly a thrill seeker. As if parachuting isn't fun enough, he's also doing it backwards and wearing just a pair of shorts too. Why not.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image91-kfr4oi05b8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Winter wonderland</h2><p>Isn't winter wonderful. This dog is clearly a big fan of fun in the snow. A brilliantly timed GoPro photo captures all the joy of jumping over logs and bounding about in the snow.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image92-cgfbxrl80g.jpg\" /></p><h2>Surfing hound</h2><p>Another calm and serene view with a lady and her dog enjoying the waters. Nothing quite like a nice relaxing paddle and a perfectly posed photo.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image93-owb9phsgvz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Buried in the snow</h2><p>These sorts of photos show just how versatile a GoPro can be. They work well outdoors, but are also highly capable in bright snowy conditions. The view is fantastic too. Snow covered trees stretch out as far as the eye can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image94-arzz0v7to5.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fun with the little one</h2><p>With the right mount, you can make a GoPro hands free. Chest mounts, helmet mounts and more make it possible to capture all sorts of shots including fantastic family snaps to treasure for years.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image95-wqg8lvcpsk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Tearing up the slopes</h2><p>A simple image of one man and his quest to tear up the ski slopes and have a great time in the snow.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image96-gykvzghqyd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Airtime</h2><p>A colourful and action-packed photo of a lone surfer catching some air over the top of a large crashing wave. Perfectly timed and brilliantly entertaining too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image97-pgrrmpdeuf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Beauty in the beast</h2><p>We love this simply framed photo. The large incoming wave looks almost tsunami-like in size thanks to the height of the camera. Yet the tranquil view speaks of peace and calm.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image98-oksw1qdyv0.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cliffhanger</h2><p>People love a good selfie and they don't get much cooler than this. Wearing a t-shirt while hanging from an icy cliff - chilling!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image99-1m3cscyvub.jpg\" /></p><h2>A surfers view</h2><p>There's no denying that surfers get to see some pretty awesome views. Brilliant timing and an eye for the perfect waves results in some pretty special moments like this. An amazing view as a surfer passes underneath a large wave just as it breaks.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image100-qu2zod0kir.jpg\" /></p><h2>A rainbow painting</h2><p>We're not entirely sure how this photo was composed but it's brilliant. An amazing rainbow painted between the trees and across the night's sky.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image101-7xtw6pdjyn.jpg\" /></p><h2>A tight fit</h2><p>Take a moment to admire this view, then look closely and you'll see the climber stuck between the rocks. Looks like a narrow and difficult climb, but certainly makes for an amazing photo.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image160-6xath7nb0w.jpg\" /></p><h2>An icy climb</h2><p>There's no denying that GoPro cameras are regularly put to awesome use capturing some fairly extreme sports, snapping awesome views or highlighting adventures in numerous landscapes.</p><p>This ace shot by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/giorgioghezzi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Giorgio Ghezzi</a> certainly shows a flair for fun-packed, death-defying adventure with a climb up a steep icy cliff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image102-7y8eszim2k.jpg\" /></p><h2>Birthday celebrations in style</h2><p>Why be content with just a cake when you could take to the skies instead. This GoPro user managed a brilliant birthday celebration with an incredible skydiving experience and the photo to prove it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image103-emz2zbd4vn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Making a splash</h2><p>One of the bonuses of a GoPro's underwater capabilities is being able to see how the water reacts to human interaction. We love seeing high-impact actions captured in a single frame.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image104-nsqjn0woxy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Gliding to glory</h2><p>Aerial photos keep coming as more and more GoPro users take to the sky. These robust cameras are perfect for flight as much as they are any other use. This photo shows a brilliantly green mountain range and even a small urban centre sprawling out below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image105-czlweq7kae.jpg\" /></p><h2>A colourful light show</h2><p>GoPro cameras are available to purchase pretty much all over the world. Which means we get to see incredible photos like this - with light shows painted in the sky. From lightning storms to the&nbsp;northern lights, GoPro cameras can capture them all.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image106-c2fpwcx0j1.jpg\" /></p><h2>A waterslide that goes on and on</h2><p>Now, this looks like a lot of fun. This photographer put their GoPro to good use by capturing a great image of them sliding down an enormous waterfall.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image107-njjecmggrh.jpg\" /></p><h2>The freedom eagle</h2><p>It's surprising how popular wildlife photography is among GoPro enthusiasts. The results are often impressive too - almost as much as the subject themselves.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image108-xntjja54k8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Killer photos</h2><p>Another wildlife photo captures a pod of killer whales swimming together. Magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image109-bme9sawc24.jpg\" /></p><h2>A wild ride</h2><p>From the calmness of the sea, to the mean streets with some motorbiking fun. The humble GoPro is full of endless versatility.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image110-nlgb7wrcel.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rollercoaster thrill ride</h2><p>Why pay for hilarious rollercoaster photographs when you can take your own with a camera you can fit in your pocket? These sort of brilliant photos are so easy to snap yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image111-4cnwpvgelf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rings and wings</h2><p>More aerial acrobatics captured with the help of a GoPro. This photo not only includes multiple planes and a magnificent view, but smoke trails too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image112-v6flzsmbyk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Nothing to see here</h2><p>Nothing to see here, just some bananas catching some waves. All perfectly normal.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image113-s7mqehaczi.jpg\" /></p><h2>A seat in the sky</h2><p>We love this image. Another brilliant view of the landscape captured with the help of a parachute and a little patience.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image114-kymrijhi01.jpg\" /></p><h2>A toothy view</h2><p>This image almost looks like it's been Photoshopped. A terrifying close-up view of a shark seeking out a quick snack. Not something you'd ever want to see outside of the cage.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image115-hpilwctear.jpg\" /></p><h2>Shark bait</h2><p>Yet another impressive underwater shot captured with a GoPro. This image shows a mass of swimmers no doubt competing in some sort of race. An impressive, if turbulent view of the water.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image116-0ol5gvhwro.jpg\" /></p><h2>Just hanging out</h2><p>Because skydiving photographs aren't interesting enough, this photographer has managed to capture a casual pose hanging from the wing of a plane.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image117-v0ajoslge7.jpg\" /></p><h2>A road with a view</h2><p>A motorcyclist's joy captured in a simple photo - a winding empty road, pleasant weather and the freedom to open up the throttle.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image118-r6qkowot8s.jpg\" /></p><h2>A horse with a view</h2><p>Another Wild West adventure on horseback captured with the help of GoPro. This staggering hillside view of the world is certainly breathtaking. We wonder if the horse appreciates it as much as we do.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image119-egpta8il4q.jpg\" /></p><h2>A death-defying view</h2><p>We're starting to think we should have included a warning at the start of this article for people who are scared of heights. This view is likely to make anybody's heart skip a couple of beats, even with the safety rope tightly strapped on.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image120-ygcocx9m5i.jpg\" /></p><h2>High-speed sledding</h2><p>The standard use for GoPro cameras in most cases is capturing awesome high-speed photos and videos of reckless pursuits. This sort of sledding is perfect for such things. Looks like fantastically fast fun too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image121-khqcxgovuy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Off among the clouds</h2><p>Another hot air balloon ride with a brilliant view. We love how high above the clouds this shot is. If you look closely you'll also spot another balloon emerging from the clouds below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image122-3pzv4r57om.jpg\" /></p><h2>Climbing for a selfie</h2><p>There's something about climbing mountainsides and snapping selfies. These downward facing selfies are no doubt a lot easier to capture with a small GoPro.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image123-7jo0ydlwti.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wave free shipping</h2><p>We're impressed with how still the water is here. Even the large ship isn't making waves through these still waters and spoiling the view.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image124-jaos0z9u7q.jpg\" /></p><h2>Making a splash</h2><p>Another angle of surfing fun. Sticking a GoPro to a surfboard nearly always results in some pretty special shots. This angle gives a view you're not likely to see unless you're bodyboarding instead.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image125-dr1p43woqi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wildlife photography made easy</h2><p>Capturing animal portraits is easy when they're curious. This little feathered guy has taken a particular interest in the GoPro and has sidled up for a closer look.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image126-kqaxm1ushz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Tricks and timing&nbsp;</h2><p>Capturing great action photos isn't all about the trick, it's also about timing. Catching some air while also snapping isn't easy, but when it comes off, the results are fantastic.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image127-r30ebuay7o.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ruff rider</h2><p>This pooch might be enjoying some board time, but something else in the distance has got his attention. Makes for another brilliant photo though.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image128-tvgfklmcnl.jpg\" /></p><h2>A killer photo</h2><p>Just when you thought a landscape like this couldn't get any better looking, along comes a whale to improve the scene. A quick snap and the view is captured forever.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image129-bwruzbc5cn.jpg\" /></p><h2>A wild ride</h2><p>A high up view of a snowboarder's paradise. This incredible view must be enticing, if not fraught with danger and icy chills.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image130-ogmuewqrfz.jpg\" /></p><h2>A peaceful horizon</h2><p>There's no denying this is a brilliant view of the landscape nicely coloured by the setting sun.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image131-sohpkytcyl.jpg\" /></p><h2>It's peddle time</h2><p>We'd imagine cycling underwater would be pretty tricky. It does, however, make for an awesome photo. Daft, but awesome.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image132-c6my4bbayx.jpg\" /></p><h2>White on white</h2><p>A quick glimpse of this photo and you might miss the glider that's almost camouflaged by the equally white snow on the floor below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image133-yhpfm9kqun.jpg\" /></p><h2>Parachuting shenanigans</h2><p>We love the idea of parachuting with a giant inflatable. They probably aren't much use for slowing you down, but the photographic results are pretty unique. Plus, if you can land in a swimming pool or at the beach, you can get right into some water-based fun too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image134-ckukhziga8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Northern lights</h2><p>Another GoPro snap showing the wonderful colours of the Northern lights illuminating the night's sky.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image135-0mn9ofpplw.jpg\" /></p><h2>A monkey call</h2><p>This photo is great, it looks like this little guy is calling out to his friends about his new discovery. \"Look what I've found guys, some human has left us a camera!\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-news-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image136-pb58zwq4vm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Dolphin diving</h2><p>Dolphins are known for being playful. We're surprised he's not bothered by the large ship making waves behind him. Makes for an awesome snap though.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image139-qrjceledlg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ready for lift-off</h2><p>A colourful waterborne shot from the tropical paradise of Fiji. This view shows a seaplane readying for take-off from the crystal clear waters.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image140-sfakn5es9l.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rest in the middle of the lake</h2><p>A brilliantly beautiful view of a manmade bridge stretching across a peaceful lakeside.&nbsp;Alba Lleshi snapped this image while walking around the lake and stopping for a rest.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image141-2skhva7fgm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Piggy piggy</h2><p>It turns out that pigs don't just like rolling in mud, they also like a nice dip in the sea too. This photo shows a cute pig taking a swim in the crystal clear waters of the&nbsp;Bahamas.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image142-lqwxhzpvj2.jpg\" /></p><h2>Dolphins in Hawaii</h2><p>A smashing view captured while swimming with the dolphins off the coast of Hawaii. This underwater photo by Connor Trimble shows what an amazing world we live in.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image143-zld5lvrsbo.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wild Christmas</h2><p>Not your usual Christmas view - this photo was taken on Christmas Eve on the&nbsp;volcanic island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. Peaceful roads for a man to enjoy with just his motorbike and the cool winter winds to keep him company.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image144-b0ueateksz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Dog in the hole</h2><p>\"When your dog starts to make a hole in the sand of the beach and you end up burying it in it\"</p><p>Miriam Borrego Ruiz was clearly having some daft fun at the beach and that's certainly one cooperative pooch!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image145-inevl90tqg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fall time</h2><p>A serene view of a perfectly still lake in Northern Italy.&nbsp;Alberto Rossetto snapped this image while on an adventurous bike ride. The brilliant colours of the Autumnal trees contrasting wonderfully with the cool waters of the lake.&nbsp;</p><p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image146-bygnys0z1o.jpg\" /></em></p><h2>What a night</h2><p>This image is actually the combination of 400 photos into a single one. The result is what looks like a thousand shooting stars in the sky. Pretty spectacular, we're sure you'll agree.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image147-qke1fj7onc.jpg\" /></p><h2>Freediving in sea caves</h2><p>Victor De Valles shows us just how versatile GoPro cameras can be with a brilliant underwater snap captured as he freedives with the fishes. We love how the light breaks through the water in this image. A simple, yet wonderful view of nature.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image148-xlhdebf1mq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Machu Pichu</h2><p>Machu Pichu is an Incan citadel nestled in the&nbsp;Andes Mountains high above Peru. It's a popular tourist destination for the region and with this sort of breath-taking view, it's easy to see why.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image149-ox54kpcbx8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wingsuit flying with clouds and friends</h2><p>Another astounding Overcapture view above the clouds, proving again why GoPro cameras are such a strong favourite with skydivers.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image150-obifgpxw1c.jpg\" /></p><h2>Sunrise skateboarding</h2><p>A lone skateboarder makes the most of a winding and empty road on an early morning. The sun slowly creeps over the mountaintop as a new day begins. Another brilliantly simple shot chosen as photo of the day.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image151-p7jfrwsbh2.jpg\" /></p><h2>Powder lines with a view</h2><p>A solitary snowboarder appears at the edge of this snap, barely visible in the jaw-dropping view of the snow-covered expanse that lays before them. Marvellous, untouched white powder stretches out as far as the eye can see. A snowboarder's paradise indeed.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image152-9pqqa7hr3a.jpg\" /></p><h2>Atop the emerald ocean</h2><p>Forward-facing shots from the bow of a boat seem to be a firm favourite amongst GoPro users. This one is pretty special too. The sparkling emerald waters glisten below the green-topped hillsides. Relaxing, calm and tranquil, this photo certainly inspires a warm happy feeling at how serene nature can be.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image153-243ctxvrhn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Whitewater wonder</h2><p>Sun breaking through the tree line, whitewater rapids beckoning in the distance, a GoPro strapped to a helmet. We have no doubt there were quite a few awesome photos taken on this kayaking ride, but this one is something special. The quiet before the storm? Or simply a fantastic view of nature at its best.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image154-ywwv5gpytm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Communing with nature</h2><p>GoPro photographer Mike Maholias warms his hands by an open fire as he communes with nature and relaxes by the peaceful waters of this still lake. This photo certainly makes us marvel at how many wonderful elements of nature can be squeezed into a single snap.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image155-d2gqhw7uf9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Swimming with the fishes</h2><p>GoPro cameras are special because of how flexible they are. The underwater housing once again works its magic as&nbsp;Jeb Corliss captures a shoal of fish passing by with a few sharks thrown in for good measure. A range of creatures caught on camera peacefully and harmoniously floating around in the warm waters. &nbsp;What could be a better fit for a competition about the environment we live in than this?&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image156-02i9hdftov.jpg\" /></p><h2>Don't look down</h2><p>With a slightly less relaxing mountainous view,&nbsp;Victoria Nader shows us what a rather steep descent might look like. We're pleased to be viewing this one from a safe distance but have to admire the courage of the photographer and the wonder of the view.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image157-1cqswlypng.jpg\" /></p><h2>A peaceful paddle</h2><p>This GoPro enthusiast&nbsp;took man's best friend along for the ride on these calm lake waters. A beautiful scene lays before them and pooch seems to be contemplating the wonders of his life as he stares off into the distance.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image162-1hwkrk2eds.jpg\" /></p><h2>Seeing double</h2><p>This image by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cesahp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Cesar Palacios</a> shows a brilliant view from Mexico with a crystal clear reflection of the skies above snapped during a brilliant cityscape.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image163-w7eiah6bdk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Sky diving fun</h2><p>The awesome GoPro is obviously an incredibly versatile camera and perfect for extreme sports, like diving out of perfectly good aeroplanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/131203-cameras-feature-the-best-gopro-photos-in-the-world-prepare-to-lose-your-breath-image164-chbt4rihsv.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ocean Sunfish</h2><p>At first glance, you might think this was a man swimming with a shark or a wale but it's actually an Ocean Sunfish. Apparently one of the heaviest bony fish in the world and also one of the most fertile.

It has seen a lot of history in the decades and centuries that have passed since and has recently, rather fittingly been converted into a historical museum.&nbsp;</p><p>From above,&nbsp;Fort Bourtange is certainly beautiful, surrounded by defensive moats and brilliant countryside.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-st0phlbt46.jpg\" /></p><h2>Savior on the Spilled Blood</h2><p>This is a magnificent view of a Church in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It shows the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. This incredible building originally began construction in 1893, and represents a romantic nationalism architectural style by&nbsp;Alfred Alexandrovich Parland and Archimandrite Ignaty.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-3hpselxob8.jpg\" /></p><h2>A deserted college</h2><p>This is a beautiful view of the countryside of the Republic of Abkhazia. It shows an amazing landscape with a tragic history as this is part of the region where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_of_Georgians_in_Abkhazia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">ethnic cleansings</a> occurred in the 1990s. People were expelled from their homes, brutally murdered and persecuted. Now a broken, deserted college stands as a homage to this tragic time.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-0uqrydt7pn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Lotus Temple</h2><p>This is certainly a breath-taking view of an already awe-inspiring temple of worship. The Lotus Temple is located in Delhi, India and is famed for its flowerlike shape. It's also a place of wonder thanks to welcoming everyone - regardless of religious belief.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-gmhazjl2lq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mont Saint Michel in the fog</h2><p>This breathtaking shot shows the famous French monastery&nbsp;Mont Saint Michel bathed in stunning morning fog.

A lorry has tipped over and spilt its load on the side of the road.&nbsp;Ilya Martyanov noticed the accident and quickly dashed out to send his drone up for a snap. The result of which is a fantastic drone photograph of the pitfalls of modern life.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-fjpmv5kaiu.jpg\" /></p><h2>The red train</h2><p>This brilliantly contrasting image from the sky shows a fantastic red train passing through the snow-covered mountains of Switzerland.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-qc0ubrylpz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Thin ice</h2><p>A weirdly beautiful black and white photograph that appears to show a vein-like pattern on the ice below.

His girlfriend was with him, and in an interview after being chosen&nbsp;as the No. 1 winner of Dronestagram's 2017 awards, he thanked her for her patience, as they “waited quite a long time to find the perfect spot”.

One morning, while in search of a beautiful reflection in mirror windows of Mercury tower, he spotted industrial climbers: “I liked the way their work looked from that perspective.

He feels relaxed when flying simply because of all the beautiful landscapes he's able to see, and when he took this picture, he thought it was \"really cool and symmetrical\". From this point of view, Domingo said it is really \"hard taking a pic like that\".</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-a42uhhufid.jpg\" /></p><h2>Elements</h2><p>This astoundingly beautiful image of the landscapes of Iceland is actually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skypixel.com/photos/elements-c04f4d52-d4cf-417b-aec8-41b374a31ade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12 separate images stitched into one</a>.

I had the idea of using the sand as a large sheet of paper. So my two sons and myself drew a scene related to the sea - on the image you can see my oldest son.\"&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-bhnu8vft2x.jpg\" /></p><h2>Raising ducks by the river</h2><p>In the skies above Vietnam, a drone captures ducks being raised by the local farmers.

This picture was shot at sunset time in Dubai at 6pm, while trying to capture an area which was a&nbsp;desert 10 years back but is now \"a concrete jungle with the highest buildings in Dubai\". He said every flight is a new adventure, even though he has been flying for ages, as each flight \"has its own taste\".</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-kmhj8uwpcb.jpg\" /></p><h2>When in Rome</h2><p>The Roman&nbsp;Colosseum is an incredible sight from the ground and from most angles. It's a marvel of architecture and a fantastic view of our history. Just when you thought it couldn't get more impressive, along comes this image by Mauri Pagliai showing it in full nighttime splendor from the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>This image was selected for one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skypixel.com/photos/ancient-moonlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">People's Choice Prizes in the Sky Pixel contest</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-e5klyspvcj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Not a small Hong Kong island</h2><p>Like a scene out of Inception, this drone photo captured with a Phantom 4 Pro shows a dream-like view of Hong Kong. A collection of 43 photos was just to create this amazing view and it's certainly impressive.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-qrm3nxlui7.jpg\" /></p><h2>Icelandic waterfall</h2><p>A wonderful Mavic Pro photo of the landscapes of Iceland and one of the many ice-encrusted waterfalls visible across the landscapes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-qvle2n6zvi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fire and ice</h2><p>Another brilliant Mavic Pro photo. This time from Yellowstone National Park in the US.

This brilliant image shows a lion disturbed by the sounds of the drone, but not put out by its presence. Not often you get to safely view a wild animal in this manner unless you happen to be hiding in a nearby tree.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-iudiqopxm9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Buddy</h2><p>Dolphins are awesome, aren't they?

The city's park looks incredible from this angle - even more so when sprinkled in wintery snow.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-ombld0gcew.jpg\" /></p><h2>A bird's eye view of Lombard Street, San Francisco</h2><p>Most people will be able to identify this as the famous Lombard Street - reportedly \"the crookedest street in the world\". This windy road is certainly iconic and this drone photo is equally fantastic.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-nnwp7xahut.jpg\" /></p><h2>Tatahatso Point</h2><p>This brilliant image shows&nbsp;Tatahatso Point at the Grand Canyon.

It's also an aerial view of a lighthouse on the coast of Yalta. The waters are actually the Black Sea. This impressively high photo makes the lighthouse appear tiny too. Which is no mean feat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-ckvpyqrxmt.jpg\" /></p><h2>Stylish symmetry</h2><p>This simple photo wasn't snapped as high in the sky as some of the others on our list, but that's doesn't make it great. The view of rows and rows of vines stretching off as far as the eye can see look fantastic. Even more so with the brilliant symmetry.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-k4zsynvfl9.jpg\" /></p><h2>A lonesome home</h2><p>In the dusty plains, a lonely house sits surrounded by nothing but dust, brush and the occasional tree. The buildings casting magnificent shadows across the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-vzfouym7ci.jpg\" /></p><h2>Where we're going we don't need roads</h2><p>Roads, roads, so many roads.

This stitching gives the impression of a bending world that stretches off into infinity. We've&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141560-19-amazing-aerial-photographs-with-a-new-perspective-of-the-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen this style before</a>&nbsp;and have to say it's a pretty awesome way to capture drone photographs.&nbsp;</p><p>Jesper Guldbrand gives a bit more insight:</p><p>\"This series is called \"Mind bending\" and is shot during 2017 in different locations of Sweden.

Although showing waves of beautiful colour, these aerial photographs actually demonstrate the damage mankind has done to the world we inhabit.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skypixel.com/photos/18-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photographer commented</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>\"The rapid development of human civilization has brought a series of negative effects. The environment is polluted and the ecology is destroyed. At present, the status quo of pollution in the earth is very harsh, forming a staggering \"earth 殇\"! Mankind must reflect on the triumphant industry development model, truly implement the policy of transforming the development mode and achieve sustainable social and economic development. Face the devastation of the earth, forever scars. Environmental pollution must be managed, otherwise, there will be no complete earth. Without protection of the environment, mankind will perish. Abstract images can instead better express the environmental impact of industrial pollution. Although these industrial pollution-related environments, details and colours can produce an attractive charm, the appearance does not represent the essence of spectacular colourful pictures may be very ugly nature, it is dirty, very evil. Human beings are rich in invention and creativity. They can also create a distinctive visual beauty in the process of industrial pollution and destruction of nature.

I've always wanted a special perspective, so try my best to try that as Mavic flies over the coastline, I find the waves on the coast flashes beautifully between dark grey gravel and turquoise water, dark and light. The contrast was very strong. When the waves fell toward the shore and retreated, they showed a vast and euphemistic shape, reminding me of the tail end of the whale, and finished the work. I pressed the shutter when the spray and the skirt were handed over to make the skirt and the sea wave blend together and have a sense of extension, leaving the work with an attachment and a similar space. With this idea, I shot a series of compositions in different forms continuously. The whole process was very exciting. Unfortunately, it was a cloudy day. If it is sunny, the overall color of the works will be even more gorgeous.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/133911-drones-feature-best-drone-photos-ever-taken-image1-q1xvmz5ve0.jpg\" /></p><h2>Elemental</h2><p>This aerial photograph was captured at 1,500 feet above the rivers of Iceland.

width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-bceqvt7ml3.jpg?v1\"> <p>Sony has been working hard on its video chops over the past five years or so. Its high-end full-frame Alpha series is a firm favourite in the video-making community, while smaller cameras <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/149119-sony-a6600-review\" rel=\"follow\">like the A6600</a> have sought to offer similar capabilities in a much more compact form.</p><p>With features like fast autofocus, advanced real-time face- and eye-tracking, you'd have thought that's where it ends. Apparently not. There's one specific breed of video-maker that Sony wants under its wings: vloggers.</p><p>Enter the Sony ZV-1. This powerful, very compact and functional camera offers all the tools you need - whether you're just starting at vlogging, or a seasoned pro who needs some extra tools.</p><h2>Design</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Dimensions: 105.4 x 60 x 44mm / Weight: 294g</li> \n  <li>3.5mm, Micro-USB, mini HDMI out/in</li> \n  <li>Flip-out rotating screen</li> \n </ul><p>Sony says it designed the ZV-1 from the ground up for vloggers. That means the appearance is quite different from the RX series, the latter designed predominantly for stills shooting. So the ZV-1 may be a very <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/150349-sony-rx100-vii-review-m7\" rel=\"\">similar size to the RX100</a>, but it's certainly not the same.</p><p>The design is minimal, crafted from a subtly textured black plastic. Unlike the RX100, the ZV-1 has a rubber grip sticking out of the left side. It's quite narrow, but that's so there's enough of a gap between it and the lens to give you somewhere to put your thumb when shooting yourself front-on.</p><p></p><p>While the grip isn't large enough to get a proper grip on when shooting the other way around, it does help add a bit of 'stickiness' when holding the camera. We felt like we were less likely to lose grip or drop it.</p><p>That's not the only element of the camera's design that makes the ZV-1 more tuned to a vlogger's needs. Sony has put a proper flip-out touchscreen on this video-focused camera, which is so much better than any of the ones that flip over the top of the camera (like in the RX100 series).</p><p>Having the screen flip out to the side of the camera means it's at the same level as the lens and - more importantly - means it can never be blocked by any accessories you might want to mount to the top of the camera, on the hotshoe, or plugged into the ports on the opposite side.</p><p>The screen also acts as a sort-of power button. Flipping the screen out of its shut state automatically powers up the camera, ready for shooting. It's really useful, especially when you just want to open up the display and capture the shot, without having to search for the small on/off button on the top edge. That's a good thing, because with the included wind-killing deadcat in place, the on/off button is covered by the deadcat's fluff.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-l3idlbkgqw.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>The top itself is mostly flat. There are no protruding buttons or dials, but it still manages to squeeze in five functional buttons: on/off button, a mode button, a big movie button (with a bright red ring around it), the usual shutter button (with zoom dial surrounding it to control the lens), plus a dedicated button for switching background defocus on.</p><p>The inclusion of background defocus is yet another vlogger-targeted feature. Those who want to create a bokeh effect - that's the soft, melty background blur called by its proper name - while speaking to the camera can do so at the press of a button.</p><p>Battery and SD Card access is achieved by opening the door on the underside of the camera. It's not a great placement for anyone who likes to mount their camera to a tripod. We've often found access blocked in these instances, so we have to unmount the camera to get to the memory card. Still, this camera is designed to be used primarily handheld.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-pmqyxdtvai.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>For the pro user who wants to be able to capture audio from a dedicated microphone, Sony has included a 3.5mm port on the right, just above the Micro-USB port and mini HDMI, each of which is covered in its own individual plastic door.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly - as if any further evidence that this is a vlogger's camera was required - there's no viewfinder. You just get the screen. The space normally taken up by a pop-up viewfinder in the RX100 has been replaced by a three capsule mic system and shoe mount - which is hidden by quite a large mesh grille.</p><h2>Processing, tracking and smart exposure</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Real-time eye and face tracking (with human and animal modes)</li> \n  <li>Instant bokeh and face smoothing modes</li> \n  <li>315 autofocus points</li> \n </ul><p>A lot of what makes Sony's cameras so appealing is the brains running the show. In the ZV-1 there's the Sony BIONZ X image signal processor. It's similar to the one you'll find inside the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/143157-sony-a9-initial-review-phenomenal-speed-from-the-full-frame-mirrorless-master\" rel=\"\">top-end A9</a>, which means that all of the super fast, super smart auto-focusing and tracking you find higher up the Sony camera chain are present in the ZV-1.&nbsp;</p><p>The joy of the sensor is that you stick the camera in intelligent auto (iA) mode, or auto movie mode, and the brains of the camera will generally suss out what's going on in the scene pretty quickly and adjust settings to match. If that's you recording a vlog to camera, it'll automatically focus on your eye and then base the exposure of the entire frame on ensuring that your face is well lit and natural looking.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-awha2oyrsz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>Having tested this in a few different lighting situations, both indoors and outdoors, with bright backlighting and even with our face shaded by an over-hanging tree, the results are surprisingly good. It does seem to take a second or two to adjust and expose, but when we stood in shade that covered our face, it still managed to pull out the details and make our face clearly visible. Similarly, with bright light shining on our face, it adjusted to tone it down. You can see the before/after in the image above.</p><p>As you'd expect, in extreme contrasting conditions like this the background can end up looking bleached out and overexposed, but the priority for the vlog is seeing the person clearly, so that's what you get. Sony says this works regardless of skin colour and ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><p>You can - if you want - also enable skin smoothing modes, and adjust how much smoothing you want. If you want your skin looking all natural, with all of your pores and wrinkles on show, you can have that. Likewise, if you want to hide them for that smoother airbrushed look, you can do that too.&nbsp;</p><p>Another major feature is the instant background defocus mode. So how does this work? Watching the lens mechanism when you press the dedicated mode button, we could see the ZV-1 mechanically switching to a wider aperture. Checking image metadata from stills we took in the same scene, but having switched background defocus on and off, revealed as much to be true. The defocus setting has the aperture set to f/1.8 by default, then adjusts exposure time and ISO sensitivity accordingly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-6rpyd7ivh2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>As for the auto-tracking and autofocusing, that's as fast and accurate an experience as it is on any of Sony's modern cameras. That's thanks largely down to the 1-inch sensor featuring both phase-detection points on its surface, use in conjunction with contrast-detection autofocus. We recorded our cats, then messed around with touching to focus on the screen, and the camera was quick to detect changes and lock in on the newly selected area.&nbsp;</p><p>For the mobile generation, those who share more videos on vertical-centric platforms like TikTok, Sony's latest camera automatically detects when it's shooting video in portrait mode and at stays in vertical mode once it's transferred onto a device for sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who shoot product-based videos, or make-up tutorials, or other types of videos where you're often bringing products close to the lens to show it briefly and then move it away, there's also a product-specific mode you can switch it to.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-ivnipcvmbd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>When activated, you can hold your product - whether it be a lipstick, a Lego figure, a phone, or whatever - up to the camera, and it'll quickly focus on it, blurring you out in the background, then quickly switching back again to focus on your face when you remove the product from the frame. There is a little bit of focusing noise as the adjustment happens, but it's not especially loud, and if you're talking at the same time, it's not all that noticeable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Audio power</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Three capsule mic</li> \n  <li>Wind/noise reduction features</li> \n  <li>Included windshield/deadcat&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>3.5mm input</li> \n </ul><p>With video, the image is only one part of the story. Sony's additional effort in the ZV-1 was to include a built-in microphone system that's good enough to use on the fly without any additional mic equipment. And, for the most part, that effort has paid off.&nbsp;</p><p>Recording video and speaking to camera results in clear and loud audio. It wasn't the nasty, muffled type of sound you'd perhaps expect to get from a camera's own microphone. We tested it in a few different scenarios and found our voice was clear and pronounced and had enough natural timbre to it that it didn't sound flat and broken.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-pca5izf3sn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>Of course, using a professional microphone will yield better results, and you can either use the 3.5mm input for that, or use a hotshoe adapter to connect up an XLR cable.</p><p>The ZV-1 also comes with a dedicated deadcat - a small fluffy 'wind-shield' - that attaches to the hotshoe and covers the mic grille. We tested this out on a particularly blustery day and while you could hear the wind it never resulted in any tearing sounds, regardless of how bad the wind got.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, there is also a wind reduction feature that you can enable within the camera's menus, but this is more of an ambient noise killer than a dedicated wind noise filter. It essentially switches off the two wide mic capsules, leaving only the central one picking up your voice. The difference is stark - it doesn't completely kill traffic or wind noise, but it does reduce it. The downside to this filter, however, is that it can make the sound seem quite flat.</p><h2>Video pro</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K at 30fps/1080p at 60fps</li> \n  <li>Slow motion modes</li> \n  <li>Multiple picture profiles - ideal for colour grading</li> \n  <li>Proxy support</li> \n </ul><p>This isn't just a camera for people who want to pop a camera on a tripod and shoot a TikTok dance in vertical, full-automatic mode. Sony knows what video creators want, and so has included a bunch of features to try and keep those people happy too.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, one of those features isn't 4K video at 60 frames per second. The ZV-1 maxes out at 30fps at its full resolution setting, but it can shoot up to 60fps in 1080p.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-ued4xmkjic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>It's also pre-loaded with a bunch of preset picture profiles - which you can customise - that allow you to shoot with a variety of different S-log, cine and gamma profiles. So if you want to you can set it to a nice, flat, desaturated profile giving you the scope to colour grade it to your liking.</p><p>You can also enable proxies, which are supported by the likes of Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro, enabling fast editing and rendering without losing detail in the final product.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll need to do a bit of digging into settings with the camera set to the manual video mode in order to choose one of these options. It took us a little while to figure a lot of those menus - as there's a lot in there.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most useful settings to enable, we found, was adjusting the the focus speed. With the camera set to 'touch focus', then changing the focus speed to slow, it allowes for automatic slow pull focus effects. That's useful if you want to add a bit of extra motion to a frame where nothing is moving.</p><h2>It takes stills too</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>20-megapixel 1-inch size CMOS sensor</li> \n  <li>24-70mm (equivalent) zoom lens</li> \n  <li>24fps burst mode</li> \n </ul><p>It may be a 'vlogger camera' but you can take pictures with the ZV-1 too - and the results aren't half bad.</p><p>It still uses that same eye-tracking, fast autofocusing tech too. Pointing at a pet with the animal tracking on locks quickly onto an eye and focuses. Even if that cat's eye is half-shut because the cat is inevitably asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>We found the results to be detailed, with good colour and dynamic range in good light. Sometimes they might come out a bit too contrasty in automatic mode, but there are enough opportunities to adjust settings, including switching off a lot of the automatic scene suggestions.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing that makes this less versatile as a stills camera is the zoom length. It only has a 3x optical zoom (a 24-70mm equivalent), which isn't anywhere near as versatile in that regard as the RX100 (which has an 8.5x, 24-200mm optic).&nbsp;</p><h2>A note on battery life</h2><p>Being a small camera means quite a small battery capacity. Sony claims the ZV-1 can get you up to 45 minutes of recording.</p><p>Having tested this at 4K video resolution, we find that rather ambitious. We didn't get close to 45 minutes capture in our own use, but then a lot of our time testing was spent digging through menus, playing with different settings, and testing different features - all of which eats into battery life.</p><p>Thankfully, it's one of those cameras that's convenient to keep topped up. You just need to plug it in with the Micro-USB cable, so plug it into a power supply at home when you're done or keep a battery pack with you when out and about.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 26 May 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-bceqvt7ml3.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"ae78b3777ebb7aad47e5e1aa747771c6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-791_db1e20d39b72ab38.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":55683,"destBytes":44020,"author":"Cam Bunton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-bceqvt7ml3.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-791_db1e20d39b72ab38.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-l3idlbkgqw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-37-25-904_544e63f564f67ec9.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-pmqyxdtvai.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn54@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-37-25-403_627c4cfa6ad9685e.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-awha2oyrsz.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-37-25-984_c52fd021ce07659e.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-6rpyd7ivh2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn31@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-14-574_1252e97368f220c3.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-ivnipcvmbd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-37-05-111_fff14a6ff871559e.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-sony-zv-1-hardware-image1-pca5izf3sn.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-58-008_707f53363e7321ee.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152309-cameras-review-screenshots-and-processing-image1-ued4xmkjic.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-01-668_fa936af2de529cc8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209018},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Nikon Z5 and Z30 set to expand mirrorless camera line-up?","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/nikon/152465-nikon-z5-z30-rumoured-z9","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152465-cameras-news-nikon-z-image1-i85lqadui3.jpg?v1\"> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/151272-coronavirus-update-all-the-major-tech-conferences-canceled-so-far\" rel=\"\">passing of so many major shows in 2020</a> - there was no CP+ in Japan, for example - there's been a lack of exciting new camera releases.

The best thing about this particular celestial event is that you won't need any special gear - it'll be visible to the naked eye so you should be able to photograph it relatively easily.&nbsp;</p><p>It's believed that the worm moon/supermoon will be visible from 5.35pm after sunset as the moon rises in the east and will peak at around 5.48pm. It should be visible for much of the evening, though.&nbsp;</p><p>So what are David’s best super moon shooting tips?</p><h3>1. Be in-the-know</h3><p>The sun’s position in the sky at any given time of day varies massively with latitude and season. That is not the case with the moon as its passage through the heavens is governed by its complex elliptical orbit of the earth. That orbit results in monthly, rather than seasonal variations, as the moon moves through its lunar cycle.</p><p>The result is big differences in the timing of its appearance and its trajectory through the sky. Luckily, we no longer need to rely on weight tables to consult the&nbsp;behaviour of the moon, we can simply download an app on to our phone.</p><p>The&nbsp;Photographer’s Ephemer is&nbsp;is useful for giving moonrise and moonset times, bearings and phases; while the&nbsp;Photopills&nbsp;app gives comprehensive information on the position of the moon in our sky.</p><h3>2. Invest in a lens with optimal zoom</h3><p>One of the key challenges we’ll face is shooting the moon large in the frame so we can see every crater on the asteroid pockmarked surface.</p><p>It’s a task normally reserved for astronomers with super powerful telescopes, but if you’ve got a long telephoto lens on a full frame DSLR with around 600 mm of focal length, it can be done, depending on the composition.</p><h3>3. Use a tripod to capture the intimate details</h3><p>As you frame up your shot, one thing will become immediately apparent; lunar tracking is incredible challenging as the moon moves through the sky surprisingly quickly.&nbsp;As you’ll be using a long lens for this shoot, it’s important to invest in a sturdy tripod to help capture the best possible image.</p><p>Although it will be tempting to take the shot by hand, it’s important to remember that your subject is over 384,000km away from you and even with a high shutter speed, the slightest of movements will become exaggerated.</p><h3>4. Integrate the moon into your landscape</h3><p>Whilst images of the moon large in the frame can be beautifully detailed, they are essentially astronomical in their appeal. Personally, I’m far more drawn to using the lunar allure as an element in my landscapes, or using the moonlight as a light source.</p><p>The latter is difficult, as the amount of light the moon reflects is tiny, whilst the lunar surface is so bright by comparison. Up to now, night photography meant long, long exposures but with cameras now capable of astonishing low light performance, a whole new nocturnal world of opportunities has been opened to photographers.</p><h3>5. Master the shutter speed for your subject&nbsp;</h3><p>The most evocative and genuine use of the moon in landscape portraits results from situations when the light on the moon balances with the twilight in the surrounding sky. Such images have a subtle appeal, mood and believability.</p><p>By definition, any scene incorporating a medium or wide-angle view is going to render the moon as a tiny pin prick of light, but its presence will still be felt. Our eyes naturally gravitate to it, however insignificant it may seem. Of course, the issue of shutter speed is always there; too slow an exposure and all we’ll see is an unsightly lunar streak, even with a wide-angle lens.</p><p>On a clear night, mastering the shutter speed of your camera is integral to capturing the moon - exposing at 1/250 sec at f8 ISO 100 (depending on focal length) is what you’ll need to stop the motion from blurring.</p><p><strong>Liked this?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/120868-10-top-tips-for-better-smartphone-photography\" rel=\"\">Check out these tips for great low light photography</a></p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Mar 2020 14:26:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/143512-cameras-feature-how-to-take-pictures-of-the-‘super-blue-blood-moon’-image1-yis9hz50g2.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"27b8d5c4fffd32581a908ce79247efac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-52-428_716a1148aefcd1a7.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":70287,"destBytes":37038,"author":"Dan Grabham","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/143512-cameras-feature-how-to-take-pictures-of-the-‘super-blue-blood-moon’-image1-yis9hz50g2.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-52-428_716a1148aefcd1a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209021},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"GoPro Max review: Everything an action camera should be","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/gopro/151240-gopro-max-review","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-k1awmaxtzb.jpg?v1\"> <p>GoPro makes action cameras, that's what it's known for.

They snap easily onto the lenses, enabling a way to shoot underwater and above the water's surface simultaneously (with the clear dividing line between the two).</p><p>Just like the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/gopro/149442-gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera\" rel=\"\">Hero 8</a>, the Max has a built-in flip out frame on the underside of the camera, so you don't need to attach any frames or additional accessories just to mount it. It'll easily screw onto any handle or mount from GoPro's range using the standard screw.</p><p>Another more important inclusion is the small touchscreen on the bottom of its front/back. It means you no longer have to shoot 360-degree video completely blind, meaning you get an easy way to control and frame your shooting. Which is massively important.</p><p>Joining the screen is the addition of an advanced microphone system, which GoPro has added to offer more professional quality audio, but also better ambient noise cancellation when you need it to focus on your voice.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-ovlxwzlcpf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"704\" height=\"469\" /></p><p>There's also the durable metal cover, which seals shut the battery and microSD slots, locking them behind a catch. It holds really well in daily use, and needs a good amount of force to release and gain access, so those worried about it being broken easily can rest easy. As can anyone concerned about water seeping in. The Max is waterproof up to five metres and the build makes that pretty clear.</p><h2>User friendly</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>Easy touchscreen interface</li>\n  <li>Two physical buttons</li>\n </ul><p>One of the things we've grown to love about GoPro is the company's attempts to make using its cameras as simple as possible. That's meant reworking the user interface on the touchscreen, and developing new mobile-first apps that make it super-easy to edit on the go. These same strengths are evident in the GoPro Max.</p><p>Because this latest 360-degree camera has a touchscreen on it, actually seeing what you're filming is possible, whereas on the Fusion it was a case of pressing record and hoping things looked right.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-ya4s2lboex.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"704\" height=\"469\" /></p><p>Just like the Hero 8 Black, there are easy interface elements on the Max's touchscreen. You can switch between Hero mode - where you shoot from one camera like a regular GoPro - and 360 mode by tapping a little camera icon in the bottom left corner. Then you can flip the view on the screen to switch between the cameras by tapping the icon in the bottom right.</p><p>Like Hero you can also adjust the field of view, depending on how wide-angle you want it, as well as quickly selecting what resolution and frame rate you'd like to use. It's really consumer friendly and not at all difficult to figure out. Even if you've never used a GoPro before, you'll quickly get used to the controls, even if they are a bit tiny and fiddly on that small touchscreen.</p><p>There are physical buttons on the camera too, which for the GoPro-experienced will seem immediately familiar. The power/mode button lets you quickly cycle through the shooting modes, while the bigger red button on the top starts and stops recording.</p><h2>The GoPro app</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>Android/iPhone app</li>\n  <li>Easy keyframe selection</li>\n  <li>Accelerometer framing for easy viewing</li>\n </ul><p>It's safe to say using the Fusion was a learning curve. Initially, you had to install a desktop plugin and app for advanced editing programs like Premiere Pro. It eventually was made easier with an app, but with the Max it's been made easy right from the outset.</p><p>Once you shoot some 360 video, you simply launch the app and view the media. Press play and then move your phone to point within the frame you want to view. It takes very little effort.</p><p>Editing the footage, adding transitions, changing the view and angle is all done in a similarly easy way. And being mobile-focused, it's so much simpler than using a desktop editing suite. And that makes it far less time consuming.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-app-image1-grzeikjkqi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"704\" height=\"325\" /></p><p>Once you have your footage downloaded to the phone, all you have to do is choose to edit it by adding keyframes. Play the video, move it around using your finger on the screen, pinch-to-zoom in or out to change the view, and add a keyframe by tapping the little icon at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Once that's done, it'll automatically pan and zoom between the starting point and your keyframe. Then all you have to do is keep adding keyframes with the angle and view you want, then save and render on the phone. It's so easy it's almost ridiculous.</p><h2>Photos and video</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>5.6k 360-degree footage at 30fps</li>\n  <li>16.6MP stills</li>\n  <li>2x slo-mo&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>PowerPan - single take panorama</li>\n  <li>Spherical audio</li>\n </ul><p>There's no doubt that when it comes to shooting with the Max, it's one of the most versatile action cameras GoPro has ever launched. That stems primarily from the fact that you can use it as either a 360-degree camera, or in 'Hero' mode, just use it like a GoPro and using one camera.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The downside of Hero mode, however, is that the resolution tops out at 1440p, and even then you're forced to use that in 4:3 ratio. If you want 16:9 video - which is much more typical for the format - then you can only get 1080p as a maximum resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Short version: if what you want is the highest quality regular video footage, you're better off saving a little money and buying the Hero 8 Black instead. It has higher resolution video that generally looks better.&nbsp;</p><p>The process of shooting 360-degree video with the Max and what you can do with it afterwards is a lot of fun. One of the things we're most impressed with is the stabilisation: holding the camera handheld while we're running or walking sees the footage stay stable and smooth, with only a little smooth movement. With the feature enabled, it also keeps the horizon locked in place, ensuring you're almost looking at footage that's the right way around. It's a testament to GoPro's work on algorithms that process the movement and footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Once stitched together, the 360-video file comes in around 5.6K resolution, but when you edit into a video for a flat-screen, obviously it ends up being a much lower resolution, so it doesn't always seem that sharp.&nbsp;</p><p>If you shoot in nice bright daylight with blue skies, the footage - while a little rough resolution-wise - can look vivid and bright. In overcast conditions, or even in Hero mode shooting 1080p, it appears the camera can struggle to balance out the exposure, backlighting and shadows some of the time, leaving you either with a dark image or one that's a little too over-exposed and lacking in detail.&nbsp;It's not all that bad, but it could be better.&nbsp;</p><p>Another of the big advantages of this particular 360 camera is what it enables on the stills front. Of course, you can create 360-degree photos with tiny-planet spherical effect, but you can also create what GoPro calls a PowerPano (a panorama photo it snaps in one press of the shutter). Unlike using a smartphone, you just hold the camera still, and it'll create the Panorama using the two lenses.&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-k1awmaxtzb.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"1e39bc5c99a8ff335422dae38117581c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-51-914_b5b01e365de86e1d.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":39174,"destBytes":21212,"author":"Cam Bunton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-k1awmaxtzb.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-51-914_b5b01e365de86e1d.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-hmhsp9zovd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-16-463_9f61eb28f475502e.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-ovlxwzlcpf.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn82@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-37-14-134_d3eb1cc72360114f.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-gopro-max-review-everything-an-action-camera-should-be-image1-ya4s2lboex.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-59-034_62aaca4a29cedbae.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151240-cameras-review-app-image1-grzeikjkqi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-57-507_5af5a9eddd44da90.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209022},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Fujifilm X-A7 camera kit is £495 in Amazon Summer Sale, that's 29% off","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/fujifilm/152834-fuji-x-a7-deal-discount-camera","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152834-cameras-news-fujifilm-x-a7-image1-ctqbac9fgi.jpg?v1\"> <p>It's the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/amazon/152824-amazon\" rel=\"\">surprise Amazon Summer Sale</a>, which means discounts on a whole variety of goodies.</p><p>Leading the camera charge is almost a third off the Fujifilm X-A7 mirrorless system, complete with 15-45mm lens.</p><p>squirrel_widget_273187</p><p>That <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/ddb619b6?tag=pocketlintc07-21\" rel=\"nofollow\">means you can get this camera for £495 instead of £699</a>, which is a great deal.&nbsp;</p><p>The X-A7 is the more entry-level product in Fujifilm's X series.

We know this. But the fact remains that more and more people are choosing to print out their digital photos as well as using the things for letters, contracts and other documents.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/smart-home/buyers-guides/151531-best-printers-documents-photos\" rel=\"follow\">Best cheap home printer: The best printers for documents and photos</a></li> \n </ul><p>So, if you want to know how to avoid the pricey ink trap and make sure you're getting the most beautiful snaps for your frames then read on.</p><h2>Rule 1: Work out how much you'll use it</h2><p>This is both the hardest thing to figure out and also the most important at the same time. In fact, if you get this bit sussed, you're pretty much home already. The trouble is that it's a hard thing to estimate because it's not worth paying attention to while you do it.</p><p>In fact, you're most likely only going find out the answer after it's too late and you've already made your purchase. So, as dull as it might sound, if you can have a good estimate at this now, it'll save you a fair bit of money and trouble in the long run.</p><h2>Rule 2: Cheaper printers have more expensive ink</h2><p>You might have paid a good price for the hardware in some sale or other but chances are that a cheap printer will cost you more in ink cartridges over time whereas replacements on a more expensive piece of kit will work out better as time goes on.</p><p>So, based on the calculation of how many pages you think you'll be printing each month, you'll have some idea of how often you'll get through cartridges. Lots of brands these days say on the packaging just how many sheets they'd expect you to get out of them.</p><p>Combine that with your printing frequency and you'll have some idea of how much you'd expect to pay in refills over each year. Factor in the initial cost of the machine and you'll see at what point it might be worth going for a higher spec printer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Rule 3: Lasers are not necessarily the best</h2><p>Most home user probably would opt for an inkjet anyway but even if you really want to spend some cash or you're a small business trying to make the right choice, don't just presume that you'll get more for your money with a laser printer. The major advantage of them is that they're fast.</p><p>Many inkjets will beat laser models for startup time if you're just printing a page or two. On the other hand, if you're going to be calling for 20 sheets at a time, then a laser's probably the right call.<br> <br> Another issue is that lasers won't necessarily offer more accurate colours over all parts of the spectrum as a high-end inkjet might. So, if printing photos is the reason for your purchase then make sure to read the reviews carefully if you really are sold on the idea of these bigger, faster machines.</br></br></p><p>On the cartridge side, you won't have to shell out for a new one quite so often but you will be looking at a fair old wedge when you do. Quite a good compromise if you're unsure of which type to go for are often the prosumer type inkjet printers. They're generally quicker and more economic with the ink provided you use them on a regular basis. But they cost more initially.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rule 4: Use the right refills</h2><p>One option to make your ongoing printer use cheaper is to go for non-brand printer cartridge replacements or even have your empties filled back up again. By all means, give this a crack but get them from a reputable supplier rather than somebody selling a supply from an unknown source. Some non-brand replacements are reliable but many aren't.&nbsp;<br> <br> Another thing to keep your eyes out for are extra large cartridges and printer packs. It's just a question of a buying-in-bulk mentality. These deals will offer you a lower cost per page but obviously need you to spend more up front.&nbsp;</br></br></p><h2>Rule 5: Use the right paper</h2><p>There's a holy trinity of printing between the machine, the ink and the paper and if any one of them is out, there's a chance that you won't get good results. Fortunately, you don't have to be quite as specific with paper as you do with the ink.</p><p>Photo quality paper is the one to pay most attention to. If you are going to print your snaps, it's not really a place to scrimp. That said, they often come in grades equivalent to “good”, “better” and “best” so try a few and see which reaches the right price/quality point for you.</p><p>One piece of advice for all printing is to make sure that your paper is 80gsm thick or over – if you require your documents to have an aesthetic value, that is.</p><h2>Rule 6: A printer is a subscription</h2><p>Most dissatisfaction over printers is caused by the bill shock of the cartridges. The problem is that people just aren't in the right mindset when they buy them. You've got to see the purchase of a printer much like a mobile phone where there's an initial outlay to consider as well as an equal, if not more significant, running cost.</p><p>Pick the subscription model that suits you the best. Are you happy paying little and often or would you prefer to shell out in bursts? You might consider a cheaper printer more like a 12 month contract whereas a better model you'll need to keep for a longer period of time to really reap the economic benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n <!--            @page { margin: 2cm }           P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 08:53:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/99101-laptops-news-how-to-buy-the-right-printer-for-you-image1-ckrpqvtsot.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"7fd77148066f7b7edd7d21f6e2353dd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-042_7e05fd06a856fa30.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":40816,"destBytes":22172,"author":"Dan Sung","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/99101-laptops-news-how-to-buy-the-right-printer-for-you-image1-ckrpqvtsot.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-042_7e05fd06a856fa30.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209020},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Enter another world with these amazingly dreamlike photo edits","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/152265-dreamlike-photoshop-images-gallery","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152265-cameras-news-enter-another-world-with-these-amazingly-dreamlike-photo-edits-image1-pnmht8prhg.jpg?v1\"> <p>Photoshop is a marvellous tool, and while it may have become synonymous for a time with airbrushing and touch-ups, the reality is that it's a program that lets people achieve wonderful things visually.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/148290-fantastic-street-artist-transforms-the-world-with-pixel-art\" rel=\"follow\">Fantastic street artist transforms the world with incredible pixel art</a></li> \n </ul><p>Take <a href=\"https://jstnptrs.myportfolio.com/\" rel=\"follow\">Justin Peters</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jstnptrs/\" rel=\"follow\">Instagram profile is here</a>, for example, a visual artist who's been working for some time on beautifully altered images that evoke a sense of wonder and otherworldliness.

art in the past. With talented Photoshop artists using their skills to create some nifty pieces of modern art.</p><p>Over at Design Crowd, there are a number of regular Photoshop contests, challenging people to come up with creative works of art on particular topics. There have been all sorts, from <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/149161-amusing-images-of-animals-photoshopped-into-renaissance-paintings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">animals in Renaissance paintings</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/149332-amusing-images-of-cartoon-characters-in-photoshopped-into-renaissance-paintings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">cartoon characters</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/149283-movie-and-tv-casts-re-imagined-with-photoshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">movies recast with new actors</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This one is all about politicians. Whether you love or loathe politicians you're bound to enjoy this collection of images where photos of the most well-known have been converted into painted portraits.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-wbvykxgqhd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Vladimir Putin meets Van Gogh</h2><p>Vladimir Putin is perhaps one of the most well-known modern politicians you're ever likely to see a photo of. The President of Russia has held high office in the country for many years. Here's he's seen in simpler times thanks to an artist who has tweaked his image to fit perfectly with the work of Vincent Van Gogh.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel like the cheeky wink might not be a side of his character you'd normally see and that's what really makes this image a winner.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-ubfotacisg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hillary Clinton meets Mona Lisa</h2><p>She might not have been the most popular of politicians, despite winning the popular vote in the 2016 elections, but there's no denying that Hillary Clinton looks magnificent in this painting.&nbsp;</p><p>The wonder of&nbsp;Leonardo da Vinci's work has been reimagined with the likeness of the American politician. She's no Mona Lisa but it's still a cracking Photoshopping.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-fgbnd9lnmr.jpg\" /></p><h2>Kim Jong-Un meets The Son of Man</h2><p>The Son of Man was a surrealist self-portrait painting by&nbsp;René Magritte originally crafted in 1964. The original image featured an apple hanging in front of the artist's face and the hat still firmly on his head. Now re-imagined, it features&nbsp;Kim Jong-Un with Apple in hand and hat lost to the wind.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-xcdef23oml.jpg\" /></p><h2>Angela Merkel meets The Girl with the Pearl Earring</h2><p>Girl with a Pearl Earring was originally crafted back in 1665 and showed a beautiful, young European girl wearing an exotic dress and a large earring. Now it has been reworked to show a likeness of Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. We actually thoroughly enjoy this one. It's both convincing and amusing. We wonder what Merkel would think of it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-x7iqlavrkd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Dilma Vana Rousseff meets Princess Albert De Broglie</h2><p>Dilma Rousseff used to be the President of Brazil before her impeachment in 2016. Here she is, seen as an alternative to the likeness of&nbsp;Princess Albert De Broglie, the wife of the Prime Minister of France in 1845.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel that the updated version is actually a great improvement over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princesse_de_Broglie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">the original image</a>. Whether it's a good tribute to either woman is entirely subjective.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-7dfmgirkex.jpg\" /></p><h2>Donald Trump meets Young Boy with Whip</h2><p>Well, this one is pretty special isn't it? The original painting from 1840 showed a boy in a pink dress holding a whip. A bit of an odd image on its own. Even more so when his likeness is replaced with that of Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-z27wjd3h4u.jpg\" /></p><h2>Francois Hollande meets Napoleon Bonaparte</h2><p>Francois Hollande, the former President of France is seen here, reimagined in the regal glory of&nbsp;Napoleon Bonaparte, the Emperor of France and the great military leader from the time of&nbsp;the French Revolution. A fitting tribute? We're not sure.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-1ouq0wmb9o.jpg\" /></p><h2>Clinton and Trump meet American Gothic</h2><p>Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton appear Grant Wood's iconic painting American Gothic. One certainly looks happier about it than the other. Another classic oil painting amusingly reimagined for all to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-fnayiq8jme.jpg\" /></p><h2>Bill Clinton meets Prince Leopold</h2><p>Many of the oil paintings of old feature a look and feel like this. Important men of the time in full-blown military garb sporting a chest full of medals and posing for historic portraits. Here, the likeness of Prince Leopold has been replaced with that of Bill Clinton.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-mdaqsfvkrh.jpg\" /></p><h2>David Cameron meets The Death of Marat</h2><p>A dark, if somewhat poignant Photoshopping replaces the likeness of&nbsp;murdered French revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat with that of ex-Prime Minister David Cameron. He certainly murdered the future of our nation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 18 May 2020 16:30:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-tdpjknmck4.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"3b223140dcec6aa970fae6158675db15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-51-249_abae7e65055114bb.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":568,"sourceBytes":83668,"destBytes":48738,"author":"Adrian Willings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-tdpjknmck4.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-51-249_abae7e65055114bb.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-wbvykxgqhd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-23-259_28f41d7e22c115f5.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-ubfotacisg.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn25@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-37-03-792_a8504dabe823ecbf.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-fgbnd9lnmr.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-13-816_3f022985dc53b3e0.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-xcdef23oml.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-37-05-657_db9562d9d082c7fb.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-x7iqlavrkd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-37-06-482_36ee965606942d61.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-7dfmgirkex.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn54@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-37-03-107_97ba7d2978c3c02a.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-z27wjd3h4u.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn10@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-11-006_1751346c6f8f19a9.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-1ouq0wmb9o.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-26-445_ace3391fa246d469.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-fnayiq8jme.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-37-19-658_042d2266959f1b9b.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152226-apps-feature-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings-image1-mdaqsfvkrh.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn70@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-37-08-252_98ed31fb17d734cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209018},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"57 stunning photos from the National Sony World Photography Awards 2020","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/151442-stunning-photos-from-the-national-sony-world-photography-awards-2020","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151442-cameras-feature-stunning-photos-from-the-national-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-image1-evuxphd3mr.jpg?v1\"> <p>Every year, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldphoto.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">World Photography Organisation</a>&nbsp;celebrates the very best images and photographers on the planet with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Sony World Photography Awards</a>.

It's the dawn of the camera, and photos from that era showcase a world that we think we know, from films, books and games, but which is often hugely surprising in the details.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/151936-photos-american-west\" rel=\"follow\">These old photos from the American West will make you yearn for a better time</a></li> \n </ul><p>We've gathered another amazing slate of images from the US National Archive, showcasing what life was really like back then, in a time when there was no such thing as an easy day.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image1-kxu5uo7fdc.jpg\" /></p><h2>Family portrait</h2><p>We open with this lovely family portrait, taken in New Mexico in 1895, which shows off a lovely range of clothing and styles, all with that textbook seriousness that posed photos from this era so often showcase. This is a big family group, in front of their log cabin.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image2-wp3yejygzm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Different means</h2><p>By contrast, this family is a far smaller one, and you get the sense that their means are similarly reduced in comparison. You can see their homestead in the background, and it looks modest to say the least, although the presence of some horses holds some faint promise for them.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image3-x0n1xvaeys.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hard work</h2><p>If you want to get a sense for how difficult work could be under the hot sun of Oklahoma, check out some the expressions these women are wearing. From fatigue to sardonic, these cherry-pickers look about as tired as we imagine they feel.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image4-ilabwjuytn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mucking in&nbsp;</h2><p>Fruit picking was a common job, though, and sadly could be done pretty effectively by the child labour that was still extremely common at the turn of the century. There's something cute about the little trolley being used, but there's nothing fun about that work.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/142413-50-incredible-images-of-space-like-you-ve-never-seen-before\" rel=\"follow\">50 Incredible images of space like you've never seen before</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image5-rkhl6gfrsa.jpg\" /></p><h2>Quite a herd</h2><p>We think this a stunning bit of photography, regardless of its age. In the foreground this cowboy readies his lasso for a day's work, but waits for a signal from his fellow herdsman, who you'll spot on the far horizon, on the other side of the herd. It's a beautiful bit of mirroring.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image6-jucsbvf8q5.jpg\" /></p><h2>From a distance</h2><p>This view from a distance showcases how busy an environment could be in the West when tracks were being laid and settlements prepared. In one frame you have people, horses, carriages and a train all working together to clear the land.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image7-hasuxsqtfb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Nature's bounty</h2><p>This shot, meanwhile, is an apt reminder of how pristine the unspoiled landscape could be. Whoever lived in the ranch on the right of the frame, whatever their troubles, the natural beauty all around them must have provided some measure of comfort each day.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image8-ayclex1ggj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ways of life</h2><p>But those modes of living could be seriously tough, as show by these trappers, whose haul of raccoon pelts might fetch a price, but wouldn't offer enough to upgrade what is a fairly ramshackle dwelling. At least they've got some canine companionship.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141060-fantastic-photographic-firsts\" rel=\"follow\">29 fantastic photographic firsts</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image9-gbjv2zdhnt.jpg\" /></p><h2>No shortcuts</h2><p>If farming was the route for you, hard work lay in that direction, too - this farmer is turning the first sods in his field, with the help of a team of horses, but there's no escaping how backbreaking it looks.

Yet it also shows how quaint and free it could be - a young girl helping to feed the chickens, with a young calf stood by.

This mining town shows the sort of community that could spring up around a trove of resources.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image155-0xa2epploi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Landscaping</h2><p>And, from a different type of angle, you can get a sense for how drastic the impact was on natural environments immediately. It's odd to see this sort of change made stark even over a hundred years ago, as it's the sort of image we're more used to seeing in modern settings.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/131203-best-gopro-pictures-and-photos-from-around-the-world\" rel=\"follow\">The best GoPro photos in the world, prepare to lose your breath</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152097-cameras-news-another-set-of-photos-from-the-american-west---portraits-of-a-simpler-time-image166-mtqsnxijqi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Working in the dark</h2><p>Of course, back then this mining wasn't being done by huge machines and sophisticated supply chains.

powerhouse","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/olympus/151867-olympus-omd-em1-mk-3-review-mark-iii","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\"

Yes, it still matters. The Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III is part of the Micro Four Thirds format system, which uses a smaller sensor size than you'll find in many other competitor DSLR and mirrorless cameras. But this sensor format is both its Achilles' heel and its launchpad.&nbsp;</p><p>On the one hand, a larger sensor would mean greater light gathering capacity and resolution potential. But it also means added bulk - something this Olympus doesn't suffer. Its equivalent lenses are smaller too.</p><p>Furthermore, the E-M1 Mk3 brings a host of innovative tech, truly going to town with a bounty of shooting modes that make this camera a technological powerhouse that stands apart from its peers.&nbsp;</p><h2>An answer for everyday photography</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Image Stabilisation up to 7.5EV</li> \n  <li>High-Res Shot up to 80MP</li> \n  <li>Live ND Shooting up to 5EV</li> \n  <li>Starry Sky AF&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Focusing Stacking in-camera</li> \n  <li>Pro-Capture High Time-lapse with 4K video output</li> \n  <li>Cine 4K video, plus Slow motion Full HD videos up to 120fps</li> \n  <li>Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity&nbsp;</li> \n </ul><p>The E-M1 MkIII packs a remarkable feature list - and we've only included the highlights above. That's something Olympus continues to do: unearth new ideas that are genuinely useful.&nbsp;Scroll down page after page of the jungle of a menu system - in itself a problem that takes some navigational learning - and you'll find heaps of extra goodies.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-e-m1-mark-iii-image1-6ry8abjivj.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>But it's not just the shooting modes that are the reason to buy this camera. It also packs a super image stabilisation system, which is a key reason why the E-M1 Mark III is so easy to use. It's now rated up to 7.5EV (depending on which lens is being used), so it's completely possible to get sharp detail in handheld shots with an exposure a couple of seconds long. That's truly mind-boggling stuff. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This system is used in other creative ways too. Take in-camera focus stacking. This bracketing mode can composite multiple images at different focus planes to create a final image with greater depth of field. All in-camera, shot handheld, with manual control over the depth range and number of shots. It's a macro photographer's dream, plus that Micro Four Thirds sensor already has greater depth of field than larger sensor rivals at equivalent aperture settings.</p><p>Or how about High-Res Shot. Effective for static scenes, this uses the stabilisation system to move the focus by a pixel at a time, to multiply the sensor and capture a super-high resolution image. You'll get a 50MP image (rather than the 20.4MP native resolution of that sensor). There's also a tripod mode that results in an 80MP image - but you'll need greater attention to technique with this mode, ensuring the camera (and subject) is very steady.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-964lgubjzq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>Live ND Shooting is now part of the arsenal too. It creates the effect of a Neutral Density filter up to a strength of 5EV - useful for reducing the incoming light equivalent, enabling longer exposures that may be useful when capturing intentional movement. You may think that reducing light for a small sensor is a bad idea, but for making long(er) exposure shots in bright light it's useful.</p><p>Yet that's the beauty of the technology - in a number of scenarios the E-M1 Mark III does away with the need for extra kit like a tripod or remote release or ND filter. It's about making life easier for the image maker.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere there's Starry Sky AF. If you are into astrophotography, this mode breathes new life into the Olympus system. It really does exactly what it says on the tin: you'll get sharp detail of the stars every time, with ease. No need for manual focus, or for any degree of uncertainty or guesswork.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-6bmfzluozj.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>Olympus continues to up the video game, too. We still have Cine 4K (24fps) and 4K (30fps) video recording, plus slow-motion HD video (up to 120fps).Crucially, there's a flat colour profile and an 'OMLog 400' profile now included, meaning you can get a wonderful colour rendition.</p><p>Pro-Capture mode is perfect if your reactions are not quite up to scratch&nbsp;for action. When the shutter is half-pressed, the camera now buffers up to 35 shots before the shutter is fully pressed for capture, enabling a delayed reaction of up to 3 seconds. &nbsp;</p><p>So, while the E-M1 Mark III has a smaller-scale sensor, there are so many occasions where shots are made possible by Olympus innovation.</p><h2>King of action?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Electronic viewfinder (EVF), 2.36m-dot resolution</li> \n  <li>Fully articulated 3-inch touchscreen</li> \n  <li>121-point phase-detection autofocus system</li> \n  <li>18fps silent shutter with continuous AF</li> \n  <li>Weather-sealed magnesium alloy body</li> \n  <li>400,000 shutter cycles</li> \n  <li>420-shot battery life</li> \n  <li>AF joystick control</li> \n  <li>Dual SD card slot</li> \n </ul><p>Last year Olympus launched a new flagship camera, the E-M1 X. The E-M1 inherits much of the best bits from this camera - but in a smaller form-factor that costs a lot less. Like the E-M1 X, its magnesium alloy body is weather-sealed to an IPX1 rating, making this one tough camera.</p><p>A battery life of 420-shots is par for the course. However, charging via USB is now possible, so you can keep the battery topped up on-the-go between shots by using a power bank. Also, with a vertical handgrip added that life can be doubled. The compatible batteries and handgrip are the same ones used in the E-M1 Mark II, which could make an upgrade kinder on the pocket.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-e-m1-mark-iii-image1-j9pnsjtmiy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>It's the viewing experience where the E-M1 Mark III is let down a little. There has been no update of the 2.36-million dot EVF. With a 0.74x magnification, the view is not quite as crisp or immersive as larger examples like the E-M1 X and Panasonic Lumix G9. That said, it's still a good viewfinder with a solid 120fps refresh rate.</p><p>It's not just the screen's refresh rate that's fast - the E-M1 Mark III gets out of the blocks at great speed. Start it up and the shutter and finder are all ready to respond with no real lag.</p><p>Wade through the AF modes; Eye Detection, Face Detection, Tracking. It all seems to work rapidly and for the best part reliably. For example, Tracking AF sticks to a subject very quickly - and even right up to the near edges of the frame.&nbsp;</p><p>There is some groundwork to put in to ensure the best possible performance, though. For example, if you stick to the entire 121-AF-point array for a single subject, you'll experience focus dropping to the background. The single point or 9-AF point options are more consistently sharp in our experience.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-5zn1axh30s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>We tracked a bike moving at reasonable speed towards and away from the camera. Continuous Tracking AF did lag a fraction, especially closer to the camera, so we're not top of the pile here. However, lateral movement is fine.&nbsp;</p><p>Olympus has implemented an AF joystick. This is a tool that most action photographers want in order to select AF points quickly. Here it feels lovely and operates smoothly, whether viewing on screen or through the viewfinder. A side benefit of the joystick is that the limited functions of the touchscreen are less relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>You also have some seriously impressive high-speed burst rates: 18fps silent shutter with continuous AF (silence is a dream for wildlife photography); and up to 60fps with the electronic shutter.&nbsp;For more intense action sequences, we feel the continuous 'low' burst rate of 9fps (mechanical shutter) is best, delivering consistently sharp AF and longer sequences.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-tyug7mojvr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>Yes, high-speed sequences are handled quickly by the new TruePic IX processor and can be recorded onto a UHS-II SD card. The second SD slot is not UHS-II compatible, so you're relying on slot one for optimum performance.</p><p>Expect approximately 65 frames before the camera slows (when shooting Raw &amp; JPEG - or approximately double that in JPEG only). No sooner have you finished a new sequence and the camera is virtually ready to go again - surely a benefit of smaller file sizes compared to rival cameras?</p><h2>Micro Four Thirds sensor quality</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>20.4MP Micro Four Thirds sensor</li> \n  <li>ISO 200-25,600 (extd. ISO 64)</li> \n  <li>Image Stabilisation to 7.5EV</li> \n  <li>TruePic IX processor</li> \n </ul><p>The elephant in the room is sensor size. We're looking at the same 20.4MP Micro Four Thirds sensor as found in the E-M1 Mark II, with a sensitivity range of ISO 200 to ISO 25,600. Bottom line, there are other cameras for the same price packing larger sensors and more pixels.&nbsp;</p><p>Studio tests analysing resolution and image noise with its impact on detail will show that the E-M1 Mark III does not compete with those larger sensor cameras in like-for-like tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Image noise is relatively absent in images up to ISO 800, though, and it's really only from ISO 3200 that we're starting to lose detail and contrast. Also, default noise reduction for JPEG images is heavy handed in our view.</p><p>However, images are not taken in a lab but in the real world - and that is where the Olympus technology (and vast choice of sharp, wide aperture lenses) comes into play.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-jdczdfrybb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>Image stabilisation up to 7.5EV means a slower shutter speed can be used, where appropriate. Any increase in light intake, such as through increasing shutter speed (or a fast aperture lens), can make a big difference in image quality.&nbsp;</p><p>And what is the point of more pixels if the picture is not sharp in the first place? We feel that the E-M1 Mark III is very reliable across a wide range of scenarios to at least get focusing right and minimise motion blur.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to how images look, Olympus has long given us a beautifully warm and natural colour rendition. The plentiful Art Filters are more suited to the entry-level cameras, but here the natural picture mode with auto white balance are a great combo. Like some other camera systems, in JPEG images there is a small loss of detail in bright magentas/reds.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151867-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-image-samples-image1-k190ble6ga.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><p>We should also note that the evaluative metering system is one of the most reliable out there.

The freezing conditions positively chill you as you look but the individual character of each hut is also manifest.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image5-iamgflzw0n.png\" /></p><h2>Vibrant</h2><p>We love the painted fish on this hut from&nbsp;Sandra Herber's series - it's a splash of vibrant colour in a landscape that's largely monochromatic, and sets off the isolation of the hut really nicely.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image6-6px2l1ughj.png\" /></p><h2>Looming</h2><p>Jonathan Walland's photos of buildings look like something created in a laboratory - he cleverly dials back all colour and focuses only on the building in focus to create a sort of silhouette of their shape and lines, which strips them down to their architectural essentials.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/148387-the-best-tanks-and-armoured-fighting-vehicles-of-all-time\" rel=\"follow\">Some of the best tanks and armoured vehicles of all time</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image7-jjtuflvroc.png\" /></p><h2>Contrast</h2><p>This, another from&nbsp;Jonathan Walland's series, shows that even when a building is constructed with a more modern aesthetic, and curved lines, Walland can still distil it into an essential form, something that looks like the very first sketch its designer might have come up with.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image8-ecidz7cnym.png\" /></p><h2>Big brother</h2><p>José De Rocco's series came third in the Architecture bracket, and features stark images of buildings framed in such a way that their surface details become the story of the image itself.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/146570-17-uses-of-technology-that-make-us-cringe\" rel=\"follow\">17 awful uses of tech that'll make you cringe</a></li> \n </ul><p>Take the side of this supermarket - its red tiling dominating the frame but that security camera also drawing the eye inescapably.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image9-lvkphcbsrj.png\" /></p><h2>Grunge</h2><p>Dione Roach took second place in the Creative category for this series, boldy titled&nbsp;Kill Me With an Overdose of Tenderness, which collages together snapshots from the online world in a punk-rock aesthetic that applies a grungey layer to our sometimes clinical social media channels.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image100-di4qthaypy.png\" /></p><h2>Objets d'art</h2><p>The items photographed by&nbsp;Luke Watson in this series are all recovered from conflicts, some as old as the First World War, and repurposed into rudimentary pinhole cameras.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141060-fantastic-photographic-firsts\" rel=\"follow\">29 fantastic photographic firsts</a></li> \n </ul><p>It's a repurposing that prompts you to think about the object's original intended use, and the creative potential that countless everyday items therefore implicitly carry with them.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152500-cameras-news-the-sony-world-photography-awards-2020-have-been-awarded-to-some-spectacular-images-image111-haxkzyju1t.png\" /></p><h2>Patched up</h2><p>This helmet from&nbsp;Luke Watson's series is another starkly clean image demonstrating how something can be given a new lease of life.

<p>You're looking to buy a mirrorless camera - sometimes called a compact system camera (CSC) - but don't know what to go for? That's not necessarily a surprise, as mirrorless cameras are more diverse and popular than ever before, with more brands, lens mounts and systems mixing up the offerings.</p><p>In this best-of feature, we round up the best mirrorless system cameras of to suit all tastes and abilities. Whether that's based on a budget for a first-time buy, or a larger chunk of cash for a pro-spec full-frame mirrorless model, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/122777-best-dslr-cameras-full-frame-and-interchangeable-lens-cameras-to-buy\" rel=\"\">here's the best DSLR alternatives</a> to consider.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/deals/146122-best-camera-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\"><strong>Best cheap camera deals 2019</strong></a></li> \n </ul><h2>A quick lesson in lenses</h2><p><strong>Lens mount</strong></p><p>First thing's first: cameras don't work in a one-size-fits-all kind of way. Brands like to keep their own heritage and, as such, manufacturers tend to have individual lens mounts. The exceptions are: Micro Four Thirds, supported by Panasonic Lumix G, both Olympus Pen and Olympus OM-D models; and the Leica L mount, which will offer S lenses from Panasonic and lenses from Sigma.</p><p>Elsewhere there are a whole host of considerations, each tied to their respective manufacturers: it's EOS EF-R for Canon's full-frame models and EOS EF-M for its APS-C models; it's E-mount for Sony Alpha (formerly NEX) and A-mount for its full-frame (SLT) cameras; and XF-mount for Fujifilm.</p><p>Others are already past their sell-by date: Pentax gave up on the Q-mount for Pentax Q in 2017; NX-mount for Samsung NX (and specifically the smaller NX-M mount for the NX Mini) are both now defunct; and the 1-mount for the Nikon 1-series was also binned in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Focal length equivalent</strong></p><p>Each lens will have a \"mm\" marking on it, such as 12-24mm, to convey the angle of view it will deliver. The lower the number the wider the angle of view, so more will \"fit in\" to a given scene.</p><p>It's a bit more complex than that, however, as different camera systems have different sensor sizes that give different focal length equivalents, but stick to that rough rule above and you'll have an approximate understanding on what you're getting.</p><h2>Best budget buy</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/139813-cameras-review-panasonic-lumix-gx800-review-image1-czv1pgh9o0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix GX800</h3><p>squirrel_widget_139813</p><p>What the Panasonic Lumix GX800 really gets right is its price proposition. There's a lot of features on offer for its sub-£300 price point, which will see camera keenos flocking to check out this accomplished little mirrorless system.</p><p>Downsides are the lack of any viewfinder option (but then just look at the G80/G85 instead, below), some plasticky build elements, limited battery life, that 12-32mm collapsible lens not being the best, and the odd choice of a microSD card (most cameras use full-size SD, but not here).</p><p>All things considered, however, those above nit-picks are far from major problems. Especially when decent image quality, an autofocus system that'll better almost anything else at this price, a raft of compatible Micro Four Thirds lens options, 4K capture and accessible touchscreen controls use are all par for the course.</p><p><strong>Read our full review: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/panasonic/139813-panasonic-lumix-gx800-review-an-affable-affordable-entry-level-mirrorless-camera\" rel=\"\">Panasonic Lumix GX800</a></p><h2>Best affordable all-rounder</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/138328-cameras-review-panasonic-lumix-g80-review-image1-zjvHIdy3eM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix G80</h3><p>squirrel_widget_138328</p><p>Panasonic has boat loads of great G-series cameras. The one that offers the most bang for your buck is the G80. It's like a mini DSLR in many senses, combining a built-in viewfinder with a vari-angle touchscreen LCD to the rear.&nbsp;</p><p>With a lot of the technology taken from the top-end G-series line, the G80 walks the line between pro and budget. There's 4K video capture, decent image quality and all the control that you could possibly want. One of our favourite features is Pinpoint autofocus.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking for a one-stop-shop then few can offer as much as the G80 for the price.

Its combination of retro design, quality construction, top notch image quality and decent general performance make it a great all-rounder.</p><p>The X-T20's biggest issue is nothing to do with its own performance: it's the presence of the Panasonic Lumix G80 (above), depending on which one you can find for less cash (it's increasingly close).</p><p>But while the Panasonic is like the brains of the mirrorless camera world - it's hugely capable, with 4K modes, Pinpoint autofocus and weather-sealing - the Fuji X-T20 is the heartfelt, retro-styled champ. And sometimes it's better to listen to your heart than your head, right?</p><p><strong>Read our full review: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/140065-fujifilm-x-t20-review-the-retro-touch\" rel=\"\">Fujifilm XT-20 review</a></p><h2>Best small all-rounder</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/139263-cameras-review-sony-a6500-review-image1-proxewb3pl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Sony A6500</h3><p>squirrel_widget_139263</p><p>Smaller than the Panasonic offering, yet still with a built-in viewfinder, the A6500 is a highly accomplished little camera.</p><p>Indeed, you'll struggle to find a mirrorless cameras with quicker autofocus. The A6500 is up there with the best-in-class in this regard, while its processor is hugely capable of backing up its 11fps burst mode figures. Image quality is great, too, while its 4K video capture will appeal to a whole other audience.</p><p>The biggest drawback of the Sony system is its over four-figure asking price. It's really pricey, which is why the Panasonic G80 (above) may appeal more, but for the right user the Sony is certainly worth it. Oh, but its battery life isn't great , so you'll want to carry a spare.</p><p><strong>Read our full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/139263-sony-a6500-review-a-mini-mirrorless-powerhouse\" rel=\"\">Sony A6500 review</a></p><h2>Best DSLR-alternative / prosumer mirrorless</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/142737-cameras-review-panasonic-lumix-g9-lead-image-image1-e8dgkj4gsh.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix G9</h3><p>squirrel_widget_142737</p><p>If you're looking for a DSLR alternative with some added mirrorless benefits then the G9 ticks all the boxes. It's a very impressive bit of kit indeed.</p><p>The G9 offers oodles of appeal by cutting out the typical irks that many mirrorless cameras can present: it's got a huge viewfinder with near-instant startup; a super-fast 20 frames per second (fps) continuous autofocus mode at full resolution; it adds a light-up status LCD screen (which you'll find nowhere else except on a mirrorless Leica); and offers improved battery longevity with up to 920 shots per charge.</p><p>Having used the Lumix G9 with a variety of lenses for two weeks - in both South Africa on safari and Vietnam while travelling - we've come to think that it's perhaps the finest mirrorless cameras that money can buy. Indeed, it's so good that we'd lean away from the Fujifilm X-T2 (see below) in its favour.</p><p><strong>Read our full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/panasonic/142737-panasonic-lumix-g9-review-the-finest-mirrorless-camera-that-money-can-buy\" rel=\"\">Panasonic Lumix G9 review</a>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145646-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t3-review-image1-bktd4euk5c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><h3>Fujifilm X-T3</h3><p>squirrel_widget_145646</p><p>If there's been one inherent weakness for many mirrorless cameras it's their ability to cope with moving subjects. Fuji has tackled this head-on with the X-T3, which is among the best mirrorless cameras for capturing moving subjects.</p><p>Beyond just being good at shooting fast action, the X-T3 is an exceptional all-round camera too. It's well built, looks great, the image quality is that high-quality Fuji standard, and there's all the control and decent lens back-up that you could want. <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/143639-fuji-xh1-review-camera-mirrorless-x-h1\" rel=\"\">We think it even trumps the X-H1</a> in many regards (and the Panasonic G9, above, is better than that Fuji offering anyway).</p><p><strong>Read our full preview: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/145646-fuji-xt3-review-fujifilm-verdict-specs\" rel=\"\">Fuji X-T3 initial review</a>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141141-cameras-review-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-ii-product-shots-image1-rexkqn7c69.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mk II</h3><p>squirrel_widget_141141</p><p>If it's speed you want, it's speed you'll get, with this Olympus capable of capturing up to 18 frames per second.</p><p>Also principal to its success is the built-in image stabilisation - which is perhaps the best sensor-based system we've ever used - and its super-quick reactions across the board, from start-up, to autofocus, burst speed, capture and playback.</p><p>Ultimately, the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II is among the best Micro Four Thirds cameras for advanced photographers shooting moving subjects. That said, the Panasonic Lumix G9 (above) offers an even more compelling 20fps burst alongside a better viewfinder, which will ultimately be more favourable (and it's cheaper than the Olympus to boot!)</p><p><strong>Read our full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/olympus/141141-olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-ii-review-the-most-formidable-olympus-camera-ever\" rel=\"\">Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II review</a></p><h2>Best street shooter</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/124653-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-mirrorless-cameras-2017-the-best-interchangeable-lens-cameras-available-to-buy-today-image8-udfksretno.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Fujifilm X-Pro2</h3><p>squirrel_widget_136158</p><p>The X-Pro2 is a camera for the modern professional.

Our current favourite is the Panasonic, but die-hard videographers may call on Sony's A7S II as the very best model going (something only the Panasonic GH5S can really throw into contention).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/139811-cameras-review-panasonic-lumix-gh5-review-image1-2dbmywt6kq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix GH5</h3><p>squirrel_widget_139811</p><p>The camera world has been moving at a fairly slow pace over the last few of years, with only small gains to be made. If you were to compare the GH5's image quality to the earlier GH4, for example, then the gains aren't that significant.</p><p>But when it comes to video the GH5 offers out-of-this-world top quality. There's 4K capture with 10-bit 4:2:2 output (at 30fps; 60fps is 8-bit 4:2:0) and a host of pro spec features that put it head and shoulders above anything else you can buy at this price point (well, except the company's own GH5S, below)</p><p>Sure, it might be pipped in stills quality by the Fujifilm X-T3 (above), but for video features the Lumix GH5 is still a great choice.</p><p><strong>Read our full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/panasonic/139811-panasonic-lumix-gh5-review-hail-the-4k-king\" rel=\"\">Panasonic Lumix GH5 review</a>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/143125-cameras-review-hands-on-panasonic-lumix-gh5s-image1-tv1zfoeiw6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"561\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix GH5S</h3><p>squirrel_widget_143125</p><p>Here's where things get super specialist. But if you know your stuff then the GH5S will get your salivating at its video prowess.</p><p>The GH5S has a lower-resolution sensor than the GH5 (above), as it's designed with video in mind. That sensor offers dual native ISO, which can deliver a far cleaner image at higher ISO settings - which is great for nighttime and low-light work.</p><p>There's also no image stabilisation system within the camera, which pros with rigs will prefer to avoid any \"jumping\" that can happen when such a system is present.</p><p>It's hard to call the Lumix GH5S a consumer product, but for higher-end users this will be the small-scale, affordable and capable 4K product they've been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read our full preview:</strong> <a

translucent) definiton attests.</p><p>But let's not get stuck down too much regarding the camera's technological make-up, because when it comes to ticking all the pro-level boxes, the A9 has so much right.</p><p>In full flow, it offers 20 frames per second (fps) with no live view black-out, phase-detection AF that covers virtually the whole frame, and a generally reliable Lock-On tracking AF.&nbsp;To back-up this&nbsp;class-leading performance, Sony also has one of the best lens line-ups for sports and wildlife photography.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of image quality the A9 delivers exactly what we would expect: it's a camera that's able to make great images in both bright and low-light conditions, particularly excelling when the conditions are tough.</p><p>It's so good, it asks

like Facebook and YouTube supporting 360-degree photos and videos, it's no surprise to see more 360 cameras coming to market.&nbsp;</p><p>There is now a range of capable cameras available at wildly different budgets. Each has their own appeal, so the choice really comes down to budget and what you want the camera for. Something small you can slip in your pocket and take on a jaunt or an action camera that can survive being dropped, bashed and used underwater?&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at our list of the&nbsp;best VR and 360 cameras available to buy, whatever your budget.&nbsp;</p><h2>Best 360 camera for video capture</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image5-gfbvb7rtk4.jpg\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>GoPro Max</h3><p>squirrel_widget_168074</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>6K spherical video capture capabilities</li>\n  <li>Voice control and live-streaming</li>\n  <li>OverCapture user-friendly video editing system</li>\n  <li>1,600mAh battery</li>\n  <li>Hypersmooth video stabilisation</li>\n </ul><p>When it comes to video, especially action-cam footage, GoPro has always managed to produce incredible results. The GoPro Max is another camera from GoPro making waves.&nbsp;</p><h4>Video capture capabilities</h4><p>This device possibly offers the best 360 video capture capabilities of any device we've seen. Likely because it's capable of capturing&nbsp;6K video at 30fps. Where the GoPro Max really shines though is in usability. <a href=\"https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/gopro-app-overcapture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">GoPro's&nbsp;OverCapture</a> video editing system allows users to easily create brilliant footage from their recordings.&nbsp;</p><p>This&nbsp;OverCapture tech even offers the ability to flatten 360 videos to make them viewable on any device - including TVs and create a \"tiny planet\"-like view&nbsp;or make sharp transitions at certain points.&nbsp;</p><p>The results are something pretty special and set this 360 camera apart from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><h4>Durability and flexibility&nbsp;</h4><p>Like other cameras in the GoPro range, the&nbsp;GoPro Max is a flexible and durable camera. This device is waterproof up to 16 feet and can be used underwater and with some abuse - making it suitable for use with watersports.</p><p>A removable&nbsp;1,600mAh battery and a USB-C port that supports fast charging make it pretty flexible too. A touchscreen even lets you see what you're capturing and widens its appeal.&nbsp;</p><p>360 video makes a lot of sense in extreme sports areas and with the sort of footage GoPro fans will be capturing. It's therefore easy to see why&nbsp;GoPro created the Max (itself a soft reboot of the older Fusion camera) and where it sits in this market. As such, it's well worth considering.</p><p>The&nbsp;GoPro Max offers some of the best results we've seen in terms of capture quality. It's also easy to use with the OverCapture functionality on a smartphone. It boasts a great feature list and impressive specifications, but it does come with a pretty hefty price tag.&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>GoPro's expertise when it comes to action cameras has come to bear brilliantly on the Max — it's great for filming whatever activities you'd want it to, and is also adaptable. When you need 360 footage, it'll produce the goods, but can also film all sorts of other quality video.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>User-friendly video editing system</li>\n  <li>Tripod mounting as standard</li>\n  <li>Waterproof and durable build</li>\n  <li>Excellent footage results</li>\n  <li>Touchscreen so that you can see what you're capturing</li>\n </ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>One of the more expensive 360 camera options</li>\n </ul><h2>Most feature-rich 360 camera</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image6-xh61cbffpi.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><h3>Insta360 One R</h3><p>squirrel_widget_182791</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5.7K 360 capture or 4K wide-angle</li>\n  <li>H.265 encoding with \"advanced image processing\"</li>\n  <li>FlowState Stablisation\" - offers \"gimal-like\" stablisation</li>\n </ul><p>The Insta360 One R is one of those devices that tries to offer you the world on a stick. It's a feature-packed camera that comes in various editions with bundles that include different lenses or attachments and extras. There's even an aerial edition that'll fit certain Mavic drones.</p><p>It comes with an \"invisible\" selfie stick and a multitude of capture options that make things interesting. Everything from night shot capabilities to HDR mode, bullet time, starlapse, timelapse and more. It has a compact frame that can be made waterproof with the accompanying housing.</p><h4>Capture quality</h4>\n <ul>\n  <li>360-degree field of view</li>\n  <li>Upto 5760 x 2880 at 30FPS</li>\n  <li>HDR and standard video modes, timelapse, timeshift, bullet time and more</li>\n  <li>100Mbps video bit rate</li>\n </ul><p>The Insta360 One R offers some impressive capture quality. Considering all the recording options you get, it seems to do a lot of things and does them well.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It also has swappable lenses and different mounting options meaning you can use it to capture all sorts of footage, whatever you're planning on recording. Whether action shots using a helmet mount or chilled out strolls through the country with a selfie stick.&nbsp;</p><p>We enjoy interesting modes like \"bullet time\" where you swing the camera around your head like you're wielding a mace, capturing a surrounding view of yourself and the environment. Other capture options include everything from HDR footage to timelapses.</p><h4>Video and image sharing</h4><p>You can edit it all within the app or the <a href=\"https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-oner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Insta 360 Studio</a> and there's <a href=\"https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/oner/en-us/editing/postedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a detailed guide explaining how</a> to do that. From there you can then easily share it on your favourite social media platform without much fuss.&nbsp;</p><p>In the free video editor, you can add keyframes and move between various views including tiny planet, fish eye, standard view and more. The software isn't as powerful as something like DaVinci Resolve, but it's good enough to allow for editing, speed ramping, tweaking and even cutting out background noise from your audio.&nbsp;</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The Insta360 One R manages to pull off being a jack of all trades without much in the way of compromise. A brilliant little camera with a lot to offer and plenty of highlights too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A multitude of capture modes and footage options</li>\n  <li>Easy to use free editing software</li>\n  <li>Swappable lenses and mounting options</li>\n </ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Some elements of the software and UI can be a faff</li>\n </ul><h2>Most affordable 360 cam</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-samsung-gear-360-image4-mdenb1ktpg.jpg\" /></p><h3>Samsung Gear 360 (2017)</h3><p>squirrel_widget_136768</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>IP53 (Dust and Splash-proof)</li>\n  <li>Various capture modes including video, photo, time-lapse, looping video and landscape HDR</li>\n  <li>1,160 mAh battery</li>\n  <li>Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v4.1, USB 2.0 (Type-C)</li>\n </ul><p>The Samsung Gear 360 is part of the company's \"Gear\" range of smart products designed to accompany the various <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/buyers-guides/samsung/145854-best-samsung-phones\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Samsung flagship phones</a> available. As such, this 360 camera works well with both the Samsung Gear VR (to view the photos) and the latest Samsung phones via <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.gear360manager&amp;hl=en_GB\" rel=\"follow\">the accompanying app</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, the camera is actually pretty capable, easy-to-use and boasts a number of specifications that make it interesting. It's also one of the most affordable 360 cameras available.&nbsp;</p><h4>Capture quality</h4>\n <ul>\n  <li>360-degree field of view</li>\n  <li>4K video capture (up to&nbsp;4096 x 2048 at 24FPS), 15MP photos (5472 x 2736)</li>\n  <li>Micro SD card slot compatible with&nbsp;upto 256GB&nbsp;</li>\n </ul><p>The Samsung Gear 360 uses two 360-degree lenses to capture either 4K video or 15MP images through a variety of capture modes including video, photo, time-lapse, looping video and landscape HDR. The results are fairly good, especially for the price of this camera.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>However, like many of the other 360 cameras out there, the fully stitched images are quite clear close-up, but distant objects are fairly blurry. The stitching itself though&nbsp;is well done and the split between the two images is often barely visible.&nbsp;</p><p>This camera pairs with <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-360/#compatibility\" rel=\"follow noopener\">a range of Samsung phones</a> and will also work with <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Apple iPhones</a>, but frustratingly won't work with other Android devices. If you have a compatible smartphone you can access a live view of the camera for capturing purposes, as well as access to a wide range of different settings and tweaks.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>You don't need a phone to capture images or video if you don't want to though. A small monochrome screen on the device allows you to easily power on the camera and switch between the basic capture modes as well as settings to snap photos on the go.&nbsp;</p><p>We also like the addition of the tripod mount underneath which allows you to put the camera to more adventurous uses if you should feel the need.&nbsp;</p><p>The Samsung Gear 360 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/138727-ip-ratings-what-do-they-actually-mean\" rel=\"follow noopener\">IP53-rated</a>, making it dust and splash proof, but not fully waterproof like the GoPro Max. It is compact and ergonomically well designed though, making it easy to take with you. It's small enough to fit nicely in your pocket and pop it out when you need it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Video and image&nbsp;sharing</h4>\n <ul>\n  <li>130-minute battery life when recording&nbsp;2560 x 1280 at 30fps</li>\n  <li>Sharing via connected Samsung phone</li>\n </ul><p>The Samsung Gear&nbsp;360 captures images and video that can be shared via the app on your smartphone. It can also be accessed, processed, edited and shared on PC or Mac with the accompanying <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/SM-R210NZWABTU%20\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Action Director software</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to a USB-C connection, it's not only easy to quickly charge this camera, but also to easily download the images captured on the MicroSD card. The software can then be used to stitch the captured images into a 360-viewable photo or video and shared from there.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're using the Smartphone app, you can share directly from there. You can also start a live broadcast via Facebook or YouTube too, though obviously the latter requires passing the data from the camera to the phone and then onwards, which results in lower-quality resolutions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Samsung Gear&nbsp;360 is an easy-to-use camera. Although the photo and video results aren't necessarily the best, the price point of this device and flexibility of its features and settings make it pretty appealing.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The stitching of images and videos is also surprisingly impressive and a much speedier process than the Acer Holo 360 - especially when using the Action Director software on PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Quick image and video processing via <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/SM-R210NZWABTU%20\" rel=\"follow\">Action Director software</a></li>\n  <li>USB Type-C charging/interface port</li>\n  <li>Great ergonomics and compact design</li>\n  <li>Includes tripod mount</li>\n </ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Only compatible with Samsung phones and Apple iPhones&nbsp;</li>\n </ul><h2>Most premium 360 camera</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-garmin-virb-360-image9-vj3uohi68g.jpg\" /></p><h3>Garmin VIRB 360</h3><p>squirrel_widget_174818</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Tripod mounts and grips included</li>\n  <li>Four microphones for spatial audio recording</li>\n  <li>Single and dual lens capture</li>\n  <li>Various photo modes including&nbsp;single shot, burst, timelapse, 360-degree front and back</li>\n  <li>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC connections</li>\n  <li>Waterproof to 10 metres</li>\n  <li>Built-in sensors for G-Metrix data overlays</li>\n </ul><p>The Garmin VIRB 360 is simultaneously both one of the most expensive and most interesting 360 cameras on our list.</p><p>This camera is an impressive little box of tricks. Packed into the fat little body is some high-end tech. This includes not only two 360-degree lenses capable of capturing 5.7K footage and 15MP photos but also a mass of other tech too. There's&nbsp;GPS, GLONASS, barometer and accelerometer sensors designed to capture data as you record and four&nbsp;microphones for spatial audio recording too.&nbsp;</p><p>This gives you the power to create some pretty impressive footage using this camera, not just in quality, but also in the information you include.

Especially if you're planning on doing something sporty with the camera.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The&nbsp;Garmin VIRB 360 is also designed to be rough and rugged.

Still, it shows it's capable of recording in wet environments and will stand up to some abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>In the box, Garmin has included two attachments which allow you to connect a tripod using the usual screw mount. A small and capable, hand-held tripod is also included which allows for some nifty and steady shooting if you can find somewhere to stand it.&nbsp;</p><p>This camera also includes another attachment which allows you to connect the camera to GoPro style mounts - opening up a world of possibilities for attaching to helmets, suction cups, handlebars and much more besides.&nbsp;</p><p>Capturing is as simple as pressing a button on top to take photographs and pushing a slide on the side to record video. An LCD screen on top gives you easy access to change basic settings and flip between capture modes too. The result is an easy-to-use camera that's a joy to play with.&nbsp;</p><p>Voice control is also an option saying \"OK, Garmin\" allows you to give verbal commands. You can then ask the camera to start/stop recording, take photos and more besides.&nbsp;</p><h3>Capture quality</h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>5.7K/30FPS, unstitched or 4K/30FPS, stitched</li>\n  <li>15 MP photo capture</li>\n  <li>Automatically stitched photos and videos</li>\n </ul><p>We were suitably impressed with the capture quality of the Garmin VIRB 360. It's not surprising that with such impressive specs under the hood, this camera is capable of not only capturing high-quality video but images too.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As well as recording 360-degree video at a maximum of 5.7K, the Garmin VIRB 360 also has a number of other capture options that include standard stills from either lens, burst mode, timelapse capture and slow-motion too.&nbsp;</p><p>It's easy to grab imagery and video footage with just a couple of clicks and the camera automatically does all the legwork in processing what you've snapped too.&nbsp;</p><p>We did experience some minor issues with stitching occasionally with photos (people missing parts of their heads) but this is fairly common on these sorts of cameras and is often forgivable. Otherwise, the quality of the footage and imagery is pretty reasonable.&nbsp;</p><p>None of these cameras is yet mind-blowing in terms of the end results. Despite the specifications, the technology is not quite there yet and you can easily see the degradation in quality the further into the distance you look, but this camera still has a lot going for it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Garmin VIRB includes spherical stabilisation capabilities and footage can be edited to reduce shake and wobble with a simple couple of clicks. The results are remarkable too. It's the ease-of-use, brilliant capture capabilities and flexibility where this 360 camera really shines.&nbsp;</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, the camera is also capable of recording for up to an hour on a single charge. <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/562010#accessories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spare batteries and dual chargers</a> are available to purchase to keep on recording if you so wish too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Video and image&nbsp;sharing</h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>Spherical stabilisation capabilities</li>\n  <li>Free desktop editing software</li>\n  <li>Mobile app for settings tweaks and sharing on the go</li>\n </ul><p>For us, one of the highlights of the&nbsp;Garmin VIRB 360 is almost certainly the way it handles stitching of images and videos. This processing is done automatically on the device meaning it's almost seamless.</p><p></p><p>You can choose to use the <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/153276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">iOS or Android app</a> to share content while you're out and about or use <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/573412\" rel=\"follow\">the free desktop software</a> to edit footage once you're back home. But even importing photos and videos from the device onto your PC or Mac you'll find their already stitched and ready for viewing or sharing to Facebook, YouTube or wherever else you wish to use them.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a Google Cardboard functionality built right into the app too, meaning you can pop your phone into a VR headset and view footage you've captured in full 360-degree glory.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot of flexibility here. Apple users can even live stream via the smartphone app, so there are plenty of different ways to capture and share content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Garmin VIRB 360 is one of the best 360-degree cameras we've seen. It's flexible, capable and powerful. We loved the automatic stitching and the easy-to-use accompanying app and software that make it a breeze to easily create and share your content.&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Stand-out features include powerful video stabilisation, brilliant G-Metrix data overlays, easy editing and spatial audio recording.&nbsp;</p><p>For us though, the best feature is likely the one you'll take for granted - the automatic stitching and processing. This is seamless and results in content that can be viewed and shared as soon as it's exported.&nbsp;This means it can be seen without any dull waiting around for the camera to process the footage beforehand like we experienced with other cameras we've tested.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Automatic on-camera stitching and footage processing</li>\n  <li>Easy-to-use interface</li>\n  <li>Simple pairing and controls via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC</li>\n  <li>Free app and desktop software makes editing and sharing a breeze</li>\n  <li>Waterproofing and rugged design</li>\n  <li>Flexible mounts and adapters mean you can potentially stick it to anything</li>\n </ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>&nbsp;Hefty price tag</li>\n </ul><h2>Most durable 360 camera</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-nikon-keymission-360-image10-cr7i8voay1.jpg\" /></p><p>&nbsp;squirrel_widget_174817</p><h3>Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360</h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>1,050mAh Lithium-Ion battery</li>\n  <li>Approximately two hours of charging time</li>\n  <li>198-gram bodyweight</li>\n  <li>Bluetooth 4.1/IEEE 802.11b/g Wi-Fi</li>\n  <li>microSD/microSDHC/microSDXC memory card compatible</li>\n  <li>NIKKOR 1.6 mm f/2.0 lenses</li>\n </ul><p>If an action camera and a 360 camera got together and had a baby, this would be the result. The&nbsp;Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 features a rugged, durable and robust body housing some capable&nbsp;NIKKOR 1.6 mm f/2.0 lenses and the ability to capture UHD 4K footage or 23.9MP 360-degree stills.</p><p>If you're into extreme sports or want a 360 camera that's capable of functioning underwater, in snowy/freezing conditions or just stand up to rough handling then this might well be it.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/138727-ip-ratings-what-do-they-actually-mean\" rel=\"follow\">IP6X and IPX8 rated</a> meaning this camera is capable of withstanding a multitude of environments and rough handling. It's&nbsp;dustproof,&nbsp;shockproof, weatherproof and waterproof too.</p><p>The camera's durable body allows it to be dropped up to two metres, used underwater up to 30 metres for 60 minutes and resist temperatures&nbsp;ranging from -10°C to 40°C. All these specs certainly make it an ideal candidate for extreme sports use or a great alternative if you're a bit of a clumsy buffoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.europe-nikon.com/en_GB/products/action_cameras/keymission_360_missions.page#accessories\" rel=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple accessories available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including everything from suction cups to chest mounts, selfies sticks, grips and more. Meaning you can use this 360 camera for pretty much anything you can imagine. It also supports a standard tripod mount, making it flexible and easy to use with a variety of mounts and attachments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This camera also comes with a build-it-yourself cardboard headset you can use with your smartphone to view the images and videos in VR - for a more immersive view of the footage you've captured too. </span></p><h3>Capture quality</h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>Standard, timelapse, looping and superlapse video capture</li>\n  <li>7744 x 3872 still images (approx 23.9MP)</li>\n  <li>MP4 (Video: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, Audio: AAC stereo)</li>\n  <li>2160/24p, 1920/24p, 960/30p, 640/120p, 320/240p video capture</li>\n </ul><p>The&nbsp;Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 captures images up to a resolution of&nbsp;7744 x 3872 (approx 23.9MP) and video at a maximum of&nbsp;2160p at 24 frames per second. The results are fairly impressive and comparable with the other high-end cameras on this list.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This 360 camera offers a number of capture modes including standard, timelapse, looping and Superlapse video capture. It also supports a self-timer which allows you to set up the camera ready for photographs or video and capture footage just the way you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Built-in Vibration Reduction technology uses information about the camera's position in the world to counter camera shake and stabilise imagery. This, in theory, should result in smooth video performance and clearer photos. Our experience during testing shows video performance that isn't quite as stable as we've seen with the Garmin VIRB, but this camera is a lot more affordable.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Like the Garmin VIRB, this camera has separate buttons for video and photo capture, making it easy to ensure you're pressing the right button for the results you're after. The video button doubles as the power button, which can make things a bit fiddly at times but otherwise it's fairly user-friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Video and image&nbsp;sharing</h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>Automatic in-camera stitching</li>\n  <li>Self-timer capable</li>\n  <li>Auto-download options</li>\n </ul><p>A highlight to the design of the&nbsp;Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 is the power under the hood. This camera supports automatic in-camera stitching that processes photographs and videos seamlessly.</p><p>You can then use the accompanying app to download captured footage directly to your smartphone or plug it into a computer to access it from there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 is compatible with the&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SnapBridge 360/170 app for </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapbridge-360-170/id1162513075?mt=8\" rel=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nikon.snapbridge.sb360170\" rel=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android devices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This app allows you to connect to the camera to access and tweak settings, download images and work the camera as a remote control.&nbsp;We found the app could be a bit flakey and not as user-friendly as others we've tried, but automatic pairing via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is a breeze. There are some occasional connection issues, but nothing that prevents you from using the camera manually.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had some issues with video capture during our testing. Some experimenting combined with a thorough reading of the manual revealed that you need a microSDXC memory card with an SD Speed Class rating of 6 or faster in order to properly capture video footage. Lesser rated cards lead to recordings stopping unexpectedly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app allows you to manually or automatically download images and videos from the camera to your phone. They can then be shared from your phone straight to social media. This sharing is fairly easy, but sometimes held back by the problems with app connectivity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downloading to your computer and sharing from there is also easy and the fact the stitching is automatic really makes life a lot simpler. There's also a desktop utility for basic editing and tweaks available to <a href=\"http://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/download/sw/79.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">download for free</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Nikon&nbsp;KeyMission 360 is an interesting option for those looking for a durable and rugged 360-degree camera. It's built to withstand all sorts of punishment and weather situations making it perfect for extreme sports in all manner of conditions. We found the video capture to not be quite as good as other 360 cameras we've tested. Video stabilisation isn't as good as the Garmin VIRB, for example, but the price of this camera makes it far more accessible.&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This camera is also flexible and able to work with a wide variety of accessories and mounts. Meaning you can put it to use in whatever activity you're planning on. It takes pretty impressive 360-degree imagery and is a really capable device for the money.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Automatic in-camera stitching of photos and video</li>\n  <li>Ability to download images directly to your phone</li>\n  <li>Durable design that's&nbsp;dustproof,&nbsp;shockproof, weatherproof and waterproof too</li>\n  <li>Affordable price point compared to other 360 cameras on this list</li>\n </ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>No live streaming capabilities</li>\n  <li>Smartphone app connection is flaky and unreliable</li>\n  <li>In-app settings are somewhat limited</li>\n </ul><p>&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 11:52:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image7-m10giyzos4.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"f16d60031787d51e4a54f35efc1d255e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-50-723_095fb861204cac8b.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":55663,"destBytes":34236,"author":"Adrian Willings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image7-m10giyzos4.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-50-723_095fb861204cac8b.webp","https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image5-gfbvb7rtk4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/137301-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-360-camera-lead-image6-xh61cbffpi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-samsung-gear-360-image4-mdenb1ktpg.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-garmin-virb-360-image9-vj3uohi68g.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/assets/images/144544-cameras-buyer-s-guide-nikon-keymission-360-image10-cr7i8voay1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209018},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Canon EOS R5 vs EOS R6: What's the difference?","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/canon/152866-xx-embargo-xx","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152866-cameras-news-vs-canon-image2-1wcbgd8ml7.jpg?v1\"> <p>Canon had been teasing that its EOS R5 mirrorless camera was coming - it <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/canon/151073-canon-eos-r5-8k-ibis-release\" rel=\"\">was first made public in February 2020</a> - but it arrives alongside an EOS R6 too. That's a bit of a surprise! Two cameras, but two very different prospects, so what's the difference between the EOS R5 and R6?</p><h2>Best for</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: Magnesium alloy body, 135.8 x 97.5 x 88mm, 738g</li> \n  <li>EOS R6: Polycarbonate body, 138.4 x 97.5 x 88.4mm, 680g</li> \n  <li>Both cameras: Full-frame sensor with EOS RF mount</li> \n  <li>Both cameras: Built-in image stabilisation (IBIS)</li> \n </ul><p>The EOS R5 as the ultra-high resolution solution with 8K video capability. Think of it as the mirrorless version of the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/135439-canon-eos-5ds-review-resolution-revelation\" rel=\"\">EOS 5DS DSLR</a>, ideal for landscapes and highly detailed work.</p><p>The EOS R6 doesn't deliver the same resolution or video potential as the R5 - but it's a very fast camera, with action and low-light in mind. Think of this more as the mirrorless version of the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/131682-canon-eos-7d-mark-ii-review-king-of-quality\" rel=\"\">EOS 7D II</a> (albeit with a larger sensor).</p><p>Both cameras feature Canon's built-in image stabilisation system, which is a first for the brand. By using a combination of sensors in the cameras' bodies in combination with lens-based stabilisation (where applicable) the Japanese company is claiming up to 8-stops of stabilisation can be delivered. That's a huge helping hand.</p><p>While both cameras are also weather-sealed, the R5 is a magnesium alloy build, so it's heavier, as the EOS R6 uses a polycarbonate body instead.</p><h2>Resolution</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor<br> \n    <ul> \n     <li>ISO 100-51,200 (102,400 expanded)</li> \n    </ul> </br></li> \n  <li>EOS R6: 20.1-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor \n   <ul> \n    <li>ISO 100-102,400 (204,800 expanded)</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n </ul><p>Here's the biggest difference on paper. The EOS R5 has a 45 million pixel full-frame sensor. Canon says, thanks to it being part of the new system, it's capable of resolving more detail than any Canon camera before it - and that includes higher-resolution DSLRs too - because of the optical potential of the RF lens mount.</p><p>The EOS R6 has a 20.1 million pixel full-frame sensor, so less than half the resolution. That's still heaps of pixels though, more than many will need for most types of work. And having lower resolution can be a benefit when churning through dozens of files at a time.</p><h2>Performance</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: -6EV low-light autofocus / EOS R6: -6.5EV</li> \n  <li>Both cameras: <br> \n    <ul> \n     <li>12fps mechanical shutter (20fps electronic)</li> \n     <li>Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus</li> \n     <li>Digic X processor</li> \n    </ul> </br></li> \n </ul><p>In terms of performance both cameras offer a lot that's the same. Their sensors are the same physical size. The stabilisation system equally effective.</p><p>Both also represent the first appearance of Canon's second-generation Dual Pixel CMOS AF system. If you've used a Canon before you might have heard about this: it first appeared on the 70D DSLR, showing off what was possible on screen-based autofocus. In its 2020 guise, however, it's quicker than ever before - as fast as 0.05s, Canon asserts - and also features eye/face/body tracking and animal detection.</p><p>Not that the EOS R5 and R6 are just for shooting your pets. Both cameras offer deep learning, so the more you shoot subjects, the more context the camera will have to understand your methods. Sure, dogs and cats are the dominant species it's programmed to recognise, but also birds - including birds in flight - will be a huge deal for a large swathe of enthusiasts.</p><p>The latest Digic X processor also means considerable speed: both can clack away at 12fps (mechanical shutter) at full resolution. So, yes, the EOS R5 can capture 540 million pixels of data in a second in that regard (it's actually more as a 20fps electronic shutter also runs at full resolution, meaning 900MP can be buffered within a second).</p><p>The EOS R6, on account of its larger 'pixels' on that sensor, is also more astute to low-light conditions. It can autofocus as low as -6.5EV, which is beyond moonlight conditions - more like candlelight really. The R5 isn't far behind, though, at -6EV, making it half a stop less capable there.</p><h2>Screen &amp; Viewfinder</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: \n   <ul> \n    <li>LCD: 3.2-inch, 2.1m-dot, vari-angle mount</li> \n    <li>EVF: 0.5in, 5.76m-dot 120fps refresh rate</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>EOS R6: \n   <ul> \n    <li>LCD: 3-inch, 1.62m-dot, vari-angle mount</li> \n    <li>EVF: 0.5in, 3.69m-dot, 120fps refresh</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n </ul><p>In sync with its ultra-high resolution, the EOS R5 also offers the higher resolution viewfinder, offering a massive 5.76 million dots. That makes it 1.92m pixels (1600 x 1200; as each dot describes one of the red, green and blue channels used to create one white pixel). Still, there's nothing more resolute out there in the consumer market.</p><p>By comparison the EOS R6 has a lower resolution offering, but it's still massively resolute at 3.69m-dots (1.23m pixels). Both offer 120 frames per second refresh rate too, for the most accurate to-eye view, so you don't miss a moment.</p><p>Both cameras feature vari-angle LCD screens for creative composition. The R5's is a little larger and more packed with pixels.</p><h2>Video Credentials</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: Maximum capture - 8K at 30/25/24fps</li> \n  <li>EOS R6: Maximum capture - 4K at 60/50/30/25/24fps</li> \n  <li>EOS R5: Dual cards (1x CF Express, 1x SD (UHS-II))</li> \n  <li>EOS R6: Dual cards (2x SD (UHS-II))</li> \n </ul><p>The headline feature of the EOS R5 is its ability to capture 8K video (DCI 17:9, UHD 16:9 using H.265 compression and 4:2:2 10-bit onto card). This is with a slight crop - Canon tells us the camera captures at 35MP per frame - at up to 30 frames per second.</p><p>The EOS R6 maxes out at 4K60p, but that's still impressive. The EOS R5 also offers this - but with 4K120 as an option to make quarter-time slow-mo editing a breeze.</p><p>Both cameras also offer Full HD at 120fps, Canon Log for grading, and clean HDMI out to 4K60 maximum (potentially due to the HDMI standard).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>EOS R5: £4,199.99, sales from 30 July 2020</li> \n  <li>EOS R6: £2,499.99, sales from 27 August 2020</li> \n </ul><p>So there you have it, two big deal pro-spec cameras with a different target user in each case.</p><p>Want the ultra-high resolution and/or 8K capture? The R5 will set you back £4,200 in the UK, arriving late July. Add an RF lens and you'll need deep pockets.</p><p>The R6 is £2,500 and will arrive later in the year, from late August. Hardly small change, but this looks like an all-round EOS R that, with the right lens attached, will become Canon's 2020 focus.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 12:01:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152866-cameras-news-vs-canon-image2-1wcbgd8ml7.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"cb930e76c1363d99c942221d7109960f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-665_247fea6859ae19e9.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":68257,"destBytes":45214,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152866-cameras-news-vs-canon-image2-1wcbgd8ml7.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-665_247fea6859ae19e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209016},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"The most famous ghost photographs ever taken","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141224-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"580\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/141224-cameras-feature-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken-image1-ksgkjn7rfa.jpg?v1\"> <p>Ghosts, the paranormal and the supernatural have always been debated.

The entrepreneur in him turned this into a business, where members of the public would have their portrait exposed with an image of a dead relative.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141224-cameras-news-feature-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken-image3-a1ozzfjca8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"487\" /></strong></p><h2>Lord Combermere - 1891</h2><p>This image taken of the library at Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, England by Sybell Corbett clearly shows a figure sitting in the chair on the left.

If you don’t believe us, imagine Nirvana’s Nevermind cover with the baby lying on a rug instead of swimming in a pool.</p><p>Stock photo libraries are packed with thrilling underwater shots, but there are lots of gems on Flickr, in Wikimedia and in other libraries too, and you can often use those photos in your own creations too.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/drones/news/145720-astounding-aerial-photos-or-amazing-abstract-art\" rel=\"follow\">Astounding aerial photos or amazing abstract art?</a></li> \n </ul><p>Here are some of the most astounding underwater photos we’ve seen; some are astounding because of the moment they captured; others because of the stories of their subjects, and still others because of what they say about what we humans have done to so many species.</p><p>Please note that the last photo may not be appropriate for younger viewers.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image7-7qxno5rxvj.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Polar Bear</h2><p>Not everything you see underwater lives underwater. Visitors like this polar bear are bad news for seals, because they’re looking for their dinner: for many seals this face may be the last thing they see, as it’s attached to a body weighing as much as 450Kg. Polar bears are yet another species suffering because of humans: climate change is destroying the ice on which they live, and they were classified as a threatened species by the US in 2008.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image10-qdparrkatu.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><h2>Grey Shark</h2><p>Greek-based photographer has made good use of colour in this photo of a grey shark: it looks a lot more sinister than it actually is, because the grey shark isn’t really dangerous to humans unless you wear a swimsuit made of raw meat. Like many marine photographs this one has a sad undercurrent, because like many sharks the grey shark is suffering from declining numbers after years of commercial fishing: while they’re protected species, illegal fishing still occurs.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image2-nljsk14rbe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Humboldt Penguin</h2><p>Guichard is from London, but you won’t see many Humboldts around there: it’s native to South America, although this particular shot was taken in a bird park in France. You probably guessed that from the background colour: underwater shots in relatively small enclosures tend to be much greener than ones taken in the great outdoors. Nevertheless it’s a superb shot, capturing some really excellent side-eye from its subject.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image1-kf10u9wnd4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Blue Dragon-Glaucus Atlanticus</h2><p>Technically this photo is only slightly underwater, as its subject was washed up into a rock pool –&nbsp;but we’re including it because it’s a great example of how otherworldly so many marine creatures can be. This little blue beauty is better known as a sea swallow, blue sea slug or Lizard Nudibranch, which would be an excellent stage name for someone in a band. It’s a small, blue sea slug that floats upside down in water; the blue colouring is camouflage so that it blends in with the blue of water, while the underwater side is silvery-grey. Don’t pick one up if you see one: they deliver a very painful sting.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image5-1rt9t5r8qf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Seal Underwater</h2><p>The NOAA is the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the scientific agency that concentrates on the oceans and the atmosphere. Its Flickr feed is full of amazing images like this one, taken on Hawaii’s Pearl and Hermes reef. We love it because it captures the playful curiosity of the seal really well. This particular seal is a young monk seal, one of two remaining types of monk seal: the third, the Caribbean monk seal, is extinct. This chap is a Hawaiian monk seal, the only seal native to Hawaii and sadly yet another name on the endangered species list.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image3-mnbwajchf7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Humpback Whale</h2><p>This beautiful photo of a humpback whale inspecting a diver is all over the internet –&nbsp;and sadly it’s usually posted without credit on wallpaper sites, free photo sites and so on. Once again we’re in the good hands of the NOAA, and this photo helps communicate the scale and majesty of this extraordinary creature. Some humpbacks can grow as long as 16 metres and weigh up to 30 metric tons, which is all the more incredible when you hit YouTube for videos of them hurling themselves into the air. This is one creature you really don’t want belly flopping onto your pedal.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image11-jf2bu8nwct.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>A Magnificent Siphonophore</h2><p>If we didn’t trust the NOAA we’d think they’d made this one in a 3D modelling app. The wondrously coloured Siphonophore is a Cnidaria, which is a group of creatures that includes coral and jellyfish such as the infamous Portuguese Man O’ War, and some of them are incredibly big: specimens as long as 40 metres have been discovered. The most colourful ones live in the deepest waters and some are even bioluminescent, glowing when disturbed. They’re predators but they’re also very vulnerable as they break very easily.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image13-mvhtiuqzw8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Underwater Woman</h2><p>Let’s have some art. This striking image by Engin Akyurt is our favourite in a series of underwater shots: we like the composition, the stillness of the model and the contrast between the deep black of the background and the bright red of the model’s dress. Stock photo libraries contain quite a few arty underwater shots – for example, Adobe Stock has a selection of women in brightly coloured clothes and of couples swimming while wearing formal clothes –&nbsp;but we prefer this one: it does more with less.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-14-astounding-underwater-photos-image1-70otgbrzfk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Purple and Pink Jellyfish</h2><p>Aren’t jellyfish weird? This could be a space alien, or the pattern made by something leaking ink into water. It’s a brilliantly colourful image by the very versatile Tim Mossholder, whose photos often make great use of colour as in this photo. We don’t know what particular species this jellyfish is, but the combination of purple and pink usually spells bad news for its prey and of any humans unlucky enough to get too close.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image14-ru5aazfu8g.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Scuba Diver near Brown Turtle</h2><p>We love all photos of turtles because of their fantastically unimpressed expressions, but we particularly like this one because Tom Fisk’s use of perspective makes it look like the diver is approaching a turtle that’s much bigger than he is. The picture was shot off Komodo Island in Indonesia, which is home to five species of sea turtles –&nbsp;and while this particular turtle isn’t a giant, they can grow up to 2m long and can weigh up to 590kg.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image6-hfyjpsrykc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Pink and Brown Jellyfish</h2><p>Kalisinski has taken some beautiful shots in the warm, clear waters around Mallorca, and this close shot of an otherworldly jellyfish is great: it’s captured not just the weird blobbiness of its subject but the floating tendrils it uses to catch its meals. Although Kalisinski doesn’t name the jellyfish we think it’s Pelagia Noctiluca, a relatively small and quite unusual sight in the Majorcan waters but one you don’t want to get on the wrong side of: those tentacles can cause pain, burning and muscle cramps.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image9-qbemfov05q.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Red Jellyfish</h2><p>There’s weird, and then there’s Red Jellyfish weird. This luminous lovely looks like a visitor from another planet, and we’d love to know who took the photo, where they took it and what particular kind of jellyfish this is. Sadly Pixabay can only tell us that it was shot in 2013 on a Panasonic DMC-FZ200, which isn’t really very helpful.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image4-ivbjitgjy2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Man in Water</h2><p>Who needs extraordinary creatures when you can get a scuba diver to blow some bubbles from his mask? This unattributed shot from Pixabay works brilliantly because it’s free of context: we can make up the entire backstory and imagine he’s a spy, or he’s just spotted a really big and angry shark.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image12-z4ezldg1mr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Isla Mujeres</h2><p>There’s something haunting about man-made things that weren’t designed to live at the bottom of the sea, and the photo sites are packed with fascinating photos of shipwrecks and other vehicles that ended up where they weren’t intended. But as interesting as they are, we’re more drawn to the ruins of architecture and of amazing things like these sunken statues from the Mexican island of Isla Mujeres. It looks like the aftermath of a tragedy but it’s actually a modern art museum, which is pretty astounding.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147200-cameras-feature-stunning-underwater-photos-that-will-take-your-breath-away-image15-ng9u387pak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"689\" height=\"459\" /></p><h2>Sea Turtle in fishing net</h2><p>Our final photograph is the saddest: taken by Greenpeace photographer Salvatore Barbera, aka Capitan Giona, it’s the body of a turtle drowned by a fishing net. While much fishing is of course environmentally responsible it still has its victims, and illegal overfishing has brought some species to the very brink of extinction. But it’s not just fishing that threatens marine life. Pollution, especially in the form of plastics, is taking a heavy toll too.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a

preconceived notions of what life looked like on the frontier and in towns and cities.</p><p>We've been trawling through its list of photographs for weeks now, gathering together some of the most interesting and arresting shots, like those below.&nbsp;</p><p><img

for lunch</h2><p>There's nothing like heading out for a picnic in the shade of what is a frankly enormous cactus - the sort of cactus you remember from Looney Tunes. These guests of the garrison at Fort Thomas in Arizona look like they're having a delightful day, despite the guns everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image3-slsk4um6jq.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rudimentary</h2><p>It might not be easy to make out at first, but these men are actually gathered for the solemn occasion of a game of poker - it looks like they've got plenty of work to do, but there's never really a bad time to sit down for a few hands, right?</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/144672-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house\" rel=\"follow\">How to be an Instagram travel sensation without leaving the house</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image4-3zvixli0rn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hillside views</h2><p>This is another image where it might not be immediately obvious what's actually going on - it's recreation, again, although with a side of skillful practise, as these men work on some target practise with their firearms.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image5-tmcvkbjhib.jpg\" /></p><h2>Water, water everywhere</h2><p>This photo shows that getting water circulating around a new town was hardly a simple matter (not that we'd assume it would be). The water tower being erected here in Oklahoma would be a key part of the initial infrastructure for the area.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image6-iquomw24pm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hustle and bustle</h2><p>It's amazing to us that this photograph was taken in the same year as the last, 1893 - it demonstrates just how far ahead some territories could be based on immigration and growth. This bustling cotton market is a far cry from the badlands it once occupied.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/news/149572-then-vs-now-video-games-through-the-decades\" rel=\"follow\">Then vs now: Video games through the decades</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image7-isprz7gf1s.jpg\" /></p><h2>Someone's got to build it</h2><p>Of course, those towns don't just pop up out of nowhere - they had to be built, and before the days of industrial tools and automation that meant hard work and an absolutely huge bucket of elbow grease.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image8-ywvsju591a.jpg\" /></p><h2>Family life</h2><p>This photograph showcases another side to the American West - the family life, in a house that's clearly recently built, and to be fair is nice and chunky, giving plenty of space. The photo's a little underexposed, giving one side of the house that menacing dark look, which we think increases the image's impact.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141224-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken\" rel=\"follow\">The most famous ghost photographs ever taken</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image9-kijwg6oruw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Business goes on</h2><p>A key part of the growth of these towns is, of course, the arrival of business and commerce, and in the early days many businesses would have to cater to multiple diverse needs. If you had a supply of wood, for example, you might set up shop selling both furniture and coffins, as this shop has.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image100-xoh2rkfbqn.jpg\" /></p><h2>A sight for sore eyes</h2><p>Where people settle, food follows, and people will almost always be interested in spending their disposable income on some food they don't have to prepare themselves. It might be a little strong to call this a restaurant, but the English Kitchen certainly looks like an early one.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/152226-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings\" rel=\"follow\">Modern politicians fantastically re-imagined in famous portrait paintings</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image111-qfunjcxsrg.jpg\" /></p><h2>I am the law</h2><p>You couldn't necessarily rely on having a huge list of lawyers to choose from if you wanted some legal work done back then, but you'd hopefully be able to find help from the likes of J. W. Craig and others who ironed out disputes over land in particular.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image122-mev4qbsxp9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cosy</h2><p>Another delightful picture of a place that must have been treasured by many, The Bijou saloon would indeed look like a jewel if you were particularly thirsty for a drink - although we're amused to see how tiny it is given how many people are stood outside it!</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/147588-amazing-images-of-our-moon\" rel=\"follow\">Amazing images of our moon in all shapes and sizes</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image133-ajtkk8ddui.jpg\" /></p><h2>Photo day</h2><p>Another great group shot, this is a reminder that growing up in the West still meant going to school, unless you were really rural - this shot of a class full of kids is a great one that echoes down to the similar class photographs still being taken all over the world today.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image144-xwizsacmpd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Airs and graces</h2><p>This is about as fancy a building as we've seen in the Archive from this period, photographed in around 1897 or 1898, and it's no surprise to learn that it's the home of an early university, which would want to house its students in something a little more sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/140473-best-internet-optical-illusions-you-won-t-believe-your-eyes\" rel=\"follow\">The very best internet optical illusions around: You won't believe your eyes</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image155-96nxpus2li.jpg\" /></p><h2>Quite a clan</h2><p>This image shows another type of educational institution - a local church's sunday school in Oklahoma, which explains why everyone's dressed up quite so fancy. It's a diverse group and shows the sort of communities that would spring up and centre around faith.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image166-vi19zfgpyh.jpg\" /></p><h2>Vice</h2><p>Faith couldn't repel all vices, though, and gambling was an early arrival in the United States, becoming a staple for movies about the West, too. This table's playing Faro, which isn't quite so popular anymore, but still feels characteristic of the feel of a saloon.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/151711-best-zoom-backgrounds-fun-virtual-backgrounds-for-zoom-meetings\" rel=\"follow\">Best Zoom backgrounds: Fun virtual backgrounds for Zoom meetings</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image177-ywacn0nqut.jpg\" /></p><h2>Beachside</h2><p>How's that for an imposing location? We can't help but feel that building such a huge structure quite so close to ocean is asking for trouble, but it doesn't half look picturesque. This was taken near San Francisco in 1902, and we're really fond of the choice to have the family outing in the foreground to lend a sense of scale.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image188-voftlkmc2r.jpg\" /></p><h2>Patience personified</h2><p>This cow looks like it's fairly used to having to cart around the youngsters on its back, but that doesn't make it any less impressive. They look like they're having a whale of a time, and it's a lovely image of a happy time.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/148290-fantastic-street-artist-transforms-the-world-with-pixel-art\" rel=\"follow\">Fantastic street artist transforms the world with incredible pixel art</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image199-2k1tbxwxgj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rustic</h2><p>This church is a great reminder that not all buildings at this time were something you could call impressive - it's got a character to it, for sure, but also looks more than a little rustic. The scorching heat of the New Mexico day is almost palpable, too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image20-jf1tklhzbc.jpg\" /></p><h2>The high street</h2><p>In many small towns across the country, this is what a high street looked like a for a very long time - some shops with porches, many without, and huge lettering on signs to let you know where to head to pick up your supplies.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152449-cameras-news-living-in-the-old-west-photographs-from-the-birth-of-the-united-states-image21-jtvfpxnozk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Shamrock Saloon</h2><p>We've seen plenty of images of saloons in this collection, and our final image is another, showcasing the Shamrock Saloon, which looks to also be advertising itself as a restaurant if you were feeling brave. It's just a shame for the owner that his face is shadowed out of the image!&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/152215-photos-from-old-west-american\"

photos","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/151839-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\"

<p>Sony's annual photography awards are always a superb excuse to drink in some absolutely unbelievable photographs, spanning all sorts of categories and subject matters, and the 2020 shortlist is no exception to that rule.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/151442-stunning-photos-from-the-national-sony-world-photography-awards-2020\" rel=\"follow\">57 stunning photos from the National Sony World Photography Awards 2020</a></li> \n </ul><p>That list of contenders was recently unveiled for the Open category of the awards, which is the section that's open to all comers and entrants. The winners won't be unveiled until early June, but until then we've got plenty of time to enjoy browsing the amazing selection of photos.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image1-un5afekgbi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Clean lines</h2><p>There's something hugely satisfying about the lines of colour and texture in this wintery photograph, with the various strata of the building drawing the eye differently, while the two shuttered windows actually look much like a pair of heavy-lidded eyes themselves.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image2-1fysgvnhbq.jpg\">&nbsp;</img></p><h2>Divided</h2><p>The division between metropolis and green space is rarely as clear and obvious as in this aerial picture taken in Guangzhou, China. The clustered, crowded buildings are mirrored by the overgrowth of the trees and plants, with that clear dividing road between the two.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image3-9ci30qjd6n.jpg\" /></p><h2>Bridge to nowhere&nbsp;</h2><p>This cove in Newfoundland has countless fishing baskets waiting to be used on a pier, piled up in their multitudes. The prominence of timber in the construction of the pier makes this photo have an almost historical feeling to it.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/151522-jaw-dropping-photos-sony-world-photography-awards\" rel=\"follow\">These stunning award-winning pro photos will blow you away</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image4-auu4xokhm2.jpg\" /></p><h2>Painterly</h2><p>It's almost inconceivable to us that this is a photograph, not a painting, so gorgeous and smooth is the imagery. There's no overbearing sharpness or clarity here, just superb colour and a wonderfully chosen point of view.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image5-flgbcv3njj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Land to sea&nbsp;</h2><p>This Icelandic vista has a mind-blowing range of colours and textures to take in, as water runs out to sea over various types of rock and silt, taking on peculiar and memorable tones as it does so. The ripples on the surface of the water in the middle of the frame are extremely pleasing, too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image6-yy6vm8eket.jpg\" /></p><h2>Timeless</h2><p>This rower's pose, fashion and hairstyle all combine to make her seem somehow out of time - it's credible that this photo could have been taken in any of the last multiple decades, we'd argue. It's a superb portrait capturing her taking a breath as she works.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image7-9c245berfh.png\" /></p><h2>Eerie</h2><p>This looks like a nice, simple exploration of light and darkness until you look more closely through the car's windows and see that there's far more to interpret. What are those otherworldly lights? What's going on inside the car? All these are up to your imagination.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141628-48-insanely-neat-photos-of-cables-that-belong-in-a-modern-art-gallery\" rel=\"follow\">58 insanely neat photos of cables that belong in a modern art gallery</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image8-fiukhlonmi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Silhouettes</h2><p>The historical techniques used to take this photo shine through in the soft, monochromatic look of it. The contrast between the far cow, viewed from the side, and its closer friend looking directly into the lens, is nice, while the seascape in the distance is enigmatic.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image9-kimotqph7e.jpg\" /></p><h2>Jubilation</h2><p>This action shot from the&nbsp;Palkhi Festival in Pandharpur, India, is bustling with energy and happiness, the sole drummer rising above the crowd to steal your focus while the foregrounded clapping hands frame the entire shot.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image100-ryk8zb0mji.jpg\" /></p><h2>Swirl</h2><p>The setting sun provides gorgeous lighting for this motion-capturing shot of a boat being piloted with a bit of fun in mind, and the endlessly random ripples and eddies it leaves in its wake are eye-catching.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image111-nyteok6v3g.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ablaze with colour</h2><p>The day of the dead is a well-known festival, but its costumes and pageantry don't get any less entertaining to observe, as this extraordinarily colourful costume demonstrates. The look she's serving the camera with could scare anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/148556-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs\" rel=\"follow\">33 incredibly interesting photos from history</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image122-hbz6davp1k.jpg\" /></p><h2>Taking the plunge</h2><p>There's nothing quite like the pure joy of a dog enjoying playtime, and this shot also shows off the sheer chaos that groups of pooches can foster. There's a lot going on, but the core of the image is that dog frozen mid-dive as it jumps back into the pool, clearly for neither the first nor the last time.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image133-jpazevrcxd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Boom</h2><p>Planned demolitions make for satisfying viewing in video form, provided everything goes right, but this amazing frame shows that they can be just as awesome in photographic form. The setting sun is the perfect ingredient to tie it all together with great colour.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image144-wzb4exrp3q.jpg\" /></p><h2>Contrast</h2><p>It took us absolutely ages to work out what on earth was happening here, but once you clock that the blurred orange sheen in the top of the frame is falling snow, things start to make more sense in terms of perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/apple/116023-apple-fans-better-dressed-80s\" rel=\"follow\">Apple's $10K sneakers were only the half of it, these 80s clothes were quite magnificent</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image155-bkgjhwnec4.jpg\" /></p><h2>Sanctified</h2><p>This image is a stunning evocation of the quiet resonance of places of worship, helped by the clean quality of its morning light and the total lack of people in the frame. It looks like a truly calm space in which to think.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image166-kwlxuppz1o.jpg\" /></p><h2>Ominous</h2><p>This mind-bending sculpture is very real - it's called&nbsp;38° Parallelo by Mauro Staccioli, and the black and white photography here makes it stand out all the more from the natural landscape in which it's set.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image177-wmsrbusb51.jpg\" /></p><h2>Crashing wave</h2><p>Those of us in the UK know this sort of image all too well from annual storms battering our coastlines, but this is a particularly artistic version, with the cracks in the sea wall catching the eye once you look away from the wave itself.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image188-8fcteqjrsy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Luminous</h2><p>If you know much about fish you might be confused by what's poking out of this little guy's mouth. Sadly for him, it's a tongue-eating parasite, so not exactly the happy-go-lucky photo you might have first taken this for.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/drones/news/133911-best-drone-photos-ever-stunning-images-taken-from-up-high\" rel=\"follow\">Best drone photos ever: Stunning images taken from the sky</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image199-xtokozkaw8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Seeing right through you</h2><p>Staying with the ocean, this negative image of a bizarre octopus was taken at night, but looks for all the world like a still from a laboratory environment. It's completely weird in a really captivating way.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image20-7glvicpilv.jpg\" /></p><h2>Midair dogfight</h2><p>Seagulls can be mighty possessive of any potential food, as we know all too well from trying to eat chips at the seaside, but the way these three are fighting over an utterly helpless starfish is amazing. The timing required to get this shot beggars belief.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image21-b86abhlmjf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Still and serene</h2><p>With this photo, meanwhile, it must have been more about patience, waiting for a lack of disturbance to be able to capture the totally still landscape and these stunning&nbsp;dancing mangrove trees in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image22-drfciog5bh.jpg\" /></p><h2>Red</h2><p>This Brazilian dancer's hair, hat and skin tone combine wonderfully to make a delicate palette for this image, while the way her hair blocks her face creates a shield of anonymity.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/148866-hilarious-images-of-celebrities-photoshopped-into-renaissance-paintings\" rel=\"follow\">Amusing images of celebrities Photoshopped into Renaissance paintings</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image23-afiqcub5p8.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fantasy forest</h2><p>This looks for all the world like a shot straight out of Tolkien's Fangorn Forest, not a lane in Tenerife, but the latter is the reality of the situation. That mist is perfect for evoking memories of countless fantasy novels.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image24-urjax3ehgy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Redder</h2><p>This frame is simply saturated in subtly different shades of red, a portrait of a&nbsp;Theyyam ritual in India. The costume is elaborate, delicate and hugely complex.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image25-82r9p37rxm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Parenting</h2><p>Not all portraits of parenthood require humans, and the bond between this baby Orangutan and its mother is clear to see at a glance. The amusing grimace on mum's face is a picture of perseverance, meanwhile.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image26-gkmd2ixis3.jpg\" /></p><h2>Historically new</h2><p>We love this portrait of a young man in South Africa, his oversized jacket seeming to say a lot about the expectations he's been saddled with, while the arid landscape behind him is chastening, too.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/140252-30-famous-photoshopped-and-doctored-images-from-across-the-ages\" rel=\"follow\">Famous Photoshopped and doctored images from across the ages</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image27-e6vv5kjq0k.jpg\" /></p><h2>The void</h2><p>We find this image almost menacing, as a result of that yawning black void creeping down from the top of the frame as these men blithely take selfies and take photos on their phones.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image28-yjeomw0kry.jpg\" /></p><h2>Negative landscape</h2><p>This photo captures an Alpine landscape using infrared technology to present a colourscape unlike anything any human eye would normally see, and leaving you with the impression of an almost alien landscape.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image29-2akjzx8fol.jpg\" /></p><h2>Groom with a view</h2><p>Another beautiful shot of parenting in action, this mutual grooming by a young cheetah and its mother showcases the duality of big cats - terrifying hunters one moment, and adorable oversized fluffballs the next.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image30-mzocg6wohn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Silent witnesses</h2><p>This shot of Extinction Rebellion protestors on the London Underground feels like an impactful statement on modern times - not least because of the fact that they're being quietly ignored by most of the commuters in the shot.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/142867-photoshop-fails-go-to-the-movies-the-worst-film-posters-of-all-time\" rel=\"follow\">Photoshop fails go to the movies: The worst film posters of all time</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image31-lqe9bdy3vw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Absolute squad</h2><p>This huge gang of rare&nbsp;cownose rays, on the Ningaloo Reef off Australia, produces an amazing image where the group almost appear to be moving as one seething ball of ray.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image32-yqjcudpnqx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Flat earth</h2><p>We love this jaw-dropping photograph for how it draws your eye to the horizon, where you're confronted with the immediate rise of that range of mountains at the back of the frame. It's an amazing landscape, that's for sure.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image33-hearsp3xgm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Frozen wave</h2><p>This ice cave is so smooth and shiny that it almost looks like a riptide wave that's been frozen in time.

Her hair is stunningly made up, while lens-flare style bubbles on the frame are a great, odd touch.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image36-rajgxcxv34.jpg\" /></p><h2>Unstill life</h2><p>This still life looks like it must have taken ages to organise, if the cat's body language is anything to go by. It's offbeat and coy, that banana taped to the wall a possible reference to the great modern art story of 2019.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image37-aqtyechdv9.jpg\" /></p><h2>Gradient</h2><p>This mountainous landscape, photographed from above, reveals an amazing range of colours emanating from the river carving out a valley in the middle of the frame.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image38-pmts0pwelx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Reflecting on it</h2><p>We're entranced by the beauty of this shot, from the gentle slope and that still iceberg to the slightly rippling reflections of them both.

It's actually from a salt mine, showing the impact that human shave on huge landscapes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image44-rex9rlchyu.jpg\" /></p><h2>City 17</h2><p>The brutalism of this shot, and the architecture it captures, are both memorable. You might assume it's somewhere more totalitarian or industrialised than the ancient city of Athens, where it was actually shot.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image45-mf9kzzaxnc.jpg\" /></p><h2>All the pretty horses</h2><p>This beautiful shot is perfectly framed with three horses each owning their slice of the photograph, while the colour of the sky and mountains at the top are almost improbably gorgeous.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151839-cameras-news-the-shortlist-for-the-2020-sony-world-photography-awards-is-full-of-gobsmacking-photos-image46-o9v6jdcylb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Paradise on earth</h2><p>We end with a slice of paradise, an aerial shot of Exuma which makes us yearn for a proper holiday. The blue of the ocean and the white of the sand is utterly transporting.&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:08:00

Simple: to make full-frame photography more affordable for those wanting that bigger sensor experience. Not that the £1,719/€1,999 asking price is <em>small</em>, per se, it's just under that critical two grand mark with a lens included. In the USA the body-only price is $1,399.</p><p>So what do you get for your money? The Z5 is designed to sit beneath the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/nikon/145453-nikon-z7-review-specs-price\" rel=\"\">Z7</a> a <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/nikon/147435-nikon-z6-review-full-frame-mirrorless-camera\" rel=\"\">Z6 models</a>, bringing a 24.3-megapixel full-frame sensor to the line-up (which is almost the same resolution as that in the Z6).</p><p>Also launching is the Nikkor Z 24-50mm f/4-6.3 lens, which claims to be the \"shortest and lightest full-frame mirrorless zoom lens\" on the market. That's another play of the Z5: to bring a more compact form factor compared to similar cameras.</p><p>The Z5 isn't just about stills, as it's gifted with 4K video capture too. There's dual card slots (SD, UHS-II) to capture files, which will be especially handy for large video files.</p><p>Here's a quick summary of other big selling points about the Nikon Z5:</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>Built-in 3,690k-dot viewfinder (EVF) &amp; tilt-angle LCD touchscreen</li> \n  <li>5-axis Vibration Reduction (VR) stabilisation system</li> \n  <li>Dust &amp; moisture sealed magnesium alloy body</li> \n  <li>273-point Hybrid AF autofocus system</li> \n  <li>Eye-Detection AF locks onto eyes</li> \n  <li>Animal-Detection AF for pets</li> \n  <li>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth</li> \n </ul><p>Sounds like a treat. The camera will go on sale \"late summer\" 2020 - which is probably another way of saying September. Still <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/nikon/152465-nikon-z5-z30-rumoured-z9\" rel=\"\">no word on the also rumoured Z30 model</a> though, so expect more on that later down the line.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 08:28:11 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/153046-cameras-news-nikon-z5-image1-j0aiykqhzd.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"25a3864f4be69319c7e2fd595517e653","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-51-241_de6de79c65132385.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":52754,"destBytes":31782,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/153046-cameras-news-nikon-z5-image1-j0aiykqhzd.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn74@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-36-51-241_de6de79c65132385.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209024},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Canon EOS R5 launch event: How to watch the \"Reimagine\" livestream and what to expect","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/canon/152818-how-to-watch-new-canon-camera-launch-event-online","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152818-cameras-news-canon-eos-r5-launch-event-how-to-watch-the-reimagine-livestream-and-what-to-expect-image2-1xlh9dqo0w.jpg?v1\"> <p>Canon will host an online camera launch event on Thursday 9 July and, somewhat uniquely, you can watch live.</p><p>Alll you need to do is sign up for details closer the time.</p><p>Here we explain how, along with what you can expect - spoiler alert: the company has teased an EOS R5 mirrorless camera in recent times.</p><h2>When is the Canon Reimagine online launch event?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/canon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canon</a> will broadcast its online event (in English only) on Thursday 9 July 2020, starting at 2pm CEST.

The image shows the&nbsp;remnants of a supernova - a tangled mess in space caused by the end of a massive star in the region. The resulting explosion apparently sent a great swathe of material out into surrounding space.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image3-mwibtwhq5l.jpg\" /></p><h2>Galactic goulash</h2><p>An image created using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory reveals the cosmic outcome of mixing two galaxies together over millions of years. This area of space is located&nbsp;140 million light years from Earth where two galaxies have collided and caused some interesting phenomena.&nbsp;</p><p>Regions of this area of space seemingly show stars forming at an unusually rapid rate. The various colours show emissions of hot gas in the area which is believed to represent the formation of new stars.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image4-yxcm6fshbd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Giant Red Spider Nebula</h2><p>In 2017, Hubble captured this image of the&nbsp;Red Spider Nebula which plays host to&nbsp;one of the hottest stars known to man. This star generates large stellar winds which can be seen reaching out as far as&nbsp;62.4 billion miles.</p><p>These stellar waves are caused by supersonic shocks, that occur when the gas in the area is compressed, heated and then rapidly expands. The result is magnificent&nbsp;waves of radiation that can be easily seen in this fantastic image.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image5-rxasyw5cgx.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Pillars of Creation</h2><p>This image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a vision of the Eagle Nebula - a cluster of stars in&nbsp;the&nbsp;constellation Serpens. This view is unbelievably over 6,500 light years&nbsp;from Earth and shows a number of star-forming&nbsp;gas and dust&nbsp;regions stretching off into pillar-like formations.&nbsp;</p><p>This nebula was originally discovered by Swiss&nbsp;astronomer&nbsp;Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in&nbsp;1745 but is perhaps most well-known thanks to this image from the&nbsp;Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image6-3e24feyhf9.jpg\" /></p><h2>The bubble nebula</h2><p>The Bubble Nebula is located 8,000 light-years away from Earth and was originally discovered by&nbsp;German-born British&nbsp;astronomer&nbsp;Frederick William Herschel in 1787. The bubble is actually the result of winds from a nearby star and it is the heat from the star that causes it to glow.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image7-k0dlo5p6go.jpg\" /></p><h2>Antennae Galaxies reloaded</h2><p>The Antennae Galaxies have been photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope several times over the last few decades. This image is the most recent and the most impressive. The galaxies shown in this image are locked in a constant battle - clashing with each other for several hundred million years.</p><p>This space battle is&nbsp;so violent that stars have been ripped from both galaxies and&nbsp;form a streaming arc which bridges the two. Signs of this cosmic chaos can be seen in the various colours surrounding the galaxies.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image8-ikweuzux0r.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Horsehead Nebula</h2><p>This image shows part of the&nbsp;constellation of Orion. It was captured during the Hubble Space Telescope's 23rd year in use. The magnificent view shows incredible waves of&nbsp;dust and gas creating what looks like a&nbsp;giant space seahorse.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image9-6jtq8hso5z.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hubble mosaic of the majestic Sombrero Galaxy</h2><p>The&nbsp;Sombrero Galaxy is thought to be&nbsp;one of the universe's most beautiful and&nbsp;photogenic galaxies. It's also named due to its likeness to the famous Mexican hat.&nbsp;</p><p>A brilliant and brightly lit galaxy with a&nbsp;bulbous core<strong>&nbsp;</strong>surrounded by masses of gas. The galaxy&nbsp;is so bright it can be easily seen&nbsp;through small telescopes from Earth but is just beyond the limit of the naked eye.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image10-ojxrnlqest.jpg\" /></p><h2>Most detailed image of the Crab Nebula</h2><p>This incredible image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows one of the most detailed views of the Crab Nebula ever seen. The image is actually stitched together from 24 individual images captured by the telescope and we think you'll agree, the results are spectacular.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image11-xivml08osw.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Lagoon Nebula</h2><p>At an incredible 55 light-years wide and 20 light-years tall, the Lagoon Nebula is as impressive as it is beautiful. This Nebula is 4,000 light-years away from Earth and was originally discovered in 1654. Since then, it has been&nbsp;photographed and analysed by&nbsp;astronomers all over the world.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image12-0debjhkqud.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Orion Nebula</h2><p>This brilliantly colourful view of the Orion Nebula shows a section of the Nebula where&nbsp;thousands of stars are forming. Incredibly, over&nbsp;3,000 stars of differing sizes appear in the region captured by this single image.&nbsp;The Orion Nebula is 1,500 light-years from Earth and is the closest star-forming region to our planet. Like other photos on this list, this image is actually made up from&nbsp;520 different photos captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image13-u58ncrfpib.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cosmic dust bunnies</h2><p>This image shows&nbsp;dust lanes and star clusters of this giant galaxy. These so-called dust bunnies are thought to be evidence that this mass is actually the result of the merging to two separate galaxies.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image14-qbtb5rvktz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mystic Mountain</h2><p>This incredible image looks more like fantasy than reality, but the brilliantly colourful view speaks of friction and cosmic chaos. A spiralling pillar of gas and dust can be seen being engulfed by the brilliant light of nearby stars.&nbsp;</p><p>This view is of a&nbsp;stellar nursery known as the&nbsp;Carina Nebula which is a mere&nbsp;7,500 light-years away from Earth. Radiation and cosmic winds from nearby new-born stars are what cause the pillar-like formations that can be seen here. Jets of gas, swirls and wisps of dust and more can be seen as new stars are born and grow.&nbsp;</p><p>The colours are caused by the glow of the different gases - with oxygen in blue,&nbsp;hydrogen and nitrogen in green and sulphur in red. An astounding view, we're sure you'll agree.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image15-kupti27qjs.jpg\" /></p><h2>Star birth in the extreme</h2><p>This incredible view of the Carina Nebula shows an amazing inferno and area of activity where new stars are being born.&nbsp; Scorching ultraviolet radiation and outflowing winds from stars within this area of space create the colourful cosmic painting before your eyes. Again, these colours represent the different gases flowing within the regions -&nbsp;sulfur,&nbsp;hydrogen and oxygen swirling wonderfully as nature creates new cosmic life.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image16-kadviborh0.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Ring Nebula</h2><p>From our perspective on Earth,&nbsp;Messier 57 (also known as \"The Ring Nebula\") has an elliptical shape with a rough, shaggy edge. The Hubble Space Telescope shows a slightly different view though - one likened more to a distorted doughnut. This view is&nbsp;formed by gases being expelled from a giant red star that's in the process of evolving into a white dwarf.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image17-heydcvrajp.jpg\" /></p><h2>Centaurus A</h2><p>Who knew space dust could be so astounding? This image of Centaurus A was taken with&nbsp;Hubble's most advanced instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3. It shows incredible&nbsp;never-before-seen&nbsp;detail of the dusty parts of the galaxy.&nbsp;</p><p>Centaurus A&nbsp;is one of the closest&nbsp;radio galaxies&nbsp;to&nbsp;Earth giving off luminous radio emissions thanks to&nbsp;electromagnetic radiation in the region. These radio emissions make the areas easier to observe and study. The centre of&nbsp;Centaurus A&nbsp;contains a&nbsp;supermassive black hole which emits&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;and&nbsp;radio&nbsp;wavelengths from the area.&nbsp;</p><p>It is thought that Centaurus A was once a large elliptical galaxy that collided with a smaller galaxy in the region and merged to create the view we see now.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image18-sxih8wgkrq.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Veil Nebula</h2><p>This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a small area of the Veil Nebula, also known as the&nbsp;Witch's Broom Nebula. This view shows heated and ionized gas and cosmic dust of the region. It is also the aftermath of a supernova that exploded in the region somewhere between&nbsp;3,000 to 6,000 BC.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image19-zrdnuhxotk.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Carina Nebula</h2><p>Yet another image of the&nbsp;Carina Nebula shows the beauty of the gas and dust pillar in the region. This pillar is an astounding&nbsp;three light-years-long and can be seen bathed in the glowing light of massive nearby stars.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image20-xo80paynfp.jpg\" /></p><h2>A galactic crash</h2><p>This image shows a&nbsp;scattered and warped region of space - the result of a clash between two galaxies. Powerful cosmic forces carve out the shapes now seen here in a galaxy known simply as NGC 4490.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image21-techjbedig.jpg\" /></p><h2>Globular cluster 47 Tucanae</h2><p>47 Tucanae is, after Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster in the night sky. As you can see from this image&nbsp;47 Tucanae hosts&nbsp;tens of thousands of stars.</p><p>Scientists examining the area have noted how dying white dwarf stars have migrated from the central region to the very outskirts. A process that was known to happen, but had not seen before in great detail until the study of this area began in earnest.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image22-kzza94o7en.jpg\" /></p><h2>The whirling disc of NGC 4526</h2><p>This beautiful view of galaxy NGC 4526 seems to show a peaceful galaxy glowing brilliantly in the depths of space. This serene view shows a galaxy that has&nbsp;hosted two known supernova explosions in the last few decades alone. It also has a&nbsp;supermassive black hole at its core with an incredible mass of&nbsp;450 million Suns.</p><p>A&nbsp;rapidly rotating disc of gas spectacularly reaches out from the&nbsp;galaxy's&nbsp;heart and spans seven per cent of its entire radius.

This fantastic image was created&nbsp;by combining data from different telescopes capturing the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. This Nebula is sited&nbsp;6,500 light-years from Earth and is the result of a supernova explosion observed by&nbsp;astronomers in 1054.&nbsp;</p><p>At the centre of the Crab Nebula sits a super-dense neutron star, known as a pulsar. This pulsar spins once every&nbsp;33 milliseconds and as it spins it shoots out beams of&nbsp;radio waves and incredible visible light shows.&nbsp;Fast-moving winds from the pulsar fly off energising gas and dust in the nearby area.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/145151-cameras-feature-astounding-images-from-the-depths-of-the-universe-courtesy-of-the-hubble-space-telescope-image24-5a197ukegn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Auroras on Jupiter</h2><p>This stunning view shows incredible light shows happening in Jupiter's atmosphere. These&nbsp;auroras are the result of&nbsp;high-energy particles entering&nbsp;planet's atmosphere.

improvement","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/152068-fujifilm-x-t200-review","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image1-xp51wv9xlz.jpg?v1\"> <p>When we <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/145312-fuji-xt100-review-camera-mirrorless\" rel=\"\">reviewed the Fujifilm X-T100</a> back in 2018 we were a bit flummoxed about how it was supposed to sit within this high-end camera series. Two years on and its follow-up, the X-T200, has arrived. Featuring an updated design and new feature set, can it convince us where its predecessor could not?</p><p>We've long been fans of Fujifilm's mirrorless cameras, because the X series is all about doing things differently. Whether that's the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/151739-fuji-x100v-review-fujifilm\" rel=\"\">unique viewfinder of the X100V</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/151202-fujifilm-x-t4-review\" rel=\"\">impressive sensor technology in the X-T4</a>. Except the X-T200 doesn't leverage any of that, largely because it doesn't use the X-Trans CMOS sensor design of the rest of the X-T mirrorless range.</p><p>The Fujifilm X-T200 is therefore the company's unabashed entry-level push in the interchangeable lens market. It's the camera that wants you to ditch your smartphone. But does it all add up?</p><h2>Design &amp; Lens Mount</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>Fujifilm X mount (for XF lenses)</li>\n  <li>Built-in electronic viewfinder (0.39in, 2,360k-dot OLED)</li>\n  <li>Vari-angle mounted screen, with touch controls (3.5in, 2,760k-dot LCD)</li>\n </ul><p>While many camera makers release incremental updates of a series, Fujifilm has re-thought things a little more for the X-T200. It's redesigned, thus about 80g lighter than its predecessor (just 370g for the body), the intent being to appeal to those who baulk at the idea of carrying a big and heavy camera around.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image6-0jeog9zy2v.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><p>That's why it comes equipped with a retracting power-zoom lens, too, rather than depending on the pricier and more advanced lens options in the range. These XF lenses do still fit the camera, of course, if you wish to buy any for your collection - that's always part of the appeal and point of an interchangeable camera.</p><p>The retro looks are appealing, but the X-T200 avoids the mass of labelled dials that the more traditional models in the series feature. Instead there's a mode dial with manual controls, plus a bunch of scene modes. It makes sense, in that we get it, but it doesn't make sense, in that it feels like the outlier in the X-T series.</p><p>Elsewhere the X-T200 comes fully featured on the screen and viewfinder front. The fact is has the latter built-in will be as much an appealing element as it may be a deterrent for some others; it's a good finder, though, with ample resolution and helpful for when sunlight is too bright.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image100-m2visiwjcd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>The 3.5-inch rear touchscreen is now bracket mounted, so it can open through 180-degrees or rotated between 90-to-180-degrees. That's useful for overhead shooting, waist-level work, or rotating the camera between portrait and landscape when in such scenarios.</p><h2>Performance</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>Autofocus with 117 selectable areas</li>\n  <li>Face Detection &amp; Eye Detection AF</li>\n  <li>Adjustable AF point size</li>\n  <li>Up to 8fps burst</li>\n </ul><p>Let's explain the X-T100's smattering of dials: there's a Film Simulator to one side; a mode dial, and twin top dials (this pair change their function depending on selected mode) to the other side.</p><p>When clicking between Film types using the top dial, there's a neat effect where the camera shows you the live image, a line drawn down the middle, to compare current selection (Provia) and whatever else you're looking to use (Velvia - vivid, Astia - soft, Classic Chrome, Pro Neg - Hi/Std, Monochrome (with Yellow/Red/Green filter options), and Sepia. It's a nice touch - even if the frame-rate slows somewhat due to the processing asks.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image5-wjmveawzpk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>The pre-set scene modes on the main mode dial seem like a compact camera feature that's trying to creep into a more serious camera, but the inclusion of Night (for completeness: there's also Sport, Landscape, Portrait) shows the camera is able to push settings beyond their normal restrictions, which can be really handy.</p><p>That's one of the things about the X-T200: the included power-zoom lens has its limitations given its limited maximum aperture. By default you might find it will mean a very limited shutter speed is selected, which may not be appropriate for the scene. That said, the optical stabilisation (OIS) system is rather impressive: we've been able to shoot at 1/15th second without much bother, which is something you won't get away with on your phone.</p><p>Elsewhere the X-T200 improves upon the autofocus system of its predecessor. With a total of 117 areas to select from, incuding area size adjustment, it's possible to select one, an area/group, and move the focus area around using the touchscreen or rear lever (a physical control that lacked on its predecessor).</p><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image2-wcxqgdt5ov.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>The autofocus system is adept, as it's utilising an improved on-sensor system, but some of the implementation isn't perfect. For example: when the cameras sometimes throws back \"AF!\" in a red box when it's unable to focus, it isn't over-ridden with a half press of the shutter button, as you would expect. Which isn't intuitive for a camera of this type.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the inclusion of Face/Eye detection (including left/right eye priority) is really useful for portraits and group scenes. This used to be the reserve of higher-end cameras only.</p><h2>Image Quality</h2>\n <ul>\n  <li>'New' 24.2 million pixel sensor, APS-C size</li>\n  <li>Standard primary colour filter (not X-Trans CMOS)</li>\n  <li>Video capture: 4K at 30fps, Full HD (1080p) at 60fps</li>\n </ul><p>The X-T200 also includes a brand new sensor. Yes, it's the same 24.2-megapixels of resolution as the outgoing X-T100's, but it's been engineered differently, has phase-detection autofocus points on the sensor itself - hence that improved focus ability compared to the last model - and a processor that's three-and-a-half times quicker than its predecessor too.</p><p>That additional speed means burst shooting to eight frames per second (8fps) at full resolution, while 4K video is also possible to 30fps. That's knocking on the door of much more expensive cameras in both departments.</p><p>What you really want to know about is what the pictures are like. As the X-T200 does things differently to its X-series family - there's no X-Trans CMOS sensor, it's a 'normal' sensor and colour array here - it's something of a departure in process.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the pictures are poor. Indeed, it's quite the opposite. Which is a major reason to consider buying the X-T200 in the first place.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/assets/images/152068-cameras-review-fujifilm-x-t200-review-image-samples-image1-yossbkvzzg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><p>The thing that really stands-out from a camera with a large sensor such as this is two fold: one, how good image quality can be in low-light conditions; two, how standout the blurred background effect is, giving much more pro-looking results.</p><p>Despite the power zoom lens' limited aperture, we've been shooting indoors and the camera has handled limited light really well by pushing the ISO sensitivity up.

Capable of capturing 8K raw footage up to 30fps in-camera, this is the kind of system that will be used in high-end productions.

Here's a summary:</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>8K 4:2:2 10-bit in Canon Log (H.265) or 4:2:2 10-bit HDR PQ (H.265)</li> \n  <li>4K up to 120fps 4:2:2 10-bit in Canon Log (H.265) or 4:2:2 10-bit HDR PQ (H.265)&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>4:2:2 10-bit in Canon Log or 4:2:2 10-bit HDR PQ output via HDMI at 4K 59.94fps</li> \n  <li>5-axis optical image stabilisation - enabling Lens IS &amp; camera IBIS to be combined</li> \n  <li>Dual card slots: 1x CFexpress, 1x SD (UHS-II)</li> \n </ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All video modes will be compatible with the company's Dual Pixel CMOS AF for autofocus. There's also animal AF to recognise dogs, cats and birds, in addition to face detection.</p><p>All in all, given its 12fps stills shooting capability, this is starting to sound like the higher-end EOS R camera that Canon has been hinting about since the inception of the product line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151870-cameras-news-canon-eos-r5-image1-wbncy3asmb.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"83d3379c5177ad9a108fcdbccf71515b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-36-51-285_002c87d3c6dc54fe.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":99123,"destBytes":53946,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151870-cameras-news-canon-eos-r5-image1-wbncy3asmb.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-36-51-285_002c87d3c6dc54fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209020},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"12 of the best images of time travellers from throughout history","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/147505-photographic-proof-of-time-traveller","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image1-qg6mzfd4w9.jpg?v1\"> <p>Every now and then an image appears online which people claim shows a time traveller somewhere they shouldn't be. But are they just cases of people letting their imaginations run wild?</p><p>We've rounded up some of the best and most interesting images of time travellers throughout history. Some turned out to be plain fakes or cases of mistaken identities, but others are certainly intriguing.&nbsp;</p><p>Which have you seen before?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image2-ctawh1ozip.jpg\" /></p><h2 class=\"nolinks2\">The time travelling hipster&nbsp;</h2><p>This photo was snapped in 1941 at the re-opening ceremony for the South Fork Bridge in British Columbia.</p><p>If you look carefully, on the right-hand side you can see an unusually dressed man in what appears to be modern clothing, sporting sunglasses at a time when most were wearing hats and smart jackets.</p><p>Many argue this is a time traveller, while others have countered that he's simply a man with a fashion sense ahead of his time and that it's <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/time-traveling-hipster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">a false claim</a>. Either way,&nbsp;it's still a wildly popular photo and a great one too in our mind.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image3-xtwgepprty.jpg\" /></p><h2>World Cup celebrations</h2><p>This photo comes from the 1962 World Cup and shows the celebrations as the Brazilian team lifts the trophy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you look closely though, you'll see in the bottom centre of the image what looks like someone with a mobile phone snapping a photo of the event.</p><p>Could this be a time traveller as well? Bit odd to think someone in the future might have a flip phone, but then they have been making a comeback recently and we know <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/146826-best-foldable-smartphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">folding phones are about to be big too</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image4-2lwzvqqsnf.jpg\" /></p><h2>The time travelling sun seeker</h2><p>This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StuartHumphryes/status/1046532116794748942/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">image from 1943</a> apparently shows British factory workers escaping to the seaside for a break during the midst of wartime. The clothes and beachwear of most people certainly fit the era, but in the centre of a frame appears to be a man dressed like Mr Bean checking his mobile phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Or maybe it's a time travel device? Likely a bit of a stretch or a case of overactive internet imagination, but we still enjoy the thought. Maybe there are no public beaches in the future?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image5-gfbqwd1sao.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mohawk time traveller</h2><p>This image from 1905 appears to show the usual happenings of the time - including workers and a banana boat delivering its goods.</p><p>However, if you look near the edge of the boat you can spy a man in a white shirt with what appears to be a Mohawk style haircut. A very unusual haircut for the time and possible proof of a time traveller? Who can say?&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image6-blefrxujty.jpg\" /></p><h2>Film extra</h2><p>Film footage captured during the recording of Charlie Chaplin's 1928 silent film \"The Circus\" appears to show a lady dressed all in black, wearing a hat and walking around the set talking on her mobile phone.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiIrpEMbQ2M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">footage is a little iffy</a> as is the idea that anyone could be talking on a mobile device in the 1920s, but it's certainly got some suggesting it might be proof time travellers are among us.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image7-uoldrkvoet.jpg\" /></p><h2>The ancient astronaut sculpture</h2><p>In Salamanca, Spain, there's a cathedral with multiple sculptures carved into its sides. One such sculpture appears to show the likeness of a modern day (or perhaps futuristic) astronaut.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the cathedral's construction dates back to 1513, people have taken this as proof that time travellers made their way back to that time. However, the truth is the astronaut is merely a modern addition to the artwork carried out by&nbsp;Jerónimo García de Quiñones during <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/ancient-aliens-mysteries-of-the-salamanca-cathedral-astronaut-carving-revealed_1081104.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">renovations in 1992</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image8-lkspzivaf1.jpg\" /></p><h2>Time travelling celebrities</h2><p>There's an interesting trend of people who <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/time-travel-celebrities-historical-doppelgangers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">closely resemble folks from a bygone era</a>. This could just be a spooky coincidence, but maybe it's proof that time travel is possible?</p><p>Perhaps these celebrities are living a double life in another century? Here,&nbsp;Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Leader Mahir Cayan who was born in 1946 and died in 1972 is shown to bear a striking resemblance to TV star Jimmy Fallon. Is Jimmy Fallon living a double life as a revolutionary communist? Seems hilariously unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image9-xqdz85sskp.jpg\" /></p><h2>A man and his mobile phone</h2><p>Some claim that this oil painting by&nbsp;Pieter de Hooch, that was lovingly crafted in 1670 appears to show a young man holding his mobile phone. In an age where such a thing would probably have seen him burnt at the stake, this one is hard to believe.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_woman_with_a_letter_and_a_messenger_in_an_interior\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">description of the image</a> also suggests the young man is a messenger and that's a letter in his hand, not a phone, but it's still nice to let your imagination run wild once in a while. We've often wondered what it would be like to be able to travel back to simpler times to see what life was like for ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image10-qkccmjjtnm.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Adidas trainers mummy</h2><p>A couple of years ago, an ancient mummy was unearthed by archaeologists digging in Mongolia. At the time, it was suggested the funky looking footwear she was wearing bore a striking resemblance to Adidas trainers. More evidence of a time traveller visiting ancient times? Investigation of the body dated it around 1,100 years old. That's one heck of a blast through the past.&nbsp;</p><p>However, further unearthing showed the woman was more likely to have been a&nbsp;Turkic seamstress which might explain the fresh kicks. She was found with an&nbsp;ancient clutch bag, a mirror, a comb, a knife and more. But no mobile phone.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image11-s9bdx1rvin.jpg\" /></p><h2>The time surfer</h2><p>Another image of an out-of-place individual that people have latched on to as proof that time travel is a reality. This image dates back over 100 years and shows some smartly dressed Canadians sitting on the side of a hill.</p><p>On the left-hand side though, sits a young man in what appears to be a t-shirt and shorts with ruffled hair. He was quickly referred to as the surfing time traveller due to how unusual his attire is. Others have suggested people in the photo appear shocked by his appearance, even pointing out the woman on the right who seems to be gesturing in his direction. Again, a bit of a stretch as would a time traveller really go through time dressed like that?&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image12-9kgj8vrn3f.jpg\" /></p><h2>A visitor to wartime&nbsp;Reykjavík</h2><p>This photograph apparently shows a scene from downtown Reykjavík in 1943. In the heart of wartime, soldiers and sailors can be seen everywhere in the streets among civilians. The man circled though, appears to be on a mobile phone.</p><p>We've really got a theme going with these smartphone using time travellers. Who is he calling? And how? And if he is a time traveller, why is he not in Berlin trying to assassinate Hitler?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/147505-cameras-feature-photographic-proof-of-time-travellers-or-just-hoax-and-coincidence-image13-5fcvqa1tw3.jpg\" /></p><h2>The dabbing WWII soldier</h2><p>There's an apparent theme to these time traveller photos that not only includes smartphone users, but also people visiting the second world war. In this image, a young soldier is seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">dabbing</a>, a dance move that became popular around 2014, but certainly wasn't known in wartime.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it turns out this photo isn't an image of a time traveller, but rather just an image of some actors from 2017's blockbuster Dunkirk. The fact that most of the soldiers are smiling should also be a bit of a giveaway with this one.&nbsp;</p><p>This concludes our list of famous images of time travellers. Which do you prefer? And if you had the power to travel through time, where would you go and would you take your phone with you?</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 08:19:00

The legendary photographer travelled to many parks, taking photographs that are famous for their scale and beauty.</p><p>The US National Archives house many of his photographs, from a variety of national parks, and we've gathered some stunning highlights right here for your viewing pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image2-m4nuwnliqj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Reflective</h2><p>This shot of Acoma Pueblo, in New Mexico, nearly radiates heat, the white-out blanch of the low buildings reflecting the sun's glare. That pool of still water in the foreground creates a mirror for the world which palely shows the building again, and we love the light palette of the photo overall.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image3-3c5dsyw8rv.jpg\" /></p><h2>Going to church</h2><p>From another angle, this structure in Acoma Pueblo makes the settlement look more impressive and structured, with that church in the back left of the frame actually looking borderline grand, with its two towers, even despite a lack of ornamentation.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/144672-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house\" rel=\"follow\">How to be an Instagram travel sensation without leaving the house</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image4-79nhzg3pjw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rough exterior</h2><p>From another angle, though, you can see the dilapidation striking in the background, with mortar falling away to show crumbling bricks below. It's a reminder of how structures from the West weren't necessarily built to last into the mid-20th Century.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image5-qkpyywcflj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Damn, that's big</h2><p>Later in his career, in 1941, Adams took a set of pictures of the Boulder Dam, otherwise known as the Hoover Dam, a huge structure on the Colorado River, and we think they make interesting viewing for how Adams applies a landscape photographer's eye to a huge manmade construction like this.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/120303-mobile-phone-40-year-anniversary\" rel=\"follow\">The most iconic mobile phones in history</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image6-yzr05sjb94.jpg\" /></p><h2>Power</h2><p>Adams might be associated with landscape and natural photography, but he was living through a time of rapid technological change and the spread of industrial processes, and this photo of a power unit at the Hoover Dam shows he didn't just ignore this - it's a beguiling lattice of wires and coils.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image7-gmuqgfzp9d.jpg\" /></p><h2>A new landscape</h2><p>Meanwhile, power lines were spreading over the landscapes he would have photographed, as so many hikers know nowadays. Still, this photograph shows that with his expertise and camera skills he could perfectly expose a photo to make the power lines an equal and interesting part of the composition.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image8-lsdw1njlcn.jpg\" /></p><h2>A sliding scale</h2><p>This portrait shot of the dam gives a great sense for how huge it was (and remains) - standing on top of it can be a vertigo-inducing experience even in modern times, so must have been even more impactful back in the 40s when this shot was taken.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/152226-politicians-re-imagined-in-famous-portrait-paintings\" rel=\"follow\">Modern politicians fantastically re-imagined in famous portrait paintings</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image9-51ztuagmen.jpg\" /></p><h2>Lean out</h2><p>Here, again, Adams shows his eye by using the power line in the foreground to draw your eye back to the dam and then beyond it, to the rolling mountains and hills on the horizon, each fainter than the last as you head into the distance.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image100-ek1swodvmd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Trademark</h2><p>This image is textbook Adams, its dark, moody exposure creating a stunning tableau and the banded rock of this Arizona canyon lit up to differing degrees by the sun peeking through clouds. It's a superb piece that's up there with his most famous images in terms of quality.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/148290-fantastic-street-artist-transforms-the-world-with-pixel-art\" rel=\"follow\">Fantastic street artist transforms the world with incredible pixel art</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image111-fsoagz8bjy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Death Valley</h2><p>Death Valley national park is one of those locations that is clearly named to dissuade people from visiting, but visit we do nonetheless, and its apparently arid climes actually hide some crazy beauty. We're not sure what the blurred light elements are in the bottom of this shot, but they lend the photo an ethereal, magical feel.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image122-cbpnzzt3fg.jpg\" /></p><h2>The burn</h2><p>Forest fires can be terrifying, but they're also a natural part of regeneration (to a certain extent). This is the aftermath of such a fire in Glacier National Park, Montana, and shot in portrait orientation Adams gives it a massive sense of scale. Just try counting how many burnt trees are in this one shot.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/instagram/148765-the-finest-surreal-photographers\" rel=\"follow\">The finest surreal photographers and image manipulators of Instagram</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image133-zogwd4tjme.jpg\" /></p><h2>Misty mountains</h2><p>This shot shows how Adams had a true eye for the sky, able to see clouds forming and flowing and capture them at just the right moment. This pair of mountains has a cloud passing through them that looks straight out of Lord of the Rings.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image144-ebgxm8kgzn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Serenity</h2><p>There's nothing like a placid lake to make for a calming picture, and this photograph is a beautiful example. You can almost hear the natural silence that surrounds Adams as he takes this shot, with the many different hills and mountains all sloping down to the one lake.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image155-cualopmtmd.jpg\" /></p><h2>Postcard view</h2><p>This looks like a still from an animated movie or a painting, so perfect is the framing and so varied are the profiles of the mountains on show, while that single tree's silhouette at the bottom provides a lovely touch, and the cloud in the middle is just how you'd imagine one in your head.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/152265-dreamlike-photoshop-images-gallery\" rel=\"follow\">Enter another world with these amazingly dreamlike photo edits</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image166-uje0boigfp.jpg\" /></p><h2>The sky's the limit</h2><p>Again, here Adams shows his unique talent by pretty much making the sky the real star of the show - the limitless variation of the cloud cover, their colour and depth all making for an amazing tableau. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have an amazing mountain below it all.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image177-yp4nul2mds.jpg\" /></p><h2>The elements</h2><p>Here we get a great three-piece image in vertical, with the lake in the foreground rising up to a sudden, barren mountain, which in turn points up into the sky, beckoning the viewer that way. You can tell that the sun is once again peeking through on the scene, too, so beautiful is the light.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/152281-retro-tech-pictures-gallery\" rel=\"follow\">These superb pictures of retro tech will show you how far we've come</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image188-xbowdpccba.jpg\" /></p><h2>Close-up</h2><p>Adams might have been often preoccupied with the huge end of the scale, but he clearly also had an eye for detail, and you can see why this patch of lichen took his fancy, spreading out on a sheer rock face. Its texture is just as compelling and unique as the clouds photographed elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image199-f7zs36nrcw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Perfection</h2><p>Have you ever seen a more perfect leaf than this one? It's another great showcase of Adams' patience and eye, finding a pristine leaf to shoot in amongst the riot of options that any forest or undergrowth offers.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/149858-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts\" rel=\"follow\">This incredible photographer creates new worlds with arts and crafts</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image20-1yabnvkafp.jpg\" /></p><h2>A lovely fern</h2><p>Another textbook example of a plant looking like how you'd imagine it in your head, this five-point fern is exposed beautifully, with a little more light than Adams sometimes used, to make for a dazzling image.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152619-cameras-news-these-stunning-ansel-adams-photographs-show-the-great-outdoors-in-all-its-glory-image21-z0ok98xdcm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Grand is the word</h2><p>If you're talking about depth, though, the layers and layers of rock faces and cliffs in this shot are jaw-dropping. It's from Grand Canyon National Park, an area that people might not realise covers much more than just the Grand Canyon itself, allowing for amazing vistas like this one.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a

<p>This is where we round-up the best DSLR cameras available to buy today.</p><p>DSLR cameras - which stands for digital single lens reflex - have removable lenses so that different optics can be attached in order to give a different view onto the world. This potential variety allows you to start small and build-up to the more varied, sharper and desirable featured lenses as you go along.</p><p>We'll guide you through the hottest cameras available - using only models that we've handled - to save you time when it comes to working out what the best options are.</p><p>Whether you're new to DSLRs, looking to upgrade, know plenty about cameras already, or are considering a more pro option, we've broken down our list of great DSLR cameras into sub-headed categories to make things easier to digest.</p><p>Don't confuse them with the newer breed of mirrorless cameras (sometimes called compact system cameras)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/buyers-guides/124653-best-mirrorless-cameras-budget-to-high-end-mirrorless-lens-cameras-to-buy\" rel=\"\">which we have covered in a separate feature</a>.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/deals/146122-best-camera-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\"><strong>Best cheap camera deals</strong></a></li> \n </ul><h2>A quick lesson in lenses</h2><h3>Lens mount</h3><p>First thing's first: cameras don't work in a one-size-fits-all way. Brands like to keep their own heritage and, as such, each manufacturer has its own lens mount.</p><p>For Canon it's EF-mount (including EF-S), for Nikon it's F-mount, for Pentax it's K-mount, and Sony has A-mount. There are some additions and exceptions, but those are the current main four.&nbsp;Don't fall into the trap by buying the wrong lenses just because the brand names match up.</p><h3>Sensor size</h3><p>Second to the equation is sensor size. Entry and mid-level cameras typically have what's called an APS-C size sensor. Some pro-spec cameras have full-frame sensors that, because they're physically larger, need specific (typically pricier and more advanced) lenses that are capable of covering these larger dimensions. Typically these sensor types aren't interchangeable across the lens range: you're either using APS-C or you're using full-frame.</p><h3>Focal length</h3><p>There are plenty of things to consider with lenses and this all depends on the type of photography you are planning on doing. If it's all about portraits you'll want something around the 50mm or 75mm mark. If you are trying to snap that lion on the Savannah and don't want to get eaten then you'll want something with a long zoom, say, closer to 300mm or greater.</p><h2>Best entry-level DSLR</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/143700-cameras-review-hands-on-canon-eos-2000d-review-image1-xploy5pbva.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" /></p><h3>Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7</h3><p>squirrel_widget_143700</p><p>The replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/137661-canon-eos-1300d-review-entry-level-ace\" rel=\"\">EOS 1300D</a> is a safe bet and typically a few quid cheaper than its <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/nikon/145545-nikon-d3500-is-a-24-2-megapixel-dslr-that-won-t-break-the-bank\" rel=\"\">Nikon D3500</a> competitor.

camera?","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/150556-what-should-you-consider-when-buying-an-action-camera","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\"

first steps, your smartphone camera has you covered for everyday moments in life. But when it comes to breathtaking action and adventure, a smartphone camera just can’t keep up — enter the modern-day action camera.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=326657&amp;awinmid=7327&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=https://www.dji.com/osmo-action\" rel=\"follow\">Action cameras</a> offer you an entirely new way to film your adventures, featuring durable designs, waterproof casings, and state-of-the-art imaging capabilities.</p><p>If you’re in the market for an action camera, hold on tight and launch yourself into a world of adventure with this article. We will discuss the action camera features you should consider and reveal some of the best options on the market in 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2>Durability: Whatever the weather</h2><p>Durability is one of the most important features to consider, as it will determine how well your action camera can keep up in any given shooting environment. The best action cameras on the market can withstand extreme temperatures, dirt, a dive into the ocean, or even being dropped. Waterproofing is a good feature to look out for if you wish to dive deeper for more content. DJI, GoPro, Sony, and other companies offer action cameras that are waterproof, shockproof, and resistant to extreme environments.</p><h2>Stabilisation: Hollywood shots</h2><p>Stabilisation has become a huge factor to consider when choosing an action camera. Whether your skiing down a mountain, running along a track, mountain biking, or recording other dynamic shots, stabilized video makes a world of difference to your footage. Most modern-day cameras come equipped with their own internal stabilization, letting you focus more on the action rather than worrying about the shot. When it comes to action camera stabilization systems, key contenders re DJI’s RockSteady, which made its debut with Osmo Action, and GoPro’s HyperSmooth, which was introduced with the GoPro Hero 7. We recommend checking out the stabilization availability of different action cameras for different resolution combinations.&nbsp;</p><h2>Videos: 4K and beyond</h2><p>The main function of an action camera is to capture dynamic, high-quality videos in any environment. Most action cameras in 2020 can now shoot both HD and 4K videos, which means you should pay attention to things like HDR support, 60fps frame rates, slow motion, and integrated shooting modes. A great example of this is Osmo Action, which features HDR video, 240fps slow-motion mode at either 1080p or 720p, and timelapses in 1080p, 2.7K, and 4K.</p><h2>Images: Simple shooting</h2><p>In addition to videos, an action camera should be able to take exceptional still images. A larger lens captures more light, which improves your images and video quality. Look for action cameras that offer intelligent image processing. The Sony RX0 II has one of the largest camera sensors of any action camera and offers a range of image control and dynamic range modes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Lens: Wide-angle views</h2><p>Action cameras are known for their point-of-view lenses, which use a very wide-angle view to capture yourself and all of your surroundings in one frame. Most action cameras on the market can produce a wide-angle shot that is perfect for capturing all the action in one shot.</p><h2>Screens: Perfect selfie shots</h2><p>An action camera screen monitor is an important feature to consider when you are purchasing your equipment. A screen helps you see what the action camera is recording, review your footage, and change settings easily. The DJI Osmo Action triumphs in this category, featuring a 2.25-inch touchscreen on the back and a vivid 1.4-inch selfie screen at the front.&nbsp;</p><h2>Voice control: Focus on the action</h2><p>Every second counts when you are undertaking extreme sports activities. Voice control is a fantastic feature that lets you control your action camera while focusing on the moment at hand. This clever feature gives you control over recording, taking a photo, turning the device on and off, and more.</p><h2>Others to consider</h2><p>There are lots of other action camera features you should consider. Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity makes it easier to transfer your images and videos to your phone or laptop. No matter how impressive the hardware is, software stability should always be considered when purchasing your action camera. A dedicated app lets you edit your footage, download files, change the camera settings, and more. Battery life is also an essential thing to consider; most modern action cameras can record for over an hour on a fully charged battery.</p><h2>Some action cameras to consider...</h2><p>Now that we’ve gone through some important action camera features, it’s time to check out some of the best action cameras in 2020. Here are five of our favourites!</p><h3>DJI Osmo Action</h3><p>To kick off our list of recommended action cameras, we will start with an action camera that has changed the game. The <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=326657&amp;awinmid=7327&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=https://www.dji.com/osmo-action\" rel=\"follow\">DJI Osmo Action</a> was released in May 2019, opening up a world of creativity for professionals and adventure seekers alike. DJI debuted its first action camera with some stand-out features that make it a unique addition to the action camera market.</p><p>Osmo Action has two screens: the back screen delivers a hyper-responsive display while the innovative front screen lets you capture selfies and frame action shots effortlessly. This action camera also comes with DJI’s own electronic image stabilization (EIS), which they have coined as “RockSteady.” The EIS technology works in conjunction with high-performance algorithms to record cinematic action shots.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to 4K/60fps video at 100 Mbps, Osmo Action also features 4K HDR video, improving the dynamic range of your footage and giving you more vibrant details. This action camera also comes jam-packed with creative shooting modes that support 8x slow motion, timelapses, hyperlapses, and continuous shooting.&nbsp;</p><p>Osmo Action is as rugged as it is sophisticated, and is waterproof to depths of up to 11 meters without any external casing. This durable action camera features voice commands and is supported by a lineup of accessories, which round off an entry that easily earned its place on our list of top action cameras.</p><h3>GoPro Hero 8</h3><p>Next on our list is GoPro’s new successor to the Hero 7 Black — introducing the GoPro Hero 8 Black. Built on the success from previous models, this new model features a slimmer design, a foldable built-in mount, a better microphone, and updated EIS stabilization.</p><p>GoPro introduced HyperSmooth 2.0 with the Hero 8 Black, offering stabilization functionality across all resolutions and frame rates. Included with this update are three modes of stabilization that crop the frame at different levels to counter camera shakes. HyperSmooth 2.0 can also be applied to slow-motion footage shot at 120fps and 240fps.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to these updates, a narrow lens perspective lets you shoot close-up footage, 2.7K and 4K video modes now support bitrates up to 100 Mbps, and social media live streams can be broadcasted at 1080p.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hero 8 Black also comes with built-in foldable hinges that allow it to be attached to other accessories like a tripod. This convenient feature removes the need for an additional frame mount for accessories and gives you easier access to the battery and memory card.</p><h3>Insta 360 One X</h3><p>This innovative action camera brings some impressive features to the market. The Insta360 One X offers sharp footage at 5.7K 30fps, 4K 50fps, and 3K 100fps. An HDR mode ensures your footage maintains excellent details in different types of lighting conditions. The Insta360 One X also features its own form of electronic stabilization, named FlowState, which provides stability for all of your action shots.</p><p>When it comes to exciting features, Insta360 One X brings heaps of action to the table. Snap the action camera into the Drifter accessory to create stunning slow-motion shots with ingenious angles. The accessory features an aerodynamic body and a shock-resistant frame, letting your creativity take flight. Another useful accessory is the invisible selfie stick that produces great selfies without appearing in the footage itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Insta360 One X also impresses with various shooting modes. TimeShift gives you control over your perspective by using slow motion and stabilized hyperlapses. These features are all combined with the One X app for simple, cinematic editing.</p><h3>Garmin VIRB XE</h3><p>The next action camera on our list is built for extreme adventures. The Garmin VIRB XE is a compact, waterproof action camera with plenty of impressive features. This action camera shoots high-definition footage at 1080p 60fps and 12MP photos up to 30fps. You can also capture photos while simultaneously recording videos. The VIRB XE is engineered to withstand harsh environments, and it is waterproof up to 50 meters without an external case.&nbsp;</p><p>G-Metrix is a clever feature that contains information on GPS, G-force, orientation, and more performance data. Users can playback their footage with overlays of speed, acceleration, and more. For fast-paced action shots, the VIRB XE contains motion sensors that detect camera movements and EIS stabilization that keep your shots smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>With built-in WiFi, VIRB XE can be connected to a smartphone or tablet for live video control, editing, and playback. This rugged action camera also comes with Bluetooth-enabled HD audio to ensure you can obtain the best audio possible. VIRB XE also comes with impressive remote-controlled accessories and features a user-friendly design that makes it a great addition to the action camera market.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sony RX0&nbsp;</h3><p>No action camera list in 2020 would be complete without the Sony RX0. Promising boundless creative inspiration, the RX0 combines excellent imaging performance with durability. This action camera is waterproof down to 10 meters and shockproof up to 2.0 meters.&nbsp;</p><p>Packing an Exmor RS CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor, RX0 offers excellent imaging capabilities. One great feature of this product is the ability to shoot super slow-motion video at 1000fps. From golf swings to football tackles, you can capture slow-motion sports footage like never before. RX0 also contains an anti-distortion shutter up to 1/32000 seconds that gives you crystal clear shots of fast-moving subjects. Users can take photos up to 16fps, and Picture Profile/S-Log2 offers more professional video options.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with all these great features, the RX0 is supported by a lineup of accessories that accommodate a variety of shooting options.

It's constantly releasing new models to keep up with technological developments and user expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>While there's more competition now, GoPro still has arguably the best all-round ecosystem of action cameras. That said, there are absolutely loads of models to choose from. This begs the question: which GoPro should you buy?&nbsp;</p><h2>What GoPro offers</h2><p>GoPro's entire lineup has gone through something of a streamlining process and complete refresh over the past couple of years. Whereas prior years saw various models, including a budget, tiny Session, the company now only offers versions of the flagship Hero series and the 360-degree Max.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, it moved around its product line quite a bit to achieve this streamlining, and further slimmed it down in 2019 with the launch of <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/gopro/149442-gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera\" rel=\"follow\">the Hero 8</a> and Max. Now it has the Hero 7 Silver, Hero 7 Black, Hero 8 Black and the GoPro Max.&nbsp;</p><p>That makes four cameras in total but between them you should easily be able to find something that works for you on your budget. What's more, you can still quite easily find some of the previous flagship cameras at much lower prices than they were at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>GoPro also offers an array of accessories, from small handheld mounts that act as tripods, and floating cases, to the powered, stabilising Karma Grip gimbal system. It also has a great, easy to use mobile and desktop apps for editing. As an ecosystem goes, it's pretty unbeatable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our pick of the best action cameras from GoPro</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/134096-cameras-buyer-s-guide-best-gopro-which-gopro-should-you-choose-image16-8ledprqct0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h2>GoPro Hero 8 Black</h2><p>squirrel_widget_168058</p><p>GoPro didn't just enhance the action camera's capabilities when it launched the Hero 8 Black, it also brought with it a new, more practical design. It's slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor, but that extra size and weight means there's now space for built-in mounting arms, and that means no more additional clip-on frame. It'll mount to anything all by itself.&nbsp;</p><p>As you'd expect, it's waterproof and can shoot up to 4K resolution, with a huge number of frame rates and resolutions available depending on what kind of footage you're wanting to shoot. The big news in video performance is the enhancement of the company's HyperSmooth stabilisation algorithms. It's called HyperSmooth 2.0 and is available across all resolutions and frame rates, so it doesn't matter what you shoot, it'll be buttery smooth.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K Wide - 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>4K SuperView - 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>4K Linear - 60, 30, 24fps</li> \n  <li>4K (4:3) Wide - 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K Wide - 120, 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K&nbsp;SuperView - 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K Linear -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K Narrow -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K (4:3) Wide -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K (4:3) Linear -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K (4:3) Narrow -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1440p Wide -&nbsp;120, 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1440p Linear -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1440p Narrow -&nbsp;60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Wide - 240, 120, 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p SuperView + Linear - 120, 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Narrow - 60, 30, 24 fps</li> \n </ul><p>One of the biggest enhancements to the Hero 8 Black is down to the redesigned exterior and port layout: mods. GoPro has introduced three new mod add-ons that enable a more professional vlogging experience. Simply: you can now connect a shotgun microphone, LED light and display mod so that you can light yourself in darker environments, get better audio recording and see yourself when shooting to camera.&nbsp;</p><p>It's for sure the most accomplished standard GoPro action camera to date.

Likewise, in a lot of ways it isn't. It's a 360-degree camera, that's true, but its more than that and GoPro has completely changed the way you edit video from it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can shoot using either of the two 180-degree cameras on its own, and it features even better stabilisation than the Hero8. As well as using the HyperSmooth technology of the more standard camera, it uses its ultra wide lenses to automatically level the horizons, so not only does it make all your footage smooth, it's also always level.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a better mic than the Hero8 too, in fact, offering similar performance to the shotgun mic mod that you can buy for the Hero8. It has six mics in total, offering that 360-degree audio.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you can shoot in 360 too, using both cameras, and then you simply use the GoPro mobile app to reframe any of the footage you capture in a way that's much more user friendly than the method offered by the Fusion. You can also use a TimeWarp feature that lets you speed up and slow down footage while panning around the 360-degree footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Hero, it has built-in mounting arms, so you'll never need a case for it to mount it to any of your handles. What's more, it's only $100 more than the single-camera device.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/134096-cameras-buyer-s-guide-best-gopro-which-gopro-should-you-choose-image14-cdhlexh5vl.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>GoPro Hero 7 Black</h3><p>squirrel_widget_145781</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K video at 60fps</li> \n  <li>1080p at 240fps</li> \n  <li>HDR Photos</li> \n  <li>HyperSmooth + HyperLapse</li> \n  <li>10m waterproofing</li> \n </ul><p>It might have been launched in 2018, but the Hero 7 Black still offers a lot, and is even better value than ever now that its retail price has been reduced.&nbsp;</p><p>Stuck on the front is a camera capable of shooting HDR still photos, as well as 4K video up to 60 frames per second and 1080p footage up to 240fps for awesome slow-motion. It's also equipped with some very advanced digital stabilisation, which acts like a 3-axis gimbal to smooth out shakes and vibrations. It's called HyperSmooth and almost completely gets rid of bumps and shakes in the footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As well as all that, general image quality is much more natural and better quality too, compared to its predecessor. All this is thanks to the new custom, upgraded GP1 processor, which has enabled these improvements in hardware that's largely the same as the previous model. It offers the following resolutions and FOVs:</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K Wide - 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>4K SuperView - 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>4K (4:3) Wide - 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K Wide - 120, 100, 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K&nbsp;SuperView + Linear - 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K (4:3)&nbsp;Wide + Linear - 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1440p Wide + Linear - 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Wide - 240, 200, 120, 100, 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p SuperView + Linear - 120, 100, 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>720p Wide + Linear - 60, 50 fps</li> \n </ul><p>It's waterproof up to 10 metres, fits all the same accessories and mounts as the Hero 5. It also has the same 1220mAh battery.</p><p>What's particularly interesting here is that it was the first GoPro with the built-in ability to analyse telemetry, audio and facial recognition clues and better choose the bits where action is happening. That means when it comes to creating a QuikStory, the camera should be better at choosing the important parts than previous cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>You can control Hero 7 using the buttons or touchscreen as normal, or use voice commands to get your camera to take photos, shoot video, just by telling it to.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read the full review:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/gopro/145781-gopro-hero-7-black-review-specs-video-stabilisation-4k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoPro Hero 7 Black review</a></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/134096-cameras-buyer-s-guide-best-gopro-which-gopro-should-you-choose-image15-2u6exsgwhu.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>GoPro Hero 7 White</h3><p>squirrel_widget_148418</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>1440p video at 60fps</li> \n  <li>10MP stills</li> \n </ul><p>If you want a capable action camera without the expense, there's the GoPro Hero 7 White. It's discontinued currently, but even at launch it was half the price of its highest-spec sibling. It was launched in 2018, effectively taking the features from the 6-month-old Hero, and putting it in a new design.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't have 4K video recording, but it has many of the same features as the old Hero 5 Black. For instance, you get voice control, QuikStories, video stabilisation and waterproofing up to 10 metres. It even has the 3-mic noise reduction system. And, unlike the Session cameras it's replacing, it does have a screen, so you can see what you're filming and interact with the controls using its touch sensitivity. It lacks the small monochrome screen on the front, and the battery isn't removable though.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can live without the 4K resolution video, the 60fps 1080p capture from the stabilised Hero should be more than enough to capture your best outdoor exploits. Here are&nbsp;all the resolutions, frame-rates and FOVs available:&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>1440p Wide - 60fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Wide - 60fps</li> \n  <li>15/1 burst rate 10MP stills</li> \n </ul><p>It's a much simpler offering from GoPro and one which should prove very easy to use for those thinking about trying out a GoPro camera if you can still find one.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/970x/assets/images/134096-cameras-news-buyer-s-guide-best-gopro-which-gopro-should-you-chooseimage11-u6et0bsbx1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"427\" /></p><h3>GoPro Hero 5 Session</h3><p>squirrel_widget_148420</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K video up to 30fps</li> \n  <li>10m waterproofing</li> \n  <li>Tiny, portable design</li> \n </ul><p>The Session range is the ultra-portable set of cameras that's been discontinued, but they still make great options if you can find one. They cut down a little on features, but are surprisingly capable of producing great footage, despite their small size. The top of the range Session is the Hero5 Session, which launched alongside the Hero5 in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Hero5, it's compatible with QuikStories and connects to the GoPro mobile app. It's waterproof to 10 metres, is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth equipped, and can shoot in all the modes you've become accustomed to: Photo, Burst Mode, Night Photo, Video, Looping, Time Lapse Photo, Time Lapse Video and Night Lapse Photo.</p><p>Video is stabilised, and wind noise is actively reduced using two mics on the exterior. You can even make use of the ProTune feature for more manual photo and video control. Here's a full list of available resolutions and FOVs.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>4K Wide - 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K Medium - 48, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K SuperView, Wide + Linear - 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>2.7K (4:3) Wide - 30, 25 fps</li> \n  <li>1440p Wide - 60, 50, 48, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Wide -90, 60, 50, 48, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Superview + Linear - 60, 50, 48, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>1080p Medium + Narrow - 48, 30, 25, 24 fps</li> \n  <li>960p Wide - 100, 60, 50, 30, 25 fps</li> \n  <li>720p Wide - 120, 60, 50, 30, 25 fps</li> \n  <li>720p SuperView + Medium - 60, 50, 30, 25 fps</li> \n </ul><p>As well as all these features, you can make use of GoPro's Voice Control to take photos, shoot video or time lapses. As small cameras go, it's pretty advanced, and matches the Hero5 Black in almost every way. It's just cheaper and smaller and missing the touchscreen.&nbsp;</p><h3>Which GoPro should you buy?</h3><p>If you want the best of the best, the Hero 8 Black is the easiest recommendation. It doesn't just film 4K resolution at 60fps, it's waterproof, can do 240fps slow-mo at 1080p resolution, and has really impressive digital stabilisation during shooting. Overall image quality is great too.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, the GoPro Max also makes a solid case for itself by not only offering high-end Hero performance, but also more advanced stabilisation and horizon levelling, plus 360-degree capture.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want high end recording abilities in as small a package as possible, the Hero 5 Session is a really great option, even if it is discontinued. It's compact, waterproof and can shoot at pretty much the same levels as the Hero 5 Black, and doesn't cost the earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately it comes down to weighing up what's important to you in an action camera.

seen mystery and intrigue around every corner. Mysterious events have been put down to the supernatural, the paranormal and even the extra-terrestrial.</p><p>One things for sure, there have been a lot of unexplained mysteries over the centuries and with modern technology giving people greater access to photography and previously unexplored parts of the galaxy, there are bound to be plenty more cropping up.</p><p>We've tracked down some of the most famous alien and monster photographs ever taken to show just how weird and wonderful the world can be.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141224-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken\" rel=\"follow\">The most famous ghost photographs ever taken</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/134235-the-best-astronomy-photographs-that-are-out-of-this-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">21 of the best astronomy photographs that are out of this world</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image2-lh39diqkwc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1190\" /></p><h2>The Loch Ness Monster (565 AD)</h2><p>Nessie is the fabled creature that famously inhabits Loch Ness in Scotland. This monster might well be the oldest of the unexplained mysteries on our list as the earliest reports of sightings date back to 565 AD.</p><p>Since that time, plenty of people have claimed to see the monster of the Loch but there have also been many false sightings, hoaxes and misidentifications that have included everything from trees to natural gases.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image3-gw85pldi4m.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" /></p><h2>An ancient visitor from outer space? (15th Century)</h2><p>This painting by Domenico Ghirlandaio of \"the Madonna with Saint Giovannino\" dates back to the 15<sup>th</sup> Century and seemingly shows an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) hovering in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It might be a bit of a stretch, but some have theorised that it's not a mistake in the painting or a cloud in the sky because if you look carefully, you can see a man standing below staring up at the object.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image4-dhkv85snfx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" /></p><h2>The Tunguska event (1908)</h2><p>In June 1908, a massive explosion happened near the Stony Tunguska River in Russia. The explosion flattened 770 square miles of forest, toppling around 80 million trees and yet somehow resulted in no loss of human life.</p><p>It has been theorised that the Tunguska event, as it has been designated, was caused by an air bursting meteoroid but no one really knows for sure. There was no impact crater, so the conjecture is simply that it broke up in the atmosphere somewhere between three and six miles above the Earth's surface. The explosion is calculated to have been 1,000 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.</p><p>The Tunguska event has since lead to much discussion about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact_avoidance\" rel=\"\">asteroid impact avoidance</a>, a growing fear of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event\" rel=\"\">extinction-level events</a> and has helped to spawn a multitude of science fiction films.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image5-z1lay604fx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2130\" /></p><h2>Ectoplasm séances (1912)</h2><p>During the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20th Centuries, spiritualism took a grip on society with many people believing that mediums could help communicate with the dead. Fraudsters took to manipulating their audiences with a variety of tricks and illusions aimed at duping them out of their hard-earned cash.</p><p>Strong favourites at the time came in the ability to produce convincing ectoplasm, apparitions and manifestations that couldn't easily be explained by the average person. In this photo, Marthe Béraud apparently conjures an inexplicable light between her hands and ectoplasm above her head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image6-ytx0ainrvc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1215\" /></p><h2>The Hinterkaifeck massacre (1922)</h2><p>In the depths of Bavaria, Germany, in 1922 a horrific massacre took place where six people including women and children were murdered with a farming implement. There were several things that turned this tragic event into an unexplained mystery and a crime that was never solved.</p><p>A suspect was never found, despite over 100 people being questioned. There were several rumours about the farmstead being haunted and the attacks also happened shortly after the arrival of a new maid (who was also killed).</p><p>Each of the victims was apparently lured to the barn where they were killed one by one. The events were even more sinister when evidence was unveiled that suggested the murder(s) stayed in the house for several days after committing the crime before disappearing. Decades later, a multitude of investigations have been carried out with no further results.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image7-fk3wqb8jbx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1138\" /></p><h2>The time travelling hipster (1941)</h2><p>There are a fair few stories and legends of time travellers throughout history. The most popular so far has proven to be this image from 1941 taken at the re-opening of the South Fork Bridge, British Columbia.</p><p>The picture apparently shows a man in modern clothing and wearing sunglasses in an era when most people were sporting suits. Though there have been many <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/supernatural/hipster.asp\" rel=\"\">arguments and explanations</a> which counter the theory it's still wildly popular on the internet.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image8-trcpcb6kjk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1293\" /></p><h2>The Battle of Los Angeles (1942)</h2><p>Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, in the early hours of the morning 25 February 1942, an unidentified aircraft was spotted in the skies above Los Angeles. Fearing another attack, military forces fired over 1,400 anti-aircraft shells into the sky and apparently hit nothing.</p><p>Photographs from the event appeared to show a flying saucer-like object hanging in the sky and caught in the military searchlights. Of course, the Government denied the sighting and put it down to weather balloons.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image9-x8rfv3deyq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /></p><h2>SS Ourang Medan (1947)</h2><p>This legend from the high seas comes from June 1947 when two American ships received a distress call from the SS Ourgan Medan. Sent in Morse code, the message read \"S.O.S. from Ourang Medan * * * we float. All officers including the Captain, dead in chartroom and on the bridge. Probably whole crew dead * * *.\"</p><p>The American ships went to offer aid but when they boarded the SS Ourgan Medan they found the crew were all dead, sprawled on their backs, mouths agape with no visible signs of injury. A fire then broke out on the distressed ship forcing the rescuers to abandon it before it exploded and sunk taking all evidence with it. What happened to the ship and crew remains a mystery.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image10-qucjhb57sl.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"515\" /></p><h2>The McMinnville UFO photographs (1950)</h2><p>In May 1950, a series of photographs were taken by Paul Trent at his farm near McMinniville, Oregon in the United States. These images appeared to show a metallic disk-shaped object moving slowly in the skies above the farm.</p><p>The event was witnessed by Paul Trent and his wife Evelyn. Despite many arguments that the <a href=\"https://www.debunker.com/trent.html\" rel=\"\">photographs were fake</a>, the two witnesses maintained their statements that images were genuine right until their deaths in the late 1990's.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image11-ot05aflnqx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1050\" /></p><h2>The great alien reconnaissance (1952)</h2><p>In 1952 multiple air traffic controllers from several airports and air force bases near Washington D.C. reported seeing unidentified blips on their radar screens. When questioning local pilots, the controllers were told that a number of \"bright lights\" had been seen in the sky nearby.</p><p>The next weekend, it happened again, this time with a dozen blips appearing on the radar screens. Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept but were unable to match the speed of the unidentified flying objects. These sightings were added to list being investigated by the Government under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book\" rel=\"\">Project Blue Book</a> but nothing further was revealed.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image12-wmzvg1szfy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1265\" /></p><h2>The Dyatlov Pass incident (1959)</h2><p>In 1959, in the depths of the Ural Mountains of Russia, an experienced group of trekkers died under mysterious circumstances which were never adequately explained. Investigators discovered that the victims had cut a hole through their tent and run away from something while wearing minimal clothing despite the temperatures being around -30 degrees Centigrade.</p><p>A number of the victims died from hypothermia but some had inexplicable fatal injuries including a fractured skull, major chest fractures and one victim had brain damage despite no visible injury to their skull. Another of the victims was found with major injuries as well as missing tongue, eyes and lips. Several theories have been offered as to what caused the hikers to run and what eventually killed them, but none have been conclusive and their deaths remain a mystery.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image13-2xdx7oypgc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" /></p><h2>The Babushka Lady (1963)</h2><p>In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in his motorcade in Dallas, Texas. Many conspiracy theories and wild claims have centred around the events of that day. Perhaps the least known of which relates to this woman nicknamed \"the Babushka lady\" (thanks to&nbsp;the headscarf she can be seen wearing in photographs).</p><p>Based on images taken from that day, the woman can be seen pointing a camera at the President's car at an angle that would have captured essential footage. Despite this, the woman apparently never came forward and the images from her camera have never been seen.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image14-xz0repqhds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2354\" /></p><h2>The Solway Firth Spaceman (1964)</h2><p>While on a day trip to Burgh Marsh in Cumbria, England, Jim Templeton took several photographs of his daughter, one of which, when developed appeared to show a man in <a href=\"https://drdavidclarke.co.uk/secret-files/the-solway-spaceman-photograph/\" rel=\"\">a white space suit standing behind her</a>.

Described as being around 80 feet in length, with serpent-like features and eyes on top of its head, the creature quickly became known as the Hook Island monster.</p><p>Many <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/the-amazing-hook-island-sea-monster-photos-revisited/\" rel=\"\">theories have debunked the photograph</a> as being either fake or staged, but the myth lives on.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image16-2qqhsyr1vn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1891\" /></p><h2>Bigfoot (1967)</h2><p>Bigfoot is a legend that dates back as far as 1867 with several people reporting seeing giant, \"wild men\" wandering the forests and mountains of the Pacific Northwest parts of the United States and Canada.</p><p>In 1967, filmmakers Roger Patterson&nbsp;and Robert&nbsp;Gimlin&nbsp;captured the most famous and well-known footage of Bigfoot in existence. Its authenticity has been in much dispute in the decades that followed, but there's certainly something compelling about it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image17-caw3d82sqx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1974\" /></p><h2>The Falcon Lake Incident (1967)</h2><p>Another year, another story about a UFO sighting. This time from Manitoba, Canada, where Stefan Michalak apparently saw an unidentified alien craft land nearby when he was out prospecting for gold and silver.</p><p>Stefan approached the craft and apparently heard human-like voices muffled by the engines. He went close enough to poke his head inside the craft and saw \"a maze of lights\" within. He was then startled when the craft took off and injured by a beam of heat that shot from the ship. The heat set fire to his clothes and severely burnt his chest. Doctors and authorities could not explain his injuries and this added credence to his story which he repeated in interviews until his death in 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image18-ur2mquzjox.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1607\" /></p><h2>NASA Lunar Pyramid (1972)</h2><p>In 1972, Apollo 17's mission to the moon came back with several photographs from near Geophone Rock. This photo was marked by NASA as \"blank\" but when enhanced appears to show what looks like a pyramid on the moon.</p><p>This later led to many conspiracy theories that NASA was hiding what was really up there.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image19-jrsn6o4quc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1129\" /></p><h2>The face of Mars (1976)</h2><p>Another NASA related mystery, this time centres around Mars and comes thanks to another photo snapped from outer space. Here, the Viking 1 spacecraft captured photos of Mars' surface that appeared to show a face looking back at the spaceship from the ground.</p><p>More recent photographs with higher resolution lenses have given a clearer picture of the area and now NASA has concluded it may just be a Mesa. This hasn't stopped popular opinion concluding it's a sign of life on Mars.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image20-idjmr7a83u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /></p><h2>The Phoenix Lights (1997)</h2><p>The Phoenix Lights event was probably the biggest known report of UFO sightings in history. On a single day in March 1997, thousands of people reported seeing lights above them in the skies over a 300-mile range through the American Southwest.</p><p>Witnesses claimed to have seen a huge V-shaped UFO passing overhead and making no sound as it moved. No reasonable explanation was offered as to the cause of the sightings and further reports of the UFOs came again in 2007 and 2008.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image21-iqenpxyhoc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1775\" /></p><h2>The Black Knight satellite (1998)</h2><p>There is a myth among UFO conspiracy theorists and enthusiasts that an alien satellite exists and has been in Earth's orbit for around 13,000 years.</p><p>The so-called \"Black Knight\" satellite theory is based on a series of different stories around items of unknown origin orbiting our planet and extra-terrestrial radio signals being picked up on Earth. NASA and other space organisations claim the sightings and photographs are more likely to be space debris or remains of our satellites.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image22-pkpfrubh23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2720\" /></p><h2>The Myakka Skunk Ape (2000)</h2><p>The Myakka Skunk Ape is by most accounts a distant relation Bigfoots. This large ape-like creature has been spotted many times over the years with the earliest sightings dating back to the 1960's but more recently it has also been caught multiple times on video.</p><p>The Skunk Ape mostly inhabits regions of Florida and got its name due to the stink that often accompanies its sightings. Sceptics of the sightings say that it's far more likely to be misidentification of other wildlife including local black bears. Much like the footage of Bigfoot, recordings and photographs of the Skunk Ape are often shaky, low-quality or taken from an extreme distance.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image23-5dwb27q3dr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1100\" /></p><h2>Juvenile Bigfoot (2007)</h2><p>In September 2007, Rick Jacobs placed a motion sensing camera in a tree along the game trails of Pennsylvania. This camera later captured multiple images which appear to show some bears being chased off by an ape-like creature which resembled a juvenile Bigfoot. &nbsp;</p><p>Several witnesses have claimed to see Juvenile Bigfoot over the years, describing them as walking on four legs (unlike Bigfoot who is usually seen on two legs) which have led to them being dismissed as fake or likely to be another animal misidentified.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image24-nkrzmpucob.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1071\" /></p><h2>The&nbsp;Hessdalen lights&nbsp;(2007)</h2><p>Over the valleys of Hessdalen in central Norway, a series of unexplained lights regularly appear through the day and night. Sometimes the lights appear for over an hour, sometimes they're there for just a few seconds. They're a regular occurrence and have had many UFO theorists claiming the lights to be of extra-terrestrial origin.</p><p>Scientists, however, have attributed the lights to a chemical and electrical reaction caused by the different metals and minerals in the local hillside reacting with the environment. Though it's not quite as exciting, it's certainly pretty.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image25-yklprow2rd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1088\" /></p><h2>The Raystown Ray (2007)</h2><p>Another body of water said to contain an aquatic monster is the Raystown Lake in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Here, a creature not too dissimilar to the Loch Ness Monster has been spotted and photographed many times over the years.</p><p>Much like Nessie, there's not much proof beyond photographs taken from a distance that prove or disprove the existence of the creature, but it's certainly a popular local legend.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image26-mgdsxvbvgc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" /></p><h2>The Hubble Pyramid (2008)</h2><p>From around 1999, the Hubble telescope was pointed at the moon and captured a number of images. One of these photographs, never officially released by NASA, appears to show a pyramid on the surface.</p><p>This is the second sighting of a pyramid-like object on the moon, the first being captured during Apollo 17's mission, but neither has been accurately explained or had its authenticity confirmed by the authorities. Thus, the mystery of the moon pyramids continues.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image27-yrtlviscpd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /></p><h2>The Baltic Sea anomaly (2011)</h2><p>In 2011, a Swedish diving team discovered a mysterious formation on the bottom of the Baltic Sea. Sonar imagery appeared to show a strange disc-like object 60 meters in diameter with many unusual characteristics that include a long runway running up it, a stairway at the side and a light soot covering.&nbsp;</p><p>Explanations for the object have included everything from a crashed UFO to a naturally occurring geological formation. It has even been likened to the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. Not much else is known about the object, though it is purported that it could be as much as 140,000 years old.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image28-tpdelnigcr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1198\" /></p><h2>The death of Elisa Lam (2013)</h2><p>In 2013, Elisa Lam was staying at the Hotel Cecil in Los Angeles. She went missing during her stay and was later discovered in the water tank on the hotel's roof. There were several unusual facts about the case which made it mysterious, including a video released by the LAPD of her getting into a lift, pressing multiple buttons and apparently trying to hide from someone.</p><p>Access to the hotel roof was blocked at the time of her death and both toxicology and coroner reports showed no visible trauma or reason for her passing. Though her death was officially labelled as \"accidental drowning\" there have been many other theories that include her being victim to a serial killer.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image29-l8ykojd4qq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"845\" /></p><h2>The Portuguese Chupacabra (2016)</h2><p>The legend of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra\" rel=\"\">Chupacabra</a> finds it roots in the Americas, where a creature is said to wander the lands attacking and killing livestock and drinking the blood from their remains. Reports of Chupacabra have since come from all over the world and in 2016 a video was captured in the Portuguese desert.</p><p>The video appears to show a man-like beast walking through the desert and then disappearing behind a bush. Much like all the videos of Bigfoot, the footage is long-distance and low quality, so we'll leave it up to you to judge its validity.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/141531-cameras-feature-unexplained-mysteries-and-paranormal-events-image30-bx8lubysdg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" /></p><h2>Unexplained Mars object (2017)</h2><p>There are a few images of Mars which have raised questions about whether there was once life on Mars or indeed whether there still is.</p><p>In 2017, the Mars Curiosity Rover <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/gallery/all/1/p/348/1P159077009EFF40DPP2594L7M1.HTML\" rel=\"\">captured an image</a> which appears to show an unidentified object on the surface of Mars.

Where YouTube is king, more makers are looking for better ways to capture themselves and their surroundings in better quality.</p><p>We pick three of the best options out there - the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/panasonic/152607-panasonic-lumix-g100-mirrorless-vlogging-face-voice\" rel=\"\">Panasonic Lumix G100</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/152309-sony-zv-1-review\" rel=\"\">Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/148530-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-review-3-camera-video\" rel=\"\">Canon Powershot G7 X III</a> - to help you decide which makes best sense to buy and why.</p><p>squirrel_widget_270682</p><h2>Size &amp; Portability</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100: 115.6 x 82.5 x 54.2mm; 412g (with 12-42mm lens)</li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1: 105.5 x 60 x 43.5mm; 294g&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3: 105.5 x 60.9 x 41.4mm; 304g</li> \n </ul><p>Small is sometimes mightiest. While all three of these cameras are small, it's the Sony that will most likely feel lightest and most portable. There's not a huge amount in it.</p><h2>Sensor Size &amp; Lens</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100 \n   <ul> \n    <li>Sensor: 20MP Micro Four Thirds</li> \n    <li>Lens: Interchangeable lens mount \n     <ul> \n      <li>12-32mm kit lens (24-64mm equivalent)</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1 \n   <ul> \n    <li>Sensor: 20MP 1.0-inch Exmor RS CMOS</li> \n    <li>Lens: 24-70mm f/1.8-2.8 equivalent</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3 \n   <ul> \n    <li>Sensor: 20.1MP 1.0-inch stacked CMOS</li> \n    <li>Lens: 24-100mm f/1.8-2.8 equivalent</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n </ul><p>However, there's a big reason for the variance in size: sensor size and each lens' focal length.</p><p>Both Sony and Canon models have fixed-in-place zoom lenses, while Panasonic's G100 is a system camera with interchangeable Micro Four Thirds lenses - which makes it potentially much more versatile (and a bit larger and heavier by comparison).</p><p>All three of these cameras house sensors that are larger than an entry-level compact, which bodes well for quality. The Sony and Canon both use stacked 1-inch size CMOS sensors. The Panasonic has the larger scale sensor, however, which ought to mean greater potential when it comes to background blur and overall quality.</p><p>The kit Panasonic G100 comes with a 12-32mm pancake zoom - which delivers a 24-64mm equivalent zoom. That's the same on the wide-angle as the 24-70mm of the Sony ZV-1 and the 24-100mm of the Canon G7 X III. Note that the Canon can zoom the furthest - i.e. make farther away subjects look closer-up in the frame.</p><h2>Audio, Mic Input</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100: OZO Audio by Nokia (audio tracking / positioning), 3.5mm mic input, micro HDMI out</li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1: 3.5mm mic input, micro HDMI out, deadcat wind-shield included</li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3: 3.5mm mic input, micro HDMI out</li> \n </ul><p>A big reason to buy a dedicated camera for video is for its audio abilities. All three of these cameras offer a 3.5mm microphone input, so you can connect an accessory microphone as you please - whether that's a directional shotgun mic, a wireless mounted mic, or any other number of possibilities.</p><p>However, you won't necessarily always want to use a microphone. It's here that Sony comes up trumps by including what's called a deadcat in the box - a fluffy microphone cover that sits up top and stops wind noise from creating those 'tearing' sounds.</p><p>The most advanced of the lot, however, is Panasonic's Lumix G100. For the first time in a camera this includes OZO Audio by Nokia, which utilises the three onboard microphones to record in a directional format - you can define whether you want behind, in front, or subject tracked to be sound isolated. That's the real big winner: the system's autofocus includes face detection which can be audio synched, so as the subject moves through the frame the OZO tech will use the right proportion of microphones to channel that audio isolation. Very clever.</p><p>squirrel_widget_254445</p><h2>Screen &amp; Viewfinder</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100: 3-inch 1,840k-dot vari-angle touchscreen LCD; built-in 3,680k-dot EVF</li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1: 3-inch 921k-dot vari-angle touchscreen LCD; no EVF</li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3: 3-inch 1,040k-dot vertical tilt-angle touchscreen LCD; no EVF</li> \n </ul><p>Traditional cameras aren't great for vlogging on account of their fixed screens. All three of these cameras, however, offer mounted LCD screens that can be repositioned: the Canon's flips forward vertically; the Sony's and Panasonic's are side-mounted and therefore offer even more versatile position potential.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of screen resolution the Panasonic is far and away the most resolute - although at arm's length we doubt you'll notice a huge difference in this, and actually more dots on screen is just more of a battery drain.</p><p>Of the three cameras only the Panasonic has a built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF). This is more for shooting still images or shielding from sunlight to better judge exposure and composition - so certainly has its use cases.</p><h2>Video Credentials</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>All models: Up to 4K at 30fps \n   <ul> \n    <li>Panasonic: Up to 9mins 59secs</li> \n    <li>Sony: Up to 5mins due to avoid overheating</li> \n    <li>Canon: Up to 9mins 59secs</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100: 1080p at 60fps (29m 59s maximum)</li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1: 1080p at 120fps (29m 59s maximum)</li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3: 1080p at 120fps (29m 59s maximum)</li> \n </ul><p>Being vlogging targeted, all three cameras cater for 4K resolution at 30fps maximum (and with 100Mbps in all cases, ensuring there's enough data for optimum quality). However, the Sony can only record for half the time compared to the other two to avoid overheating - and even then the Canon and Panasonic max out at 10 minutes at this resolution.</p><p>If you're looking for Full HD recording to up your recording time, save on bandwidth, storage space, and editing processing pressures then all three cameras can cater for that too.</p><p>Slow-motion is best handled by the Sony, with Full HD at 240fps/480fps/960fps available. The Canon offers 120fps slow-motion. The Panasonic's spec sheet says 120fps sensor output is possible too - but that in-camera capture is 60fps.</p><h2>Stabilisation</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Panasonic Lumix G100: 5-axis hybrid stabilisation (4-axis for 4K video)</li> \n  <li>Sony Vlog Camera ZV-1: Steadyshot for Movie hybrid stabilisation</li> \n  <li>Canon PowerShot G7 X M3: 5-axis Advanced Dynamic IS &amp; Auto Level</li> \n </ul><p>Stabilisation is important when it comes to video. Although you may wish to buy a handheld gimbal for extra stabilisation for those ultra-smooth video results.</p><p>All three cameras offer hybrid stabilisation systems - that's to say there's optical lens-shift working in tandem with electronic stabilisation (using a portion of the sensor as a buffer to counter motion). We've not tested these three side by side so can't say which is best of the bunch.</p><p>squirrel_widget_160674</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The big question: which one to choose? Well, if price comes into the equation then the Sony is the priciest of the lot. That might be a bit of a surprise when the Panasonic offers a more advanced audio isolation system, has a larger sensor size, and interchangeable lenses.</p><p>If size is your biggest concern then the Sony is the lightest of the bunch, which helps in terms of portability. It's also got the most muscle when it comes to slow-motion options - although its 4K capture is more time-limited than the other two.</p><p>The decision, as they say, is yours.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:01:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152639-cameras-news-feature-panasonic-g100-vs-sony-zv-1-vs-canon-g7-x-iii-image1-g2ad3ntokw.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"c47d8013ed60744c71e770a94ebc13d7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-50-613_098180e6419e9918.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":50147,"destBytes":29002,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152639-cameras-news-feature-panasonic-g100-vs-sony-zv-1-vs-canon-g7-x-iii-image1-g2ad3ntokw.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-50-613_098180e6419e9918.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209017},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Amazing images of our moon in all shapes and sizes","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/147588-amazing-images-of-our-moon","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/147588-cameras-feature-amazing-images-of-our-moon-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-image1-bruv1hpm4j.jpg?v1\"> <p>It's now over 50 years since the human race went to the moon with the first moon landing by Apollo 11 happening on 20 July 1969.

Often, that's because, while the camera might be powerful, the lighting conditions might not be quite right, or your hand might be shaking a tiny bit, or any number of other reasons. Enter the likes of PolarPro, which makes amazing attachments for your smartphone to level up your mobile photography.&nbsp;</p><p>It's got a new range of accessories dropping for the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max - <a href=\"https://www.polarprofilters.com/pages/litechaser-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LiteChaser Pro</a>, which will take your photos and video up a notch, and we wanted to run you through just what benefits you could reap from picking them up. If you think a&nbsp;complete filter system for iPhone 11 could improve your photography, read on.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151357-phones-news-upgrade-your-mobile-photography-with-polarpros-litechaser-for-the-iphone-11-image2-s7crxdgcpi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Get a grip</h2><p>The core part of PolarPro's LiteChaser system is a case for your phone, which unlocks its potential by allowing you to clip on various other accessories. In itself, though, it's a great bit of protection that looks nice and sleek, and won't draw attention to itself when you're not in the middle of shooting.&nbsp;</p><p>The case lets you clip on LiteChaser filters over the phone's camera unit (more on those later). It also lets you clip on an adjustable grip unit for better handling.</p><p>The grip is perfect for making sure that you're in control of your shot at all times, but it's even got its own secrets. You can use it to mount your phone&nbsp;on most tripods - a package that'll see you converting your iPhone into your 'A' camera in no time.&nbsp;</p><h2><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151357-phones-news-upgrade-your-mobile-photography-with-polarpros-litechaser-for-the-iphone-11-image3-t0iktufomj.jpg\" /></h2><h2>Mount it</h2><p>That mounting option means that you can really use your phone in a myriad of ways - you might want it on a tripod, or you might want it handheld, but the grip is great regardless. A low-profile rail means that you can position it wherever you need on the back of the phone, plus you can easily rotate it into a portrait position if you're shooting in vertical.</p><p>Plus, there's even a mount on top of the grip, too, which is perfect for connecting microphones or lights which will even further elevate your shooting toward the sort of performance previously reserved for DSLR cameras.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151357-phones-news-upgrade-your-mobile-photography-with-polarpros-litechaser-for-the-iphone-11-image4-kgpds18vfx.jpg\" /></p><h2>ND filters and polarizer</h2><p>Of course, in many ways the heart of PolarPro's system is its filters, and there are three superb options available for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.&nbsp;PolarPro wanted to take what they were known for, their prestigious line of filters, and adapt it to a mobile system. Precision light control is essential when creating high-end content, which is why PolarPro custom-engineered a line of filters to be compatible with LiteChaser Pro.&nbsp;</p><h4>ND8 (3-Stop) &amp; ND64 (8-Stop)</h4><p>These neutral density filters will make sure that you're getting the right amount of light through to your lenses, and give your footage a more professional feel, ready for cinematic-style edits.&nbsp;</p><h4>Variable ND (3-5 Stop)</h4><p>This little filter is an easy way into top-level shooting, letting you switch up how much light you're letting in on the fly so that you can shoot at lower framerates.

<p>There are lots of things to think about when choosing a new compact camera – what do you want to use the camera for? Perhaps you want a versatile, all-rounder for a vacation or travelling. Maybe you want a camera with a bonkers-long zoom?</p><p>Here at Pocket-lint we've been cutting through the abundance of compact camera releases over recent years, including the creme de la creme of last year's models and earlier, as relevant.</p><p>We've broken down our list of great compacts into sub-headed categories to make things easier to digest. You name it, we've got you covered.&nbsp;So without further ado let's guide you through the top compact cameras to save you time when it comes to buying one from your local shop or online.</p><h2>Best do-it-all compact</h2><p class=\"align-center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/120768-cameras-buyer-s-guide-best-compact-cameras-2019-the-best-point-and-shoot-cameras-available-to-buy-today-image1-fgxltmfatb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><h3>Panasonic Lumix TZ90 / SZ70</h3><p>squirrel_widget_140940</p><p>Panasonic's TZ-series has long been a favourite and the Lumix TZ90 (SZ70 in the USA) is one of its top-end do-it-all compacts (although it has been replaced by the altogether similar TZ95). It even has a built-in electronic viewfinder to the rear, which is helpful to see an image direct to the eye when sunlight makes the rear screen tough to see.</p><p>The TZ90's premier feature is its 30x optical zoom lens, which encompasses wide-angle (24mm equivalent) for those group shots, or can zoom right in (to a 720mm equivalent) to make far-away subjects appear large in the frame.

There's an autofocus system that will see off a whole range of compact camera competitors, a fast 24-75mm f/1.7-2.8 equivalent lens, and brilliant electronic viewfinder.

And now that comes with a fantastic \"electronic rangefinder\" option for even more accurate manual focus.</p><p>That may all sound bonkers, but it's not: think of a wider-than-100-per-cent optical viewfinder with all the bells and whistles of an electronic overlay and that's what the X100T delivers. You can see beyond the frame's edges to help capture the shot at that decisive moment.</p><p>Image quality from the fixed 23mm f/2.0 lens – that's a 35mm equivalent when paired with the APS-C sensor – is so crisp from f/4.0 and below, in part thanks to Fujifilm's own special colour array design and the fact there's no low-pass filter to bypass light diffusion for heightened sharpness.

But its huge full-frame sensor, which is the same size as found in pro-spec DSLR cameras, is paired with a lens so sharp that its results are incredible.

champion","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/151739-fuji-x100v-review-fujifilm","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-m6ezeivnuw.jpg?v1\"> <p>For years Fujifilm has been making the finest fixed-lens cameras in its X100 series. These street photography cameras are certainly specialist - given the retro styling, unusual viewfinder, and lack of zoom - but there's nothing else that can compete in this class.</p><p>Back in February 2020, around two-and-a-half years after the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/140051-fujifilm-x100f-review-fixed-lens-finery\" rel=\"\">release of the X100F</a>, Fujifilm revealed an eagerly-awaited update: the X100V. So what's new for this fixed-lens camera that might attract you to buy one?</p><h2>Is the X100V's design new?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Adds 4K video</li> \n  <li>New ergonomic grip</li> \n  <li>New lens construction</li> \n  <li>Adds touchscreen controls</li> \n  <li>Adds vari-angle bracket for screen</li> \n  <li>Adds weather-sealing (requires adapter ring &amp; filter, sold separately)</li> \n  <li>26.1-megapixel X-Trans CMOS IV sensor (new generation ups resolution from 24MP)</li> \n </ul><p>While Fujifilm hasn't gone back to the drawing board for the X100V - in that it looks much the same as the X100F - there are some nips and tucks. According to the original press release, the grip has been redesigned. But having now handled the camera, we can't find any noticeable difference with it. No biggie, though, as the subtle curve of this grip works just fine for a camera that doesn't have a massive lens on the front.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-umz2ji7zpr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>A much bigger change is that the LCD screen can now flip out away from the body, up to 90-degrees vertically, or about 30-degrees facing downward. This has been implemented really nicely, without excessive bulk, just a little nub to the side of the screen to aid in pulling it away from the camera body. Or leave it in a fixed position, as the choice is yours.</p><p>There's also the prospect of weather-sealing. You'll need to attach the AR-X100 adapter ring and PRF-49 protection filter to achieve that resistance, none of which comes in the box. We think Fujifilm should have gone all-out in making the X100V sealed straight out of the box really. Although such sealing won't be an essential for everyone.</p><h2>Anything missing?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Lens is still a bit noisy</li> \n  <li>Close-focus sharpness limitations</li> \n  <li>No exposure compensation dial lock</li> \n </ul><p>Front-on and the X100V looks identical to earlier X100F. Some changes in moving controls have taken place around the back to accommodate the bracket-mounted screen, but in general you're getting the same fairly large scale compact and all the goodness that brings.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-ea50oj8q21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>We looked back over our X100F review from 2017 and it's clear that the X100V takes many minor complaints we had back then and solves them. For example: that bracket-mounted screen now includes touch control, bringing this camera into the modern world of hands-on operation. There's also 4K video, should that be your thing.</p><p>It's only really with the exposure compensation dial where nothing has changed. It still can't be locked into position, which sees ours spin into the wrong position from time to time. Not the end of the world, but it'd be great to see this solved.</p><h2>How does the X100V handle?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>23mm Fujinon single focal length lens (equates to 35mm), f/2.0-f/16 aperture with ring control</li> \n  <li>Hybrid optical/electronic rangefinder-style viewfinder unique to this camera series</li> \n  <li>35mm (equivalent) focal length; 50/70mm (equivalent) crop options available</li> \n  <li>425-point autofocus system</li> \n </ul><p>At first glance you might think the X100V's lens is identical to its predecessors. In many regards it is: the focal length, a 35mm equivalent, is the very same. So is the f/2.0 maximum aperture and manual control ring. The difference lies in the construction: although the eight elements arranged in two groups remains the same, two of those elements are now aspherical (in the X100F it was just one molded ASPH element).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-srjo861nsp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>Why is this useful? Aspherical lenses are a more oval shape and help to deliver a 'flatter' image appearance because the lens doesn't bulge in a spherical way. This will, for example, make for more natural portraits from a relatively wide-angle lens. The new lens is also said to be capable of resolving higher resolution, delivering lower distortion, and focusing closer to subjects - all things that we've wanted from this series in the past. Yay.</p><p>However, the close-focus distance of the X100V is the very same as the X100F, at up to 10cm from lens. And if you're shooting with a wide open aperture then you still won't be able to resolve crisp detail in such close-up shots. There's nothing to stop you shooting at f/2.0 but close-to-lens subjects won't be sharp, even if they're within the focal plane, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/151739-fuji-x100v-review-fujifilm\" rel=\"follow\">delivering a milky 'halo' as a result</a>. The camera doesn't warn of this - it's just something you have to learn as you go.</p><p>Still, as high-end compact cameras go, we love the X100V. It's a camera like no other - in looks and operation - and we've always had such a soft spot for this camera series. Drop the aperture for f/4.0 and you'll squeeze a lot more sharpness potential out of it. Coupled with the large sensor size that still enables shallow depth of field control no problems.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-fesbgtplqi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>The autofocus system also offers a huge spread of focus points throughout the screen's breath, and with the ability to adjust their size they function in a fairly pinpoint fashion. Of the 425 autofocus points, there's a 117-point option, while combination of phase-detection and contrast-detection systems makes for good performance. The more sensitive points are outlined as distinct, larger squares so you know what's what.</p><p>However, the lens is quite noisy when shifting focus. The mechanical sounds are reminiscent of a miniature printer seeking out its ink.</p><p>The addition of optional touch control is really handy, especially with the screen tilted outward for waist-level work. You may not go using the screen that much though. It's the viewfinder that really sells the X100V. It's always been the pinnacle of this camera series: offering a wider-than-100-per-cent optical view, so you can predict what's coming into the frame, thanks to a digital border outlining the edges of the shot you're about to capture. Just make sure you're keeping a keen eye on that digital white outline - as that's where the picture magic happens.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-8g7qxisz5g.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>When adjusting to the 50/70mm crop options, that digital border moves - you'll see it get smaller within the view, to represent the new capture area. Parallax adjustment is also catered for in this situation, which means the frame edge will move accordingly if you've focused on a closer subject (necessary given the different placement of the viewfinder window and through-the-lens alignment to the sensor) to accurately focus on what you intend.</p><p>A flick of the X100V's finder switch - which is positioned towards the front - opens up an in-camera rangefinder-style preview window to the bottom right corner, which can be used to view the whole frame, or 2.5x or 6.5x magnification, to see exactly what you're doing. Flick the finder switch the other way and the whole viewfinder goes fully electronic - which can be handy, as it means zero parallax error (everything is operating through-the-lens) - but we far prefer the more fluid vision of the optical viewfinder with its electronic overlay. It's a thing of beauty.</p><h2>What's the X100V's image quality like?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>26.1-megapixel X-Trans CMOS IV sensor</li> \n  <li>ISO 160 - 12,800 (80 - 51,200 ext.)</li> \n  <li>4-stop ND filter built-in</li> \n </ul><p>The X100V doesn't lavish the image sensor with lots more resolution compared to its predecessor. The bump from 24- to 26-megapixels is all you're getting for this generational jump. But that's a sensible approach: overloading the sensor with too many 'pixels' would mean they would be smaller and less able of gathering light.</p><p>As it stands the X100V can deliver exceptional quality, but it's situationally dependent. As we've pointed out prior, a lens and sensor combination such as this can't handle close-up focus with a wide open aperture. Even if you're shooting 30cm from the lens you won't want to shoot wide open at f/2.0 - we'd suggest stopping down at least once stop to deliver the best possible crispness.&nbsp;</p><p>The sensor has an wide-ranging sensitivity, although it begins at ISO 160, which isn't necessarily the best pairing with such a wide aperture lens. Thankfully there's an extended ISO setting, but more usefully - in order to maintain the dynamic range of the image data - is the built-in neutral density (ND) filter, which can step in for up to four stops.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-photos-image1-3pojwjo6v8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>We've found the lower sensitivities to deliver crisp and colourful images, although when pushing into four-figure numbers the precision detail isn't quite as present (a number of ISO 2500 examples show this). Not that you'll capture lots of image noise within a frame thanks to the large sensor and processing abilities. The lens really is great, assuming the subject is just far enough away.</p><p>Another potential perk with the X100V is the leaf shutter within the lens. This opens in an outward-from-centre motion, rather than upward focal-plane motion, which means much higher flash sync speeds are possible. It's great for catching flash-lit subjects while causing the background to not receive the same degree of lighting and, therefore, provide a darker appearance - like the subject is highlighted beyond it, even in outdoor scenes.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-photos-image1-fgbxpi4nbq.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>During times of lockdown it's rather hard to test a camera, but on our evening exercise sessions we've been stopping to quickly shoot market stalls, flowers and such like - all hands-off - to get a greater understanding of how the new lens fares. We must say that distortion is very low, so in terms of setting up those perfectly straight-line shots the X100V is ideal. Sharpness dwindles only a little towards the edges, which is very impressive.</p><p>Overall, this is a specialist camera designed for a particular and meticulous way of working. If that suits you down to the ground then, well, prepare to be blown away with the overall quality that you'll be able to get - and the process of getting there.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-m6ezeivnuw.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"bbb08b99965d2960bb8e34e557fbffcb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-36-51-234_47242ac6ecd84375.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":76716,"destBytes":50540,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-m6ezeivnuw.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-36-51-234_47242ac6ecd84375.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-umz2ji7zpr.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-04-303_e93fc64562d7da80.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-ea50oj8q21.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn9@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-12-937_c42a25962a3555b0.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-srjo861nsp.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-36-55-605_c0f2fc810ebe1ef6.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-fesbgtplqi.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-06-788_75738e8bab13b228.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-image1-8g7qxisz5g.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-36-58-738_1d67a042b1d94118.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-photos-image1-3pojwjo6v8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn21@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-37-21-285_eead8a022054ee95.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151739-cameras-review-fujifilm-x100v-review-photos-image1-fgbxpi4nbq.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-37-09-033_f6bf589f41a67561.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209020},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"58 insanely neat photos of cables that belong in a modern art gallery","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141628-48-insanely-neat-photos-of-cables-that-belong-in-a-modern-art-gallery","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/141628-cameras-feature-ocd-cable-porn-image1-oyzsp4buna.jpg?v1\"> <p>There's a certain breed of IT worker who has a deep fetish for all things neat and tidy.</p><p>The result is a server room with hundreds of cables neatly organised, cable-tied and manipulated into perfect angles.

So what's new in this forthcoming mirrorless camera?</p><p>First thing's first: the X-T4 features the same sensor and processor <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/145646-fuji-xt3-review-fujifilm\" rel=\"\">as the earlier X-T3</a> - that's a 26-megapixel X-Trans CMOS IV, if you're wondering - meaning the image quality potential between the two cameras is one and the same.</p><p>Where the X-T4 steps things up is in a few main areas.</p><p>First, it's got a new in-body stabilisation system, said to support for up to 6.5 stops, paired with a new shutter system that's capable of shooting up to 15 frames per second (15fps).</p><p>Second, there's a new battery system. The cells are far more capacious than the outgoing model, which means they're longer-lasting, but also larger as a result - therefore the X-T4 is about 10 per cent bigger and heavier than the X-T3.</p><p>Third up, the video mode - or movie mode, if you prefer - has its own dedicated switch to activate. This takes the camera into movie-only functionality, with a dedicated silent menu if you need to change settings. Plus the Full HD (1080p) mode can now shoot at 240fps for one eigth slow-mo (the 4K mode remains at 60fps, if you want Ultra-HD instead).</p><p>That's the X-T4 in summary.

Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/fujifilm/145646-fuji-xt3-review-fujifilm\" rel=\"\">the X-T3 won Best Camera</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/139556-pocket-lint-gadget-awards-winners\" rel=\"\">2019 Pocket-lint Awards</a>.</p><p>Now there's a new kid in town: the Fujifilm X-T4. But does this latest camera add enough extra to warrant its purchase? We got to play with a pre-production camera ahead of its official announcement, so here's what you can expect.</p><h2>X-T4 vs X-T3: What's new?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>X-T4 adds: \n   <ul> \n    <li>New in-body stabilisation unit (IBIS)</li> \n    <li>New shutter unit (15fps mechanical)</li> \n    <li>Dedicated movie mode</li> \n    <li>New battery system</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n </ul><p>At a glance the X-T4 looks a lot like its X-T3 younger brother. But there are some clear differences. The newer camera is a little larger and heavier, on account of a new battery system that's designed to last longer.</p><p>Some weight has been shed elsewhere, to avoid it getting altogether too heavy, by introducing a newer, smaller in-body stabilisation system, which is said to be capable up to 6.5 stops (up from the 5 stops of the X-H1, where in-body was first introduced by Fujifilm).</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-9itqfl3dkb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>In tandem with the stabilisation system is a new shutter mechanism, capable of up to 15 frames per second (15fps) burst shooting. It's also tested to 300,000 shutter cycles, doubling the durability over the X-T3.</p><p>Other little tweaks should make a big difference for movie users: a dedicated movie mode, with its own Q Menu on-screen settings (useful for silent adjustment), and even a removable SD card door, should you be shooting from a rig. The rear LCD screen is also a little higher in resolution than before (1.62m-dot compared to 1.04m-dot).</p><p>Elsewhere the specification is built around the same core as the X-T3: this means the X-T4 has the same sensor and processor combination, same on-sensor autofocus capabilities (albeit with some algorithm tweaks to improve tracking and face/eye-detection). So if you're looking for higher resolution or advances iin quality in that area, then the two cameras don't differ.</p><h2>How does the X-T4 perform?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>New magnesium alloy body footprint: 134.6mm x 92.8mm x 63.8mm / 607g</li> \n  <li>3-inch tri-adjustable LCD touchscreen, 1.62m-dot resolution</li> \n  <li>0.5-inch, 3.69m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</li> \n  <li>Improved autofocus algorithm</li> \n  <li>425 selectable AF areas</li> \n </ul><p>The X-T4 is made primarily from magnesium alloy, which gives it a robust feeling in the hand. It's also weather-resistant, so paired with a suitable lens you needn't worry about splashes and rain.</p><p>The X-T4 is larger than the X-T3 given its new battery system, but that extra little bit of bulk and 10 per cent weight increase is worth it on account of longevity. The new battery is 2,200mAh in capacity, which is a big increase over the 1,260mAh of the X-T3's cell. Fujifilm says you can expect over 500 shots per charge as a result.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-efv7ek5itm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>There's also a new vertical grip, which can house two additional batteries, and comes with a dedicated switch to flick between normal, boost and economy performance modes. The X-T3 grip won't fit onto the X-T4 due to the new battery system and different camera footprint.</p><p>Recharging takes place via USB-C, much like an Android phone, but you'll need to use a 15W charger at the wall for the fastest possible recharge times. It'll take about three hours to recharge the one cell, which isn't especially quick, but use a low power USB port and it'll take three or four times longer than that!</p><p>The X-T4 has the now staple rear LCD and OLED viewfinder setup. The vari-angle touchscreen is easy to use, benefits from that added resolution, while the X-T4's OLED finder is the exact same as found in the X-T3. That means it's got all the resolution you'll need, complete with a high refresh-rate, deep contrast, and a massive 0.75x equivalent magnification size - which makes for a formidable finder scale to this eye.</p><p>If you're familiar with the X-T3's autofocus - which we found did a great job at the Goodwood Revival motor show - then it's much the same with the X-T4. The camera uses a massive 2.16-million phase-detection pixels embedded across its sensor's surface, designed to cover the full width from edge to edge. That means you can focus anywhere in the field of view, as far vertically or horizontally as you wish, and still acquire the same focus ability as you would in the centre.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-ebiogrmdu3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>The autofocus system is pared down to 425 areas maximum, which can be further reduced to simplify operation as you wish. The AF point can be adjusted between a variety of point sizes, too, by using the rear thumbwheel. There's still no Panasonic-style Pinpoint mode, however, which we always miss when using other brands' mirrorless cameras.</p><p>Fujifilm claims the X-T4 has tweaked the tracking and face/eye-detection for the better, but we've not been able to shoot in suitable scenarios as yet to discern any major difference.</p><p>With a decent lens on the front and the X-T4 is a formidable shooting machine (yes, we know, it's pictured here with a basic 18-55mm kit lens, but Fujifilm offers plenty of better glass). From its 15fps burst, to the various custom settings (much like you'll find in a pro DSLR, in a scenario-appropriate format), mirrorless system cameras don't really get any better than this.</p><h2>What's the X-T4's image quality like?</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>26-megapixel X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor</li> \n  <li>ISO 160-12,800 (80-51,200 ext)</li> \n  <li>New: Eterna Beach Bypass filter</li> \n </ul><p>Just like the X-T3, the X-T4 features Fujifilm's fourth-generation X-Trans CMOS sensor. This sensor is backside illuminated, with the copper wiring placement beneath the photo diodes in the sensor, in order to create a cleaner signal path.</p><p>That all worked a treat in the X-T3 and it's much the same here: image quality is exemplary. Although, as we always say, a lot of that comes down to the lens on the front of the camera. And Fujifilm's range of optics means there's something for more or less every situation. The 18-55mm we've used for this preview is fine, but not the hottest ticket, we've found the 40-150mm f/2.8 and 50mm f/2.0 to impress us much more - especially those wider aperture lenses.</p><p>We've shot with the X-T4 in and around Fujifilm's House of Photography in central London, where there's a variety of light sources and situations. That's given a broad scope to test out the baseline ISO 160 sensitivity, right through to the higher ISO 12,800 setting when shooting a vase of flowers in the dim-lit (off public limits) basement at the property.</p><p>Low-light will show some grain, of course, but it's not overwhelming by any measure and even the four-figure ISO settings are really clean looking. But daylight is where things really shine, those lower settings giving real clarity.</p><p>We've always praised Fujifilm for its image quality prowess, a trend that the X-T4 continues. No, it's not more resolute or more advanced than the X-T3, which some will see as a downer, but as that camera was already accomplished you're really looking to buy this newer model for its better battery, faster burst rate and improved image stabilisation (although it's a marginal improvement in that regard).</p><h2>The X-T4's new video capabilities</h2>\n <ul> \n  <li>Dedicated movie mode, via physical switch dial</li> \n  <li>Dedicated Q Menu with silent mode selection</li> \n  <li>4K 60fps maximum, 1080p 240fps slow-mo</li> \n  <li>Can fix crop to 1.29x for all modes</li> \n </ul><p>The X-T4 has also clearly been engineered with the videographer in mind. Not only on account of the better battery and removable SD card door, but also the dedicated movie mode, which is activated via a physical switch beneath the shutter speed dial atop the camera.</p><p>Moving this switch over to 'Movie' means you get a dedicated Q Menu, which is accessible during shooting and means silent adjustment of modes is possible using the touchscreen. The physical dials will also work, but if you want to avoid the physical motion and clicking sounds then this is one way around it.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-gbmzkaqcsz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"499\" /></p><p>The frame-rate possibility has also increased, with Full HD (1080p) now available at up to 240fps. Some would call that slow-motion to one eighth the speed of a normal 30fps capture. The X-T4 is also 4K capable, offering 60fps in this Ultra-HD mode (just like the X-T3).</p><p>All this adds up to a much more accomplished and movie-focused device, in an attempt to outsmart the Panasonic and Sony options on the market.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 05:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-ni1tzg6q09.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"512eb209106a4e441241785e97fa22d5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-097_2e3848b8f1ea659b.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":79106,"destBytes":43508,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-ni1tzg6q09.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-36-51-097_2e3848b8f1ea659b.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-9itqfl3dkb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-37-21-388_775a47fb18ee9837.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-efv7ek5itm.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-37-04-427_05438646e49a344b.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-ebiogrmdu3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn18@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-13-053_beca35ca1ecdd82e.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151202-cameras-review-hands-on-fujifilm-x-t4-review-image1-gbmzkaqcsz.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-36-56-909_a4e9ee23762a77fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209022},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Staggering images of Mars like you've never seen before","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/147538-staggering-images-of-mars","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/147538-cameras-feature-staggering-images-of-mars-like-youve-never-seen-before-image1-ubnktz64li.jpg?v1\"> <p>It might be nicknamed the red planet, but there's a lot more to Mars than just rocks and red dust.

For 2020 that will be an as-yet-unnamed APS-C sensor model, which has been explored in a little more depth in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=0001&amp;v=vXd47-xBXSU&amp;feature=emb_logo\" rel=\"\">a company YouTube video</a>. </p><p>The big reveal is this new K-series camera - which we could assume to be a \"K80\" - has an all-new viewfinder that presents a massive image to the eye.</p><p>Optical viewfinders use magnitication, which is typically 0.9x (for APS-C models anyway); the new Pentax model will have 1.05x magnification - delivering an image size that's larger than any equivalent competitor for a camera of this type.</p><p>Pentax says the finder uses special glass to minimise refraction, to deliver a distortion free and clear image - right to the edges. The finder also protrudes 3mm from the rear of the camera, to help avoid nose contact with the LCD screen - a screen which auto-dims when the finder is in use to avoid being a distraction.</p><p>The new DSLR will also offer a new battery grip designed for both portrait and landscape orientation use.</p><p>So when can we expect the new Pentax K-series? The company says it's still on course for the end of 2020, with assurances from factory managers and suppliers.

It shows just how rugged the conditions for many were when settlements were being established, but also how people got on with their lives nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image2-mkxtpcs7ug.jpg\" /></p><h2>A real character</h2><p>We love this photo for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the cheeky grin on Fred Loring's face - this is him showing off his mule, named \"Evil Merodach\", which for our money has to be in the running for greatest pet name ever. Just two days later, Loring would be killed by Apaches - it was that sort of time.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image3-u5iw31eixp.jpg\" /></p><h2>Distant threat</h2><p>This image shows a correspondent from the San Francisco Bulletin taking notes on the battlefield, and we like the contrast between his studious air and the armed wariness of the soldiers to the left of him.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/148556-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs\" rel=\"follow\">33 incredibly interesting photos from history</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image4-bgescqltvr.jpg\" /></p><h2>A nice place to stop</h2><p>This member of an expedition takes a break to sketch by a dried-out canyon bed, before a stunning cliffside. The parasol he's sitting under gives the scene a lovely sense of calm.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image5-bylphpz5cu.jpg\" /></p><h2>Wooded seclusion</h2><p>This image actually shows a photographer in action - John K Hillers is inspecting one of his negatives while camping on a geological surveying trip.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image1-jmk9bp2yuu.jpg\" /></p><h2>Natural Beauty</h2><p>This photograph shows a natural vista in what is now Idaho, and it really is stunning - it might take you a little while to even notice the human figures checking it out for themselves in the foreground.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141701-history-in-colour-amazing-artists-add-colour-to-our-past\" rel=\"follow\">History in colour: Amazing artists add colour to our past</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image1-tx7pbfjb2r.jpg\" /></p><h2>Parched</h2><p>This desert scene might look extremely remote, although it's actually in the Carson Desert, Nevada.

This deconstructed version reminds us that they needed maintenance and, often, assembly.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image1-na1qpfbxld.jpg\" /></p><h2>Traversal</h2><p>When it comes to covering challenging areas, slippery rocks under high sun isn't too nice either, as this party is discovering in Utah in 1909, some time later than most of the photos we've shown so far.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/135231-the-apple-iphone-is-10-years-old-look-how-much-the-iphone-has-changed\" rel=\"follow\">Apple iPhone history: Look how much the iPhone has changed</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image1-nm4vt9x0tb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Charting a course</h2><p>Another image that shows just how difficult it could be moving around the country, this trail on the Pike's Peak road in Colorado in 1911 shows that even into the 20th Century it was still a proper challenge.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151936-homepage-feature-these-old-photos-from-the-american-west-will-make-you-yearn-for-a-better-time-image1-3zcmbhtsy1.jpg\" /></p><h2>A new world</h2><p>Never mind that elsewhere in the country people were no longer relying on horses and carriages - the automobile had arrived in America, as shown by this image from 1912. Road signage, sadly, wasn't up to scratch for some time.&nbsp;</p><p><img

change</h2><p>This image shows a test drive of the new route between Denver and Salt Lake, to see how stable and drivable it was - one of the cars is from the Denver Motor Club, showing how quickly motor cars gained fans in America.&nbsp;</p><p><img

It's like something out of a child's imagination, but is actually just the result of people wanting a splash of colour in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-9qk5gy3oum.jpg\" /></p><h2>Isolation</h2><p>Here, again, you get a splash of colour, this time in an otherwise white-out landscape. This tiny home looks like it might be encrusted in place, but in theory could be picked up like a trailer and driven away. The yellow of the main cabin is a beautiful contrast to the freezing outdoors.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-qnewt0ahot.jpg\" /></p><h2>Construction</h2><p>It's amazing seeing monumental structures in the process of being constructed, and there's something completely otherworldly about seeing these giant elephant heads in India, robbed of their context, with a worker casually holding one in place.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/151442-stunning-photos-from-the-national-sony-world-photography-awards-2020\" rel=\"follow\">Check out these entries from the National category of the 2020 Sony World Photography Awards</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-kgrne5hypz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Tuckered out</h2><p>Part of the story of any sport is the exhaustion afterward, whether you've won or lost.

The mushrooms growing from this tome seem to evoke wizards and witches, but maybe that's just us.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-g5vi3sw4hx.jpg\" /></p><h2>A matter of scale</h2><p>This photograph is an interesting contrast in scales, with the architecturally complex model on the floor drawing the eye. The table above it is more beguiling, especially when you realise that it's an inch off the ground.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-nsvbeoowhx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Shorn</h2><p>We all know the aftermath of a home haircut means sweeping - lots of sweeping. This photo takes that scene and turns it into a lovely meditation on texture, not to mention an ode to a classic-looking chair.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/parenting/news/lego/151241-classic-lego-sets-of-all-time\" rel=\"follow\">Classic Lego sets: Do you remember these all time greats?</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-2oyua0jt9z.jpg\" /></p><h2>Mocked up</h2><p>The models used by trainee doctors to practice their medicine are creepy at the best of times.

This black-and-white monstrosity is tiny, but photographed like this, could be a giant space beast for all you know.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-pmcubin4hv.jpg\" /></p><h2>Big air</h2><p>This kid is shredding it - proving that scooters can get huge air just like skateboards, and making us worry for his safety at the same time. The perspective is brave, and the expression on his face is priceless.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-rwsrkizhnn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Portrait</h2><p>This portrait is of Chantal, a woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the victim of sexual violence perpetrated by soldiers. As part of photographer Denis Rouvre's Unsung Heroes project she talked about her experience. This photo is a raw reminder of the importance photography can carry as an act of witnessing.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-32ryugetfh.jpg\" /></p><h2>A retro look</h2><p>We love the look and feel of this photo - you couldn't tell what decade it was from if you tried. It's a railroad worker in Ukraine, and we're fond of how proud she is of that uniform, paired with those spectacular curtains for a beautiful colour palette.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/140252-30-famous-photoshopped-and-doctored-images-from-across-the-ages\" rel=\"follow\">Famous Photoshopped and doctored images from across the ages</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-7ue6wlxnrj.jpg\" /></p><h2>Captured at work</h2><p>This might be our favourite portrait in this whole collection, a goldfish seller captured on his bike about to drive away. The lighting is sumptuous, while just taking in all the fish on his stand would keep us occupied for some time.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-dxztxkrquw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Precious</h2><p>Pangolins are trafficked in sad numbers, and remain extremely endangered. They're stunning creatures, and extremely beautiful to observe, as this photo demonstrates, picking out the details and outline of each of it scales with lovely skill.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-462c8qdwcz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Texture</h2><p>You might be hard-pressed to guess what this photograph is actually of - we certainly were stumped. It's actually a butterfly's wings under a lot of degrees of magnification.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/145762-bonkers-new-animals-imagined-with-the-power-of-photoshop\" rel=\"follow\">Bonkers new animals imagined with the power of Photoshop</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-kutzdl8eca.jpg\" /></p><h2>Chilly</h2><p>Bears might be more used to the freezing cold than us, but we have to say we still feel pretty sorry for this chilly-looking customer. The frost in his beard is really detailed, while the black and white gives the whole picture a melancholic air.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-dnwsve28c5.jpg\" /></p><h2>Colour grading</h2><p>The grey of these trees is in wonderful contrast to their orange leaves, while the fallen foliage on the water's surface give this a really eerie vibe. It's like something out of True Detective, with the bayou beckoning.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-ldkm8gpszn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Man's mark</h2><p>There's nothing like a remote road to remind you of the extent to which we have remodelled the world's landscapes to suit our ends. This winding road with its endless switchbacks is a textbook example.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-3xu2iyszgz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Clinical</h2><p>Similarly, anytime you forget that we're growing plants, flowers and foodstuffs in almost insane quantities at a time, check out an image like this to remind you that many \"farms\" don't look like much like their name anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/143402-proof-that-photoshop-makes-everything-better\" rel=\"follow\">Proof that Photoshop makes everything better</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-gektyucjip.jpg\" /></p><h2>Symmetry</h2><p>Returning to calmer themes, this beautiful sea gate and two lanterns is shrouded all around by mist to create a scene that wouldn't look out of place in a Miyazaki film. It's a lovely, blanched photograph.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-47holqfjem.jpg\" /></p><h2>A family business</h2><p>It might not look like your own domestic bliss, but this photo of family harmony is delightful. The Bolivian family here have swapped to agriculture because the climate crisis was making their old craft of fishing harder and harder.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-w42ouaizgv.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hellscape</h2><p>And here's the climate crisis represented more forcefully - a natural gas flaring site in Nigeria spews flames into the sky, above a landscape that was once vibrant and full of life, and now looks like somewhere to be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-sa8kepldwg.jpg\" /></p><h2>Pilgrimage</h2><p>Again, the industrial background to this image is impossible to escape. We love the bizarre symbolism of this lone wanderer, decked out in gold, making what looks like a pilgrimage toward a promised land that doesn't hold much allure.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/140252-30-famous-photoshopped-and-doctored-images-from-across-the-ages\" rel=\"follow\">Famous Photoshopped and doctored images from across the ages</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-nysxhbw1fk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Hell on earth</h2><p>If the fossil fuels burning don't evoke the climate crisis, this terrifying image of a true conflagration should. Needless to say, it's from Australia's bushfire crisis, and the lone fire truck puts the scale of destruction into proper context.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-dno3amwhqb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Bleached</h2><p>A more peaceful scene, if still somewhat unsettling, is provided by this photograph of&nbsp;Pardis, near Tehran. The blanched-out colours make for a landscape that almost looks unreal.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-uhz9tibhcp.jpg\" /></p><h2>True pink</h2><p>You don't often see the colour pink in nature, but this superb aerial image of the&nbsp;Lemurian salt lake, Ukraine, shows that where it does arise, it's simply stunning. The addition of a single person gives you a sense of scale and points out the colours all the more vividly.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-0f5ra7xs8v.jpg\" /></p><h2>Athleticism</h2><p>We love how communal this image is, with these wrestlers training against the sand's resistance as a group, all striving for the same goal of excellence and victory. You can see how single-minded each is at the moment captured.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151522-cameras-feature-these-jaw-dropping-photos-from-the-sony-world-photography-awards-will-blow-you-away-image1-3dihu4edxj.jpg\" /></p><h2>True romance</h2><p>We end on a true high note with this photograph of an Iraqi couple taking a boat trip having just been married. The bride picks her way up the rocky beach carefully, her beautiful dress clear and obvious as a beacon, while the groom carefully gets on the boat in the background. One lovely little further detail - in the background, a lone swimmer interrupts the lake's surface.&nbsp;</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:00:00

You've no doubt seen plenty of photos of Lady Liberty over the years, but have you ever seen those taken during her construction?&nbsp;</p><p>Before it was fully built, parts of the statue were constructed in France before shipping to New York. In 1878, the head was shown off at the&nbsp;World's Fair in Paris.&nbsp; Several years later, in 1885, crates containing the main parts of the statue were shipped via&nbsp;French steamer into New York and construction began in earnest. The rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image7-wd3u0ab2xn.jpg\" /></p><h2>Apple clothing</h2><p>Apple has been known for creating some interesting, inspiring and impressive designs over the years.

It's known as a vapour cone and is, in essence, a cloud of condensed water which has formed around the plane as it passes through moist air at high-speed. This F-18 was photographed with a perfect cloud as it pushed into transonic flight. This happens at the point where parts of the aeroplane are supersonic while others remain subsonic. Shock waves and water condensation create a magnificent view of mankind's high-speed travel achievements.</p><p>The first supersonic flight happened in October 1947 when a&nbsp;Bell X-1s reach&nbsp;Mach 1.06 (700 miles per hour), but this image is a brilliant homage to how far that technology has come since.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/148109-the-most-interesting-and-important-aircraft-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">The most interesting and important aeroplanes of all time</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image10-rbv1564lhx.jpg\" /></p><h2>The Bowden Spacelander</h2><p>The Bowden Spacelander was seen as a marvel of post-war design. It was originally created by British designer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bowden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Benjamin Bowden</a> in 1946 and though many were in awe at the time, it wouldn't go into production until over a decade later, by which time people weren't as enthused.

Technology has come a long way. In the 1960s things were a lot different. There weren't many TV channels for a start. It was in&nbsp;1956 that&nbsp;Motorola first introduced its&nbsp;transistorised remote control for television.</p><p>Motorola wasn't the first company to release a remote control - that was&nbsp;Zenith Radio Corporation in 1950 - but it certainly made a push towards convenience in the years that followed. This advert was one of many from that time that pushed the ease of use. No more hassle of getting up to change the channel.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image12-y2jqlo5vnk.jpg\" /></p><h2>Quake II contestants in Lan Party mode</h2><p>Before superfast broadband, PC gamers got together with their hefty machines and large CRT monitors to play. These LAN parties were serious business and certainly a mark on history that a lot of us won't forget.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image13-yrkt0mxvom.jpg\" /></p><h2>Masks for plague prevention</h2><p>This vision from 1912 shows uniformed workers with special gear to help them avoid catching the plague. These individuals were responsible for research into the plague that struck the Philippines at that time. A rare view of terrifying work and brave people carrying it out.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image14-h2ynsqdais.jpg\" /></p><h2>The first photograph of lightning</h2><p>In&nbsp;1882,&nbsp;William Jennings snapped the very first photo of lightning ever to be taken.

Quite a spectacular sight, but something that actually <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/niagara-falls-frozen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">happens quite regularly</a> it seems, though not many get to see it in this full glory.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image18-cx6cbp5y87.jpg\" /></p><h2>The first Disneyland ticket ever sold</h2><p>In 1955, Disneyland opened its gates for the first time. The first ever ticket was sold to Walt Disney's brother&nbsp;Roy O. Disney for $1. The first real customer though was&nbsp;a college student named David MacPherson. Mr&nbsp;MacPherson achieved the honour by getting up at 2 am in the morning to join 6,000 other people queuing to enter the park. He was the first proper guest to enter the park and was given a lifetime pass as a reward.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image19-exkvhsuxvn.jpg\">&nbsp;</img></p><h2>A bicycle for two&nbsp;</h2><p>In&nbsp;1886, this couple posed for a photo outside the White House in Washington D.C. on this two-seater bicycle. Tandem design has come a short distance since then as have the gear people wear when out and about on their bikes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image20-j3xf0vcsdp.jpg\" /></p><h2>Galileo's drawings of the moon</h2><p>Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer who has been famously referred to as the father of several sciences including&nbsp;observational astronomy,&nbsp;modern physics,&nbsp;scientific method and modern science too.</p><p>In 1610 he famously published these images of the moon as he had observed it through a telescope. They were released in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus_Nuncius\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Sidereus Nuncius</a>, an astronomical&nbsp;pamphlet which showed detailed observations of the moon and constellations of the stars. Not quite as incredible as <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/147588-amazing-images-of-our-moon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">the photos of the moon</a> we have seen today, but incredibly impressive for the time.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image21-4qab08nvds.jpg\" /></p><h2>Daredevil pilot</h2><p>This photo from the 1960s appears to show an insanely brave pilot manually restarting his propeller in mid-air. It was actually part of an airshow stunt.</p><p>The photographer explained:</p><p>\"I took this in November 1946 and it shows Merle Larson demonstrating a small air show stunt that he did. It appears that he is alone in the plane but there is another pilot (Gladys Davis) flying the plane from the back seat and he does have a rope tied around himself. Merle was a WWII B-24 pilot, flight instructor, inventor and builder of three unusual planes based at Buchanan Field, Concord, California.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image22-2wuw4y0pmg.jpg\" /></p><h2>One man and his car</h2><p>This image shows a gentleman aged over 100 years old who has been driving the same car, a 1928&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Phantom for well over 80 years. They don't build them like they used to.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image23-fsuwvztie3.jpg\" /></p><h2>Harlem Hellfighters</h2><p>During both the Great War and World War II, African American men and black soldiers fought for the freedom of the world against enemy forces. These particular men were from the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters. They won the Croix de Guerre for gallantry in action during their fight and can be seen here proudly displaying the medals. The original image was black and white but has been colourised so the men can be seen in their full glory here.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image24-zpmr4toqlf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Witches from 1875</h2><p>It is said that this photo shows some Victorian witches posing for a photo in 1875. We have some doubts about how legitimate the image is, but it is nice to imagine ladies of the coven brazenly posing at a time when they wouldn't be burnt at the stake for their craft.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image25-bpfch38rsy.jpg\" /></p><h2>The World Trade Center&nbsp;under construction</h2><p>The construction of the famous World Trade Center building began in 1966 and wasn't finished until 1973. In the meantime, this brilliant view of the towers was captured with sunlight shining through the middle. It's an awesome tribute to a place where many lost their lives tragically in 2001.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image26-9rtufy2kbd.jpg\" /></p><h2>A man buying cigarettes in hospital</h2><p>In the old days, cigarettes were unbelievably marketed as being good for you. As a testament to this daft time, this photo of a man buying cigarettes from his hospital bed was snapped in the 1950s. What a weird time to be alive.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image1-wrqsldcghz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Nikola Tesla, with his equipment</h2><p>This photo from 1899 is not only interesting because it shows the magnificent Nikola Tesla, but because it might also be one of the first doctored images of the time. The experiment that the viewer is witnessing appears to show Tesla sitting nearby while his magnifying transmitter sparks large bolts of electricity through the air.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the image is actually a double exposure, which the man himself admitted at a later dark. The sparks of electricity were snapped in a darkened room when Tesla wasn't there. That photo was exposed again with Tesla safely in the room and the machines off. Still looks impressive though.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image1-rj9wfjgp6k.jpg\" /></p><h2>A child labourer</h2><p>This striking photograph dates back to 1908 and shows a child labourer working in the mills of South Carolina. The photograph said the mill was full of children working like this but that the \"overseer\" of the mill claimed they'd \"just happened in\" to help.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image1-5lwxrbsidk.jpg\" /></p><h2>A&nbsp;Suffragette arrested</h2><p>This photo from 1914 shows the leader of the Women's&nbsp;Suffragette movement being arrested outside Buckingham Palace in 1914. Emmeline Pankhurst was the leader of the movement at the time and was attempting to get a petition to King George V at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">The Suffragette movement</a> was later successful in getting women the vote in 1918.

It shows the aftermath of the attacks of the 11 September and the devastation to the World Trade Center building that's clearly visible in the middle of the photo.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image1-thvcmwrysu.jpg\">&nbsp;</img></p><h2>A&nbsp;self-immolation during the&nbsp;Buddhist crisis</h2><p>This photo dates back to 1963 and is perhaps one of the most instantly recognisable images on our list. It shows&nbsp;Thích Quảng Đức, a&nbsp;Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who set fire to himself as a protest against the&nbsp;persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>The image was one of many historical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">events from the crisis</a>, but by no means the most shocking thing to happen at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/148556-cameras-feature-some-of-the-most-interesting-events-in-history-in-photographs-image1-yrboxsgfml.jpg\" /></p><h2>Crash landing Hellcat</h2><p>This image might be one of the most iconic photos from WW2 and shows a Hellcat that has crash-landed on the desk of the USS Enterprise.

It's interesting because M3 Lee was one of those tanks that were almost obsolete before it even started being useful.

That would put it in early October at the earliest but it seems a little late to us and too close to Black Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/31/amazon-amzn-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actual quote</a> during the call was: \"we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3, as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reports the move is because of distancing measures in warehouses and also to de-prioritise non-essential goods.</p><p>In an official press statement Amazon said that: \"Over the last five years, Prime Day has become a special celebration and time for Prime members to shop incredible deals for themselves and for friends and family – and it’s something we look forward to every year.</p><p>\"This year we’ll be holding Prime Day later than usual... members all around the world will experience Prime Day later this year. We look forward to sharing more details soon.\"</p><p>In 2019, Amazon Prime Day took place over&nbsp;48 hours from 15-16 July and that seemed about right; Amazon was able to sustain a good number of deals for the two days and it was successful from Amazon UK's point of view. So we're expecting the same duration again.&nbsp;</p><p>Prime Day, as the name suggests, was previously centred around a 24-hour period, but 2019 was the first 48-hour Prime Day. In 2018 Amazon Prime Day deals took place for 36 hours across 16-17 July. In July 2017 it was 10-11 July.&nbsp;</p><h2>Do I need to be a Prime member to get Amazon Prime Day deals?</h2><p>Yes - to get Amazon Prime deals you&nbsp;need to be a Prime member. If you're not, it's high time you signed up for Prime membership.It usually costs £79 a year&nbsp;but it is currently £20 off - so £59.99.</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewspocket-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Sign up for Amazon Prime on Amazon UK</a></li> \n </ul><p>Some of the very best deals are always on Amazon devices, but there are stacks across all product categories such as TV, laptops, smart home, fitness, cameras, gaming and more.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/138192-apps-buyer-s-guide-amazon-prime-day---stock-images-image2-8mpr7oaxbv.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p><h2>Can you get Amazon Prime Now on Amazon Prime Day?&nbsp;</h2><p>Yes you can on selected items.

It's called the ZV-1 and it's compact, lightweight, but features a tonne of features vloggers and video makers will find really useful.&nbsp;</p><p>The design of the camera is all focused around making it easy to hold and easy to film yourself. The small grip on the front has enough of a gap between itself and the lens, that you can place your thumb there in order to hold it while pointing it at your face. It also has a bright red LED on the front that flashes while recording.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike some of Sony's <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony\" rel=\"follow\">other camera offerings</a>, the movie/video recording button is prominently placed on the top, right near the camera shutter button.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who have complained in the past about Sony's lack of a proper flip-out screen, it even has one of those.</p><p>The display can be flipped out to the side so you can see yourself on screen when filming, but likewise, it rotates, and can be held at various angles when viewed from the back or up top. You can even flip it over to have the screen facing the camera's body when shut, to protect it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image2-1vel4wrdnf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>The top of the camera features a three-capsule mic setup which Sony says can give you clear, good quality audio whether you want to set it for wider ambient capture, or a focus on your voice. It even comes with a custom-made deadcat to kill wind noise that fixes into the shoe mount.</p><p>Of course, some vloggers and video makers will want to use their own dedicated microphones, and so there's also a 3.5mm mic input, but also the capability to plug in an XLR mic via a hot shoe adapter if you need that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's arguably the video processing that makes this ideal for vloggers, combined with the auto focussing and tracking capabilities that Sony is renowned for.&nbsp;</p><p>Like a lot of its recent high end cameras it has real-time eye and face tracking, as well as fast autofocus based on phase and contrast detection. However, it's programmed to base its frame exposure on the person's face that's in the shot.&nbsp;</p><p>What that means is that you can be talking to camera, walking under bridges, into darker or brighter settings and it'll continuously adjust the exposure to ensure your face stays looking well exposed and natural. And that's not dependent on ethnicity either, it can detect and adjust for different skin colours and shades.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a vlogger that needs to bring products to the frame - like makeup tutorials or consumer electronics hands-on videos - you can switch the camera to Product Showcase mode, and it'll automatically pick up the product in the shot and focus quickly on that, and then focus back on your face when you remove it from the frame.&nbsp;</p><p>For <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/149869-best-tiktok-tips-and-tricks\" rel=\"follow\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/instagram/138416-what-is-instagram-stories-and-how-does-it-work\" rel=\"follow\">Instagram Stories</a> users, the camera automatically detects when it's shooting video vertically, and will transfer that video in portrait mode to your phone, without auto-rotating to landscape.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image3-xsmn1efm9j.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"498\" /></p><p>It shoots 4K video at 30 frames per second, or 1080p up 60fps, but also features a super slow motion capability and can shoot at 240, 480 and 960 frames per second. You can even shoot in different Log settings, for those who want to colour grade later on in the edit, and it supports proxies.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside, Sony's equipped the camera with a 1-inch 20-megapixel 4:3 CMOS sensor. 4K videos oversample a 16:9 14MP frame down to 8-megapixel, without cropping it and it's equipped with EIS and OIS for stability during shooting too.&nbsp;</p><p>It has 315 autofocus points, and can shoot still bursts up to 24fps, and then displays those bursts in clusters within the gallery on the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The battery is good for 45 minutes of video recording time, or 260 still photo captures, and can be charged by plugging the camera into a microUSB cable. That - of course means - if you're going out for an extended period, you can take a battery pack with you and plug it in to keep it topped up between shooting.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sony ZV-1 will be available to buy in June 2020 for £700 in the UK.</p><p></p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 26 May 2020 14:42:46 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image1-xb6qaoglpi.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"9120fa84795175990f8142ce96f065d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-50-657_e59ce3058625ab7f.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":55683,"destBytes":44020,"author":"Cam Bunton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image1-xb6qaoglpi.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-36-50-657_e59ce3058625ab7f.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image2-1vel4wrdnf.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn48@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-36-55-548_6665c7e3ac70c159.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152266-cameras-news-sony-zv-1-is-an-all-new-breed-of-vlogging-camera-image3-xsmn1efm9j.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/24/23-36-55-704_da61213311c1c7dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209017},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"These superb pictures of retro tech will show you how far we've come","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/152281-retro-tech-pictures-gallery","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"751\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image1-pxrgzwlni6.png?v1\"> <p>There's nothing like an advert for a spurious technological product in black and white to make you realise just how much progress we've made as a tech society. Whether it's bizarre contraptions for making phone calls or lighting products that barely look safe, it's fair to say that we've all got a heck of a lot more access to reliable tech now.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/adobe/140252-30-famous-photoshopped-and-doctored-images-from-across-the-ages\" rel=\"follow\">Famous Photoshopped images from across the ages</a></li> \n </ul><p>Still, there's a lot of fun and interest to be found in surveying images of old tech and reminding ourselves of how things used to be.

No wonder, then, that this Ford model looks so funky - it's from the 70s and we just can't get enough of that colourful stripe.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/151220-brilliantly-bizarre-paintings-of-an-alternate-1920s-with-mecha-robots\" rel=\"follow\">15 brilliantly bizarre paintings of an alternate 1920s with mechs, bears and wolves</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image2-sqdpttvxfg.png\" /></p><h2>Pimp my ride</h2><p>Bikes, compared to cars at least, haven't changed nearly so much - after all, the core technology can only come on so far. That said, it's been a while since we saw a lighting option for a bicycle quite like this one, which straps a frankly astonishing number of bulbs to your bike. If people were concerned about being seen when it was dark, this certainly would have solved the problem.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image3-thrdyhlle7.png\" /></p><h2>Social isolation</h2><p>People's imagined versions of the future always make for fascinating comparisons after the fact, and this painting from Italy is a perfect example. Its vision of isolated individuals zipping around in personal vehicles that seal them off from the rest of society is, on the one hand, far-fetched, but also bears at least a passing resemblance to some aspects of how we live now.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cars/news/151360-batmobiles-batman-car-best-ever-gallery\" rel=\"follow\">Batmobiles down the ages - check out Batman's best-ever vehicles</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image4-acqxzihl8c.png\" /></p><h2>Green skies</h2><p>People also liked to imagine what our cities would look like decades into the future, and these predictions seem, for whatever reason, to often skew towards the optimistic. Hence you get ideas like this one, which posited that the skyscrapers shooting up in cities around the globe would all be topped by gardens to lessen their environmental and visual impact. Sadly, this hasn't really proven true.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image5-dszs4kybhw.png\" /></p><h2>Neon demon</h2><p>Going all the way back to 1930, this neon salesman's case is a great example of how futuristic some real retro technology can be - the way these tubes are powered is so low-fi that most of us would struggle to comprehend it. What's obvious, though, is that it has a gorgeous look and feel to it, sure to be a collector's item nowadays.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/141224-the-most-famous-ghost-photographs-ever-taken\" rel=\"follow\">The most famous ghost photographs ever taken</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image6-fi48hcs2v0.png\" /></p><h2>Gaming rig</h2><p>Fast-forwarding rapidly into this century, we love this image, because of how well we know that it was, in its day, the height of sophistication.

It might not be right in design terms, with the bulbous looks no longer in vogue at all, but ever since Google famously added napping stations to its huge campus in Silicon Valley, nap pods have become, if not popular, at least accepted.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/smart-home/news/151608-these-interior-decor-disasters-will-leave-you-cringing\" rel=\"follow\">These crazy interior decor disasters will leave you cringing</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image100-xetlfhteoz.png\" /></p><h2>Sleek</h2><p>Setting aside Elon Musk's folly in the form of the Cybertruck, we think it's fair to say that car design has got a heck of a lot less interesting over the last few decades, as this gorgeous model demonstrates.

No thanks - just give us a stormy sky and huge pink glints on the speakers to show that this thing is built for rock and roll.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-superb-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image1-lwfzixyzop.png\" /></p><h2>Rolling out</h2><p>This might just be the coolest vehicle of any type that we've seen in quite some time, but the fact that it was built in the 1930s makes it almost jaw-dropping. We can see the reasons why this didn't spread to become a normal sort of thing to own, but that's still a crying shame.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-superb-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image1-nwgvphscx5.png\" /></p><h2>Why not?</h2><p>A burger-shaped phone would later be made iconic by the film Juno, but why not have a portable games console in the same shape? This concept piece is hilarious to look at, and you don't the sense that its two buttons and a D-pad would be much fun to play, but it's certainly memorable.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152281-cameras-news-these-pictures-of-retro-tech-will-show-you-how-far-weve-come-image199-dsdy8t29vu.png\" /></p><h2>Chunky chic</h2><p>Our final picture is a final phone, too, and we're honestly torn on it. Is it a great bit of knowingly kitsch design with huge buttons that are unique and fun, or an ugly monstrosity with buttons that should never be replicated anywhere, ever. At the end of the day, we might just have to leave that to you.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a

of its EOS R5 camera, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/canon/151073-canon-eos-r5-8k-ibis-release\" rel=\"\">teasing a pre-release way back in February</a> about some of the goodies you could expect from it.</p><p>Now the full information has come to the fore: the EOS R5 is the top-tier camera in the company's RF lens-mount mirrorless system, bringing a 45-megapixel full-frame sensor that's even capable of 8K video capture.</p><p>Yes indeed, the EOS R5 is a beast when it comes to potential. Here are some other specification highlights, as there are so many potential places to start.</p>\n <ul> \n  <li>In-body stabilisation system, works with lens IS for up to 8-stops of stabilisation</li> \n  <li>12 frames per second mechanical shutter (20fps electronic shutter)</li> \n  <li>Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus system introduced (0.05s)</li> \n  <li>Enhances face/eye detection, adds animal detection</li> \n  <li>ISO 100-51,200 sensitivity (102,400 expanded)</li> \n  <li>Weather-sealed magnesium alloy body</li> \n  <li>5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder</li> \n  <li>3-inch 2.1m-dot vari-angle LCD</li> \n  <li>Dual card slot (1x SD, 1x CFE)</li> \n </ul><p>There are some big take aways there, in particular that this full-frame sensor is a massive 45-megapixels when it comes to resolution. That's not quite the highest Canon has ever produced (<a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/canon/135439-canon-eos-5ds-review-resolution-revelation\" rel=\"\">there's the 5DS</a>), but the company is claiming - due in part to the RF lens system, but also the low-pass filter design here - that it will deliver the best fidelity of any of its cameras. Like, ever.</p><p>It's also the first camera to introduce the second-generation focus system, called Dual Pixel CMOS AF II, which not only claims the world's fastest speeds (at just 0.05 seconds if the right lens is attached), but adds in animal detection - it's able to lock onto the eyes of various species, including dogs, cats, and birds (including birds in flight).</p><p>Then there's the image stabilisation system, which is a first for Canon. There's a gyro in the body, which works in tandem with the lens-based stabilisation (IS) to function as a two-part system, which Canon claims can stabilise for up to 8 stops. That's a rather immense claim.</p><p>Elsewhere the R5 has an ultra-resolution electronic viewfinder, plus a 3-inch vari-angle LCD touchscreen.</p><p>Two card slots feature: an SD (UHS-II) and CompactFlash Express slot. The latter is an essential for one of the R5's other major abilities: shooting 8K video. Yes, this camera can capture the 33-megapixel format at 30 frames per second. Or you can 'downgrade' to 4K and shott at 120fps, making for ultra high-definition slow-motion capture. Looks as though Canon is finally opening the gateway to its high-end video capabilities.</p><p>So how much do you need to buy such a system? It doesn't come cheap, at £4,199.99 for the body only. The RF lenses are various prices and levels, including a batch of new optics also announced to show the company's dedication to getting the R system well and truly off the ground.</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152765-cameras-news-canon-eos-r5-brings-45mp-sensor-and-8k-video-image1-ttx2zqfnhc.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"df98999c9a8d5cde383356c9807a5fb5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-36-50-716_86548745be28a406.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":42558,"destBytes":24124,"author":"Mike Lowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152765-cameras-news-canon-eos-r5-brings-45mp-sensor-and-8k-video-image1-ttx2zqfnhc.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/24/23-36-50-716_86548745be28a406.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209016},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"The winners of Apple's iPhone night mode challenge offer some stunning images","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/151293-the-winners-of-apple-s-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image1-af9z6njqzx.jpg?v1\"> <p>It's been hard to ignore the growth of night mode photography in the last couple of years.

These six images are really quite incredible, and do an amazing job of showing just what you can do with an iPhone camera nowadays.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image1-ex29awrvk1.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rubén P. Bescós (Pamplona, Navarra, Spain), iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2><p>This shot from Spain is so evocative, with Night Mode bringing out the detail in the hill close to us, while silhouetting the walkers on the verge at sunset. Those scaffolded frames in the background are mysterious and draw the eye, but the collection of animals in the centre are also beautifully captured, almost looking like drawings of themselves. Meanwhile, the overall palette is obviously dominated by that impressive, warm orange in a way that makes the whole tableau feel welcoming.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image2-rn156r9okx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Rustam Shagimordanov (Moscow, Russia), iPhone 11</h2><p>This shot looks fit for any tourism brochure, so idyllic does it make this riverside set of dwellings look. The light of the buildings, and their beautiful red colouring, makes for an interesting contrast between what looks like a lovely place to live and what is plainly a freezing, harsh environment in many ways. Meanwhile, in the background, that looming rock places the village in the context of an awesome demonstration of nature's true scale.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image3-8ofcu3w9t0.jpg\" /></p><h2>Andrei Manuilov (Moscow, Russia), iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2><p>Taking us from the natural world to the urban environment, there's something very deliberate about this shot of the internal courtyard of a building block. It's got that slightly otherworldly light that is characteristic of software-assisted night shots, but in a way that serves its aesthetic. You can almost lose track of which way is up as the parallel lines of the walkways extending away from the lens draw you into the photograph. The night sky at the top of the frame, meanwhile, is pitch black.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image4-xi9io07vqe.jpg\" /></p><h2>Konstantin Chalabov (Moscow, Russia), iPhone 11 Pro</h2><p>Another photograph contrasting warm colours with the coldest imaginable, with the head and taillights of this truck lighting up the middle of the frame while the cold expanse extends in front of and behind it. Meanwhile, once again a huge hunk of rock stands by nearby to illustrate the harshness of the environment, as do the frigid trees visible in the background. The blue of the sky and snow is almost cold enough to feel through the screen.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/151293-phones-news-the-winners-of-apples-iphone-night-mode-challenge-are-stunning-image5-dtbmszjdzy.jpg\" /></p><h2>Yu “Eric” Zhang (Beijing, China), iPhone 11 Pro Max</h2><p>Back to the city we go, with this picture managing to capture the eclectic hustle of a side street in Beijing. There's a lot going on but the small details are what win out, whether it's the neon trainer at the bottom of the frame, the posters barely legible to the far right, or the different coloured ingredients on that trader's table in the centre, its steam wafting up into the sky.

In the past, the social network was full of photos of&nbsp;Instagram travellers showing off the wonderful sights from all around the world. Now, everyone's stuck at home, there's less and less of these about.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a solution though, as you can still travel the world by using Google Maps for a virtual tour instead of a real one.&nbsp;</p><p>That's what one Instagram user started to do when issues with&nbsp;agoraphobia led her to have a crippling&nbsp;fear of the outside world. Unable to leave her London Flat,&nbsp;Jacqui Kenny instead took to Google Maps to travel to faraway lands.&nbsp;</p><p>When she struck upon the idea of uploading the images to Instagram, she soon became an Instagram sensation and is now over 126,000 followers. Maybe if you're looking for something to do to alleviate the boredom you could use her idea as inspiration for some digital travels.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been through the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/streetview.portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Agoraphobic Traveller's Instagram</a> account to show you some of the best destinations she's travelled to, all from the comfort of her own home.&nbsp;</p>\n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/149858-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">This incredible photographer creates new worlds with arts and crafts</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/instagram/148290-fantastic-street-artist-transforms-the-world-with-pixel-art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Fantastic street artist transforms the world with incredible pixel art</a></li> \n </ul><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image4-q5vksncp2c.jpg\" /></p><h2>A tree that casts a large shadow</h2><p>Using Google Maps to travel to Sun City, Arizona, the&nbsp;Agoraphobic Traveller discovered this impressive street side view of a magnificent tree casting a large shadow over its sunbaked surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p>This is just one of many desert&nbsp;locales this Instagrammer has travelled to thanks to the power of Google Street View - probably a welcome change to the rain-soaked views of London visible through her flat window.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image5-gruv0lx3ni.jpg\" /></p><h2>Boys and girls at football practice</h2><p>In the foothills of Bolivia, a mixed-sex football team takes some instruction from their coach and prepares for practice in the sweet warmth of the summer sun.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image25-piwsy6vr9q.jpg\" /></p><h2>Paddling pool in the street</h2><p>Summertime in&nbsp;Callao District, Callao Region, Peru must get a bit toasty. This view shows kids splashing about in a large paddling pool in the street. A refreshing dip in the sweltering sun. A brilliant view from another part of the world enjoyed from a computer screen.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image6-39ggkbmj1c.jpg\" /></p><h2>Staten Island after the hurricane</h2><p>This image was captured in 2013 and shows the aftermath of&nbsp;Hurricane Sandy, one of the most deadly and destructive hurricanes of the time. Here we see the damage the hurricane did in Staten Island, but that same hurricane also did damage elsewhere. Winds whipped up to&nbsp;115 mph, causing 233 people to lose their lives and damage totalling over $68 million.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image7-d6ru8xlqrc.jpg\" /></p><h2>A home in the sun</h2><p>In&nbsp;Western Cape, South Africa, a man stands in the doorway to his home watching the Google Street View car passing by. A simple view of life miles from home.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image8-urc3bowsyj.jpg\" /></p><h2>The boy with the blue balloon</h2><p>On a quiet street corner in the&nbsp;Western Cape, South Africa, a small boy can be seen blowing up a blue balloon. Small blue shacks can be seen behind him and the vast blue cloudless skies above.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image9-ric0mvy9ag.jpg\" /></p><h2>Workers in Bolivia</h2><p>Another shot from the foothills of Bolivia shows some workers at the side of a dirt track watching as the Google car passes them by. Dust roads and green hills can be admired in this area, without all the hassle of actually walking.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image10-pw81ytgcla.jpg\" /></p><h2>A lone horse is watching you</h2><p>At the edge of the road, a lone horse looks befuddled by the car as it passes by disturbing his peaceful grazing. Not the usual Instagram snap of&nbsp;Rio De Janerio, Brazil you'd expect to see - no beaches or cocktails anywhere in sight.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image11-ajp5m0lwbh.jpg\" /></p><h2>A long worn mountain road</h2><p>This view shows the worn out roads of Mongolia, stretching off into the distant hills. This rural view would certainly require a long trip in order to see normally. Google Maps gives easy access to far-off lands with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image12-rfdxygl60e.jpg\" /></p><h2>A herd at the petrol station</h2><p>Nature meets man. This image shows a petrol station in&nbsp;Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia as a shepherd and his flock pass by the pumps on their onward journey.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image13-n8bf7upga4.jpg\" /></p><h2>A well-used pitch</h2><p>At the edge of the road in&nbsp;Peru, South America sits a well-worn sports pitch. Not many sports fields have a view like this, with mountain ranges stretching off into the distance. Another hidden manmade beauty spot captured by Google for all to see.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image14-i9kszbsopi.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cows disturbed by Google</h2><p>Some cows check out the Google car as it drives by. These bovine beauties were snapped in&nbsp;Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and show a standard roadside view not many of us would see on a daily basis. Though it would certainly make for a more interesting commute to work.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image15-nhpsbwlugz.jpg\" /></p><h2>A family cooling in the pool</h2><p>Another snap captures a family cooling off in a paddling pool at the edge of the street in Callao, Peru. No doubt a refreshing treat from the heat of the baking sun.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image16-olrb2yebzz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Workers in Russia</h2><p>Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, some workers are seen digging outside a housing complex. An urban view from the depths of Russia you're not likely to see elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image17-qydebma6lv.jpg\" /></p><h2>A woman walking with her cat</h2><p>A woman can apparently be seen seemingly walking her black cat along the streets of Bulgaria. Snow-clad roadsides and rolling hills tell a chilly story for her and her feline friend.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image18-kuo2dnljui.jpg\" /></p><h2>A security guard taking some shade</h2><p>A much warmer view shows a security guard attempting to cool off in the shade of a tree. Small and quirky domiciles can be seen behind him, a regular view on the streets of&nbsp;Celaya, Mexico?</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image19-aw3jlwkofm.jpg\" /></p><h2>A man and his birds</h2><p>A much more rural scene from&nbsp;Belgorod, Russia shows some feathered creatures waddling down to the waters. A lone man seems distracted by something in the distance and completely oblivious to the passing Google car.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image20-gtisjo7vzb.jpg\" /></p><h2>Cactus by the road</h2><p>Where your average road might have a few flowers at its edge, the streets of Peru&nbsp;are a little bit different. These neatly placed Cactii seem to be waving at the cars passing by. Cloud covered mountains can be seen in the distance too. Quite a peaceful view.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image21-mkt4px9krm.jpg\" /></p><h2>Beautiful Saguaros cactus</h2><p>Another cactus with a view - this time from the sun-baked desert of&nbsp;Florence, Arizona. This majestic cactus certainly makes for a smashing focal point of the barren surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image22-wocnxvvrka.jpg\" /></p><h2>Colourful car camouflage</h2><p>This image is so brilliant it almost looks staged. A colourful car is parked at the edge of this road in&nbsp;Mexico and almost matches the houses behind it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image23-vec4kg2sjx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Just a man walking a cow</h2><p>A snap of&nbsp;Kyrgyzstan shows a man walking with a cow following close behind. One of the&nbsp;Agoraphobic Traveller's first photos. The caption reads:</p><p>\"This is one of the first images I ever captured that got me excited about exploring the weird and wonderful world of Street View. It's not my usual style but I really love the painterly feel of it. This was taken in the beautiful country of Kyrgyzstan.\"</p><p>We hope you've enjoyed this selection of images.

The&nbsp;Agoraphobic Traveller has an eye for finding beauty in the most unusual of spots. All from the comfort of home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image3-rwqm5iawyp.jpg\" /></p><h2>Camels prancing in the desert</h2><p>This wonderful view of nature captured by the Agrophobic Traveller while investigating the deserts of&nbsp;Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. This view appears to show camels prancing in the sand, but they're likely spooked by the maps car. Hopefully, no animals were harmed during the making of this image.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/144672-cameras-feature-how-to-become-an-instagram-sensation-without-ever-leaving-the-house-image2-gjoz6cyj1p.jpg\" /></p><h2>The abandoned playground</h2><p>While virtually travelling around&nbsp;Baganuur, Mongolia, the Agrophobic Traveller found this large playground area, eerily abandoned like a small playful ghost town.

Incredible images you won't believe were shot on a smartphone.</p><p>If you feel like you've got what it takes, you too could submit your photos to the iPhone Photography Awards to see if you can win an award in one of the 16 categories.

This artist uses a mix of photography skills and minute arts and crafts talents to create visions of new worlds and amazing visions for you to enjoy.</p><p>The following is a gallery of behind the scenes images to show his various projects and the magic of his creations. We're sure you'll agree they are impressive. A little lighting here, some clever perspective there, a dash of modelling and you've got a whole new world before your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image2-ad8tymdtep.jpg\" /></p><h2>Love Bug Story</h2><p>Just a few images hardly show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tyFtA5_KQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">all the effort</a> that Felix Hernandez puts into his works. This one was part of a project for Volkswagen and showed a tiny VW Beetle model that the artist lovingly constructed, along with a brilliant backdrop to give the illusion of a real road and landscape. Perspective plays a big part in these works and the results are magnificent.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image4-fkrzkm2sjo.jpg\" /></p><h2>Abducted</h2><p>Another vision of a VW vehicle in tiny form. This painstakingly created work includes a camper van in a small frozen landscape seemingly being abducted by an alien spacecraft. We love the framing of this artist's work, along with the lighting and smoke that's added for atmosphere.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image1-jciqa0bfsm.jpg\" /></p><h2>The boy and the dove</h2><p>Felix's work appears to use a healthy mix of perspective, attention to detail and Photoshop wizardry. In this image, a small boy is made even tinier and cast off into some imaginary waters.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image1-qh8wc2xk60.jpg\" /></p><h2>Star Wars Tamashii Nations</h2><p>Handcrafted&nbsp;dioramas, a small smoke machine and some clever camera placement lead to some fantastic and interesting results. This is just one of several Star Wars themed images Felix has created.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image1-ypbrudxx81.jpg\" /></p><h2>Shelby GT40</h2><p>We see this as a brilliant way to enjoy a car you might not otherwise be able to afford. A spray of moisture, some clever lighting, the right angle and you can make a small toy car look like a dream machine.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image12-p0nonfmudo.jpg\" /></p><h2>A rusty Nova</h2><p>Felix is not just a dab hand at crafting and building models, it turns out he also has a talent for painting them in such a way that they appear worn out and broken too. Here he's made a toy car look like a well-worn automobile that's rusty and run-down but still has plenty of character.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image1-nyelmu85vx.jpg\" /></p><h2>Myth mountains</h2><p>Some clever photography can even transform a day at the beach into a foreboding landscape of a distant planet. A lone stormtrooper can now be seen staring off thoughtfully into the distance, wondering what went wrong with his life.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image16-jvty9cluj3.jpg\" /></p><h2>Love Car</h2><p>The Love Car came about as a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZpkKPvwZ-VI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">project over several years</a>. Another small model car turned into something much bigger. There's <a href=\"https://retouchingacademy.com/the-love-car-2018-by-felix-hernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">a great story behind this project</a> too, as Felix&nbsp;Hernandez set out to create something special without spending a fortune.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image18-1vjsziwodl.jpg\" /></p><h2>Heartbreak</h2><p>This intricate work of art was the result of a single word. The idea of heartbreak becoming something visual with a carefully constructed cliff face falling apart as two elephants reach out for one another. We love seeing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxsWMbKlH8J/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">the various small steps</a> that go into creating a masterpiece like this.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image20-daolvnfebf.jpg\" /></p><h2>Fix it</h2><p>Some of these works are a mix of reality and cleverly crafted&nbsp;dioramas.

Felix once again uses his skills, attention to detail and infinite patience to create a magnificent scene using another model car, some clever lighting and fake fog to transform an old-looking car into futuristic flying one.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image1-fxhjcgevnw.jpg\" /></p><h2>Echo 1</h2><p>Back in 2017, Felix worked on creating a awesome vision of the iconic vehicle from Ghost Busters as part of a project called Famous Cars. Lighting and smoke effects were used to give the toy model a new lease of life and resulted in this awesome vision along with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BREIoPWjHL3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">other cool visuals</a> that included seeing the car doing a wheelie through the smog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image26-itvgnwuy15.jpg\" /></p><h2>Dukes of Hazard</h2><p>This brilliant shoot and <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/47111045/The-Dukes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">several others like it</a> were inspired by the Dukes of Hazard for a famous movie cars project. We enjoy seeing how much effort Felix puts into these projects with brilliant behind the scenes photographs and there's even a video of this one too.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/149858-cameras-feature-this-incredible-photographer-creates-new-worlds-with-arts-and-crafts-image28-2t5i40fulz.jpg\" /></p><h2>Action!</h2><p>We can only imagine how much effort goes into these images where two cars look like they're actually moving.

touchscreen","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/news/sony/153116-sony-a7s-iii-price-specs-details-release-date","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\"

has finally delivered the answer to so many video-makers' prayers. Five years after it launched the last A7S full frame camera, the A7S III has been unveiled and it looks like an absolute beast.&nbsp;</p><p>When briefed about the new camera, <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony</a> told us it has built everything from the ground up. When it comes to internals, hardware and performance, it's virtually all been upgraded to create what - on paper - looks to be one of the best run-and-gun cameras made so far.&nbsp;</p><p>It starts with the sensor, and in order to give us quality video capture, Sony opted for a 12.1-megapixel sensor. That ensures there are enough pixels for 4K video, but also means that those pixels are quite large and enable better light and colour capture than a higher resolution sensor might, and there's no pixel binning involved.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/150424-sony-a7r-iv-review-mk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony A7R IV review: Here's to new resolutions</a></li>\n </ul><p>Sony says it's its best full frame sensor yet for signal to noise ratio, and that also means cleaner images in low light situations even with the ISO cranked up. The sensor itself is an updated Exmor sensor, called the Exmor R, and is backside-illuminated for faster readout speeds and combined with a new Bionz XR processing engine for faster overall processing performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Spec-wise, the A7S III in video mode has an ISO range of 40-409600 and is capable of 15 stops of dynamic range when shooting in the lower sensitivity settings.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also says it has improved rolling shutter performance as well, with as much as 3x improvement over the last A7S camera. That much much smoother panning, and fewer jitters when you're moving the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>As for recording quality, that's been upped too. 4K is the top resolution here, but you can shoot in frame rates all the way up to 120 frames per second at max resolution. For full HD that frame rate tops out at 240p.&nbsp;There is a slight 1.1 crop at the top 4K/120p end, however.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a plethora of resolution/bitrate/frame-rate options, but you'll be able to shoot them all internally on an SDXC V90 memory card on either or both of the SD card slots. The camera also supports a new kind of CFExpress card, which will launch alongside the camera.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/153116-cameras-news-sony-a7s-iii-unveiled-4k-up-to-120p-all-new-sensor-and-a-proper-flip-out-touchscreen-image3-dirvop4hca.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>The only recording mode that requires this CFExpress card is the highest quality slow-motion setting, but otherwise, everything can be shot on a V90 SD card.&nbsp;</p><p>As with most of <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/cameras/reviews/sony/152309-sony-zv-1-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony's recent cameras</a>, it has market-leading autofocusing and tracking features. It has 759 phase-detection autofocus points, taking up nearly all of the sensor's available surface area, with an additional 425 contrast-detection autofocus points.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use the built-in, flippy-out touchscreen (yes it has one now), to enable real-time tracking on any object, but you can also switch it to track human or animal eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>When you do touch to focus, you can set the speed at seven different settings which means you can either program it to switch focus immediately or create a slow pull focus effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features worth noting include the redesigned buttons, which make the movie mode button more prominent on the top. There's also 5-axis IBIS to keep footage nice and smooth. There's even an electronic stabilisation algorithm that can save any movement/shake data captured by the internal gyroscope, allowing to more accurately stabilise footage in post.&nbsp;</p><p>For those worried about thermal performance, Sony has redesigned the heat dissipation system so that if you are shooting at 4K/60, you can get an hour's worth of filming done before it needs to take a break and cool down. In less intense modes, it can go up to 95 minutes.</p><p>For professionals who want to shoot HDR, it has 10 bit HLG shooting capability and supports HDMI 2.1 out, so you can hookup an external recorder like the Atomos Ninja V and shoot up to 4K/60 using that method.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sony A7S III will be available to purchase at some point in September this year, with prices likely to be around the £3,800/€4,200 mark for the body only.&nbsp;</p><p>squirrel_widget_307806</p> </img>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":7639,"bgimg":"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/153116-cameras-news-sony-a7s-iii-unveiled-4k-up-to-120p-all-new-sensor-and-a-proper-flip-out-touchscreen-image2-1wijllx6ow.jpg?v1","linkMd5":"7a737bcec5b9cde32f66ddb7916895bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-36-52-043_2805b950c1f2a6cc.webp","destWidth":748,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":47914,"destBytes":30306,"author":"Cam Bunton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/153116-cameras-news-sony-a7s-iii-unveiled-4k-up-to-120p-all-new-sensor-and-a-proper-flip-out-touchscreen-image2-1wijllx6ow.jpg?v1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-36-52-043_2805b950c1f2a6cc.webp","https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/153116-cameras-news-sony-a7s-iii-unveiled-4k-up-to-120p-all-new-sensor-and-a-proper-flip-out-touchscreen-image3-dirvop4hca.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/24/23-37-17-404_444168a6ffc3094e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598312209023},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:36:49","title":"Huawei P50 could be first to have an innovative liquid lens camera","link":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/huawei/152284-huawei-p50-could-be-first-to-have-an-innovative-liquid-lens-camera","description":"<img width=\"748\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/748x/assets/images/152284-phones-news-huawei-p50-could-be-first-to-have-an-innovative-liquid-lens-camera-image1-zri6lhfkiw.jpg?v1\"> <p>A patent filed with the&nbsp;China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) could result in <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/huawei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">Huawei</a> being the first to market with a phone sporting a \"liquid lens\" camera.</p><p>Indeed, we might even see the technology debut on the Huawei P50 next year.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.pocket-lint.com/r/s/660x/assets/images/152284-phones-news-huawei-p50-could-be-first-to-have-an-innovative-liquid-lens-camera-image3-vsebya6yum.jpg\" /></p><p>Liquid lens technology uses optical grade liquid inside a cell structure rather than optical glass.
