It comes from a more naive time on the web, when people were advocating being a little wreckless in the name of innovation. These days, the sentiment isn’t as celebrated.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I guess when web developers find themselves testifying to congress about their practices… maybe it’s worth reevaluating the ethics that got us there. Maybe breaking things is… bad?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So I think we’re maturing and interested in not breaking things quite as much. But still, I find the relationship between moving fast and breaking things to be very relatable.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.002.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.002-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.002-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.002.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Breaking Things\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And that’s because regardless of whether it’s our stated goal, there are so many ways we can easily break access for our users. Especially when we’re “moving fast.” We want to move fast on developing new features without breaking things, and we also want to move fast and iterate while keeping our sites fast. I find those priorities are increasingly difficult to reconcile. Poor performance is one of the most common ways we break a good user experience today.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So I want to talk about what makes our sites break, and ways to make our websites fast, &amp; keep them fast.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.003.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.003-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.003-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.003.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"A Brief History of Not Breaking Websites\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I’ll start with a little contextual history about breaking things. I’ve been building websites for a long time. Over the last 20 or so years I’ve been tinkering on the web, I’ve noticed that our notion of what it means to break things on the web has changed several times, and also that there’s been a common thread in the way we fix things, or even prevent them from from breaking in the first place.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.004.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.004-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.004-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.004.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Screenshot of Position is Everything site\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption> \n  <a href=\"http://www.positioniseverything.net/\">Position Is Everything site</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Early on in web design, we focused heavily on normalizing features. Does anyone remember this site \"Position is Everything? Great site. Totally useless today. Thank goodness! That’s because this site hosts a huge collection of very old Internet Explorer bugs and oddities, and even odder fixes. I think of it as like, <a href=\"http://filamentgroup.com/lab/dontbreakthings/caniuse.com\">caniuse dot com</a>, crossed with a Ripleys Believe It or Not! museum. It’s amazing to think about the issues we used to deal with.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.005.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.005-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.005-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.005.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Screenshot of Quirksmode site\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption> \n  <a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/\">Quirksmode.org</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How about this site, Quirksmode? Full of its feature tables. This is still a great resource. If you’ve been making websites a while, you probably have used these sites a lot. In early versions of today’s browsers, not breaking things was difficult for different reasons than it’s difficult now. That’s because early on, we took cues from other media like print and TV to define our success criteria for what it meant to create a good design, or a broken one. And this thinking cultivated an obsession with consistency, in producing our designs identically across the browsers of the time so they look and behave the exact same. At the time, that was hard because those few browsers of that time asked us to do the same things in different, non-standard ways. So we’d comb through sites like these to find what each browser would need, then negotiate which fix to apply</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"emphasize\"> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.006.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.006-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.006-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.006.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Progressive Enhancement\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And typically, we’d do that by first asking the browser who it is. What is your name, browser? And then, incredibly, we would believe what it told us, and make important decisions based on its answer. Now, a browser could just lie and say it was someone else, and that could cause problems, but the bigger issue with this practice was that every time a new browser came out, our code wasn’t prepared to handle it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So we started to adopt more sustainable patterns like feature detection to test if something works before using it, and Progressive Enhancement, which meant serving usable functional HTML upfront and carefully enhancing it without breaking anything. These practices were not convenient. But they were more reliable, and they ended up being an adequate tool for normalizing the quirks of that time. Again though, these practices took more work, so it’s surprising to me that “PE” took hold at all in those days.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But I’m glad it did…</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.007.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.007-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.007-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.007.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"A laptop, tablet, and phone\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I’m glad because it became much more useful soon after that. With the introduction of smartphones, there were loads of new considerations. New screen sizes and resolutions, New input modes like touch and built-in assistive technology like screen readers. And new and different kinds of browsers.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Now thankfully, those browsers’ features were standardizing quickly - which meant less normalizing code for us. But at the same time, the user contexts in which they applied were splintering.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.008.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.008-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.008-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.008.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"The first image of safari browser on an iPhone, with a zoomed out screenshot of the nytimes\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So this marked a turning point in what it meant to deliver a broken user experience. It was pretty clear that our earlier ideas of what constitutes a good or a broken website were now wrong. Trying to make a website look and act the same way for everyone turned out to be a bad idea. Across different devices, our practices were actually creating broken experiences. So from then on, we would aim to embrace diversity in browsing, rather than fighting it. We would cater to unique interaction modes and viewport sizes—many of which might occur at different times even on the same device.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.009.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.009-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.009-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.009.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"A cell tower\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design\">Responsible Responsive Design</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And the challenges of embracing that diversity continues today.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But also, I think by now we’ve gotten pretty good at catering to browsing differences. New challenges continue to come our way, but we’re aware of what to look for. And that’s good. Because right now we’re in need of another shift. Our common conventions right now are once again breaking things for our users.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>When cell networks first arrived, they were slow and less reliable than any connections we’d dealt with in years. And that continues. But lately, we’re also seeing an opposite effect. Where I live in Florida, my cell connection is faster than my wifi connection most of the time, which seems backwards… In fairness, Florida can be a confusing place. I have neighbors with street legal lawnmowers.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.010.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.010-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.010-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.010.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"5G text with stars whirling around it \" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But this trend is common, outside of Florida too. It’s worldwide. 3G and 4G coverage spread quickly worldwide and coverage is now pretty decent. And now we’re all hearing about 5G - it’s rolling out now, it’s here in NYC! It’s very fast. And reason we know it’s fast is because it’s always depicted like this, with stars whirling around it so fast that modern cameras can’t yet captured it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This week, the 5G network in Harlem was clocked at 1.4Gbps which means about 175mb per second. Amazing. But it’s not just bandwidth. 5g will also improve latency, so it’ll get that code turned around sooner and in bulk. So cell networks are getting faster. In theory that speed should alleviate a lot of our web performance problems!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.011.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.011-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.011-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.011.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"What even matters for performance in a 5G world?\" /></source> \n </picture> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Which brings up an interesting question: what even matters for web performance in a world where mobile users might get 200mb per second? I think our inclination is to think that the answer is “nothing.” Nothing matters for performance anymore. We can do whatever we want! And that’s what I want to leave you with. Nothing matters anymore. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Of course the real answer is more complicated. Networks are getting faster, at least in some parts of the world. So using the web should be getting faster for everyone as a result. Right?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.012.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.012-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.012-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.012.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Alcatel 1x device listed on amazon\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"http://filamentgroup.com/lab/5g/\">5G Will Definitely Make the Web Slower, Maybe</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Well… So far, it isn’t happening that way. Web performance is actually getting worse for average users, even when they are connected to the same fast networks we all use.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How?! Well, it’s because the average device that folks are using to connect to the web is relatively underpowered. Probably underpowered compared to many of the devices in this room. To be clear, the average device isn’t that iPhone with the notch at the top that we have to design around. It’s phones like this one, by Alcatel. Low-powered androids</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.013.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.013-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.013-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.013.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\" amazon best sellers of unlocked phones\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Unlocked-Cell-Phones/zgbs/wireless/2407749011/\">Amazon's Unlocked Phones Best Sellers</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This is the best sellers page of unlocked phones on Amazon. It’s a useful page to keep tabs on what people are really using. A lot of people shop for a deal on a phone like they would anything else. And most of the phones on this page cost around 150 bucks or less. The third most popular is 40 dollars. Many of these are not top-tier phones. The iPhone 6 is the first apple device on the list and it’s at #7.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.014.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.014-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.014-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.014.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\" a cell phone kiosk in siem reap, cambodia\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019\">The Cost of JS in 2019, Addy Osmani</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>These phones may be connected to the same fast networks. But They’re slow to process code that they download. How slow? It turns out that phones in this class can take 6, even 10 seconds to parse 200kb of transferred JavaScript. That’s on top of the time it takes to download it. And during that parsing, the phone is locked up preventing the page from working or maybe even appearing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.015.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.015-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.015-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.015.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\" a chart visualizing the increase described below\" /></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs\">State of Javascript, httparchive</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>200kb may sound like a lot but actually we’re sending more than that on mobile. According to httparchive, we’re sending over 370kb of JS on the average page. So that’s closer to two megabytes uncompressed. And to be clear, this has been worsening.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>During the years 2011 through 2019, 4g coverage spread from 5% to 79% of the world. During that same time period, the median average JavaScript transfer size to mobile devices increased by 611%, from 52kb to 372.9 KB.

Faster networks have enabled us to deliver increasing amounts of code and it is causing the average device to choke. This is why performance is worsening.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>As networks improve, we’re shifting the performance burden from the networks to the devices. So right now, at this moment we have a huge opportunity to broaden our reach. But it still takes care.

In the past, as we shifted our criteria for what it means to make a good experience, Progressive Enhancement was ready to help, and I find that this is a recurring thing. It continues to help address tomorrow’s challenges.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <picture> \n  <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.018.webp\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.018-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.018-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.018.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"Progressive Enhancement is Faster\"> </img></source> \n </picture> \n <figcaption>\n   Related reading: \n  <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster\">Progressive Enhancement is Faster, Jake Archibald</a> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But beyond that… I want to be clear that Progressive Enhancement is actually a performance best practice in itself as well. Browsers are optimized to best consume websites that are built in this fashion. And by using the patterns of progressive enhancement, and an ethic of generally trying to stay out of our own way, your site is very likely going to be delivered faster.

Internally, PSI runs on Lighthouse, also by Google,and lighthouse does a fantastic job of analyzing the way your page loads. Yeah, it gives you a score, but the best part is it makes very specific suggestions to improve your performance.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And WebPageTest… one of my favorite tools. Here’s how it works. You go to <a href=\"http://webpagetest.org\">webpagetest.org</a>. You enter a url you’d like to test, Choose a region of the world to test from. Then a device and browser, and a connection speed, and then you’re ready so you hit start, and it will turn around with a nice summary about how your site loaded</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This is where we can start to see high-level timing. In particular, WPT records a visual view of the loading process in a timeline format, which is helpful for communicating goals to clients.

So we can take advantage of that. We can set it to a media type like <code>print</code> and it’ll fetch asynchronously. Then, an <code>onload</code> handler can be used to set the <code>media</code> attr back as soon as it’s ready, which will make the full CSS apply to the page.

We should audit regularly.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This is what the Telegraph found when they deployed this special new web methodology called “just delete stuff and see if anyone notices.” These things pile on and have a short lifespan.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.074-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.074-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.074.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n    Related reading: \n   <a href=\"https://speedcurve.com/blog/javascript-growth/\">JavaScript growth and third parties</a> \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So I’m not saying we can or should remove all JS. But we should aim to keep it small and the hard part is we’re not always in control. Here’s where that gets tough. We tend to work on first-party scripts most often—The stuff that lives in our GitHub repos and the scripts folder. It tends to be purposeful and more reasonable to break apart.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Third party JavaScript is a different story. In recent years, we’ve seen an explosion of 3rd party JS. These are ads, trackers, analytics, and many sites have much of their AB tests and personalized content negotiated by JavaScript on the client-side. A 706% increase in third party scripts since 2011, per Steve Souders’ article. These packages have become popular because their UIs are friendly for non-developers to use They can often can be managed without much integration with the source codebase at all. THIS is often where that Javascript weight comes from.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"emphasize\"> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.075-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.075-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.075.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\" It's easier to make a fast website than it is to keep a website fast\"> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Friends, the hard work of performance tends to start right here. It’s defending your site <em>after</em> it launches, when stuff gets added to it every day. Which brings me to a sad observation.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>It’s easier to make a fast website than it is to keep a website fast…</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>And that’s because an increasing number of people on a team can impact a site’s speed with changes to many aspects of the service.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.076-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.076-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.076.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"screenshot:  lighthouse can integrate right into Github pull requests\"> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>So what can we do? How do we know when we need to step in and fix things? Well, there are good tools to help us monitor and communicate problems and speed regressions across our teams today. For developers working on the source of a site, tools like lighthouse can integrate right into Github and test our changes as we build and stop regressions before going live.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But again, some of the most performance unfriendly changes happen outside of the main codebase, in 3rd party tool panels, so these tools won’t catch them.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.077-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.077-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.077.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"speedcurve interface\"> \n  <figcaption>\n    Great tools: \n   <a href=\"https://speedcurve.com/\">Speedcurve</a> and \n   <a href=\"https://calibreapp.com/\">Calibre</a> \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But other tools can. Speed curve and Calibre are good examples.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>These tools let you set up budgets based on any performance metrics you care to retain. And their dashboard gives nice daily alerts when things are going well or over budget.Then, when a change breaks the budget, you have leverage to question its value. So that’s part of our jobs now: playing defense. Keep our teams aware of the performance impact of the things they do.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.078-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.078-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.078.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"example of rel=preconnect attribute\"> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>But sometimes it’s hard to convince a team to remove or defer a script that’s providing a measurable return. When we can’t remove a script, we can at least try to make it load sooner. Resource hints like <code>rel=preconnect</code> can help inform the browser to pre-connect to a third party domain that will be needed soon. Tools like this can help with network delays, getting a script to the browser a little sooner.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure> \n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://filamentgroup.com/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.079-480.jpg\" srcset=\"/images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.079-480.jpg 480w, /images/smashingnyc-sj/imgs.079.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 690px) 288px, 100vw\" alt=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n    Related reading: \n   <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-tools-are-here/\">The Tools are Here</a> \n  </figcaption> </img> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Okay that’s all the code I’ll be showing. Let’s recap.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I think our notion of what it means to break the user experience has shifted before, and it is shifting again right now. We’re breaking the web today for many users. But we don’t have to do that. It’s true, new web technology is exciting, but we already have the tools to build amazing things and deliver them efficiently today.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The web is good enough already.
