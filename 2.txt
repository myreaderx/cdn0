(credit: Rivian)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Tesla has sued competitor Rivian for theft of trade secrets. Tesla says that around 70 people have left Tesla for Rivian—including 22 in the last four months. And Tesla claims that several of those employees took confidential documents with them on their way out the door.</p>\n<p>Rivian has emerged as perhaps Tesla's most formidable rival among electric vehicle startups. The company announced a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/tesla-rival-rivian-raises-2-5-billion-to-make-electric-trucks-and-suvs/\">$2.5 billion round of fundraising</a> earlier this month—on top of $2.85 billion raised last year. The company is working on a pickup truck, an SUV, and a delivery truck for corporate customers—all powered by batteries. Amazon, a Rivian investor, has already <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/amazon-orders-100000-electric-trucks-to-fight-climate-change/\">ordered</a> 100,000 of Rivian's delivery trucks.</p>\n<p>With a ton of work to do and billions in the bank, Rivian needs to hire at a rapid pace. Unsurprisingly, Tesla workers have been a prime target of Rivian's recruiters. Tesla says it respects Rivian's right to recruit Tesla employees, but it argues that Rivian hasn't been playing fair.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1694234#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1694234&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 16:36:08 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2018_11_R1TBlue_BC_PSStatic_Woods_058A4306-scaled-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"6fb31e2a2a4ed521691e55f969b9b67a","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2018_11_R1TBlue_BC_PSStatic_Woods_058A4306-scaled-800x533.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=H6t-mZTAK8Y:cvnYl9gnlpU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-07-25 01:13:10","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 17:13:10","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 17:13:10 +0000","fetchMs":39,"handleMs":24,"totalMs":31154,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"172.17.222.22","hostName":"0683f3fd-a5d0-47f6-b64d-640a89e1b0fe"},"extra4":{"start":1595610790154,"total":31154,"statList":[{"spend":39,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":24,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":30061,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":5,"extra6":3}
