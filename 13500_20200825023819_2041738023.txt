Shouldn’t we be looking at new voices? Lange’s work has been a part of photography’s canon for decades. <em>Migrant Mother</em> is easily one of the most famous images in the world, to the point that it often eclipses a fuller understanding of her work at large. </p> \n<p><em>Dorothea Lange: Words &amp; Pictures</em> now coincides with the highest unemployment numbers since the Great Depression. Lange firmly believed her photographs to be a tool for social change. Her photographs shine a light on how little has changed and how much work still needs to be done. The breadth of her work defies easy terms such as document or even record. In these images we are rarely looking at something that happened; we are looking and empathizing with those it happened to. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>The Defendant, Alameda County Courthouse, California. 1957.

For her, words could extend the power of an image, not just causing an emotional response but also urging the viewer to not only see but to read, to listen carefully. She wrote that her image captions should carry “not only factual information, but also added clues to attitudes, relationships and meanings,” calling these captions “connective tissue.” Some of her image titles exhibit a matter of factness, a dry wit, <em>On the Road to Los Angeles, California (1937) </em>features two men walking down a dirt road towards a billboard advising to take the train next time. An image of men in front of a building is titled <em>Six Tenant Farmers Without Farms, Hardeman County, Texas (1937)</em>. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Dorothea Lange.

Whilst photographing, Lange took copious field notes on her assignments recording where, when, and who she was depicting and what they had to say. The exhibition shines a light on these collections and how in pairing the photographs with the subjects’ own words, Lange empowered their voices. The endpapers of her book<em> An American Exodus,</em> which she worked on with her husband, the agricultural economist Paul Taylor, hold the words of her subjects. Upon entering the gallery, these words feature prominently, as an introduction to the images on view, giving voice to the protagonists of her work. </p> \n<p>Throughout the show, wall text enriches the images with fragments of Lange’s own notes and extended quotes from those she photographed. This combination of words and pictures hits both head and heart; the photographs touch the viewer but the words allow them to do more than that, they shine a light on the injustices of the wider world through experience and fact. They also illuminate the inner thoughts and methods of a photographer committed to bringing change to the world with the tools at hand. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Dorothea Lange.

Bender \n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dorothea-lange-words-and-pictures#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>As I write this from my home in New York City, the lines at food banks are blocks long. With a deep measure of grief, it is an apt time to revisit these photographs. In the photograph <em>White Angel Bread Line, San Francisco (1933)</em>, a man is turned toward the camera, away from the mass of people waiting. His eyes are hidden by the brim of his hat, a look of resignation about him, hands clasped. </p> \n<p>This photograph led to Lange’s participation in the government’s Resettlement Administration program which would go on to become the Farm Security Administration. The FSA was a New Deal agency created to address the poverty sweeping across rural America. The administration found its natural leader in Roy Stryker who urged his team of photographers to document what was happening across the country, from Dust Bowl migrants to labor strikes. Their directive was to “introduce America to Americans” and so they went about capturing the human face of the ongoing economic crisis. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Tractored Out, Childress County, Texas. 1938.

Other greats of American photography like Gordon Parks and Walker Evans were also involved, joining Lange to become its most well known photographers. Within her role there, she made her name photographing the toll of the Depression on the country. </p> \n<p><em>Tractored Out, Childress County, Texas (1938)</em> features barren lines of ploughed earth leading to a forlorn seeming cabin. An air of desolation hangs within the image. Again and again, Lange’s photographs pinpoint struggle and strife, the crush of poverty and dashed dreams. Yet the strength of her images lies in their specificity, in how they condense larger-than-life problems into the situation of each image’s subject. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Woman of the High Plains, Texas Panhandle. 1938.

How does one cut through the noise? Lange knew that the answer was to pay close attention to her subject. In <em>Woman of the High Plains, Texas Panhandle (1938),</em> the subject is seen hand on tilted head, an expression of exhaustion on her face, the softness of a summer cloud unable to temper the grief. It is a look of sorrow, that rests not only on this woman’s face but across her body, the downward press of her lips, the lines around her eyes. </p> \n<p>In another photograph, <em>One Nation Indivisible, San Francisco (1942)</em>, a group of children appear to be reciting the pledge of allegiance, amongst them a young Japanese-American girl. Her inquisitive look belies what was happening across the country during the Second World War, as people of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated to internment camps. Lange had been working on a series of images documenting these deportations, only to see the photographs pulled from circulation, undermining the full context of what was happening. </p> \n<p>In viewing these images now, there are echoes of the same xenophobia and fear; throughout the COVID-19 crisis we are living through there has been a rise in racist attacks towards people of Asian descent; an increase in the deeply dehumanizing ways that this country asks those who appear to be ‘other’ to prove their loyalty, to always work harder for respect. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>One Nation Indivisible, San Francisco. 1942. Gelatin silver print, 13 1/8 x 9 13/16″ (33.4 x 25 cm). Dorothea Lange. The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Purchase \n<p>Lange’s images reveal the constant struggle for human dignity during governmental action or neglect. For all of the social injustices that Lange was committed to capturing and giving face to—one should not overlook the many moments and gestures of compassion depicted in her photographs. For example, the close-up photograph <em>Paul’s Hands (1957)</em> depicting the weathered hands of her husband. This other, lesser-known side of her work is lovingly explored through the inclusion of the book <em>Day Sleeper </em>by Sam Contis. Using Lange’s archives as source material, Contis created a book that plays off of the sensitivity of Lange’s photographs. The images include those from her later years, as well as her early studio work and family photographs. There are scenes of San Francisco in the 1950s and the vibrant street life of Richmond. Details and fragments of images are paired, dissected, and reconsidered to create one artist’s intimate view of another. </p> \n<p>In looking at the past we can often better understand our present. Lange’s place in the canon is justified—even more so when viewed from a distance. Her work speaks to the compassion, crisis, and dignity of lives lived, and the importance of bearing witness. Or, as Lange said: “It’s not pictorial illustration, it’s evidence.” </p> \n<div> \n <em>Editor’s note: </em>Dorothea Lange: Words &amp; Pictures\n <em>,</em>\n <em> curated by Sarah Meister with River Bullock, is currently on view on <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5079\">MoMA’s website</a>. </em> \n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/cortona-on-the-move-the-secret-to-a-great-photo-edit\">The Secret to a Great Photo Edit</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/issei-suda-anonymous-japanese-master-issei-suda\">Anonymous Japanese Master: Issei Suda</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/kim-llerena-american-blues\">American Blues</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-editors-international-photography-festivals-to-visit-in-2018\">International Photography Festivals to Visit in 2018</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/sean-thomas-foulkes-fragments-of-engagement\">Fragments of Engagement</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-picasso-picasso-the-camera\">Picasso &amp;amp; the Camera</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/25b7246f-bb15-4a17-b7f3-9c9f391467f0.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8d6cf829-6ce3-41c5-a33d-67066915d501.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/20a31922-29fc-4e19-9564-577b22ecb16c.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/32fefd62-8887-466c-81ec-3d2adcb3755d.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/5de605cb-b13d-4ffe-9465-f8ca0e9338b7.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/5150ab95-5647-4bf5-a84e-021e1871a22e.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4a14f161-5a1d-4a38-9ab3-822f3d56d5f9.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d45a8fce-fd33-4acd-81c5-046cfd4022b3.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/71d70ec1-6c28-4735-9d3f-6e21d67c163f.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 12:45:28 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/8d6cf829-6ce3-41c5-a33d-67066915d501.jpg","linkMd5":"765b0fe53599037e606d6723050d5a12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-47-785_7c945cdb6f473555.webp","destWidth":867,"destHeight":1542,"sourceBytes":265008,"destBytes":167258,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/8d6cf829-6ce3-41c5-a33d-67066915d501.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-47-785_7c945cdb6f473555.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/25b7246f-bb15-4a17-b7f3-9c9f391467f0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-02-922_170136da844fdcc3.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8d6cf829-6ce3-41c5-a33d-67066915d501.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-57-720_d1706be369e8957d.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/20a31922-29fc-4e19-9564-577b22ecb16c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-56-582_0d69ab7fc1e3b436.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/32fefd62-8887-466c-81ec-3d2adcb3755d.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-08-696_10a3909b6ef185ed.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/5de605cb-b13d-4ffe-9465-f8ca0e9338b7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-16-177_e8d83d3a00df0cd4.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/5150ab95-5647-4bf5-a84e-021e1871a22e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-53-578_af3c15231e03b3bd.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4a14f161-5a1d-4a38-9ab3-822f3d56d5f9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-12-635_8a79071f54022b6d.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d45a8fce-fd33-4acd-81c5-046cfd4022b3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-10-962_bce732c56454355c.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/71d70ec1-6c28-4735-9d3f-6e21d67c163f.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-00-030_4278e8ce964be17b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066814},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Greenfield.

With the help of 19 writers, he resurfaced with a beautiful book project that blurs the lines of fact and fiction.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For those of us interested in vernacular and orphaned photography, flea markets and second-hand shops are a goldmine. Amongst all the rubbish and knick-knacks that have passed through countless other hands, photographs reveal themselves as magical, magnetic entities, often sold at a low price point by vendors who have no attachment to the discarded scraps of memories—relics to some and shards of potential to others. </p> \n<p>One day in July 2016, as artist Pablo Lerma and his husband coursed through the lanes of the Hell’s Kitchen Flea Market in New York—a regular Sunday morning ritual for the couple—something caught his partner’s eye: a vendor selling a dark, wooden box full of small envelopes. Each paper vessel, inscribed with a file number and general notes, contained groupings of negatives, mostly in black and white, and a few in color. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Kraft Envelope © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The vendor approached the inquisitive Lerma, and explained how he acquired the box at an auction in Greenfield, Massachusetts, where the negatives were discarded by a photo store that went out of business. During his retelling, the vendor referred to the small images in Lerma’s hands as “the forgotten negatives.” Lerma reflects, “As soon as he said that, something resonated within me. I guess you could call that moment the starting point of the project—when he said it, I pictured it written with capital letters.” Acknowledging his curiosity, Lerma’s husband suggested purchasing the entire box for him as a birthday gift. After ten minutes of negotiating with the vendor, who initially propositioned the steep price of $500, the couple convinced him to whittle down the sale to a fraction of the price: $100. </p> \n<p>Having worked as a photographer across multiple roles for over 10 years, Lerma wears a multitude of hats, from practitioner to researcher to educator and everything in between. The photographs of his own making are stark and striking, harnessing the otherworldly capacities of natural light, ethereal landscapes and humankind’s relationship to external spaces, not in a traditional documentary sense, but through a method that acknowledges the language of photography’s limitations within the frame. Looking at Lerma’s photographs, you get the sense that he is the only one present for miles and miles—how does he find these spaces, and how does he interact with them without disruption? But Lerma’s introduction to what he now calls “the Greenfield Archive” is quite the departure from the sleek aesthetic of his previous practice, less to do with making his own photographs, and more focused on unlearning the structures that his years of formal training built up. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>M-4 Gratlock 003 © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>At first, this conceptual untangling made the mysterious box difficult to approach in a creative sense. Lerma knew it was important to him, but didn’t quite know how to interact with it. He remembers, “When we took the box home, it sat inside of a wardrobe in our apartment for a few weeks, even months. I was really hesitant about creating something out of those negatives. In a previous project, <em>A Place to Disappear</em>, where I worked with vernacular photographs and negatives, each of the objects were from the New York Public Library and Cornell University, so each image had so many details attached to it. Here, without that institutional information, it was somehow more difficult for me to create a connection to the material.” </p> \n<p>Every so often, Lerma would open the wardrobe, pull out the box, and inspect the negatives in the light, discovering something new each time he interacted with them. After many months, he started scanning them, and also began researching the geography of the USA to better understand the location of Greenfield, Massachusetts. To his surprise, there were more than 25 states in the country containing a town called Greenfield. “At that moment, I realized Greenfield was much bigger, and more akin to a stage for investigating American society during the time the images were produced,” he explains. Lerma scanned his collection over a number of weeks, often for eight hours a day, tracing the photographs’ dates, which were recorded on the envelopes from roughly the late 1930s to 1960s. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>More than 25 states in the USA have a town called Greenfield. © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>With this rough timeline, he delved deeper into American history, discovering that after the Second World War, the United States experienced an unprecedented baby boom motivated by veterans returning to the country, who were in need of cheap housing for their families. This catalyzed the birth of American suburbs, which were hastily constructed to accommodate growing families to live outside of major cities. </p> \n<p>“When you look through these pictures, there are no images from cities,” Lerma explains. “In fact, it’s the opposite, and all of the families are white. My research showed that when the first suburb in America, called Levittown, was created, it was specified that only families of Caucasian race could move in. All of this information—the post-war baby boom, the suburbs and the history of segregation—helped me understand why middle class white families are often the dominant representation in these photographic narratives.” </p> \n<p>Lerma then started looking through old snapshot camera manuals, often made by Kodak, and found even more interesting information about the construction of visuals in this chapter of American society. “Even though most of the negatives in the Greenfield Archive were produced with larger and more professional cameras, I started to realize that the photographers were aware of the trends of the moment, because they followed the same instructional aesthetic outlined in these Brownie manuals. I started to see how this concept of a ‘good photograph’ was constructed—the distance between camera and subject, or explicit instruction that the photographer had to be a man and the subject had to be a woman. Looking through the illustrations in those manuals, you start to see that there were defined roles in the representation of photography at that moment.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Kodak Ad © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The peculiar thing about vernacular photography is that we often consider it to be the closest thing we can get to an authentic or objective moment. Studio photographs are staged, documentary photographs are laced with the goals and aspirations of their makers, experimental photographs are saturated with the personal tastes of their creator, but vernacular images—family photographs, albums, snapshots—can’t possibly be riddled with intention. The stakes just aren’t high enough. But here, flipping through Kodak manuals, staring at the posed, straight white faces before him, Lerma started to realize that objectivity was often just as scarce in these ‘candid’ moments. </p> \n<p>If the snapshots themselves were shaped by industry rules, Lerma recognized that there might be more power in commentating on this lineage rather than attempting to ground the archive in static, historical facts. “It soon became obvious that this was the only way to fill in the gaps and give new meaning to the images. This project wasn’t about Greenfield, Massachusetts. It was about Greenfield: The Archive, where Greenfield is a stage presenting open questions for anyone to answer.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>D-8-4 Fred+Dot Wedding + Trip 005 © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>And what better way to present the relationship between fiction and material evidence than through another work of construction: the photobook. Lerma reached out to nineteen writers, asking them if they would be interested in contributing a piece about the archive in whatever method suited them—prose, poetry or historical research—expecting a handful to reply. To his surprise, sixteen of them responded, and after three months, the pieces started rolling in. When he sat down to read each text, Lerma realized he couldn’t always distinguish between heavy historical research and fabricated accounts, which ranged from tales narrated from the perspective of the subjects to socio-cultural commentary on race and sexuality. </p> \n<p>“The entire process was like performing a surgery, and it became clear that in the end, every interpretation of the archive is actually some sort of fiction. In my own essay, I reflect on my experience with the materials in a physical way, but also as a gay man who doesn’t see himself represented in the Greenfield Archives. In the end, this collection stands in for many other archives that put forth this strange, utopic representation of the world.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>D-5 Mallochs 001 © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Equipped with his new set of written perspectives, Lerma began playing around with the various narratives that his prospective photobook could take, creating dummies and approaching publishers, many of whom were interested in the elusive pictures. But he soon realized that a shiny, narrated version of the images—the format easiest to sell publishers on—wasn’t how he wanted the project to take shape. With the help of a publishing fellowship from <a href=\"http://www.saladartjove.cat/\">Art Jove</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.lapanera.cat\">Centre d’Art La Panera</a>, he was able to create the conceptual publication that best fit his line of inquiry, whether the marketability of its final form was immediate and effortless or not. </p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://meteoroeditions.com/Greenfield-The-Archive-P-Lerma\">Greenfield: The Archive</a></em> is a coil-bound, charcoal-black soft cover photobook.

The first section measures 5.75 x 7.75 inches, and its direct cover depicts faded, silvered duplicates of five of the images contained within.

After this we are guided to the second section, measuring 7.75 x 9.85 inches, titled “Part II: The Archive,” containing inverses of the black and white and color negatives, respectively, as well as the few included prints and an ‘envelope index’. </p> \n<p>Sifting through this section, images start to appear one page at a time, sometimes in small groupings of two or three and other times in larger collections that take up entire pages. While this might seem like an intentional act of sequencing and curation, it is actually a visual record of which images appeared together in which envelope. Lerma hasn’t edited them down for us to consume in a series of ‘decisive moments’—instead we see the full scope of subject matter, from possible outtakes to blurry accidents, to indiscernible, repetitive framings. At the bottom of each page, Lerma records the accompanying file numbers and titles inscribed on each envelope, formalizing the handwritten notations into his new interpretation. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>N-3 Vermont Devels Gorge_N-31 Bennington 007 © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>While he did acquire the images as negatives, they appear as positives in the book—an intentional choice that allows visitors to engage with the repetition and subject matter of each photograph organically, rather than through their radical inversions. The color images appear after the constellation of black and white photographs, signalling the emergence of new processes and the societal transition away from monochrome methods. Lerma’s diligent catalogue of each envelope connects the vessels back to their accompanying prints through file numbers, notes and physical descriptions of their content, so that the reader can flip back and forth between the material, making limitless associations. </p> \n<p>At first, this frills-free way of presenting the work might seem static and bare, reflecting the ostensibly synthetic world of data-entry more than the malleable universe of fiction. But for Lerma, the standards that human beings have developed to catalogue images—in photo studios, museums and archives around the world—are just as much a work of fiction as <em>Greenfield</em>’s accompanying textual perspectives. In order to make sense of the chaotic world of vernacular photography, cataloguing specialists assign data-based narratives to them, guiding the ways we access and interpret their information, drawing conclusions about their making. In the same way we take the subjectivity of snapshots for granted, we also tend to think of cataloguing as an objective practice. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Spread from “Greenfield. The Archive” © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>“To me, archivists in museums are magicians—they incorporate social background, heritage and life experience into a system that presents itself as completely objective. They have to find ways to work around the limitations and standards of museum conventions, somehow incorporating their own experience, which undeniably results in a subjective point of view. As an artist working with archives, I don’t see any tension between myself and an archivist; in fact, I think we both create fiction, just on different levels. Archives and museums play with different structures, and their institutional power dignifies their message in a capacity that I might not be able to reach as an artist—but we both produce records with the same ingredients.” </p> \n<p>At the tail end of his working with the Greenfield images, Lerma’s own surroundings started to shift: he and his family decided to move to the Netherlands to pursue a new set of professional opportunities. Needless to say, his immersion in this new type of photographic work, mixed with a substantial geographical move, further altered his relationship to the medium. </p> \n<p>“I always felt like I had so many ideas, but I was deeply attached to the assumption that I had to construct images from scratch, in a very intentional way, to match those thoughts. Making <em>Greenfield: The Archive</em> taught me that I can give new life to images that already exist in the world, and that it’s okay that I don’t always produce the photographs on my own. I am always extremely careful, trying to see three steps ahead of me at all times, which often establishes too many boundaries and limitations. But with <em>Greenfield</em>, I didn’t look at any other work, and I didn’t pay attention to anything that was happening in relation to other archival projects. For the first time, I wasn’t worried about the final result—I just trusted the process.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>N-4-2 Mt Monadnock 006 © Pablo Lerma\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pablo-lerma-greenfield-the-archive#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Speaking with Lerma, it’s clear that, more than ever before, the artist has found a project where each overturned stone welcomes even more questions, which he sets out to continue asking and answering through his publishing collaborations with other artists. Inspired by <em>Greenfield</em>, Lerma set up his own publishing imprint, Meteørø Editions, where he explores the archival work of other makers. His main wish is that these projects inspire curiosity and wonder in his own audience—as both artist and publisher. </p> \n<p>Looking back on his journey, he reflects, “When people interact with these books, I want them to experience the same thing that I experience: every time I open up <em>Greenfield: The Archive</em>, I discover something new. Even after spending so much time with this material, I always find something I haven’t noticed before. I want people to approach the book as an endless source of stories: <em>Who do you think the photographer is? Can we possibly know from the images alone?</em> Many would say yes; others might see something different. But the magic of it is that each question leads you to more intriguing questions to grapple with.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n <div class=\"picture\"> \n  <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18677-greenfield-the-archive\"></a> \n </div> \n <div class=\"title\">\n  Greenfield.

I think I really just wanted to start my life over again and build my practice around giving myself the care I need.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“#1”, 2014.

The area that the artist’s body covered receives no light exposure and appears white, while the fully exposed areas around her body are black, creating a striking reverse-silhouette of her form that bears witness to her powerfully vulnerable experience. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“A Womb of My Own (Mistakes Were Made in Development)”.

Davis explains, “Making this work changed me. As I changed, the work changed. I started working more loosely and intuitively. I stopped working within a grid, started hand-applying developer, and started incorporating crochet and singing—self-care rituals I use on a daily basis to keep sane. I made sure to only create what I felt like, when I felt like I needed to create it for myself.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Performance: Anchor Song, Lecture at the Visual Studies Workshop.

Often different mediums overlap and enrich each other, with each step feeding into the next. For example, Davis crochets while singing, making the initial stitching that defines each piece, that crocheters call the foundation chain, the length of a single song. Later, she uses her crocheted pieces in the darkroom to create web-like patterns within her photograms. She also installs her crocheted pieces as stand-alone works, sometimes hanging them from the ceiling, sometimes with her laying atop them on the gallery floor and performing the music to which they were made. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“#7”, in progress.

There, she began to experiment with cyanotypes—a historic photographic printing process that produces Persian-blue prints in sunlight. Working in parks across Brooklyn, such as Prospect Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park, and the pocket park near her apartment, she has augmented this process to create abstract photograms on fabric by selectively developing and felting cyanotype-coated pieces of canvas, silks, and linen, leaving the undeveloped portions of each fabric to change and react to the environment continually. </p> \n<p>While combining these printing and fabric-making techniques into a hybrid that complicates the notion of photography, she bends the medium to meet her evolving needs. Davis explains, “Since I made my practice a way for me to process my feelings, my work has become a sort of journal, documenting my recovery. These cyanotypes feel like a new entry in that journal. Making them is less about responding to stress and more about enjoying the art-making process.” </p> \n<p><em>Editor’s note: This fall, Davis will be included in the exhibition</em> One<em> at </em><a

Time seems at a standstill in Natela Grigalashvili’s photographs of mountainous Adjara, a region in western Georgia. Here, the locals traditionally move their herds to pasture grounds in the mountains in summer before returning in winter. Yet things are changing rapidly for them. Many have to seek seasonal work in Turkey for additional income, as more and more families leave their villages for cities. The mountain huts are emptying out.</em><br> </br></p> \n<p><em>Natela Grigalashvili, the first female photojournalist in post-soviet Georgia, has been photographing the </em>The Final Days of Georgian Nomads<em> for several years now. Her images bring a delicate balance of tenderness and grit to her documentation of life in the mountains. Inevitably, the way of life in mountainous Adjara will change. In Grigalashvili’s photographs, the foggy, highland landscape will always feel like home. </em> </p> \n<p><em>In this interview, Grigalashvili spoke with Misho Antadze for LensCulture about learning from her memories and experiences, connecting with her subjects and the photography clubs she has opened in the places where she works.

How did you come to photography?</strong> </p> \n<p>Natela Grigalashvili : I was born in rural Georgia, I grew up there, and I used to draw since I was a child. I fell in love with cinema early on, specifically with documentary films. I wanted to become a documentary cinematographer, and I heard that you need to know photography to do so. My friend gave me the cheapest camera on the market, a Soviet ‘Smena’, and that’s how I started to photograph. I did not end up studying anywhere, because at that time educational institutions were shut due to the situation in the country. I did, however, receive the certification of a studio photographer. So, I did not end up going into movies, but I became a photographer. And I’m very happy about how it turned out. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Maiko makes coffee for her guests, while her family is at the summer pastures © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: As a photographer, you started your career working as a photojournalist. How would you describe the experience, and how did you start working on personal projects?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: I became a photojournalist quite quickly. There were no women photographers at that time in Georgia, so that was unusual. Working in the press gave me some important experience, like communicating with people, and learning to be more self-reliant and independent. But after some time, I understood that I wasn’t born to be a photojournalist. For years, it has been just a source of income. It took up a lot of my time because it was a very hard period in Georgian history. I had my family and my child to support, so I didn’t have a choice, but the entire time I was thinking about what I want to do with photography. The kind of work that I was given was tedious and boring for me. One day, I left it all behind and started working on my own projects. That was made possible for me by a grant from the Open Society Foundation, and it gave me some time to work independently. </p> \n<p><strong>MA: How did you first arrive in Mountainous Adjara? Could you tell our readers about the place, and the people that live there?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: All my projects are very personal, and I’ve thought about them for a long time. I also spend a long time wherever I go to photograph. The projects that I take on, both consciously and subconsciously are connected with me, my life, my past. That’s why they mostly deal with rural areas, and with the people to whom I feel a spiritual connection. I think that even in a very remote area, I can find my childhood memories. I choose topics that are close to me, and Mountainous Adjara felt that way. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Emine prepares children for the first day of school © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>More than other places in Georgia, it preserves a way of life that has almost disappeared elsewhere. This expresses itself in many things, like in everyday life, in customs and traditions. But even in these places, changes happen very fast. I can see it happening in front of my eyes, between my visits. It affects me a lot. It’s very sad to see villages emptying out. Almost all of the families now also have a home in a city. Most of them leave to give their children a better education. Those brought up in a city rarely return to a village. It is no longer a home environment for them. </p> \n<p>This is what mountainous Adjara means to me, the people, the relationships. I spend a lot of time there even without a camera. I want to meet these people. When I arrive in a new village, sometimes the locals are surprised by how much I, an outsider, know them. They ask me: “How do you know our customs?” and I tell them that they’re very important to me. When I go back home, I think 50% of what I bring back are the photos, and the rest are the relationships that I’ve established with people along the way. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Broli collecting Hay © Natela Grigalashvili \n<p><strong>MA: I am thinking about an image that I especially like. A woman is working on the side of the mountain. Light is changing in the background, and the work is quite hard. Nevertheless, she is smiling. How do you establish a relationship with your subjects?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: Often, people that I photograph don’t know who I am, and tell me “you don’t seem like you are from a city, you’re like one of us.” And I think that’s important for them, so they know that you’re not there just to take a photo and lose all interest afterwards. I am not playing to win their hearts. I want to understand their lives fully. For the women, for example,it’s interesting to know how they get married. Some of them meet the bridegroom only at the engagement. It’s interesting to listen to them, to hear how their life goes after that. </p> \n<p>It brings you closer to people when they see that you’re not playing, that their environment is familiar to you. If I started working in another environment, I think it would have been very different. These women start working very early on in their lives. Around age 10, a girl already knows how to perform all of the household tasks. Boys start early too. They’re very hard-working. It’s also a kind of a tradition. They can’t even imagine it otherwise. They’re tidy and fastidious. Unlike other places in Georgia. So sometimes what looks like hard labor for us is everyday life for them. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Tamriko © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: The tradition of pastoral images is quite central to Georgian arts, whether in painting, cinema and even in photography. In your images, you strike a delicate balance between the landscape and portraiture. The landscape becomes personal. What does the landscape mean for you? </strong> </p> \n<p>NG: Maybe the pastoral theme used to be important in Georgian arts, but not anymore. It would be nice if it were again. I think urban life is a more dominant theme in Georgian arts today, and even that is divided into different parts. But life in rural areas is frozen, and so is the interest for it from city artists. But the landscape is very important to me. I think it is the environment that makes these people, and maybe all of us, the way they are. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Returning too the lowlands from the summer pastures © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: In your previous series, you’ve photographed the Doukhobors, a tiny, Russian-speaking religious minority. Now, you are introducing us to the inhabitants of Mountainous Adjara, who are mostly Muslim. Both of these societies exist on the periphery socially as much as geographically and are diminishing in numbers. Why are you drawn to explore this subject through photography? What place does the idea of faith hold in your work?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: Faith was not my main interest in choosing the topics. But faith makes these places unique. I’m repeating myself, but unfortunately, the unique lifestyles of these people are disappearing, and it affects me a lot. There’s a lot of causes for it. For example, Gorelovka is the largest village of the Doukhobors. There are around 55 families left. Years will pass, and generations after us will say that we’ve lost a big part of our country’s culture. Their houses are being destroyed. Before I went there, I’d only seen a Russian stove in movies and heard about it in fairytales, and it’s the only place where you can find it in Georgia. Or the Russian-type Khata hut, and many other things, are unfortunately disappearing. Ethnic minorities are the riches of our country. We need to take care of this diversity, but we don’t. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>A man returns home at the end of the day © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: When looking at this series, I think about the fog. It is as if your figures appear out of it, and disappear into it. But you also show moments of sunshine, a rainbow, harvest, and snow. We see people at work and at play… </strong> </p> \n<p>NG: I love the fog very much. I spent a month in a village last year, and it was foggy every day. The locals would joke that it’s my fault. It’s so mysterious, and I like to think that it’s like my character. Some people like the fog, but others don’t. But it has so many great qualities to it, it really sets the mood. </p> \n<p><strong>MA: Photographers often show rural Georgia as either romantic or desolate. You avoid this tendency, and your images are much more balanced. How do you manage this?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: I think it’s only because these places are so familiar to me, I can’t look at them differently. This is my environment, my world. I can’t look at it as either romantic, neither do I see only the impoverishment. Many people, including photographers, just don’t want to see that it’s simply a different way of life. A lot of people look at my photos and say: “These people are so poor.” But Mountainous Adjara is not poor at all! These people are very hardworking who live quite well. But people don’t understand that their different way of dressing, their house interiors are just their way of life. To see reality, it is important to be one of them, to understand their joys and their sadness, not to remain an outsider. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Darejan, mother of five with one of her daughters on the pastures © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: I know you’ve played an active role in the communities that you photograph. Could you tell me more about the photography clubs that you’ve established in the places where you work?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: I myself grew up in a village where nothing really happened, where nothing happens now. As time went by, I thought how nice it would be if someone taught me photography when I was younger. I was already older when I first held a camera because no-one around me had one when I was growing up. So I wanted to start teaching and did it first in Gorelovka. It was very interesting, because Gorelovka is ethnically and religiously diverse, but not necessarily harmonious. I opened the first photo club here. </p> \n<p>The oldest member was 62, the youngest was 15. We went everywhere together and took photos. My main intention was to bring them closer to the arts so that their normal experiences would become extraordinary through photography. They saw that they could hang the landscape they see every day on a wall, and people would come to see it and be amazed by it. I have opened these clubs in several places where I’ve worked. They’ve become very popular, and I’m asked to do it again. Now I’m going to do it with young people, in the pastures of Mountainous Adjara. It’s very good that people are interested in art. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>16-year old Melano helps her family with the harvest © Natela Grigalashvili\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/natela-grigalashvili-the-final-days-of-georgian-nomads#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MA: This current project is still a work in progress. What are your plans for the future?</strong> </p> \n<p>NG: I was there last this winter, and then everything that happened with Covid-19 interrupted my work. Mountainous Adjara is so quite large and so diverse, and as a project, is inexhaustible. Sometimes, I meet people who tell me to go to their village, because it’s different from the others. And I like to spend a long time in these places. Unfortunately, it’s not completely dependent on me, but on financing the project. So I don’t know when I’ll finish. </p> \n<p><strong>MA: Your photography is now recognized abroad as much as it is in Georgia. How does the reception of your work differ at home and abroad? Do you think that photography is a universal language? Do you feel something is lost in translation between contexts? </strong> </p> \n<p>NG: Sometimes, non-Georgians show even more interest than at home. They can be more interested in individual people, and ask very interesting questions. How do these people live? What makes them happy? What pains them? I am even surprised by how they pay attention to very small details. They don’t see it as only romantic. No matter where we live, we like in the same way, we love in the same way, we hate in the same way, and we all have similar emotions. So I don’t think much is lost. </p> \n<p><br><br> </br></br></p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deutsche-borse-photography-prize-deutsche-borse-2017-shortlist\">Deutsche Börse 2017: Shortlist</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-lange-highway-61\">Highway 61</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vincent-catala-rio-an-inner-shore\">Rio: An Inner Shore</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/zhang-kechun-the-yellow-river\">The Yellow River</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jakob-schnetz-trade-show\">Trade Show</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/boris-mikhailov-boris-mikhailov-a-retrospective\">Boris Mikhailov: A Retrospective</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1e2c8426-6008-4303-9024-8281068c8003.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4d93418c-b333-4a1a-afd8-94090dff71b8.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/caa45628-8692-4ed6-9c7f-b41735b83dca.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a2498869-9731-4047-912f-9842d8f8bd6a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/cac98e68-110b-4128-ae32-e20ccb403e19.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/80fb7508-328c-4a1c-a7a6-930a3cfdaa92.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d07b3adb-7d4f-46ca-88c5-4e9ca3966343.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/cbdac1b7-8e69-43b1-b56c-a68ddde651d1.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 20:31:48 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/a2498869-9731-4047-912f-9842d8f8bd6a.jpg","linkMd5":"562fc47414b00694b5782c1559e602c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-047_ec4cd654cb294386.webp","destWidth":749,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":157461,"destBytes":89418,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/a2498869-9731-4047-912f-9842d8f8bd6a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-047_ec4cd654cb294386.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1e2c8426-6008-4303-9024-8281068c8003.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-38-15-051_b371662fad7f3a34.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4d93418c-b333-4a1a-afd8-94090dff71b8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-16-249_c921808464d0eba8.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/caa45628-8692-4ed6-9c7f-b41735b83dca.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-51-531_80c72d6f74896896.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a2498869-9731-4047-912f-9842d8f8bd6a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-13-342_7117bc0346fc8e71.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/cac98e68-110b-4128-ae32-e20ccb403e19.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-15-293_420ac09b4d18ecf5.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/80fb7508-328c-4a1c-a7a6-930a3cfdaa92.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-55-330_ac56378551c2d9b4.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d07b3adb-7d4f-46ca-88c5-4e9ca3966343.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-14-653_05cbb025852ac94d.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/cbdac1b7-8e69-43b1-b56c-a68ddde651d1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-04-351_04d6fd20ace66898.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066811},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Stranger Fruit","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jon-henry-stranger-fruit","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Stranger Fruit</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Jon Henry</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/4ad23990-d72b-4a00-b195-931990522c3e.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  These portraits were created in response to the murders of African American men, due to police violence.

arrives in lake country where camp life awaits. The call to adventure promises bunk beds, communal dining, activities in the woods, swimming in the lake, and camp fires at night. For children who are just beginning to navigate the world on their own, camp life presents an alternate world for them to explore. </p> \n<p><em>Summer Camp</em> was made between 1986 and 1997 at camps in North Carolina, Massachusets, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Georgia. The project marks a departure from the earlier photographs Steinmetz had been making on the streets of LA and New York; his interest had turned towards making a coherent body of work by focusing on a particular subject for a longer period of time, an approach that continued in all his subsequent work.<br> </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Summer Camp” © Mark Steinmetz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mark-steinmetz-summer-camp#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>During the early years working on <em>Summer Camp</em>, he also photographed little league baseball players in the spring and carnival crowds in the fall. All three bodies of work examined a specific subject matter at a specific time of year, and, as in the case of <em>Summer Camp</em> and little league baseball, a specific age. Although the work was made over two decades, his approach draws out elements that withstand generational or topical change: moments of thoughtfulness and affection; expressions of humor and playfulness; the quiet of rest found in solitude.<br> </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Summer Camp” © Mark Steinmetz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mark-steinmetz-summer-camp#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Steinmetz initially gained access to various camps by working as staff. In some places he taught photography, collecting items in the woods with the children and then returning to the camps’ darkrooms to make photograms. Other years, he was hired as a camp photographer for promotional material, official publications, portraiture and so on. The work was shot on both 35mm and medium format film and maintains a visual coherence reflected in the tonality and technical approach to the subject matter. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Summer Camp” © Mark Steinmetz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mark-steinmetz-summer-camp#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>With the timelessness of his black and white photographs, Steinmetz captures the physicality and emotional vulnerability of adolescence. A child is still small in the world, the emotions poignant, less constrained by time<em>.</em> In the small, private world of summer camp, the securities of home are replaced by the rustic setting of cabins with bunk beds and screen doors, while flashlights replace reading lamps and firelight replaces television. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Summer Camp” © Mark Steinmetz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mark-steinmetz-summer-camp#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The sequencing of the book travels through a typical weekend of camp experiences, but the distinction between the different summer camps is never apparent. Here are children playing in the lake; there they relax in the afternoon, reading, drying off, spending moments alone; over here gathered around the breakfast table, dewy-eyed and still dreaming. In the end, <em>Summer Camp </em>finishes with the perennial event of any camp retreat: bonfires and candlelight rituals. The final image of the book is of a bus waiting to leave the next morning. Children embrace in the shared emotional experiences and new found friendships made at camp. </p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a

that we can travel the world through a screen? In her hand-colored photographs, sourced from virtual tours of national parks hosted on Google, Brea Souders invokes the romanticism and tradition of landscape photography to question its status in the present.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It’s been a long time since we’ve needed to leave our homes to explore the world. Longer still since ‘Explorer’ has been a valid occupation. We’ve mapped the Earth down to its dirt. The internet is our vessel now. We can ‘go’ anywhere, ‘see’ anyplace. For travels through American landscapes, we’ve swapped the once-required horse-driven wagon and months of dangerous journey for a few keystrokes on our computers; a flick of the wrist, really. </p> \n<p>In order to voyage through Brea Souders’ <em>Vistas</em>, we must first understand how her pictures were made. The artist culls anonymous shadow selfies from 360-degree photographs of U.S. national parks found on Google. The image-stitching algorithms, as magnificent a technology as they are, have difficulty in knowing how to handle the shadows left on the ground by camera operators, leaving fragmented artifacts of human presence amid their techno-mediated views of the natural world. Souders takes these views, prints them, and applies watercolors to form resemblances of hand-colored travel postcards of an older time. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>What results is a kind of picture that nimbly enters into numerous conversations old and new. In the history of Western art, the landscape picture is something of a vessel that carries within it the cultural and social values of its maker’s time. During the Renaissance, landscape rendering was cloaked in biblical narrative, a foil upon which depictions of mythology could perform. As the world moved toward the modern era, the landscape picture went through its own phases of romanticism, realism, impressionism, cubism, following along in the changes of its larger social contexts. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The lines of artistic tradition and definition in our current age are no longer so cleanly delineated. We live in a world of fragmentation, speed, and mass plurality of cultural expression. While the changes of physical land are measured in ages and eons, the changes to how we <em>represent</em> land now shift from second to second. It moves in all directions all at once, and in unpredictable ways. Landscape is a mirror for reflections of the day; reflections that are mired in ever-complicating social, ecological, and technological conditions. So the question comes now of what Souders’ <em>Vistas</em> carry within their frames. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The perspectival space in Souders’ images places our viewing of these fragmented figures as sights of our own shadows. From one picture to the next we enter into these spaces and take part in the artist’s game of association. In one scene we might be a cowboy. In another, a Victorian gentlewoman. We become adventurers and explorers, but we also become angels and demons, and sometimes outright monstrosities. There is a primitive signature in these grounded silhouettes, like contemporary cave drawings stamped onto ground and left as evidence for our speculation. The pictures illustrate evidence of their own makings, shadows of their original authors out in the natural world. But when we look at these pictures, we inevitably see ourselves, costumed, performing, taking on fantastical identities rooted in archetypal imagination. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Souders’ hand-coloring recalls a form of photography born in the late 19th century that had a particular ambition to circumvent the natural limitations of B&amp;W’s illusion of reality. Color makes photographs more real, more present, and more in and of our world. In the context of Souders’ work, it’s only ironic that our growing dependence and assimilation into virtual space brings us further from the natural world, turning <em>Vistas</em> into a tug-of-war between what we once were as humans, and what we are now. Photography <em>has</em> changed us, the internet <em>is</em> changing us. And Souders’ work helps to illustrate just how so. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Within the simple structure of Souders’ pictures, there lie countless threads to untangle. Though beyond interpretation, what might be more valuable is to consider the various questions that <em>Vistas</em> poses to us: </p> \n<p>Where are we now positioned in relation to the old traditions of American landscape photography? What was asked of landscape photographs in the 19th century, and what is asked of them today? How are we ourselves positioned in relation to the world within the omnipotent virtual realm? How has our relationship to the natural world changed in the last one-hundred and fifty years, or in the past five years for that matter? What ancient stories can we still connect to? What aspects of us, as humans, can never change? As wireless technology has placed all the world’s knowledge within the air that we breathe, what has this condition done to our curiosity, our imagination? Who are we on the internet, and what is the nature of an identity that becomes networked, fragmented across platforms, monitored, and mined for information? And how much further will we venture into the virtual world? What frontiers are left to explore in a digitized reality, and what will we leave behind in this journey? </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Vistas” © Brea Souders\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/brea-souders-vistas#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Our photographic age is changing rapidly, excitingly even, and as technological shifts have churned us into a consistent state of upheaval, past photographic traditions must adapt rapidly to keep pace. Brea Souders’ <em>Vistas</em> represents a new kind of American landscape photograph, and a necessary one. Her pictures acknowledge the past if only to better consider the present. We don’t need more photographic documents of the landscape; it’s all been mapped and accounted for. What we need in this moment are thoughtfully considered reflections of what the land is now, and how our relationships to it are changing. The subject of Souders’ pictures is us. Me and you now staring into our screens, maybe wishing we were someplace else. </p> \n<hr> \n <p><br> </br></p>\n <p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a

<figcaption>\n  A new book shows Shirley Baker’s documentary work from a different perspective, shedding light on her playful and tender street photography.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Shirely Baker’s recognition as an important figure in British documentary photography came too late. She died shortly before her 2015 retrospective at The Photographers’ Gallery in London. <i>Shirley Baker</i>, Lou Stoppard’s new book on the photographer, introduces a lot of previously unpublished photographs and opens up new dimensions to her work beyond the social documentary photography of the 1960s and early 1970s, with which she has become identified: the ‘slum’ clearances in Salford and Manchester, highlighting the fragility of communities through the Blitz-like devastation of the demolition taking place around them. </p> \n<p>While the photographs in this new book still includes examples of her work taken in the north of England, it also includes images taken in Italy, Spain, and the South of France, where she holidayed, and also London and Japan, where her doctor husband went for work. All still have value and interest as documents—as records of dress, fashions, styles and ways of being in public that are no more—but the emphasis has shifted. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>‘Stockport, England, 1967’ from ‘Shirley Baker’ (MACK, 2019). Courtesy of Nan Levy for the Estate of Shirley Baker and MACK\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/shirley-baker-a-photography-of-gestures#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Stoppard suggests Baker’s work benefits from the fact she did not socialize with other photographers, editors or curators, but worked independently. “It is delightfully untainted by influence or feedback,” the author notes. “What is often overlooked […] is that photographers are often greatly influenced by picture editors, and nowadays by gallery curators and people from arts’ bodies who dole out commissions.” While this has meant her photography has been made outside the constraints that such a system can impose, at the same time, it means her work is now being edited and shaped by others, posthumously.<br> </br></p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>‘Altrincham, England, 1985’ from ‘Shirley Baker’ (MACK, 2019). Courtesy of Nan Levy for the Estate of Shirley Baker and MACK\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/shirley-baker-a-photography-of-gestures#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">Baker’s gender is, as Stoppard notes, an undeniable determining factor in her work and her relative lack of acclaim: “As a woman in that era, she, of course, experienced daily the feeling of being passed over, regarded as unserious, insignificant, rejected.” This can also be seen to have a relation to her subject matter—the gravitation toward working-class communities uprooted by demolition, as well as the travellers and squatters who moved into the derelict homes, and her interest in what she has referred to as “the more mundane, even trivial aspects of life that were not being recorded by anyone else” </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>‘Salford, England, 2000’ from ‘Shirley Baker’ (MACK, 2019). Courtesy of Nan Levy for the Estate of Shirley Baker and MACK \n<p><span class=\"s1\">Class is still a marker of this new volume of her pictures and yet they are not driven by a polemical agenda. The street continues to be very much a social space and site of play, there is a freedom and openness to the way people interact and engage with each other and Baker. In more recent street scenes, accent is on convivial moments; a family sunning itself on the doorstep, boys who have set up a little pool table on the street. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">Hers is also a photography of gestures, touch and contact: in her picture of the modernist sculpture of Henry Moore on show in Bradford, the white space does not prevent gallery goers physically touching and interacting with the sculptures. Art is not separate from life. An entanglement with forms of representation characterizes many photographs: a girl scrambling up an outdoor sculpture of a naked woman is shown at the moment she holds on to the figure’s breast. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>‘Lausanne, Switzerland, 1977’ from ‘Shirley Baker’ (MACK, 2019).

Attentive to the woman standing before him, the posture of the man suggests a state of relaxation and softening. His head is shown leaning to one side, rhyming with the head of the female mannequin in the shop window behind him, a connection and association that plays against assumptions of masculinity and the hardness of the two crash helmets he is holding. In a sunny picture in St Tropez, a display of kitsch paintings—flowers, children, sunsets and seascapes—frame a couple’s close embrace. The woman has her back to camera, and sits on her partner’s lap, her lover’s hands are interlocked around her, an intimate moment amplified by the cheery joy of paintings all around them. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>‘St Tropez, France, 1980’ from ‘Shirley Baker’ (MACK, 2019).

The Photographers’ Gallery show, predominantly focusing on work from the 1960s, expanded upon the social accent of the Bloodaxe 1989 publication <i>Street Photographs</i> that concentrated on her ‘slum’ clearance work. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">Stoppard’s book introduces something new in the formal emphasis in her work. The spaces of leisure and holidaying she photographs certainly open up new kinds of pictures. The weight of documentary is lightened by the sense of Baker as a playful picture maker. But we still are yet to discover how much more of this work is out there waiting to be published and how typical it is of the photographs she has been taking, after her work from the 1960s and early 1970s.</span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n <div class=\"picture\"> \n  <a

Below, we talk with her about her editorial background, IMA’s mission, </em><em>and the questions she asks herself every time she views new photography.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>LC: Yo</strong><strong>u started your career on the editorial side of fashion magazines such as <i>Marie Claire</i> and </strong><strong><i>Esquire—</i>do you think this experience impacts the way you view the contemporary </strong><strong>photography you work with at <em>IMA</em> magazine?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MO: Yes, I started my career at fashion magazines—but for years I was in charge of contemporary art, not fashion. This experience definitely taught me how to look at art photography more objectively. It is often said that there is no bridge between contemporary art and photography in Japan, but I could look at photography as a contemporary art as a result of my previous work experience.\n</p>\n<p>Also, as opposed to Western editions, the Japanese editions of <i>Marie Claire</i> and <i>Esquire</i> attached much more importance to cultural content. Believe it or not, they often released special issues that featured only topics such as literature, photography and art.\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in Japan, celebrated photographers such as <a href=\"http://azito-art.com/artists/takashi-homma/\">Homma Takashi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/rinko-kawauchi\">Rinko Kawauchi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/risaku-suzuki\">Suzuki Risaku</a> create their own works in parallel with editorial work. This is a cultural tradition that was inherited from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuyoshi_Araki\">Nobuyoshi Araki</a> and <a href=\"http://www.moriyamadaido.com/english/\">Daidō Moriyama</a>. Thus, even for a fashion magazine, there were a lot of connections between art photographers and their commissioned projects.\n</p>\n<p><strong>LC: Can you tell us how <em>IMA</em> came to be? As Editorial Director, would you like to see the </strong><strong>magazine grow in a particular direction?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MO: I often thought during my previous career that directing an art magazine would be a dream. I knocked on many doors with a business proposal for a new magazine, and subsequently my business partner and I got the idea approved by amana inc [a Japanese advertising company]. Its owner wanted a magazine that would specialize in art photography. That is <i>IMA</i>’s birth story.\n</p>\n<p><strong>LC: You released your first English edition of <em>IMA</em> in 2016. What influenced your decision to </strong><strong>release an English version of the magazine? Photography is said to be a “universal </strong><strong>language”―yet text can make a big difference. Can you say more?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MO: There is a very simple reason: there were requests from <em>IMA</em> readers abroad who said that they would love to read the text in English. There is also a bigger mission: we would like young Japanese talent to become promoted and gain publicity in both domestic and foreign markets. There are not many Japanese artists who handle their own publicity. In addition, information about (and acknowledgment of) Japanese photography is not great abroad. It isn’t properly appreciated in the broad history of photography.\n</p>\n<p>But as you say, photography is a form of global expression. <em>IMA</em> aims to reveal the meaning, context and story behind a work in order to convey its essence. Thus, our texts are composed not only by photo critics, but also experts from many different fields: movie directors, novelists, neuroscientists and fashion designers. We want our readers to enjoy the work; we also want each of them to know how to “look at” photography. That is our big challenge for the future.\n</p>\n<p><strong>LC: Can you name a couple of photographers you’ve discovered recently who stand out as </strong><strong>producing innovative, compelling work? What about their work makes it persuasive? Do they </strong><strong>share any qualities that make them appealing to you as an editor?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MO: We are in an era of significant change. The world and medium are transforming simultaneously. But a few practitioners have stood out recently. One, <a href=\"http://fumiishino.com/untitled/#1\">Fumi Ishino</a>, creates highly contextualized works through his unique approach: he aims to visualize our chaotic contemporary moment. He also takes different paths to finish a series so that his photographic expression continually grows. Each new series always surprises me.\n</p>\n<p>Another, <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/kazuma-obara\">Kazuma Obara</a>, has great insights into human nature and our collective history. He has a unique method that mixes journalistic and fictional elements through meticulous research and practice.\n</p>\n<p><strong>LC: <em>IMA</em> is dedicated to publishing work by up-and-coming photographers―so, do you have any </strong><strong>words of wisdom for “emerging” photographers who are looking to break into the world of </strong><strong>contemporary photography? Whether for those entering <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/photo-competitions/critics-choice-2020\">Critics’ Choice 2020</a></strong><strong> or for people trying to catch your eye in the crowded marketplace of photography?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MO: Is the concept inevitable for this particular artist?<br>\n</p>\n<p>Is the expression genuinely something I’ve never seen before?<br>\n</p>\n<p>Does the work have meaning in its conceptualization, and does it also link to society, the world and its people?<br>\n</p>\n<p>Does the work connote power and break stereotypes?<br>\n</p>\n<p>Does the work have elements that can move people?\n</p>\n<p>I always ask myself those questions when looking at photography. I look forward to finding new artists who create such work.<br>\n</p>\n<p>—Mutsuko Ota, interviewed by Coralie Kraft\n</p><p>Enjoy more great photography:</p><ul><li><a

pioneering master of color street photography talks about his passions and the energy of the street in this wide-ranging audio interview.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>Joel Meyerowitz is a pioneer of street photography. He started in the early 1960s in New York City, using color film when most other photographers were shooting in black-and-white. He’s had exhibitions of his work all over the world, and has published more than 30 books. A retrospective of his work is scheduled to be shown in Berlin later this year, and he’s working on a new project of self-portraits. At age 82, he’s continuing to explore the medium of photography every day. </em> </p> \n<p><em>We’re delighted that Joel will be on the jury for the <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/photo-competitions/street-photography-awards-2020\">LensCulture Street Photography Awards 2020</a>. In April 2020, during the isolation of the corona-virus lockdown, he took time for a wide-ranging conversation with Jim Casper. Among other things, they talked about: how a photographer finds his or her own voice in photography; memories of working the streets of NYC in the 1960s with Garry Winogrand and Tod Papageorge; documenting the aftermath of 9/11; how iPhones have changed the texture of street photography forever; and advice for how to key into your own personal inspiration to make photographs that are uniquely your own. <br><br><em>He’s an enthusiastic, animated speaker, and his love of photography comes through every minute. </em><br><br>LISTEN to this conversation while looking at some of Meyerowitz’s iconic photographs in the article below. We’ve also provided a written version of the conversation for those who prefer to read. Enjoy!</br></br></br></br></em> </p> \n<p><em><br /></em> </p> \n<p><strong><br /></strong> </p> \n<p><strong>To start with, you once said, “An ordinary life isn’t ordinary when you put a frame around a moment.” I wonder if you could talk about that and tell me what transforms an ordinary moment into an extraordinary photograph?</strong> </p> \n<p>Well, that’s actually a lovely quote. I said that? [laughs] Well, we all — without a camera — live our lives looking at everything. We’re just constantly swiveling our head and seeing things, but we’re not making anything out of it. And for me, photography is the act of making something out of the fluid reality that’s scrolling by us all the time. </p> \n<p>We individually have some sense of what’s important to us. And by carrying a camera, you have this fluid frame. And if instinct — you know, gut instinct or gut recognition — raises a moment of consciousness, the camera comes up and you’re in that moment and the frame gets rid of the stuff all around that you don’t want. </p> \n<p>Of course it’s a moving frame when you bring up the camera and you are impulsively moving things to put more space left-right, top-bottom, include-exclude. But that’s a decision and a conscious decision. Even if we make it on impulse, it’s still our decision. And there’s a certain kind of consistency to that over time. Just look at Robert Frank. Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand. Anybody who shoots regularly has a point of view, a way of referring to the world that they see, that we identify after a while. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>New York City, 1974 © Joel Meyerowitz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joel-meyerowitz-ready-for-surprise-joel-meyerowtiz-interview-2020#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a>And for me, I think it’s the identity that each of us has that becomes visible in the frame that the camera places around fluid reality. So it’s both a challenge and a very interesting way of learning about yourself. For me, it’s been an incredible self-education throughout the course of my life. What am I capable of seeing at any given moment in my evolution? What else can I see in the world? How else can I use photography as a resource to show me my interests, my capacities, my visual sensitivity, my reading of the public space of the time we’re living in? I use it in a lot of different ways to educate myself. \n<p><strong><br /></strong> </p> \n<p><strong>And it comes across. I do feel like I’m looking through your eyes when I’m looking at your photographs. I’m seeing seeing the world the way you see it. And I really like that. I like taking that trip through the streets and noticing what you notice.</strong> </p> \n<p>Yeah. But you know what, I want to add something to that because I think it’s important. How can I put this? The challenge really is to be open enough as an artist that the photograph I may take is not such a fixed work of art that it stands out there and you look at it and then move on to the next framed piece in the show. I’m trying to make them portals into the momentary characters of reality so the viewer can enter in as if they’re standing in my shoes. </p> \n<p>I try not to be too managerial. I try not to lock it down so that it has certain familiar characteristics about framing or formal organization. I like the loose, broken, open-ended quality of photography because then the viewer enters and has an experience of their own, of that moment in time. And that’s the thing I think I’m sharing. </p> \n<p><strong>That’s interesting, this kind of loose, open, broken nature. Are there essential qualities for a street photograph to really work for you? Are there certain elements or certain things that have to come together to make a street photograph stand out?</strong> </p> \n<p>Well, first of all, I think the most important quality is the surprise of recognizing something that has manifested itself now, out of the chaos of the street. Suddenly there’s a sense — there’s never certainty, but there’s a sense — that there are elements gathering together in front of me that might produce something interesting. And it’s not that it happens and I raise the camera. I often see things up the street coming towards me that are exciting my mind’s potential. I think of it as “reading the text of the street.” </p> \n<p> That’s one of those things that I’ve said before because it is a fluid kind of text. And if you are paying attention to the whole, which means where you are as you’re walking — but also everything that’s in the stream coming at you — then you’re likely to suggest to yourself, Oh, I know if I move to the right a little bit and that messenger on his bike weaving through the crowd, and the two guys carrying the plate glass window, and the woman with the poodle — they may all come within some relationship to each other if I continue this pace that I’m at. Or do I have to lurch forward a little bit so that I might be in a time zone when all these things interact in an interesting way? So it’s about being. For me, it’s the enlivening of my consciousness when I’m out in the streets so that everything is in play. Otherwise we’re sleepwalking. </p> \n<blockquote>\n For me, photography is the act of making something out of the fluid reality that’s scrolling by us all the time. \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>So, it seems that you have to be “extra alert” to be noticing all those things.</strong> </p> \n<p>Yeah, a heightened sense of alertness is important. And I say, what better way to <em>be</em> as a human being? If we’re not using our heightened sense of awareness, then we’re functioning at a sort of half level of consciousness. I think carrying the camera is such an act of liberation. It means I have the license to see whatever is out there and make a picture of it. And so it makes me feel engaged. And that engagement is everything. </p> \n<p><strong>This may sound like a naive question or a stupid question, but how do you sustain that hyper alertness? And how do you get there if you’re not there already? Is there some kind of a warmup exercise that you could recommend?</strong> </p> \n<p>[Laughs] I think it dawns on each individual over time what it is they need to function as the artists they want to be. I’m as asleep as anybody else when I’m out on the street. But when I have the camera, and if the street is lively or, you know, promising, then I suddenly feel myself saying, ‘Oh, Oh, you know, I like the smell!’ I can smell the flowers. I can walk past the bakery. I smell fresh croissants being made. It comes in the air, it’s a fragrance. I’m suddenly keyed up by everything that’s on offer in front of me. And my memory of having done this for the last 40 years is the thing that encourages me to do it again. </p> \n<blockquote>\n It’s that kind of athletic physicality combined with a kind of mental alertness that makes me feel alive. \n</blockquote> \n<p><br> </br></p> \n<p>Because it’s not that I want to make great photographs; I don’t think they happen that often. But what I want to do is be in that zone of being interested enough that should something memorable happen, I will at least be present and awake, and have a camera in my hand, cocked and ready to go. So it’s that kind of athletic physicality combined with a kind of mental alertness that makes me feel alive. And we have such a short time on this planet that feeling the vitality… I have to be honest, at my age, my energy is fading. It is in decline, just naturally. It is harder to do my exercises in the morning. It is harder to have the appetite to go out and see it all. But I overcome that by memory. Sure. It was so good yesterday when I was out. What am I going to see today?<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span><br> </br></p> \n<p><strong>Right. So you encourage yourself to just get started and show up for work.<br /></strong><br>Yeah, it’s a self-mobilizing medium, photography. Because for the most part, it depends on everything <em>out there</em>. Unless you’re a studio photographer making still lifes. Or working with subjects in the studio that you can control in some way. But a street photographer has to go out to function. </br></p> \n<p><strong>When you start out, do you have an intention or a strategy at the beginning of the day? Or are you just putting yourself out there to be open to what presents itself to you?</strong> </p> \n<p>Yeah, I don’t have a strategy when I go out. I’ve learned over all these years that you can plan, but you can’t plan the outcome. You just say, I’m going out. You know, I’m going to go take a walk on Regent Street, or I’m going to go to Soho, or I’m going to go somewhere because I haven’t been there and I’d like to see what it feels like to me. </p> \n<p>Then out on the street, things present themselves in a way that is totally unexpected. And I find myself living off the small high of each of those unexpected moments. It’s a kind of uplifting, energizing sort of inspiration to keep going, to keep seeing. And before you know it, I’ve walked five or six miles and I’ve been laughing half the time at the crazy things I see. I’ve had a bunch of human encounters along the way, which were pleasant or surprising. Or you know, ‘Hey, Joel!’ as strangers sometimes recognize you. So, I feel like it’s just living in a way, in the unexpected, and then taking the gifts that come from being out in the world at large and just enjoying myself. </p> \n<blockquote>\n I find myself living off the small high of each of those unexpected moments.

And if I didn’t have fun doing it… after all we’re alive, we should have some fun. You know, and work at the same time. </br></p> \n<p><strong>We’re in this kind of life-changing moment with this Corona virus and everyone’s in lockdown. And it reminds me a lot of the feeling I had around 9/11. Like this feeling of being under attack and this kind of anxiety. I know you were the only official photographer at Ground Zero in the aftermath. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how that might’ve changed your approach. You talk about going out in the street and having fun and having wonderful human encounters, but at that time you were really documenting things for history as well. So did that change your approach?<br /></strong><br> Yeah, 9/11. I was feeling the necessity to do something as a native New Yorker, to do something for my city, particularly when I heard that Mayor Giuliani had once again acted in his own fascistic way and had prohibited any photographs from being made in Ground Zero. I think he was rightly afraid that there would be photographers who wanted to make money off of the death and the horror of what was inside there. And so he banned that photography. </br></p> \n<p>But I had appealed to him to allow me to go in with a group of six photographers, a videographer, and an oral historian. I had chosen three women and three men that I thought would work alongside of me. And we would do it like the FSA photographs during the Depression. We would cover the World Trade Center and produce an archive. And Giuliani said basically, ‘Fuck off. No one’s going in. We don’t want any record of this at all.’ </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>The base of the North Tower, looking east toward the Woolworth Building from Ground Zero in New York City, 2001 © Joel Meyerowitz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joel-meyerowitz-ready-for-surprise-joel-meyerowtiz-interview-2020#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a>And I thought, that’s impossible. What about the First Amendment, the right of free speech? And how could you dare and take away a record of this trauma that’s playing out in lower Manhattan? And so I just said, fuck you, I’m going to find a way in. And I made my own connections through people I knew in New York. And little by little I was able to hustle some [official-looking] identification and I got in, and I stayed in even though they threw me out every day for almost 50 days. But I persisted. And then finally I was really close friends with a team of detectives. They were known at that time as the Arson and Explosion Squad, and they became my protectors. At some point when they were forced to leave the site, after their 50 days, they took me into police headquarters and under cover of darkness, they had me photographed, fingerprinted and issued an NYPD ID with my barcode and my fingerprint and on it, and [they printed the title]: ‘Mayoral Photographer’ — Mayoral! [laughs]. \n<p><br> </br></p> \n<p>And so when I went down that very same evening and I went in there carrying my view camera, my video camera, my 35 millimeter, my six-by-seven. I walked in clanking like a robot and somebody stops me and said, ‘Hey buddy, no photographs allowed!’ And I [flashed him my official badge under my lapel]. And he said, ‘Oh, right this way sir.!’ </p> \n<p>Yeah, but so what happened to me though, you asked how that changed me. Ultimately after nine months of really being with the blue collar gang, the people I grew up with in the Bronx… You know, I, fortunately through being an artist, escaped that life. But I lived that life as a child until I went to college and all of my friends basically became cops and firemen and postmen, you know, the guys I grew up with. So here I was once again back with my guys in Ground Zero, with thousands of them. And I was able to talk that language again and feel their commitment, the beauty and the compassion of their commitment, and to celebrate the search for their dead brothers, fathers, sons. </p> \n<p>Today, I just read in the <em>Times</em> that one of the firemen I knew down there, Petrocelli, he died today. He lost his son and his brother, and I knew him when he was searching for the remains of his son. So, and just to read today that he died at 73, younger than me, probably from some of the toxins that I suffer from now and that he probably did too from the time we spent there. But it brought me back to basics, you know, to looking at the humble tasks that fall on the shoulders of these people. Just like the nurses, the doctors of today who are front line in these hospitals, putting their lives at risk. You know, the same was going on for all those firemen looking for the dead. </p> \n<p><strong>The ‘working class heroes’ as John Lennon used to say.</strong> </p> \n<p> Yeah, right. Exactly. Every backhoe operator and grappler and crane operator and truck driver… people had come from all across the country. So there I was back in my original element of regular people rather than in the more sophisticated realm of the art world. And, and I loved it, frankly. I loved the feeling of it. And when I came out of it, it made me realize that I needed to do more public service work in the course of my life to not only devote myself to my personal study of what is photography to me, but how can I use photography to better the quality of life in some way, what can I offer as a giveback? </p> \n<p><strong>I wonder if you have any advice for photographers who feel this impulse to document or to record this historic moment, but it’s dangerous to be out on the streets? And also the streets are empty.</strong> </p> \n<p>I would say to younger photographers at this moment — because I’m not capable of it. I suffer from some lung issues from being in Ground Zero and I’m 82 so I shouldn’t put myself at higher risk. These are the last years of my life, and my wife and I want to enjoy them together. So I’m not going to — even though my impulse is ‘I want to go out and and see what it looks like.’ — I’m thinking, you know what, there’s a whole other cadre of photographers, men and women who are capable of doing this, and they should be finding ways to document their role in this time. And if it means wearing the protective gear — I wore a hard hat. I wore protective goggles. I had a respirator with two cans here. I had gloves, boots. I mean, I was ready for bear, you know. And still I’ve suffered even with all that protective gear. </p> \n<p>So I would say protect yourself, but go out there and do the job that your photographic appetite suggests to you. What is it that you’re interested in? Because emptiness is important. It’s good to have a record of this time for history, but also how are the people in the stores managing? Who are they? And the fact that they’re sacrificing themselves in the little grocery store, that every single person comes in and hands them their card or money, they’re breathing on them. These people who are putting the groceries in every day. You know, there are small stories there that could add up to a much larger picture if there was an artist with a sensitivity about seeing the whole in this time, in this critical time. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>New York City, 1963 © Joel Meyerowitz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joel-meyerowitz-ready-for-surprise-joel-meyerowtiz-interview-2020#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>One time you mentioned something to the effect of ‘iPhones have changed street photography forever.’ When I heard that my first thought was you were maybe talking about technology or that everyone’s a photographer now that everyone has a camera in their phone. But then I came to understand, I think what you were saying was that it changed the way people <em>interact</em> in the street. Everyone’s walking around staring at their phones and they’re not really engaged in eye-to-eye contact or participating in the drama of the street. So, is that what you meant?</strong> </p> \n<p>Yes. When I said that iPhones have changed the texture of the street and street photography, I meant it in several different ways. One, people are always … they walk along like this talking into the bottom, or they’re gesticulating with it, or it’s distracting them because they’re watching something. </p> \n<p>So, no longer is that sexy kind of ‘scoping it out on the street’ at play. If you look at the older photographs of mine or Garry’s, or anybody who worked the streets, you can see sight-lines crisscrossing. If you were to draw strings across the frame, you would see the visual dynamic of people’s interaction with each other, even if it was just to sidestep somebody so you didn’t bump into them. But the smiles that flickered on people’s faces, or the raised eyebrows, or the interest … sometimes it’s three or four people all looking off at one moment to something happening over there. </p> \n<p>So the street had a kind of physical, visual dynamic. [But now] what you see on the street, in effect, are all these phones. On every photograph there’s going to be a dozen phones showing up. So the pictures are subverted. Suddenly it looks like you’re not just making a picture of your time, but you’re making a commentary on the use of phones. And so that adds a familiarity to every single picture, and it derails certain emotional momentary observations that might be the heart of the picture because now you see eleven phones. </p> \n<p> I think it’s like putting a torque on what is the nominal subject of the picture. Is it about that couple and the great dress she’s wearing and the way sunlight is shining on her lips and on her hair? Or is it about those eleven people with their cell phones in crazy positions? </p> \n<p><strong>Right, right. It really undermines the romanticism that you might have, even just in your own imagination, about what’s going on.</strong> </p> \n<p><strong>You know, about a year ago I decided to try to make some street photography myself. I’d never done this before, and it looks so easy, right? It just looks so easy. Yet I found that I was terrified, and I really got kind of paralyzed, not wanting to break into someone else’s space. But after a while, like after about an hour-and-a-half, my worries disappeared and I got into some kind of a flow, and it was so nice! And I realized that without even being conscious of it, I was tracking where the light was all the time, where the source of light was. I wanted my back to be at the light so everything in front of me was well lit. You have to be conscious of where the light is all the time, right? </strong> </p> \n<p>Yes. The light is everything on the street. And you know, it’s funny you say that the light was behind you, so it was lighting up everything in front of you. When I began and I was using Kodachrome film what I really loved was being on Fifth Avenue, walking downtown from early morning through lunch hour, because Manhattan streets run in a grid: North, South, East, West. When you get on Fifth Avenue, it’s facing South, so it has the light almost the whole day. First it’s on the west side of the street because it’s moving out of the East. And then during the afternoon it shifts over, as it goes slightly west, and the east side of the street is lit up. Kodachrome was incredibly beautiful when it was rendering hard sunlight. And I love the slap of hard sunlight in the way that it lit up the colors. New York wasn’t so colorful in the ’60s, like it is today. Fabrics were different. They were… the tonality was different. </p> \n<p>So it wasn’t about hot color as much as it was about incisive sunlight. The etched quality and the way the urban environment of tall buildings made of steel and glass and granite — the way they flickered and shivered in the harsh New York light. So my feeling was, I wanted full rendering. I wasn’t looking for a romantic backlighting or any of that stuff. I was looking for that slap, because Kodachrome film was incredibly slow. The ASA was 25 in the sixties — 25. </p> \n<p> <strong>Man, you had to keep that camera still!<br /></strong><br>Well, you could work in hard sunlight at 250th at 6.3 — that was the standard exposure for Fifth Avenue on a sunny day for information in the shadows and tone in the highlights. You could count on it day in and day out. Only if it was a slightly in-and-out cloudy day would you have to figure it’s going to be 4.5, 5.6. You know, we knew our exposures. The cameras were not automatic cameras. The Leica was a manual camera. Everything was manual and it never fell asleep like the new ones do all the time. </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>New York City, 1975 © Joel Meyerowitz\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joel-meyerowitz-ready-for-surprise-joel-meyerowtiz-interview-2020#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><br> </br></p> \n<p><strong>Right, right, right. There’s that one photograph, one of many famous photographs that you made, where there’s a couple walking and there is steam coming out of the ground and their shadows are cast on the backs of some other people wearing some fancy coats. But the light is what ‘makes’ that photograph. Right?</strong> </p> \n<p>Sure. And you know, it was my afternoon swing because by the afternoon the sun had moved into such a position that it was now backlighting. If you were heading south on Fifth Avenue, the sun was behind people. So Garry and I, or Tod and I, we’d switch over to the east side of the street and walk uptown from lower Manhattan. And that’s a classic example of about four o’clock, three-thirty in the afternoon. The angle of the light… and bingo, the smoke coming out like this. You know, New York has an entire heating system underneath the streets … and there are these vents and manhole covers all over the city. When the temperature outside is a certain chill, then the moisture coming up from the release gates basically makes these plumes of smoke. So on every block you’re getting puffs of condensation that people walk through. I mean, it’s magical. </p> \n<blockquote>\n Kodachrome was incredibly beautiful when it was rendering hard sunlight. I love the slap of hard sunlight in the way that it lit up the colors… It wasn’t about hot color as much as it was about incisive sunlight. \n</blockquote> \n<p><br> </br></p> \n<p><strong>What a nice lighting and stage effect! I would have loved to have seen you and Garry in action, walking up the streets. Did you do that a lot together?</strong> </p> \n<p>Garry and I worked together, I would say, for three years. Three solid years, every day. He would call me, usually. He had kids at the time. He was divorced, but his kids would stay with him two or three nights a week, and he’d get them off to school and then he would call me and say, ‘Let’s meet at the greasy spoon at 96th street.’ We’d meet at 96th. He lived on 93rd, I lived on 100th, so we were equidistant. We’d meet at 96th, we’d have a coffee, Danish (ah Cheese Danish!) And then we’d walk through Central Park and all the way down through Central Park Zoo because Garry was working on the animals book then. And then we’d come out of Central Park Zoo onto Fifth Avenue and 59th and we just walk down 59th Street down Fifth Avenue all the way to 42nd, 34th, whatever was right. We’d turn around, we’d come back up. We’d be shooting together, but apart and just keeping each other company for the day. And every once in a while we’d say, did you see that? Or, I got this. And there was no way to show anybody what you got, right? Thank goodness. And then we’d stop off in MoMA for lunch and we’d have a sandwich in the cafeteria there and hang out for a while and then back out on the street for lunchtime. We’d always catch a sort of either early lunch or late lunch because the streets were busier at noon. </p> \n<p>We even traveled in California together and we traveled in Europe together. We were intensely close for those three and a half years. And then I lived in Europe in ’66 and ’67 and when I came back, I was really my own man. Tod Papageorge had joined Garry and me in 1965. And so we were a trio for a year on the street. We liked each other’s company. We talked about photography. We were trying to understand what there was to say about it. </p> \n<blockquote>\n Tod Papageorge had joined Garry and me in 1965. And so we were a trio for a year on the street.

I didn’t want to be subject to anybody else’s decision making. Like, you know, you’re on the street, you think, oh, I’m going to go left, and then Garry wants to go right, and Tod wants to go straight ahead. So it’s like, well, which way do we go? And I felt that for my own continued growth and independence that I needed to do stuff on my own. And it pained me because these were my two best friends and both photographers and we all had such lively, engaged conversations. But you know, sometimes your time is up and, and you maintain your friendship, but you change the texture of it. </p> <p><strong>You and I had a nice conversation in London a couple of years ago and we were talking about whether it’s possible to teach people photography, or how to help people get better, how to develop a voice. And you said something really interesting about your philosophy of inspiration.</strong> </p> <p>Well, you know, I do teach photography — no longer in workshops the way I used to, but online, in the <a href=\"https://mastersof.photography/\">Masters of Photography</a>. I think you met Chris Ryan [who develops these in-depth masterclasses for online students]. </p> <p><strong>Yes, that’s a great series. I’ve looked at those repeatedly.</strong> </p> <p>And there are certain lessons that become codified. I think every teacher has a few things that they say that they know will strike a chord. And for me, this notion of the ‘gasp reflex’ is what I call it, because so many people, whether they were students or whether they’re online, they say, how do you know when to make a photograph? </p> <p>So it’s up to each person. But if you trust something in you that is the pure you, that usually is a moment when something happens and you see it and you go [makes the sound of a quick intake of breath] and that little gasp is inspiration, right? You inspire oxygen in a jolt and it goes into your lungs and immediately lights up your brain because it fires all the cells of your brain faster. You become oxygenated and alert and connected. If you recognize that those are the instances in which you yourself, the true you, not the cerebral you who thinks, ‘I should go out and photograph, you know people with food carts today.’ </p> \n <blockquote>\n  I think that photography is a search for your identity as an artist and as a human being. It’s like your fingerprint. You make pictures a certain way. If you try to make them to look like other people\n  <span>’</span>s photos, you’ll never discover yourself. \n </blockquote><br> <p>If you photograph when you have that momentary gasp reflex over time — if you separated those out — you would begin to see your true identity. And I think that photography is a search for your identity as an artist and as a human being. It’s like your fingerprint. You make pictures a certain way. If you try to make them to look like other people, you’ll never discover yourself. You’ll always be imitating someone else’s program. So my encouragement is for everybody to try to find what is uniquely their way of responding to the world, their way of framing the world, their sense of timing, the degree of closeness or distance they need to be in order to feel this way. And if you track your impulses, you will begin to see your own dots along the line that say, Oh, these are me at my truest. </p> <p>And then you have something to work with, and you can choose to strengthen that by trusting it more. Or you could choose to leave it and copy somebody else and be forever lost. I mean, lost to yourself. You may make pictures that look like somebody else’s, but then they’re not yours. They look like, you know, Diane Arbus. They look like Lee Friedlander. They look like, you know, whoever your recent teacher is at the workshop. I mean, isn’t that what we’re here for in the course of this brief life we’re going to have on the planet. Don’t you want to know something about true identity? </p> <p>I think for me it’s always been ‘what makes an interesting challenge, photographically’? You know, I went from being a street photographer to using a large format camera and making landscapes. And then that camera sort of brought me to portraiture and then something else brought me to still life and something else made me take pictures from a moving car, you know, when I was living in Europe the first time — and that was a show I had at MoMA — from a moving car. So all along the way I find myself interested in photography as a medium. And in the medium there are many different disciplines. So how is it when you go from being a street guy to suddenly challenging Ansel Adams in a sense, you know? Because you want to photograph landscape, but is that the landscape you want to photograph, or are you going to invent a landscape for yourself or redefine it in some way as every generation does? </p> <p>So I just think that photography — over my course through it for these 58 years — is to ask questions of it that provoke me into investigating it further and seeing how flexible it is, and is there something for me to say in this new way of looking at things photographically for me? </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>New York City, 1963 © Joel Meyerowitz<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joel-meyerowitz-ready-for-surprise-joel-meyerowtiz-interview-2020#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p>I do celebrate that we’re alive! And we see! What incredible wonder. We see in color and the world is constantly surprising us. Even though the sun comes up the same. You know, the next day the sun comes up, it’s all over again. You get a fresh chance, but it’s such a celebration to be alive. </p> <p>I said right at the beginning, photography has taught me everything I know basically all this time. And I think it comes to me in a kind of slowly dawning consciousness again and again. Oh, this is interesting too! And I get like a kid, I get that kind of excited astonishment. My wife always says to me, ‘This line in your head is because you are always wide-eyed and like, Oh wow!’. It’s like my eyebrows are raised all the time … I’m always in wonder, you know, at how remarkable it is, the simplest of things. And it’s allowed me to go simple. And to look at the way wind moves through grass, or the way peaches got put on that piece of newspaper. Or whatever it is — it’s wonder. I’m not a negative person. I’m not scathingly ironic. I tend to just love human nature and nature itself and the opportunity to pass along the experience through the camera’s eye. </p> \n  <hr> \n   <p><br> </br></p>\n   <p>Enjoy more great

travels&nbsp;the world and photographs&nbsp;people as they seek positive ways to engage more thoughtfully with nature in the context of climate change.&nbsp;\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Lucas Foglia’s third book, <em>Human Nature</em>, is part of his broader exploration into the ways people positively relate to nature in the age of extreme and unpredictable weather. The publication begins in the city and ends in the wilderness, with each story set in a different ecosystem: city, forest, farm, desert, ice field, ocean, and lava flow. He provides different points of view, from the scientific community, urban planners, psychologists, adventurers, and people who want to simply live off the grid. </p> \n<p> Foglia explains his motive by stating, “I think it is a problem that the media pictures nature as either a paradise or a disaster. I am operating under the assumption that we have already changed the world, and I am finding non-profit organizations, government programs, and individual people who are looking for a positive way forward.” The formally beautiful photographs he has captured for this body of work tell personal stories that transcend location, culture, and class, to underscore our universal need for a connection to the natural world. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Kate in an EEG Study of Cognition in the Wild, Strayer Lab, University of Utah, Utah 2015.\n<br> Kate waits for a storm to pass.

He explains his work is rooted in this experience, “As a child, my family’s lifestyle was connected to the land and the seasons. As I grew up, I watched the area around us get developed into suburbs; I watched the weather become more irregular and less predictable because of climate change.” <br> </br></p> <p>Responding to these trends, he finds people who have positive connections to their environments despite these obstacles. For example, instead of following media stories about the broken farm system, he photographed scientists crossbreeding wild plants with domestic crops, to develop varieties that can withstand extreme weather. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Esme Swimming, Parkroyal on Pickering, Singapore 2014 Esme swims in the balcony pool of a hotel in Singapore, as rush hour traffic builds on the road below her. The hotel contains over 15,000 square meters of greenery, amounting to twice its land area. In Singapore, 100 percent of the population is urban. The city-state is promoting conservation of its natural resources and the use of green technology. ‘Wild’ nature is being reincorporated into the city. © Lucas Foglia <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lucas-foglia-finding-ways-to-live-in-peace-with-nature#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p>Although <em>Human Nature</em> was published in its book form in 2017, the larger project is still underway, with various interconnected photographic stories extending its reach. For example, <em>Prison Nation</em>, Aperture Foundation’s traveling exhibition about the dehumanizing effects of imprisonment, includes images such as “Troy Holding a Guinea Fowl Chick, GreenHouse Program, Rikers Island Jail Complex, New York 2014.” This image, which pictures an inmate in prison stripes crouching next to a barbwire fence and tenderly cradling a small bird in his outstretched hand, is part of a positive story about prisoners working in the organic gardens or the Rikers Island GreenHouse Program. Foglia’s images were also used to advocate for the expansion of the program. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Kenzie inside a Crevasse, Juneau Icefield Research Program, Alaska 2016 © Lucas Foglia<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lucas-foglia-finding-ways-to-live-in-peace-with-nature#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>Foglia’s work is a unique response to the contemporary debate surrounding environmental conservation between traditionalists and radical conservationists. He states, “I befriended and photographed people who are working towards a positive environmental future despite the enormity of the task. <em>Human Nature</em> is a series of interconnected stories about how we rely on nature in the context of climate change.” </p> <p>For people on either side of this debate, the hard work of protecting human beings, other species, and the environment are ongoing. Foglia explains the evolving nature of his own efforts, “Many people think of a book as a completion. I think of this book like the trunk of a tree, with different stories growing out like branches. I exhibit this project in galleries and museums, I publish stories in magazines, and I give images back to communities to be used for advocacy. All of these are different outlets that refer back to the larger project.” </p> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <div class=\"picture\"> \n   <a

light-soaked street photography spotlights passersby as main characters in a classic theatrical performance.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The pervasive beauty of street photography lies in its ability to frame our disregarded surroundings as centre stage during a lively performance. Everyday passersby become the lead and supporting roles in a relatable screenplay about daily life, freezing interesting candid moments into a set of narrative stills that might have otherwise gone overlooked. For photographer Oli Kellett, this genre is pushed a step further in his series <i>Cross Road Blues</i>, where vibrant pockets of natural light poke through surrounding architecture to spotlight his subjects, as though they are delivering a crucial set of lines during a play. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Cross Road Blues (Hubbard St, Chicago) © Oli Kellett\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/oli-kellett-cross-road-blues#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p> The binding context in each of Kellett’s images is their setting at a crossroads – a familiar place and metaphor for the tension we encounter throughout life. “We live in an era of fake news, political polarization and algorithmic echo chambers,” Kellett explains. “Our experience of the world is fractured as we live out multiple identities on and offline. But crossroads are a democratic place; we all have to wait.”<br> <br> Kellett’s images harness the incredible power of ambient light. As it passes through buildings, dancing across the street below, each subject appears in a contemplative state, whether alone or huddled together with a group of other people waiting to cross. Kellett reflects, “On average, we will spend five years ‘waiting’ during our lifetime. Being held at a ‘DON’T WALK’ sign allows us a few seconds, and occasionally minutes, to just be with ourselves and remember who we are.” </br></br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Cross Road Blues (Figueroa St, LA) © Oli Kellett\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/oli-kellett-cross-road-blues#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>While Kellett’s images stand as striking compositions on their own, he hopes that as people spend time with the photographs, they absorb the metaphorical weight of the visuals, contemplating our own existence in a fast-paced, modern world. “At this time of uncertainty and change in America’s history, I’m looking for a moment where individuals are dwarfed by what surrounds them, appearing lost but searching for something,” he explains. “They then go on their way, whichever direction that may be.” </p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/barbican-art-gallery-constructing-worlds-photography-and-architecture-in-the-modern-age\">Constructing Worlds: Photography and Architecture in the Modern Age</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jason-tannen-noir-city\">Noir City</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/shira-gold-shock\">Shock</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/fuku-heavy-light-recent-photography-and-video-from-japan\">Heavy Light: Recent Photography and Video from Japan</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/sebastien-tixier-allanngorpoq-being-transformed\">Allanngorpoq: Being Transformed</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/marta-azevedo-black-faces\">Black Faces</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/31f1729d-7361-402f-b65a-e390efd08d38.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Cross Road Blues (Grand Ave, Chicago)\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/35ef9a37-4d0c-4fb3-9b36-a41ec15dcd6f.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Cross Road Blues (Hubbard St, Chicago)\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b3beb10a-e531-4435-a8e5-15030925e78c.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Cross Road Blues (Louisiana St, Houston)\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a421d389-7609-4118-9ad6-bfed05857d93.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Cross Road Blues (Peachtree St, Atlanta)\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:35:46 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/31f1729d-7361-402f-b65a-e390efd08d38.jpg","linkMd5":"f6d68c805d582eb4f48cafe83e4adac0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-47-659_18bec4e8f2765600.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":207461,"destBytes":104852,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/31f1729d-7361-402f-b65a-e390efd08d38.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-47-659_18bec4e8f2765600.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/31f1729d-7361-402f-b65a-e390efd08d38.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-53-194_b3f674d900f5fab9.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/35ef9a37-4d0c-4fb3-9b36-a41ec15dcd6f.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-01-460_8a469f42217febf0.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b3beb10a-e531-4435-a8e5-15030925e78c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-55-944_af456bc89062dfa9.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a421d389-7609-4118-9ad6-bfed05857d93.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-08-838_a78f91b10331a972.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066813},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Don’t Lie to Me","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Don’t Lie to Me</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Paulo Coqueiro</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/45aa26bd-d496-4ee1-970f-6f39d902aafb.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Through layers of mind-bending work, Brazilian artist Paulo Coqueiro weaves a photo-based approach to writing — revealing mysteries and mistruths surrounding the disappearance of photojournalist Tito Ferraz.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“Remember, I am lying to you.” Politically-entrenched photojournalist Tito Ferraz went missing from his home in December, 2016. Over the course of several months, the outspoken photographer communicated across his network of 5000 Facebook friends, dropping breadcrumbs which would ultimately end in his sudden and dramatic disappearance. A threatening letter arrives. His apartment is broken into. Hard drives are destroyed. Evidence is collected. Everything gets documented through forensic-style photographs. Flyers go up through his community in Bahia, Brazil demanding answers and justice. What happened to Tito Ferraz? </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Most research indicates that Tito Ferraz was born on August 2 1969 in the countryside of Bahia. © Paulo Coqueiro\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>But the more pressing question is, <em>who </em>is Tito Ferraz? On July 7, 2020, I met mastermind and artist, Paulo Coqueiro, through Skype after earlier communications via email and WhatsApp messaging. He appeared on my mobile phone in near monochrome—wearing a black t-shirt, ebony-rimmed glasses, a salt and pepper beard, sitting in a room of alabaster walls with a smooth, white air-conditioner hanging high beside him. Save for a few books on a distant shelf, everything surrounding him was either black or white which is exactly what I needed. My head had been swirling in the gray. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Police discover that the photographs of Tito’s face are montages. © Paulo Coqueiro\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Tito Ferraz is not real. During a two-year project, <em>Não Minta Para Mim</em> (<em>Don’t Lie to Me</em>), Coqueiro created this fictional character, pressing brilliantly deep into questions surrounding the implied truthfulness of a documentary approach to photography. “I was interested in the power of images to forge truths; how it’s possible to write using photographs.” </p> \n<p>Coqueiro took this a step further by meticulously crafting a fake Facebook account. He built a friend list of photographers, curators and others within the art world for a more believable profile, entering into a handful of virtual conversations with unsuspecting ‘friends’ where he often directed the exchange towards questions on fiction in photography. He would invite them for coffee, book launches, exhibitions—but Ferraz always came up with some sort of an excuse, explaining how they had just missed each other in his apology the next day, sent through Facebook Messenger. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>The technical police report points to fraud in photographs published by Tito Ferraz on Facebook. Some were made in places other than those identified in their posts; others were constructed from montages. © Paulo Coqueiro\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Coqueiro being the one orchestrating these missed connections would, himself, visit the meeting places and take photographs to post to Ferraz’s profile for yet another layer of legitimacy. I lean in closely to listen, trying to keep up with the fluid movement between ‘he’ and ‘me’ as he maintains a clear distinction between character and reality. At times, those two words were the only thread I had to keep fact and fiction from getting tangled up in my own understanding as he shared an image of a newspaper clipping or spoke of a police investigation. Why do we default to believing in truths despite knowing the messenger has been feeding us lies? The story folds you into it. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Photographer and expert Paulo Coqueiro was hired to try to recover the information from Tito’s hard drive. © Paulo Coqueiro\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In the chapter following Ferraz’s disappearance a hard drive is recovered containing the portraits of forty-one people which Coqueiro has bound into a book. He has also created a series of short films, one believable enough to have me scratching my head once again: “Is Ferraz real?” He records forty-one people who have befriended the fake Facebook account and interviews them as witnesses of Ferraz’s existence (none of them knew about the fictional character).<br><br> </br></br></p> \n<blockquote>\n “I would not say I use the character to lie, but to demonstrate the fragility of an alleged documentary truth. Or how credulous we are in the face of photographic images.” \n</blockquote> \n<p>Coqueiro released a portrait of Ferraz in the style of a police sketch, crafted from various facial features of each of the photographers he interviewed, having taken their photos while visiting their homes and studios. When they gaze into this likeness of Tito Ferraz, they unknowingly look at fragments of themselves. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>An investigation was opened to investigate the disappearance of photographer Tito Ferraz. © Paulo Coqueiro\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/paulo-coqueiro-don-t-lie-to-me#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In a striking reversal of roles between the rebellious photojournalist and Coqueiro’s act of fiction, <em>Don’t Lie to Me</em> became viewed as a political threat. Mere hours before the opening of the <em>Winds of Time</em> exhibit at Lianzhou Foto Festival in 2018, censors confiscated some of the work without explanation. Weeks earlier, by coincidence, renowned photographer Lu Guang went missing after stirring up dust by speaking out on controversial issues in China.

A popular recurring character in these stories was Baba Yaga, a dangerous witch with an appetite for children who lived in a small hut in the middle of the woods. In one story, the witch takes a girl known as Vasilisa the Beautiful as her prisoner. However, with the help of a black cat, Vasilisa escapes. As the girl runs from the witch, she drops a magical towel and comb behind her. A deep, broad river emerges from the towel and a thick forest from the comb, so thick Baba Yaga cannot find her. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Hiding from Baba Yaga” © Nanna Heitmann\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/nanna-heitmann-hiding-from-baba-yaga#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>For her series, <em>Hiding from Baba Yaga</em>, Heitmann returned to her mother’s country of origin, to visit the remote region of her childhood fairy tales. She was delighted to find it reminded her of Ivan Bilibin’s illustrations of Vasilisa’s fable. Using this story as a starting point for exploration, she traced the Yenisei River downstream in a Russian Jeep packed with camping equipment, documenting life along its banks. Following the longest rivers in the world from the Tuva Republic northward through Siberia took Heitmann through the wilderness of the Siberian taiga, exposing her to the locals living in social isolation on the outskirts modern Slavic society. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Hiding from Baba Yaga” © Nanna Heitmann\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/nanna-heitmann-hiding-from-baba-yaga#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Like Vasilisa hiding from Baba Yaga in a forest of her own creation, Heitmann’s subjects are sheltered by the isolation and harsh climate of the woods surrounding the Yenisei River. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, this remote area has lost its infrastructure; residences have no access to goods, technologies, or government services, so the region tends to attract people hiding from society or seeking new realities—escaped criminals, recluses, and Eastern Orthodox Old Believers. Heitmann’s environmental portraits reveal how these people shape and are shaped by their surroundings. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Hiding from Baba Yaga” © Nanna Heitmann\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/nanna-heitmann-hiding-from-baba-yaga#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Viewers may draw parallels between <em>Hiding from Baba Yaga</em> and <em>Sleeping by the Mississippi</em>, Alec Soth’s photographic journey along the neglected banks of his country’s longest river. However, Heitmann’s work also references distinctly Russian concepts and esthetics. Her wanderlust-based process echoes that of late-nineteenth-century Russian painters, such as Ivan Shishkin. Like Shishkin, her use of a light palette in the depiction of poverty and suffering reveals the beauty of resilient rural Russian folk culture. Her gentle eye conveys their dignity and humanity, allowing the viewer to consider them with curiosity and empathy. Ultimately, Heitmann combines elements of traditional documentary road trip photography with elements of Russian art and folklore, in her depictions of the eclectic mix of individuals, interiors, landscapes she encountered on her journey. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Hiding from Baba Yaga” © Nanna Heitmann\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/nanna-heitmann-hiding-from-baba-yaga#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><br> </br></p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/junku-nishimura-a-nocturnal-visitor\">A Nocturnal Visitor</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/blink-network-on-the-ground-at-the-center-after-the-quake\">On the Ground, At the Center, After the Quake</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rie-yamada-familie-werden\">Familie Werden</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/giacomo-brunelli-new-york-noir\">New York Noir</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/sara-angelucci-arboretum\">Arboretum</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jean-vincent-simonet-in-bloom\">In Bloom</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f5837b00-6bfb-4452-affd-cc01c7588b8b.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/04820033-cd9f-482c-af2d-1eb15ddb7def.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f212ccfd-9a4d-493b-9ec0-f9e470e52ffd.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/821fcdbc-3b9b-4e0e-afce-08f86b80337b.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ab1c3144-a4cc-4bcc-9e62-adcb20c2980e.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/7127934a-7d62-42f2-a384-9a0a9f75fa2b.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 11 May 2020 10:19:28 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/f212ccfd-9a4d-493b-9ec0-f9e470e52ffd.jpg","linkMd5":"a837a368110ddb4dc79765e531746460","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-48-447_00d23db6a2bc26f7.webp","destWidth":1124,"destHeight":2000,"sourceBytes":293337,"destBytes":131628,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/f212ccfd-9a4d-493b-9ec0-f9e470e52ffd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-48-447_00d23db6a2bc26f7.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f5837b00-6bfb-4452-affd-cc01c7588b8b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-05-124_fbb485f7da2c5a49.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/04820033-cd9f-482c-af2d-1eb15ddb7def.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn36@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-13-170_baaf6bc342f24a24.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f212ccfd-9a4d-493b-9ec0-f9e470e52ffd.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-12-467_e735f923b81cc2cf.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/821fcdbc-3b9b-4e0e-afce-08f86b80337b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-16-237_51ba930e9fe47f26.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ab1c3144-a4cc-4bcc-9e62-adcb20c2980e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-55-414_7c75dcaa672e2f3f.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/7127934a-7d62-42f2-a384-9a0a9f75fa2b.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-53-415_290a38d08ea90a86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066817},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Deana Lawson — Aperture Monograph","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deana-lawson-deana-lawson-aperture-monograph","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Deana Lawson — Aperture Monograph</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Deana Lawson</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/971a7f46-ab06-4a07-81f0-32cbcb1f14b3.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  These&nbsp;photographs contain multitudes — references to African diaspora, complex emotions, unspoken dreams, dignity, pride, love, visible scars, the trappings of household circumstance, the tenderness of generations.&nbsp;\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Deana Lawson is nothing short of a force, and the photographer’s monograph published by Aperture (2018) is a testament to her power as one of the great artists of our generation. Her photographs contain multitudes — references to the African diaspora, complex emotions, unspoken dreams, dignity, pride, love, visible scars, the trappings of household circumstance, and the tenderness of generations. The beauty is in the details around the edges as much as it’s in the heroic quality of the subjects at its center. </p> \n<p>At first glance, the book is simultaneously regal and unassuming – its deep burgundy cover is silky and luscious, albeit visually minimal, featuring no cues for information aside from the photographer’s full name inlaid on its front in gold. This measured simplicity continues onto the pages bound within, which, in addition to a selection of 40 color images, feature two important pieces of writing. The first is an essay by Zadie Smith titled “Through the Portal: Locating the Magnificent,” a poetic introduction that vividly contextualizes the work, and the second is an extensive conversation between Lawson and fellow artist Athur Jafa, presented for readers to ponder on the monograph’s final pages — a thoughtful conclusion to direct engagement with each image. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Deana Lawson\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deana-lawson-deana-lawson-aperture-monograph#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Embracing the black body as the central feature in her work, Lawson upholds domestic scenarios as magical environments, emboldening her subjects to be comfortable in their own skin as they pose in front of her camera. Unlike the potentially voyeuristic images that often result from photographing nude bodies, each of Lawson’s photographs seem to reflect the photographer just as much as they reflect their central figures. In front of Lawson’s lens, there is no encouragement to quiet down or play it coy. Instead, the individuals own their space and skin, dominating it regardless of the oppression that faces them when they step outside of the house.<br> </br></p> \n<blockquote>\n “Outside a Lawson portrait you might be working three jobs, just keeping your head above water, struggling.

This fine line between normalcy and drama is what defines Lawson’s work as something seminal and immediately recognizable. While each image stands powerful on its own, it’s wonderful to encounter them sequenced in conversation with one another, with interjections of other snapshots and archival photography that flesh out the artist’s inspiration for her timeless series.<br> </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Deana Lawson\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deana-lawson-deana-lawson-aperture-monograph#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Translating the power of Lawson’s photographs to the confined pages of a book is no easy task, but the monograph does it just right, allowing each image to speak for itself in an endless stream of plates that feature no extensive captions or explanations.

We were afraid. Suddenly the deafening noise within us is louder and we crave the external one back, to distract from it.\n</p>\n<p>I look at a section of a city: Barcelona. It could have been anywhere. Without the strategic privileged position (a 180-degree view terrace) in which I find myself, I could not have done it. In fact, I never meant to, I just looked out the balcony and saw an older man walking on the roof, just like he would on the street, but without shop windows or people; only with himself. My immediate reaction was to make a video, not a photo. I was attending a unique, private, historical event. The man is doing well, he is not sitting on a couch all day.  He moves, he exercises. His thoughts maybe are in the future, longing for that <em>afuera</em>.\n</p>\n<p>I open my field of vision a little more and there they all were. I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was there, with my looking machine. Life moved to rooftops and balconies. There is no precise time, although good weather lures them outside. Contemplation and confinement became a way of survival. People with balconies look out expecting to see something that is clearly empty, some kiss or hug each other, others just talk, quite a few do some kind of exercise, look at the horizon, play ball, sunbathe, take selfies…\n</p>\n<blockquote>I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was there, with my looking machine. Life moved to rooftops and balconies.\n</blockquote>\n<p>No one sees me. I’m hidden, they don’t know that I exist. For the moment. I observe, with some nervousness: the sensation of being discovered is the excitement of a voyeur. The smartphone has become an extension of my body, it is what connects me to the world. A world in collective hysteria. So I prefer to come back to the roofs and the balconies around me. Where real people are just waiting with enormous resilience.\n</p>\n<p>That older man keeps walking on the roof. This vision has become the emotional thermometer of my confinement. If I see him, I feel good. Whenever the time to go out will come, who knows, the desired routine will return and he’ll go out again, watching people move, the cars, the noise of the city. Then, I will stop meddling.\n</p>\n<p>It will be weird, for everyone.\n</p>\n<p>—Luis Cobelo\n</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> We discovered this new work (and many more excellent visual stories) on the great new site created by the visionaries behind the Cortona on the Move photo festival — Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://covid19visualproject.org/en/\">The Covid19 Visual Project</a>, and submit your own stories for consideration, too.</em><br>\n</p><p>Enjoy more great photography:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/walid-raad-deutsche-borse-photography-prize-2007\">Deutsche Börse Photography Prize 2007</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/artur-urbanski-live-view-our-point-and-shoot-memories\">Live View: Our Point and Shoot Memories</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/thomas-meinicke-havana-cabs\">Havana Cabs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/garry-winogrand-garry-winogrand-visions-from-the-street-portraits-of-america\">Garry Winogrand: Visions from the Street, Portraits of America</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/chino-otsuka-photo-album\">Photo Album</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-design-call-for-entries-lensculture-art-photography-awards-2018-3\">Call for Entries!

Over the phone from his apartment in New Delhi, photographer Srinivas Kuruganti gushes while describing the chaos, creativity and camaraderie that came together in his project <em>this archive has no legs; </em>a project realized within the framework of <em>Five Million Incidents</em>, 2019-2020, conceived by Goethe Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan, in collaboration with Raqs Media Collective.<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"> </span>The archive in question has its roots a couple of decades back. It was 1992 and he had just moved to the Lower East Village in New York City from the quieter town of Berkeley in California, leaving behind an engineering degree. “It was the 90s,” he declares, like it is self-explanatory, before launching into a flurry of lively descriptions that fill in the blanks. It was vibrant, packed with different communities of artists, mass public protests and concerts in the parks. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Untitled” from “39 East First Street” © Srinivas Kuruganti\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a>\n<br> <p>It turned out to be fecund ground for Srinivas, who had already started taking photographs of his friends and surroundings while studying in California. “Looking back, I can’t remember thinking that I was taking these photographs with the aim of doing something with them,” he admits. “We—my roommate Peter and I—had cameras, so we just began to take photos of our friends. We would experiment, make portraits and take nudes of this tight community we’d formed, sometimes at our apartments, during protests and parties, or at picnics in Central Park. The process of making these sets of photographs from my time in New York was almost collaborative,” he adds. His only regret: “I didn’t photograph enough of the street over those many years.” </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>“Untitled” from “39 East First Street” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>These photographs might have remained tucked away among Srinivas’ three decades of archived material, that sit in ten metal waterproof trunks at a friend’s Bombay office, had it not been for the chance to house-sit for another friend in Goa while she was away. Using this solitude and space, the photographer began the daunting process of creating a system to catalogue his own sprawling body of work. Since his early days photographing his community of friends and their collective activities, he has turned his attention to building a documentary practice that focuses on environmental issues ranging from coal mining in Dhanbad, ship-breaking yards<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span> and industrial pollution. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>“Untitled” from “39 East First Street” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>In bringing order to his archive of photographs, Srinivas was left with the feeling that he “wanted to make a book of these photographs from this time with little notes”. But in arranging, rearranging and arranging the images again, he felt that he was too close to the work. He’d find himself looking at them and thinking: “Oh wow, we really did all those things!” In order to find an objective eye in relation to this body of work, he decided to invite other people into the picture; to sift, select and stitch together a narrative from these photographs. Instead of keeping this intervention at the level of friends and practitioners alone, he devised <em>this archive has no legs</em>: an open invitation to anyone and everyone. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Installation shot of “this archive has no legs” at “Five Million Incidents” 2019-2020, conceived by Goethe Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan in collaboration with Raqs Media Collective. © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p>The project took place at the Max Mueller Bhavan in New Delhi over five days earlier this year, opening its doors to the public to go through Srinivas’ archives—physical prints of the photographs from his New York Days—and tack them on a wall to create their own flow. At the end of each day, the images still left upon the ‘edit wall’ would be printed and hand-bound into a book. “I didn’t want the viewers to be passive with regards to this work. I wanted to see how they would come up with an edit, or put it into a story. How would it be shown if it was treated just as visual material? I wanted to see it from the outside,” he says of his idea. </p> <p>The photographer was also present the whole time, open to interactions with those who had come into his space at the venue, but also to observe the choices made by those rifling through the photos and then putting their take up on the wall. While each collection changed, patterns soon emerged. “Every day the edits would change. And even though someone would remove or build upon the previous person’s work, something of the previous iterations was still up there. In that way, each person’s input always stayed behind,” he says. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>“Diptych 4, Day 1” from “this archive has no legs” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>“Diptych 4, Day 2” from “this archive has no legs” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span><br> <p>There are other little things that Srinivas spied on regarding the choices that people made vis-a-vis the images, which have helped him gain more clarity on the directions he’d like to take with his photobook of the work. “It isn’t like any of the images on the ‘edit wall’ or ‘bound books’ were chronological but I liked to see separate, disparate images being brought together. It is a good starting point to think the way I’d go about it. At that time, I didn’t agree with too many of the decisions but now, I’ve come around. I can see some meaning in their methods,” he offers. In noticing the many reasons behind the placement and purpose of these choices, he has been freed into settling on his own logic in arranging them. </p> <p>In terms of the visual material itself, Srinivas saw that people tended to lean towards the images that “aren’t quiet”. He found that viewers gravitated towards the “gritty”, both in terms of aesthetic—more contrasty black-and-whites, and content—more graphic, sexual images. For lack of a better word, Srinivas settles on “eye-candy” to describe these choices. Without passing judgment, he explains: “it is not wrong. It is just a different impulse.” Taking heed of these preferences has pushed him to think of the overall rhythm of the photobook, the many ways he can play with the different sections, punctuating the pace with the quiet and the dynamic images. </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>“No Faces” from “this archive has no legs” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>One of the interventions during the five days of <em>this archive has no legs</em> that has stood out in Srinivas’ mind is one he describes as “the one with hidden faces”. In this version, one of the viewers had arranged photos without prominently featuring any of his friends’ faces on the edit wall, instead focusing on shapes and shadows, tangents and textures, and other details. “At first, I was taken back by the choices because the people in photographs are so important to the work. This work is about my friends and the familiar places to us,” he says. </p> <p>But even then, he didn’t get clouded by this reason and made a record of this edit. Looking at it now, he’s had a change of heart. “I’ve come to see that the work isn’t about my friends alone. It is also about my early experimentations as a photographer where looking back I can see that I was interested in these things—in building a frame. And while I might have taken these photos instinctively, from a distance I can see the other elements that went into making the photograph more clearly,” he adds. </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>“Untitled” from “39 East First Street” © Srinivas Kuruganti<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/srinivas-kuruganti-this-archive-has-no-legs#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>The exercise of welcoming people to participate in his archive didn’t just allow for the viewers to peek into his past and place it in the contemporary; it also seems to have allowed Srinivas the distance and spark to put these photographs in a book. This gesture is by no means unfamiliar to the photographer: the impulse to ‘share’ his work seems to be a long-thread that runs through the three decades of his practice. Even in the early days, he would make double prints of each of his photographs: one for himself and the other one was for the person in the picture. “I’d like to think, this isn’t just me reliving those days. It is also them,” he says, hopefully. In opening up the relationship between photographer, poser and public, Srinivas allows each one of us to employ these images as touchstones to our memories of “those days” too. </p><p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/cecilia-paredes-eternally-camouflaged\">Eternally Camouflaged</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tytia-habing-family-flora-and-photos-the-ties-that-bind\">Family, Flora and Photos: The Ties That Bind</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/virgilio-ferreira-daily-pilgrims\">Daily Pilgrims</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/alex-cretey-systermans-familiar\">Familiar</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/adam-broomberg-oliver-chanarin-mr-mkhize-s-portrait-amp-other-stories-from-the-new-south-africa\">Mr. Mkhize&amp;#8217;s Portrait &amp;amp;

The bass line is the same in nearly every song. Almost always, the first line of the lyrics is sung, then repeated. There is some counterpoint line, but then the first line comes again. There are guitar or organ licks thrown between what little makes up a melody. The chord progression is predictable.

But everyone knows that isn’t true. Given the form, there is a world of individual voice and expression. You would never confuse BB King with Albert King. You would never confuse Eric Clapton with Joe Bonamassa. They all work the same ground but the way they work it is as nuanced as an attentive kiss. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Austin, TX © Kim Llerena\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/kim-llerena-american-blues#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>I am thinking about this because I am looking at the images by Kim Llerena in a collection called <em>American Scrapbook.</em> At one level, I have seen every one of these images before. Her work is American landscape work. Mountains and desert and roadways. Dilapidated buildings. Abandoned storefronts. Odd signs. Odd things in people’s yards. Sometimes Route 66 type stuff. And it would be easy to say this collection is derivative. But, like some new voice playing a blues tune we’ve heard a thousand times, this series of images is a fresh take. Every image is enjoyable and new. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Jasper County, IA © Kim Llerena \n<p>In the text for her project, Llerena says, “…these images seek out iconography from various interconnected systems that direct our collective national consciousness—business, infrastructure, religion, climate, natural resources, domestic space, borders, racism, power, tourism, leisure, and more…In many images there is a sense that something is missing, whether physical or contextual, underscoring the incomplete narratives that photographs can often tell.” </p> \n<p>From my point of view, Llerena’s approach is ironic more than it is sad or nostalgic. There is an edge to nearly every shot, though some of her landscape images are simply loving. Some hint at decay, provoking a fine sense of wonder about what kind of stories might lurk in these landscapes. Yes, I’ve seen images of cars with their front ends stuck in the ground before. Yes, I’ve seen the blown out sign and the cornfield and the child’s toy before. But not quite this way. That’s the real strength here. Llerena makes the familiar and predictable fresh again. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Detroit, MI © Kim Llerena\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/kim-llerena-american-blues#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Llerena says, “Taken individually, each image tells the story of a very particular place—someone’s yard, a small town with a notable attraction, something that’s been built or dismantled. Viewed together, relationships between disparate places and structures emerge, highlighting…a shared American sensibility….” </p> \n<p>I know that American sensibility. Others have been singing that song for a long time. It’s a pleasure to hear again, all new. </p> \n<p><br> </br></p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/marcus-lyon-exodus\">Exodus</a></li>\n

In a surreal play on self-portraiture, Tommy Kha creates 3-D masks of his face for his friends, family, and strangers to wear.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Tommy Kha’s self-portraits require a double-take. His on-going project, <em>I’m Only Here To Leave</em>, includes images of non-traditionally printed self-portrait objects staged within real-world settings. The photo-based artist—from Memphis, Tennessee, who now lives in Brooklyn, New York—explains, “I wanted to find a way of representing myself without literally photographing myself. So instead, I have been making photographs of photographs of my face and body as a way to control my representation.” In these images, the artist and others—family, friends, and strangers—can often be found wearing masks of Kha’s face or engaging with other props that blur the lines between the body and the photographed body. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Mine (II, or an Assembly), Memphis, TN 2015 © Tommy Kha\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tommy-kha-i-m-only-here-to-leave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Kha started working on <em>I’m Only Here To Leave</em> in 2015, during a residency at LightWork. The earliest photographs in this body of work include cardboard cutouts of the artist’s face from his existing private archive of self-portraits. For other pictures, he created white cardboard stencils of these cutouts, making it appear as if he had literally cut himself out of his own work. More recently, he has worked with a fabricator to create hyper-realistic masks of his face and used temporary tattoos to give himself the appearance of having four eyes. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Unified (I), McCarren Park, Brooklyn, 2016 © Tommy Kha\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tommy-kha-i-m-only-here-to-leave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>He travels between Memphis and Brooklyn, or wherever else his work takes him, with these photo-prosthetics in his bag, waiting for an opportunity to use them. “It’s a funny thing to do, but it lets me strike a balance between straight and staged photography by opening up more opportunities to stage these unreal things into real spaces.” This strategy may be part of what gives <em>I’m Only Here to Leave</em> its mix of familiar gentleness and unsettling strangeness. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Constellations (XI), Upper East Side, 2019 © Tommy Kha\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tommy-kha-i-m-only-here-to-leave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Kha’s family are peppered throughout this series of images. Their presence references vernacular family photography and the idea of what it means to be represented in art. He explains, “As a queer Asian-American brought up in Memphis, I did not see myself represented in the media or the canon of Western Art. I think literally inserting myself into representations is part of my way of trying to resolve that.” It will be interesting to see how <em>I’m Only Here to Leave</em> unfolds, as Kha has no plans to stop working it. He views it less as a series than a set of images that are connected, along with the rest of his work. “Everything I do feels like part of one continuous lifelong exploration.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Constellations (XII), Whitehaven Memphis, 2019 © Tommy Kha\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tommy-kha-i-m-only-here-to-leave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/kate-smuraga-nobody-important-no-one-else\">Nobody Important, No One Else</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/andrea-gjestvang-return\">Return</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/adam-krawesky-hands-face\">hands face</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/shira-gold-shock\">Shock</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/argus-paul-estabrook-taking-to-heart\">Taking to Heart</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/pentti-sammallahti-here-far-away\">Here Far Away</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b68bdfda-5b17-4614-b130-22cd67c21cf7.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f07c0081-0fdf-4799-bc36-aca39cc1cb5a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d3e4f638-1096-4775-a0db-367a1dec7e4e.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/c6c4c1f0-393b-4dbb-96cb-91892fe4ec60.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/fde331c0-6ac0-486f-8025-ddd93f539c79.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/88853321-32b2-4a15-931b-e10f841a8edb.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1409a9f2-8565-4e3f-a169-58f835419bc9.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 May 2020 09:59:59 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/b68bdfda-5b17-4614-b130-22cd67c21cf7.jpg","linkMd5":"54be6c6bea026db1c67484a88c250b67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn22@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-47-621_ca9a8b60ad03c894.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":179404,"destBytes":90942,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/b68bdfda-5b17-4614-b130-22cd67c21cf7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn22@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-47-621_ca9a8b60ad03c894.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b68bdfda-5b17-4614-b130-22cd67c21cf7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-10-299_4aefb55b0297dc68.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f07c0081-0fdf-4799-bc36-aca39cc1cb5a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn68@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-14-401_e189ae0b888084ae.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d3e4f638-1096-4775-a0db-367a1dec7e4e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-01-138_a2fb15154c475aea.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/c6c4c1f0-393b-4dbb-96cb-91892fe4ec60.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-08-246_e9ed41b304de7b03.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/fde331c0-6ac0-486f-8025-ddd93f539c79.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-04-805_6a8a963b861bb2d1.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/88853321-32b2-4a15-931b-e10f841a8edb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-58-789_ea98160d1fd1cdfe.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1409a9f2-8565-4e3f-a169-58f835419bc9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-57-810_17c49e9f4dbef36b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066817},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Yerevan 1996/1997","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/ursula-schulz-dornburg-yerevan-1996-1997","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Yerevan 1996/1997</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Ursula Schulz-Dornburg</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/a505ba53-55b1-451a-b72c-429ae2bde324.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  First conceived as a visual letter to her daughter, Ursula Schulz-Dornburg’s recent book gives us an architectural portrait of a city in transition, photographed not long after the collapse of Communism.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Ursula Schulz-Dornburg’s small book of photographs made in the Armenian capital, <em>Yerevan 1996/1997</em>, is deceptively straightforward. With pictures pasted over the pages of an Armenian school exercise book, it was originally conceived and made as a gift for her daughter, who was studying architecture in Spain at the time. </p> \n<p>The beautiful facsimile of this book, published by MACK, preserves its original purpose and intimate context. A typed letter, from the artist to her daughter, reveals how the photographs were intended to show her “a kind of fascinating Soviet concrete mania that you would not find in Barcelona.” The pictures, taken with a small automated Ixus film camera, are more akin to architectural sketches, free from the formal rigour and strictures of much architectural photography, including much of Schulz-Dornburg’s own. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Yerevan 1996/1997” (MACK, 2019).

While the immediate reading and frame is as a response to Soviet architecture, there is also the fascination with more local and improvised buildings, including such temporary and precarious structures as the yellow tramcar that forms a bridge crossing a river. She has said how she was interested in how the Armenians kept their own identity during the Soviet times and had invented and adapted at a time when they had very little. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Yerevan 1996/1997” (MACK, 2019).

Quite a few photographs show a fascination with the brutalist structures of high rises, animated by circular windows, the colour of the local pink Tufu stone and the inclusion of details showing inhabitants chatting across balconies and washing hung to dry. The more unusual include the remains of pyramidal structures in a park, originally designed as places where two or three individuals could have a drink or meal, perfect for secret meetings in Soviet times. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Yerevan 1996/1997” (MACK, 2019).

Cyrillic signs and Armenian language collide in the pairing of photographs of a meat store and car repairers, pictures fascinated with vernacular signage and which also include portraits of their owners. One Soviet-era building is now a Travel Agents, its English-language sign, Air Tickets, a reminder that such former communist countries were now open to global tourism and capitalist ‘expansion’. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Yerevan 1996/1997” (MACK, 2019).

The waiting figure reiterates the sense of pervasive indeterminacy and uncertainty captured in this book at the time of its original making. The photograph also links to Schulz-Dornburg’s well-known project, <em>Bus Stops in Armenia</em>, a celebration, albeit in black and white, of the creativity and imaginings of their anonymous and unfeted architects, despite such a low-level and basic task of design. Such Communist structures have now even become a resource for contemporary architects, with one of the bus stops she photographed having been recreated by Herzog and de Meuron for a project in Burgos, Spain. </p> \n<p>Pasting photographs over the pages of an otherwise unused Armenian school exercise book could be seen to signal the way in which the structures of Soviet modernism were imposed on Armenian life. It certainly establishes a tension and dynamic but the architecture, and this seems to be the point of the book, is not always monumental or necessarily oppressive. And the focus is not just on Soviet-era buildings. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Yerevan 1996/1997” (MACK, 2019).

With the end of modernism and the collapse of communism, modernist art is now more readily identified with capitalist investment than the ideals it may have once carried—Malevich, for example, is collected by Russian oligarchs. </p> \n<p>In what remains of Soviet-era architecture we reflect on the lost social ideals behind an aesthetic vision that was once integrated into everyday life. And death—as borne out by Schulz-Dornburg’s fascinating photographs of the colorful geometric structures found in the cemetery of Yerevan, furnishings intended for social gatherings in celebration of the life of the dead. These pictures also serve as an apt metaphor for her book as a whole, with its souvenirs gathered from the ruins of modernism and the socialist project. </p> \n<div> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <div class=\"picture\"> \n   <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18881-yerevan-1996-1997\"></a> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"title\">\n   Yerevan 1996/1997\n   <br> </br>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"author\">\n   by Ursula Schulz-Dornburg\n   <br> </br>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"publisher\">\n   Publisher: MACK\n   <br>ISBN: 978-1-912339-49-5<br> </br></br>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/peter-wegner-buildings-made-of-sky\">Buildings Made of Sky</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/peter-braunholz-topophilia\">Topophilia</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/thomas-heinser-uberblick-california-skies\">Überblick: California Skies</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/the-print-space-terra-firma-portrait-of-a-planet\">Terra Firma: Portrait of a Planet</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/multi-media-specialist-jabruson-kith-or-kin\">Kith or Kin?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/kevin-osepa-mester-blouse\">Mester Blousé</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4f797127-5e51-4168-a90f-510c8f9ee644.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d96075d9-b74d-41fb-8a64-472228eb5c7a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/592bd2cd-506d-4e54-bb1b-078746b9b44a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a505ba53-55b1-451a-b72c-429ae2bde324.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:42:09 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/a505ba53-55b1-451a-b72c-429ae2bde324.jpg","linkMd5":"571916602fcb595a756621957babb00e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-998_982ff8f9835f749e.webp","destWidth":746,"destHeight":434,"sourceBytes":377621,"destBytes":46208,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/a505ba53-55b1-451a-b72c-429ae2bde324.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-998_982ff8f9835f749e.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4f797127-5e51-4168-a90f-510c8f9ee644.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-57-371_3b6dd2b0b6dfedc3.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d96075d9-b74d-41fb-8a64-472228eb5c7a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-13-685_f3c52382d0c6f4f5.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/592bd2cd-506d-4e54-bb1b-078746b9b44a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-53-865_af12b3b926fd8f6a.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a505ba53-55b1-451a-b72c-429ae2bde324.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-57-488_9b9e3503bbeab942.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066810},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"When Bodies Misbehave","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>When Bodies Misbehave</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">When Bodies</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/6f185a13-7cbf-40de-8d71-12d237718c13.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Can photography be used as a tool of healing? Here’s a look at how seven very different artists have responded to the experience of ill-health.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship in the kingdom of the well and the kingdom of the sick…sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.” </p> \n<p>When Susan Sontag wrote <em>Illness as a Metaphor</em> in 1978—from which these incisive words are drawn—she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer, and wanted to dissect the social politics of the public healthcare system she had encountered along the way. Challenging the victim-blaming rhetoric that was often used to describe those suffering from disease or chronic illness, the essay delivers a swift and critical blow to medical discourse of the time. Some 40 years on, these same words opened <em>Misbehaving</em> <em>Bodies</em>, a 2019 exhibition of works by Jo Spence and Oreet Ashery at London’s Wellcome Collection. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Another Happy Day” from the series “Half-Light”, 2018 © Shahrzad Darafsheh\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Spence, like Sontag, sought a creative outlet when diagnosed with breast cancer, frustrated with the abrasive clinical scrutiny of medical professionals—from doctors and surgeons to hospital photographers. She kept an intimate photographic record throughout her hospital experience—through invasive procedures such as mammography and mastectomy—and found herself shaken by what came back from the lab. “I couldn’t believe that I had seen so much and already forgotten it. I had already disavowed what had happened to me…This points up one of the advantages of photographing one’s traumas—before they become sealed over.” </p> \n<p>Spence’s iconoclastic self-portraits are therapeutic exercises in self-reclamation, visualising her journey through the “other place” Sontag conjured. Tired of being reduced to the nameless status of ‘patient’, and of being told she was just the unfortunate victim of genetics, she demanded her body be seen as hers again. Reconfiguring cancer not as an enemy attacking externally, but as an intrinsic product of her own corporeal experience, Spence sought to maintain the autonomy of her body, crystallizing its various states in images. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Keramiek met aantekening” from the series “La Machine”, 2018 - present © Phelim Hoey\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Dutch artist Phelim Hoey is today preoccupied with similar concerns. Since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Hoey has explored his condition through photography, film and sculpture. His ongoing project, <em>La Machine</em>, presents a series of visual experiments, combining the symbolic fragility of materials like porcelain with precariously-balanced still lives, each wrought with a pronounced tension. “For me, MS manifests itself primarily as pain, and whenever I feel a certain muscle spasm or sensation I automatically focus on it.” Measuring the body’s functioning is now a daily task which, in turn, his photographs reflect. “I use balance a lot in these pictures—some of them are based on traps used to catch wildlife, because it often feels like my body’s setting a trap for itself.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Candle” from the series “La Machine”, 2018 - present © Phelim Hoey\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Where Spence saw a marked difference between the artistic and the medical body, Hoey observes a distinction between the physical body and the ‘self’: “After my diagnosis, I realised that I don’t see my body as something that’s really ‘me’ anymore.” Deriving inspiration from the motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge helped Hoey further underline this separation: “I like this way of focusing on the body: completely isolated in a space with no point of reference, and with no sense of its proportions. Bodies become objects in this way.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Muybridge 2” from the series “La Machine”, 2018 - present © Phelim Hoey\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Hoey proffers that for those of us without visible illness or disability, the body is self-evident, facilitating a general autonomy of existence—the luxury of moving through society unchecked. For people <em>with</em> a visible health condition, who are perhaps used to being viewed in ways they cannot control, the photograph might offer a space to repossess how they are seen. In the hands of artists, with their added ability to construct the circumstances in which audiences access the work, the possibility of reclaiming the autonomy of self-image is further enhanced. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Bystander #14, 2016 © Mari Katayama \n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Japanese artist Mari Katayama explores similar ideas. Born with tibial hemimelia, a rare disease that prevents bones from growing in the lower limbs, Katayama had both her legs amputated at 9 years old. The artist also has a cleft left hand that she says resembles a crab’s pincer, hence the recurring presence of beach motifs throughout her photographs. For these images, Katayama makes body doubles, moulding and sewing limbs from leather skin, and styles herself and her prosthetic legs into a sort of living sculpture. </p> \n<p>As Katayama explained in an interview with <em>Dazed</em>, her interest lies not in the body itself, but in “the gap of the ‘experiences’ throughout” it: “You can’t separate my body from my work, but I’m not making art out of my disabilities.” What Katayama posits, it appears, is that it’s possible to inhabit a body, to experience the implications of its ill health, and to make work that transcends that experience. First and foremost, these images are about the performance of identity and the things that shape it. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>You’re mine #002, 2014 © Mari Katayama\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Elsewhere, Iranian artist Shahrzad Darafsheh’s <em>Half-Light</em> presents a quieter, more reflective engagement with her battle with cancer. In book form, the project functions as a visual diary, recording a slew of everyday scenes alongside the more painful junctures of her journey. “Regardless of the type of illness, travelling through the image is one of the major processes to go into the body, and I wanted to examine myself inside and out. Nothing could really reveal to me how my body is changing better than photography, and shooting everything around me as well as myself helps me in being able to talk about my perception of illness both directly and metaphorically.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>“Half-Light” from the series “Half-Light”, 2018 © Shahrzad Darafsheh \n<p>The ongoing<em> A</em> <em>Certain</em> <em>Distance</em> project by Canadian photographer Philip LePage also adopts a diaristic approach, chronicling the artist’s account of living with mental illness. Diagnosed with dysthymia—a persistent and chronic form of depression—LePage examines his experience of this disorder alongside a constellation of associated conditions. In searing, dream-like black and white prints, he captures fragments of everyday life—the people he spends his time with and the places he goes.<br> </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “A Certain Distance”, 2015 © Philip LePage \n<p>LePage describes the dissociative detachment incurred by his illness as if someone else is living his life—as if he is “becoming a ghost” of himself. Something about this spectral quality of experiencing illness resonates particularly with photography. “Before I was open about my condition, recurring comments about my work always used to centre on the idea that it seemed detached and viewers couldn’t get a sense of my story, but because of my illness that detachment is an inextricable part of me. When I began talking about it in relation to my work, the pictures started making more sense.” </p> \n<p>Photography, it seems, offers artists like LePage a means to externalize parts of themselves that others may not understand. “You can’t take pictures of a broken mind, but you can show the pictures that mind makes, and maybe someone will recognize the symbols,” he says. While photography is undoubtedly a powerful tool with which to explore visible illness, it also maintains a capacity to represent the intangible—just as the body can misbehave in ways that aren’t immediately apparent. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “A Certain Distance”, 2015 © Philip LePage\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The work of Chinese photographer Shuwei Liu takes shape in similarly abstract forms, delivered in a spectrum of blues. Liu applied photography to process the impending decline of his vision, soon after floating crescents had appeared at the base of his corneas. Where English filmmaker Derek Jarman mused on the colour blue as “darkness made visible” as his own sight deteriorated, Liu considers blue “a space between the visible and invisible”, with photography offering a powerful tool for exploring that dichotomy. The milky, washed-out vision he was enduring is expressed in hazy images of foggy windows, eerily empty tunnels and moonlit landscapes. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Visible Darkness”, 2015 – present © Shuwei Liu\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>When Spence grew tired of traditional medicine, she offered the following reason: “I have rejected a medical profession whose basic metaphors of disease are those of WAR: to cut, burn and chemically destroy the ‘problem’, to get rid of the ‘trouble’ (in my case a malignant tumour); to knife it out whilst not encouraging me to ask why it is there.” These metaphors are further probed in <em>Project ‘K’</em>, a photographic collaboration between Dutch artists Geert Broertjes and Lotte Bronsgeest<em>, </em>begun after Broertjes’ diagnosis with colon cancer in April 2019. </p> \n<p>“Shortly after I was diagnosed, Lotte asked if she could take a portrait of me— something pure, without the presence of poisonous medicine in my body,” Broertjes says. As his treatment unfolded, the artist took daily self-portraits to study the nuances in his outward appearance. Meanwhile, the duo subjected negatives and prints to the same procedures Broertjes’ body was enduring. To represent chemotherapy, his urine was used to soak film rolls; partially burned negatives became stand-ins for surgical procedures; whilst 4x5 film was irradiated at the hospital—the hovering, illuminated square in the middle of the film symbolising Broertjes’ tumour of the same size. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Project ‘K’”, 2019 – present © Geert Broertjes and Lotte Bronsgeest \n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In <em>Project</em> <em>‘K’</em>, the notion of a space beyond this one—of Sontag’s “kingdom of the sick”—arises once again. As Broertjes explains, replacing the human body itself with photographic film generates “a sort of external visualization of the world you live in as a patient.” The artist also highlights the contradictory character of ‘treatment’—that what is designed to heal you also breaks you down. In response, the practice of destroying negatives served to further emphasise the violence of both illness and ‘recovery’ on the body. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Project ‘K’”, 2019 – present © Geert Broertjes and Lotte Bronsgeest \n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>A series of works by Kenyan-British artist Phoebe Boswell—brought together for <em>The Space Between Things</em>, a solo exhibition at London’s Autograph ABP—pose other pertinent questions. Why, when dealing with the experience of illness, must any account that isn’t ostensibly ‘strong’ be regarded as ‘weak’? And while there is much to be said for the therapeutic potential of art, why should creative explorations of ill or altered health always be redemptive and celebratory, or culminate in a ‘positive’ takeaway message? </p> \n<p>After sustaining a serious eye injury, Boswell suffered a difficult emotional period that eventually led to a heart attack. Subsequently, a chasm widened between the artist and her sense of self, with prior understandings of her body undermined by it failing beyond her control. “How was she supposed to live, now, with a ‘new’ body and an emotional self that could never return to the person she once knew and inhabited?” asked writer M. Neelika Jayawardane, in a recent text on Boswell’s work for <em>Aperture</em>. The answer for Boswell lay in creating a dialogue with her new self, mediated through a form of art-making that embraced vulnerability and pain. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Film still from “Ythlaf”, 2018 © Phoebe Boswell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In one video work, Boswell incorporated multiple-exposure self-portraits of medical scans, from full-body shots to close-up views of her organs. In another—<em>Ythlaf</em>—the artist floats in the waters off Zanzibar’s shoreline, her body drifting metaphorically in and out of the frame, at the whim of outside elements. Boswell’s reflections reinstate that, beyond expressions of resolve, there should also be space for more painful and affecting representations of the vicissitudes of living with ill health. </p> \n<p>Although the term ‘misbehaving’ seems to be a strangely insouciant one at first, it urges a critical consideration of the ‘norms’ from which the ill or suffering body deviates, as well as how society defines what we expect of our bodies. As Phelim Hoey reminds us, “society is ultimately for healthy people”—a feeling that connects the various accounts and conversations compiled here. For the lineage of photographers that, after Spence, have probed the capabilities and limits of their own misbehaving bodies, the medium maintains a transformative and emancipatory potential. Photography, ultimately, opens up a powerful space of rehearsal. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Visible Darkness”, 2015 – present © Shuwei Liu\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/when-bodies-when-bodies-misbehave#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>“I begin to see beneath the surface of the image,” reads a small slice of text in Spence’s seminal project, <em>The Picture of Health?</em>. “…I can now begin the work of re-inventing myselves.” </p> \n<p><em>Editor’s note: T</em><em>his piece was written with the generous support of writer and editor George H.

shared authorship weaves together an enigmatic imaginary New England location out of spellbinding monochrome vignettes.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By now, you’ve probably heard about Paul Guilmoth and Dylan Hausthor’s <em>Sleep Creek</em>, a photobook published in the winter of 2019 by Void, the Athens-based imprint specializing in dark visuals and photographic mythologies. <em>Sleep Creek</em> popped up on numerous end-of-the year book lists, and has been widely recognized in photography circles the world over, so much so that its popularity garnered its selection as Charcoal Book of the Month back in February. But what exactly is it about the New England grit, woven throughout each image in the book, that has captivated this global audience? </p> \n<p>Building a world from the ground up, saturated with original narratives, contexts and characters, is a common goal amongst artists working across all mediums. For those who use painting or sculpture to construct their alternate dimensions, there is a vast amount of space and freedom harnessed in the starting point of a blank canvas or hunk of clay. But when your medium of choice is photography, the possibilities for unique construction become tricky to navigate. </p> \n<p>As a practice whose history is deeply intertwined with realism, photography has been employed as evidence of events, people and places for nearly two hundred years. Despite this relationship to ‘real’ events, the photographs we find most captivating are often those that harness their own mythology, touching on referents that hastily reveal themselves, only to disappear just as quickly—a frenetic impact of emotion contained within the confines of a still image. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><em>Sleep Creek</em> is the result of a years-long creative partnership between Hausthor and Guilmoth, who grew up in Vermont and New Hampshire respectively, and met while attending art school in Maine in 2011. The two immediately hit it off, and discovered their mutual love for presenting their work through book-making. After graduating from their BFA program, they rented a large house together on Peaks Island in Maine’s Casco Bay, converting the living room into a studio, and spent their days taking photographs of the isolated landmass. There, they founded Wilt Press, and published magazines, photobooks, zines and cassettes, enlarging the shadowy realms occupying their own work across different outlets. Sheltered in the confines of their drafty, peculiar home, the duo began constructing the world of Sleep Creek, leaning into the mythology of New England to find ways to construct a world of their own. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>“Since we both grew up in New England, there is a very specific landscape that we are accustomed to interacting with on a daily basis, and there are very specific stories and feelings that come out of that landscape,” Hausthor explains. “It has something to do with the seasons, and this cyclical narrative that they perpetuate.” While their photographic project started out as a documentation of Peaks Island, the duo eventually broke that instinctive straight documentarian threshold, instead creating the world of Sleep Creek, a place containing equal parts fiction and reality. Guilmoth adds, “When you’re a photographer, you’re used to working with realism and with your roots, and you’re trained to make some sort of document, no matter what kind of picture you are making. It’s this relatable piece of content evidence, but how do you construct something new while paying homage to those experiences?” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Publishing work that poses more questions than answers is precisely where Void has found their niche, and after seeing the work of Hausthor and Guilmoth, reaching out to the photographers to collaborate on a book was a no-brainer. The resulting work stays true to the eerie atmosphere of the photographs while situating itself amongst the larger narrative of Void’s projects. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Cover of “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><em>Sleep Creek’s</em> cover is forest green, providing no allusion to the photographs contained within. Instead, viewers first encounter a golden, embossed goat resembling an old wood-block print, hinting at the manifestation of a dark fairy tale. Inspired by the photographers’ uncanny universe, the Void team sifted through old illustration books on witchcraft and the dark arts, finding visuals that enhanced the photographs’ twitching discomfort. The cover instigates more curiosity than clarification, as at first the goat doesn’t necessarily lean towards good or evil—it could be a harmless rural marker, but it could also be a nod to Black Phillip (as Brad Feuerhelm points out in his <a href=\"https://americansuburbx.com/2020/01/hausthor-guimoth-sleep-creek-gauze-eyed-gothic.html\">review of the book</a> on <em>American Suburb X</em>). </p> \n<p>Flipping the book over and looking at its back cover, readers encounter another embossed image, this time more explicit in its dark origins: flailing figures in the shallows of a river bank, enraptured in some sort of ritualistic reverence or baptismal wading. While hinting at the context of a ‘creek’, the twisting bodies also drive the timelessness of the photographs home, an indiscernible era that is just as much about the past as it is about the present. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>After opening the book, the first page is blank, save for hand-written ellipses in brackets in the lower left corner. This elusive nod to a compiler’s hand informs us that whatever story is contained in the following pages isn’t necessarily the beginning or end of a concrete tale. Rather, it’s a continuation, a fragment, or a series of incomplete scenarios pieced together to create some sort of framework amidst the chaos. The small dots invite each reader to step into the journey laid out for them on the following pages, standing in as a wordless representation for “Once upon a time…” </p> \n<p>Turning the page, readers are met with a steady flow of Hausthor and Guilmoth’s monochrome photographs, sequenced to a glitchy beat that feels like watching a film through blinking eyelids. Each image makes you feel like it’s revealing something you’re supposed to know—some crucial detail or piece of evidence that you try to hold onto while processing each subsequent photograph. “We like when photographs, even though they are still images, contain a beginning, middle and overall plot,” explains Hausthor. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Spread from “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>“Sure, you can create a visual storyboard that maps out a distinct narrative, but there’s something about capturing it all at once, in one image, and then bringing all of those moments together. When I see Paul’s images, I interpret all of his components—his beginning, middle and plot—and I build on it to create our overarching story. That’s why photography is so interesting to us: these aren’t moving images, but somehow they each contain a narrative. How much can we pack into one frame?” </p> \n<p>There is documentation of their surroundings: thickets and groves illuminated by a flash in the night, spiderwebs reflecting silver, bats coursing through the night and animals caught in peculiar circumstances. But there are also people, seemingly caught in candid creeping. While the work is made by both photographers, there is no indication of who exactly took which photograph. Hausthor and Guilmoth work in a similar manner, prioritizing the absence of horizons and stark magnesium flare lighting, presenting countless references to natural elements like fire, water, ice and wind. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the book “Sleep Creek” © Dylan Hausthor &amp; Paul Guilmoth\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dylan-hausthor-sleep-creek#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The world of <em>Sleep Creek</em> is shown to us in the context of dusk and night time, inspired by eeriness of gothic New England lore. But it’s also a rumination on how we come to construct any place, tapping into the limitless possibilities of story, myth and character-building that highlights the partnership between fiction and evidence in photography. Coursing through the photographs, we feel like we’re bearing witness to things that were only meant to happen in the dark of night, never meant to be recorded and seen. </p> \n<p>As they shift into making more images, Hausthor and Guilmoth hope that <em>Sleep Creek</em> stands the test of time, not only as a collective work, but also as individual images. “I like the idea of people flipping through this book, trying to figure out what’s real to them,”Guilmoth reflects. “I think that’s an interesting subjective experience, and I like the idea that we prompt questions in people and make them think about their own surroundings.” Hausthor quips, “I want people to feel the same magic in these photographs ten years from now as they might feel today.” The praise that the book has received so far is indeed a testament to its potential for that lasting magic. </p> \n<div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n <div class=\"picture\"> \n  <a

From his early beginnings as editor-in-chief at a photography magazine in Tokyo, to directing Ring Cube photo gallery in Ginza, to managing a leading photography school, and founding the T3 International Photo Festival in Tokyo, he has always focused on both local and international photography communities.</i><br>\n</p>\n<p><i>Each stage of his career followed a quest to solve large-scale problems as he built bridges for photographers where language and cultural barriers may have otherwise restricted opportunities for exposure and collaboration. He credits his own success to a community of friends who have supported him along the way.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i>We’re thrilled that Hayami is returning as a juror for the <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/photo-competitions/street-photography-awards-2020\">LensCulture Street Photography Awards</a> in 2020. In this interview, he speaks with Amy Parrish about his influences, interests, and perspective on the state of street photography moving forward.</i>\n</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Amy Parrish: One can read a lot about your accomplishments online but it’s a bit more challenging to get to the heart of an experience. I’m really curious about your personal journey.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ihiro Hayami: To start from the very beginning of the beginning—my father is a professional photographer. Ever since I was born, I have been surrounded by photographs. They say, ‘like father like son’ but I wasn’t interested in photography until after I graduated from college.\n</p>\n<p>First, I wanted to be a graphic designer but I realized I wasn’t the best kid in the class, and I felt that if I wasn’t the best kid in the class, how am I going to be the best in the world? I’m the kind of guy that if I want to do a thing, I want to be in the top five.\n</p>\n<p>After a stint selling ad space for a photography magazine, I realized I loved to sell things and I thought maybe I could use that to help photographers: those who were good at making work but not good at selling. Since I can speak English, I also thought I could serve as a bridge between Japanese photographers and other countries. This seemed like an idea that I could be good at.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: I can see the connection between building international bridges and supporting photographers, but starting a large-scale photography festival is still quite a leap. How did that come into being?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: I had been working as the Chief Editor for PHaT PHOTO magazine. Around this time the publishing business, around the world, was going down. I wanted to create an alternative for a struggling magazine industry that could actually help photographers because that was at the core of what I wanted to do. I thought maybe a photography festival could be the solution. Festivals can be thematic like a magazine issue, re-introducing new photographers in different settings. It brought together all of my experiences in sales, as a gallery director, and editor-in-chief together in a new way.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: What was your strategy for achieving what others may have seen as insurmountable?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: In putting together an international festival, I reached out to colleagues who had experience. Everybody helped me with my ideas. I consulted Inri and RongRong, co-founders of the Jimei x Arles Photo Festival in China, and also with my friend, Sam Barzilay, of United Photo Industries and a founder of Photoville in New York. I was in talks with Himeno-san (<i>Kimi Himeno</i>) of Akaaka Publishing, a well-established Japanese photo publisher. I’m lucky to have a lot of great friends who have helped me with what I wanted to do. That’s my talent. Other people are the best part of me.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: And there are so many people working in this industry. I imagine you’ve looked through the work of hundreds, if not thousands, of photographers around the globe. What advice do you have for photographers putting together a portfolio of work that captures your attention?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: Edit tight. Be critical. Everyone on a judging panel has seen a lot of great photography. Erik Vroons from GUP Magazine once said to me it’s like being a food critic and I totally agree. You’re always eating great food all the time, so great food becomes your baseline standard. For photography competitions, in order to stand out, you really have to be critical about your work in terms of preparing a portfolio and really push yourself. You have to become objective about your work. It has to be the best of you. If I see one image below-the-bar as part of a larger portfolio then I might think, maybe that photographer isn’t as good as I thought.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: Photographers are often advised to search for their unique voice or style. Curators seem to have their own stylistic preferences as well, and I understand your work at Ring Cube gallery had something special in how you brought disparate works into the same space together. Can you put into words some of the traits that draw you into a photograph?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: The very first photograph that I purchased was from Sohei Nishino’s <i>Diorama Map</i>. The images that I tend to be attracted to have a very strong visual style or visual narrative/story. Plus, with Nishino’s work, there are layers of time compressed into the image. For me, it could be the subject/object photographed, or the way they are photographed, or the amount of time that a photographer spends (in research, communications, whatever) to create the image. Being able to see these elements come together in an image is truly a privilege.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: I’m inspired by your playful description of always aiming for the top five. In your opinion, who are the top street photographers of all time?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: My fav top five street photographers have no surprises in names: Daido Moriyama, William Klein, Saul Leiter, Garry Winogrand, and Henri Cartier-Bresson.\n</p>\n<p><strong>AP: All classics! One of our entrants posed a question about how the genre has been shifting recently. They noted growing tensions for street photographers in certain parts of the world where societal norms demand more privacy for people sharing public spaces. It reminds me of your own experience maneuvering through a changing photo publishing industry. What’s your perspective on the future of street photography?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IH: It’s important to acknowledge the world of photography is constantly changing, as most things in life. But the bright side is that photography is not a traditional art form where you have to follow somebody’s style and then refine it. You can invent your own way of making pictures. Restriction really forces you to re-think or re-construct the way you shoot, which can turn into something amazing you may have never discovered if you didn’t have to work around a problem that you encountered. The future of street photography is wide open, and really up to the photographers living today.\n</p><p>Enjoy more great photography:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jordi-casanas-barcelona-punctum\">Barcelona Punctum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/meg-hewitt-tokyo-is-yours\">Tokyo is Yours</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mirko-saviane-b-uranus-inside-an-island-in-the-venetian-lagoon\">B-Uranus: Inside an Island in the Venetian Lagoon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/cesar-ordonez-tokyo-blur-2\">Tokyo Blur</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/fuku-heavy-light-recent-photography-and-video-from-japan\">Heavy Light: Recent Photography and Video from Japan</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jean-de-pomereu-sans-nom\">Sans Nom</a></li></ul><section class=\"fl-slideshow\"><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1c28f3c2-0872-4846-b008-a9398be4bf14.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bd223673-fe99-48f2-90be-9d37319a10ce.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b92d201e-3b4b-4bb3-a483-83753b22c59a.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3f07bb45-4087-46c5-9c56-ece2dd55dad5.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bb23efa9-932e-43bd-89de-8efe31647214.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/0f17482c-da01-4a15-a0c9-3fd46d8c1447.jpg\"/></figure></section>\n      ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 20:15:48 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/0f17482c-da01-4a15-a0c9-3fd46d8c1447.jpg","linkMd5":"12f83f9aff394df41250f571b7843153","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-47-770_e2cb286a0cd4a5d9.webp","destWidth":746,"destHeight":1326,"sourceBytes":292353,"destBytes":222500,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/0f17482c-da01-4a15-a0c9-3fd46d8c1447.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-47-770_e2cb286a0cd4a5d9.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1c28f3c2-0872-4846-b008-a9398be4bf14.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-10-175_4aee3eccfb1c866f.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bd223673-fe99-48f2-90be-9d37319a10ce.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-38-11-041_aae6eec1e26e5bb6.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/b92d201e-3b4b-4bb3-a483-83753b22c59a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-02-156_233bac1fc5a90c98.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3f07bb45-4087-46c5-9c56-ece2dd55dad5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-08-365_926b5591404ab93c.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bb23efa9-932e-43bd-89de-8efe31647214.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-38-13-300_55631fa78cc9d5d1.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/0f17482c-da01-4a15-a0c9-3fd46d8c1447.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-11-714_145e43f66ae06b08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066819},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"A Life’s Work","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>A Life’s Work</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Bharat Sikka</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/fdce0421-6a6e-4ef2-b024-5a24d41355d2.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  In his long term exploration of masculinity, Bharat Sikka intertwines the personal and the collective by continually finding new ways to investigate and represent his homeland, India.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>The evolution of a photographer’s artistic process is necessarily tied to personal change and growth, and while Bharat Sikka’s numerous projects are united in their rich cinematic styling, each series functions as a distinct chapter in the greater story of the artist’s life.

Later on, when the artist moved to New York City to attend the Parsons School of Design, Sikka quickly realized that the inspiration he needed to pursue photography wasn’t far from home</em><em>—it was right under his nose all along.</em> </p> \n<p><em>Since returning to India, Sikka has found ways to represent his country through images that steer clear of stereotypical documentary stylings, addressing themes of masculinity and representation.

But when I step back and look at your work, everything feels symbiotic, like each project is an individual tile that makes up the greater mosaic of your mind. What would you say was the seed for your early work?</strong> </p> \n<div> \n <p>Bharat Sikka: I’ve been taking pictures for a long time, but I don’t shy away from experimenting or finding new ways to explore photography. I am always trying to find myself, searching for that one particular way of looking at things. I made my first project, <em>Indian Men</em>, while I was studying in New York. It was the first time I left India for an extended period of time, and I felt very isolated. The distance made me think about where I came from, and about the solitary existence of men in India. When I returned to my country, I felt inspired to explore the life of the Indian middle class man, so I started photographing my father, my uncles and my friends—mostly older men. I found a certain sense of humor and loneliness within them, mixed with dignity, and I wanted to tell their story. There were things that I saw from a distance while I was away from India, that I couldn’t feel or see while I was living there. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “Indian Men” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: Can you talk about the evolution of your work? How did the ideas you were interested in manifest in each of your ensuing projects?</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: After graduating from art school, I started working on a project called <em>Space in Between</em>. While working on <em>Indian Men</em>, I realized it was important to document India in a way that wasn’t stereotypical. I wanted to deal with its politics, environment and emotion using a different type of visual. At the time, my contemporaries were generating stereotypical projects about the Maharajas, palaces, elephants and slums—these images were everywhere. To counter this aesthetic, I created landscape images with my 4x5 camera, which felt slower and closer to the subject matter. The country was changing in many ways—certain things were on the way to being lost forever. The socialist, closed decades of the 80s and 90s were shifting, and this new affluence brought with it a new aesthetic. I wanted to capture the times that I grew up in before it disappeared forever. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “Space in Between” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Road to Salvador Do Mundo” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p>After that, I worked on a smaller project called <em>The Road to Salvador Do Mundo</em>, the place my family moved to just after my daughter was born. The village felt like this small, beautiful fantasy where I was able to contemplate the emotional charge that came with being a new father. Shortly after that, I worked on a project called <em>Matter</em>, which took me about ten years to complete. It was an extension of <em>Space in Between</em>, going back over what I had seen, which felt simultaneously poetic and dark because it spoke about the evolution of social, religious and environmental issues. Everything was in color, but the subjects felt very monochromatic. I wanted the viewer to experience a lack of color, because it was a departure from India as this incredibly colorful, joyful and spiritual place. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “Matter” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p>But six or seven years ago, around the time I was working on <em>Matter</em>, my studio completely burned down, and I took a very intense break from photography, because I didn’t have anything left. The first project I did after that loss was called <em>Where the Flowers Still Grow</em>, which is about men living in Kashmir. It started as a lighter, poetic version of the place and, like my other projects, it became heavier. I didn’t want to take any sides on the political matter; I just wanted to inspect it in my own way, documenting the people in their land. </p> \n <p>There’s a thread that revealed itself throughout all these projects before I started working on my latest work, <em>The Sapper</em>: the idea of what it means to be an Indian man. And because I work on projects side-by-side over longer periods of time, they each reflect one another. It’s not a conscious, intentional link—it just happens on its own. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: In a number of these projects, you document the lives and situations of people other than yourself, like the work in Kashmir, or the commissioned project you did in Brighton for Photoworks called <em>The Marlboro Theatre</em>. How do you find ways to ensure that your interactions with subjects are less distanced and voyeuristic? Do you focus on a visual aesthetic, or is it something else?</strong> </p> \n <p><strong></strong> </p> \n <p>BS: I personally love communities and places, and that’s why those elements keep coming back in my work. For <em>The Marlboro Theatre</em>, I photographed in Brighton, which was a totally new world for me. In the town, there is a bar called the Marlboro Theatre, and it’s an LGBTQ bar. I would meet people there and ask them if they wanted to be photographed. I returned to Brighton about six or seven times over two or three years, and I spoke to my subjects at length, always trying to incorporate something specific about their stories into the images. Even though <em>The Marlboro Theatre</em> is not a part of India, and my work is mostly about my own country, I thought it was important for me to bring these images back to India and show them publicly. I didn’t know a lot about Brighton’s LGBTQ community, which meant other people in my country didn’t either, which is why it was so important to share it with them in a public exhibition. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Marlborough Theatre” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: How does this feeling translate into your work back home? You touched on this a bit already, but can you explain when you started realizing that a different representation of India was important to you as a photographer? </strong> </p> \n <p>BS: While my education at Parsons in New York City taught me to think about my work in a way that I hadn’t before, I also felt like I lost something. The teaching and learning was imbued with so much American history and values, and approval coincided with an adherence to and understanding of that world. But at the time, India was the place that I understood the most, and the place that I could openly comment on. It didn’t feel right to comment on something I wasn’t a part of. Although I was lured by the West and felt like I needed to be a part of it, I eventually realized that I didn’t have much to say about it. When I started photographing, there was this heavy Magnum-influenced perspective and perception of my country, and there were a few internal people like Dayanita Singh who were working on documentation—but I wanted to take some more radical risks in its representation. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka \n <p><strong>CL: One of the primary ways you subvert this representation is by incorporating different materials, processes and objects into your work. Of course the foundation of your work is photographic, but you push the boundaries of what that might mean. You can see this starting in earlier projects, like <em>Matter</em> and <em>Where the Flowers Still Grow</em>, where you combine still lifes of objects and paraphernalia with people and places. And then with <em>The Sapper</em>, objects and other materials become a part of each piece in a physical sense. When did you realize that inanimate objects were important to include in your work?</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: When I started working on <em>Indian Men</em>, I was deeply influenced by film and cinema, and painters like Edward Hopper and photographers like Philip Lorca Dicorcia. After some time, I realized that even though my content was completely different, it was obviously heavily inspired by these visuals. <em>Matter</em> was the first time I took a leap into not caring about whether or not people liked the images, so instead of shooting everything on 4x5, I started shooting in digital. I wanted to move forward rather than make it look classic. </p> \n <p>I took this a step further in <em>Where the Flowers Still Grow</em>, making installations that incorporated objects I collected, using my scanner as a camera to document things. This feeling of incorporating ‘stuff’ now follows me throughout every project I tackle—I always think my work requires another dimension. I like layering different materials and images, and I’m still experimenting with those concepts. </p> \n <p><strong></strong> </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: Often when artists try to put a bunch of different materials into a single project, it’s too fragmented and staccato, but yours always seems to flow. Is that something you’ve had to work on?</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: I think it’s because I spend so much time on these projects—at least three or four years—and I am insistent on changing my mind about how things should be represented if they don’t feel right. The medium, film stock and tools you use need to correlate to the message you’re hoping to unearth. If I want to slow things down, I’ll work with a process that’s slower. For example, in <em>The Marlboro Theatre</em>, even though I was comfortably using digital by that point, I felt like I needed to slow things down and be more contemplative, so I went back to my 4x5 discipline. As another example, my father, the subject of <em>The Sapper</em>, was a structural engineer. He was always playing with paper, collage and drawings, and that’s what opened me up to incorporating those materials into that body of work. </p> \n <p><strong></strong> </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: That explains the technique in <em>The Sapper</em>. What was the process of making your relationship with your father, which is something ephemeral, into something tangible? There are so many layers in this work. How did you discover which elements should be layered as effective metaphors?</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: <em>The Sapper</em> evolved out of the idea of manhood, which of course trickles through all of my work. I knew it was personal, but I soon realized that there are so many projects where people photograph their families and loved ones, and I didn’t want it to be another one of those series. But I still wanted to bring in elements that reminded me of my childhood, when my father was in the army, and layer them in. I found some things in his closet that were extremely nostalgic, so I incorporated those into the work. </p> \n <p>The more we worked together, the more I uncovered small memories, like how he used to teach me to make things with paper—airplanes and other objects—or architectural drawings. I was always interested in cutting up images and making collages, so I wanted to build those elements into the work. Then, I started giving my father the materials, asking him to make things as well, so he was able to be involved in some collages and other pieces. For example, he used to photocopy a lot of his work, so I photocopied a photograph of him and placed it with another image in a collage. There are all sorts of gestures like this layered into the project. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: There’s an assumption that the act of photographing—of putting a mechanical object between you and your subject—creates a distance between the two people participating in that exchange. But it seems like this series actually brought you and your father closer together.</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: My father doesn’t live with us, and he was not around a lot when I was a child. Yes, he is my father, but he also represents the psyche of the Indian man, and this factor is important. Since we started the project, we definitely speak more openly about the past and present, and we spend a lot of time discussing, agreeing and disagreeing, which wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t pursue the work. When I started making this series, it wasn’t about following him around his house and documenting his life. Instead, it was about asking him questions: Do you remember when you did this for me? Can you pose in this way? All of these small moments piled up, and made me feel closer to him. </p> \n <p><strong></strong> </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “The Sapper” © Bharat Sikka\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/bharat-sikka-a-life-s-work#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n <p><strong>CL: While <em>The Sapper</em> is incredibly personal, you’re showing it to an audience, and it is made to be experienced by others. How do you want your viewers to be impacted by your images and objects?</strong> </p> \n <p>BS: Every person reads these images in their own way. Some react positively, and some feel the need to ask a lot of questions, but after some point, I didn’t want this project to just be about my father. For me, it was about a man who lives in India—this is his world, this is the politics of his country, this is the life that he leads. And while all of these things are important to me, and the protagonist is my father, my main goal is to challenge how India is represented—especially in the West. </p> \n <div> \n  <em>Editor’s note: Check out Sikka’s online exhibition </em>\n  <a href=\"http://viewingroom.naturemorte.com/bharatsikka\">The Sapper</a>\n  <em> at Nature Morte, on view now. </em> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/heiko-tiemann-real-indications\">Real Indications</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/chema-conesa-the-face-s-of-spain-portrait-masterworks\">The Face(s) of Spain: Portrait Masterworks</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/iris-hutegger-textural-landscapes\">Textural Landscapes</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photo-nola-winners-photonola-review-prize\">Winners: PhotoNOLA Review Prize</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/hannah-guy-staccato-and-north-south-east-west\">Staccato and North South East West</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-eve-rattner-house-of-charm\">House of Charm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8567b439-2b75-459f-b221-329da3c405a0.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Untitled from the series \"The Sapper\"\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d3ae7861-da4b-4c4a-8f5e-c5f8b4878400.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Untitled from the series \"The Sapper\"\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/fdce0421-6a6e-4ef2-b024-5a24d41355d2.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Untitled from the series \"The Sapper\"\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8d149578-df1e-42d6-9b94-b02182798366.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Untitled from the series \"The Sapper\"\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3b723f64-9968-4409-9bae-128b36a9c042.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Untitled from the series \"Where the Flowers Still Grow\"\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 03 Jul 2020 13:27:35 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/fdce0421-6a6e-4ef2-b024-5a24d41355d2.jpg","linkMd5":"23822f038238c701b7770f008329d4e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-617_7484e63790f5be1e.webp","destWidth":843,"destHeight":632,"sourceBytes":92126,"destBytes":83182,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/fdce0421-6a6e-4ef2-b024-5a24d41355d2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-47-617_7484e63790f5be1e.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8567b439-2b75-459f-b221-329da3c405a0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-13-001_9958630a3fca911e.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d3ae7861-da4b-4c4a-8f5e-c5f8b4878400.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-59-694_4797fea989df3fb1.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/fdce0421-6a6e-4ef2-b024-5a24d41355d2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-15-903_76ae6b01fe41f874.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8d149578-df1e-42d6-9b94-b02182798366.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-03-106_a21fb88bdd4ec68c.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3b723f64-9968-4409-9bae-128b36a9c042.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-54-042_ea76fe2b64ffc94f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066813},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Working Together","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photography-collectives-working-together","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Working Together</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Photography Collectives</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/c5eea559-aac3-41c6-882c-ab9656f9728a.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Is the whole greater than the sum of its individual parts? We take a look at the ups and downs of being in a photography collective through the lens of four different collectives from around the world.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Photography can be a lonely craft. But it needn’t be. Photography collectives have been around—whether formally or informally—since the early days of the medium. Now more than ever, they seem to be on the rise. Many photographers are on the lookout for a support base that can create new or additional artistic, intellectual, and economic opportunities as well as a safe space for support and reflection—something that the photographer, who often works in a solitary way, needs. But what does being in a collective add to your work? How do you start one? And how do you make sure it endures? Four different collectives from around the world—Native, Prime, 20Fotógrafos and Kamerades—share their insights into the highs and lows of working together. <br> </br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Meeting in the Kolping of Tutors and Editors with the coordinators of 20F, before the introduction of groups.

It could be a pair of photographers working together, but also a group of photographers who live together, or on the opposite side of the scale, artists from different countries who collaborate online. Sometimes a collective also fulfills the function of an agency, selling and distributing the work of its individual members. Thanks to the Internet and a boom in new technologies, photography collectives can form and grow as a group without being fixed in the same location. </p> <p>With no single set path, being a photographer is difficult to navigate alone. One of the major reasons to start and join a collective is to find some kind of support—whether it be mental, motivational, financial or artistic. Many collectives start out of friendship, with a group of people who have similar views on the world, photography and life. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>The annual spring bowhead whale hunt in Barrow, Alaska in April, 2016.

It is a global collective of visual storytellers with an interest in new media that wants to support their artists in their creative endeavors and businesses so that, as one of its members, Dominic Bracco II, puts it “we can have fulfilling lives for our families and ourselves.” Prime’s focus is not so much on producing work together, but more about where to place the work, or how to draw connections between the interests of the different members. </p> \n <blockquote>\n  Without a doubt our collective energy has inspired us to think about stories and issues in a broad and deep sense, but more importantly in a way that’s true to each individual. \n </blockquote> <p>“In that space, we have collaborated often and successfully. We are all pretty decent educators, for example. That is largely because we share knowledge and working methods. We help each other in straightforward ways: we have compiled our picture buyer contacts, shared information about predatory contacts to avoid, and also the good ones. We supported each other through personal and professional changes. Deep down, we are in Prime as friends first,” Dominic explains. “We’ve all grown so much since we started this project. But without a doubt our collective energy has inspired us to think about stories and issues in a broad and deep sense, but more importantly in a way that’s true to each individual. We have a very positive energy in the group. We strive to support each other to grow. In whatever direction that takes us.” </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>WINDSOR, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 27, 2019: San Mateo County firefighters struggle to protect a home threatened by the Kincade Fire.

Its six members share the mission of documenting reality and expanding awareness about social issues in the Balkans. What started as a group of working photojournalists and friends became something more serious when they started to gather spontaneously, influenced by the workshops and masterclasses which some of them had the pleasure to attend at the time. </p> \n <blockquote>\n  The new tendencies from the world of photography slowly began to have a negative impact on us as photographers, neglecting our personal realities. \n </blockquote> <p>One of Kamerades’ members Marko Risovic recalls rallying together over shared discontent with the regional photography scene. “The new tendencies from the world of photography slowly began to have a negative impact on us as photographers, neglecting our personal realities. We realized that we are whining too much all together about many things, and finally decided to do something about it, first of all for the photographic community in the region, and then for ourselves as well,” he explains. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>!Seselj: Belgrade, Serbia, 2014.

Without any imposed filtration or segregation, during the period of over a year, a core group of people who shared mutual dreams and values stayed and formed a collective. The Bosnia tavern doesn’t exist any more, as many other great places of Belgrade which capitulated under capitalism. We are still resisting.” </p> <p>Starting from friendship can form a solid base and offer many advantages in the life of a collective, since friendship is a safe place to return to. However, in terms of artistic and economic opportunities, it can also be a disadvantage to work as a group focusing on shared interests. Marko explains: “Sometimes when we look back at our mutual projects, we almost can’t tell who made which single photo. We’re all so similar in our approach—and this was a spontaneous result, not an imperative—that it almost looks as if some of the projects are the result of the labor of one person. Of course this is sometimes good for the purpose of coherence and clarity, but it certainly doesn’t embrace individuality which we otherwise highly respect.” </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>Berkasovo, Serbia, 24.10.2015.

From its early beginnings, Native has clearly defined its mission to change visual journalism to be more representative of different talent from across the globe. As a collective, they form a network of talent committed to diversifying the media landscape through a multi-pronged approach: a go-to platform where editors and media organizations can hire photographers from specific regions, the organization of workshops and festivals and the presentation of the photographer’s work in the form of exhibitions. </p> <p>They connect journalists, documentary makers and visual storytellers from underrepresented regions and communities with major publications and introduce them to a global audience. One thing still resonates with the other collectives: Native also wants to build spaces where knowledge and skills are shared among others and where community can be felt, even from far away. </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>“Anytime I think about School 19 I tend to get emotional,” says Badru.

Badru grew up across the street from what he and his friends referred to as ‘the castle’. After being abandoned for over 20 years, he began the #FreeSchool19 grassroots campaign in 2012 to take ownership of the building. The detailed plans aimed to reinstate it as a community school, media lab, a re-entry center for the formerly incarcerated and a communal, multipurpose event space. In 2014, the city of Yonkers sold the property to Alma Realty, one of the top real estate firms in New York, in hopes the company’s decades of experience could see the project finished in three years. Facing a mounting campaign from locals, Alma promised to keep the original structure and convert it into market rate housing, just one of the conditions Alma Realty failed to meet.

In the case of the collective <strong>20Fotógrafos</strong>, which was originally known as ‘Colectivo +1’, a shared vision and ideas between a group of colleagues in Colombia is where it all started. They began around 2010 as a group of 3 colleagues who were looking to collaborate on different photo-related initiatives. </p> <p>An “intensive Latin American educational experience”, 20Fotógrafos aims to rethink and reinvigorate photo education and the creative processes behind photo production. The event brings together photo editors, instructors and students from all over Latin America, in order to create the conditions needed to build and strengthen collaborative networks, exchange and debate ideas around contemporary photography, create individual and collaborative projects and work alongside local communities, leaving behind valuable resources. As of 2020, they have organized versions of 20Fotógrafos workshops in Mexico, Bolivia and Guatemala. </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>Ezequiel Sambresqui (Argentina) and Paula Betancur (Colombia) photograph “Personajes de Concepción”.

It provides you with, in the words of Marko of Kamerades collective, “a backup, a spine, a springboard that really can help you jump over the fence sometimes, or support if you fall.” Many members share contacts and content to increase the visibility and financial viability of the work. The collective itself can also develop a brand, making it easier to reach different channels and widening the opportunities of spreading a message. As Dominic of Prime says: “When we started we were less defined as individual artists and worked primarily as assignment photographers for picture buyers. This meant that we were able to draw in clients because as individuals no one knew who we were.” </p> \n  <blockquote>\n   Power comes in numbers: a collective can give an individual photographer a sense of belonging. It provides you with…a backup, a spine, a springboard that really can help you jump over the fence sometimes, or support if you fall. \n  </blockquote> <p>This communal mindset doesn’t end with the sharing of resources: it can also extend into the working process itself. Collectives often produce group projects where the coming together of different perspectives can enrich the project at hand. Laura Beltrán Villamizar of Native says: “The way you see a story will not be the same way someone else does it. The same goes for any notion or feeling. Seeing that role-play balances the way we understand ‘truth’ : there is not one truth, but many. We tell stories that reflect on how we experience our realities. Collaborating with that notion in mind allows for more freedom in the creative process and for more interesting outcomes.” </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>Native founder Laura Beltrán Villamizar leads a creative lab at the African Artists’ Foundation in Lagos Nigeria with the following participants. © Native<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photography-collectives-working-together#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p><br> </br></p> <p>Kamerades’ first major collective project <em>Dirty Season</em>, was published as a book in 2014. In this project, the six members of the collective contributed their own hard-edged and sardonic vision of the Serbian electoral process in 2012 and how it reflected Serbian society. A forensic document of the state of the nation, the project dealt with their own realities, uncovering different aspects of political continuum and its consequences on the life of ordinary people. The collective attribute the project’s success to the mutual connection the photographers shared to the subject. “We made it from the depths of our hearts, well aware of the necessity of our contribution to visual exploration of the subject which is crucial to our lives and those that will come after us.” </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>Belgrade, Serbia, 2012.

What attracted my attention was the repetitiveness of both the political message and the appearances of all the political representatives, as well as the tiny gestures that displayed how much effort they all make to seemingly tell the truth and things they believe in in front of the camera. © Marko Risovic (Kamerades) <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photography-collectives-working-together#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p>Collective projects don’t necessarily need to result in a specific photo or body of work. Sometimes it’s more about nourishing individual voices. In the work of 20Fotógrafos, the group organizes a week-long experience that brings together approximately 100 photographers, mostly from Latin American countries, to work on individual and collaborative projects. In the process, the workshop rethinks the educational and creative processes around photography and builds towards strengthening regional networks of photographers. Federico Pardo of 20Fotógrafos describes the aim as “pushing the individual and collective boundaries of the creative process while giving photographers a space to find their voice.” </p> \n  <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n  </div>Elodie Chrisment (France) at the end of the afternoon working in her collaborative project FIN DEL MUNDO, Concepción, Bolivia. © © 20Fotógrafos/Migrar Phot<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photography-collectives-working-together#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a><br> <p>Native also partake in this vision, giving workshops in Africa and Latin America in which they bring photographers from all over the region to participate. Laura says about these group projects: “It’s been pretty remarkable to see the results of our efforts in real time, in real conversations.” </p> \n   <blockquote>\n    If there is mutual trust and good flow of energy within the group, as in any other profession or any other team, this can lift the bar of ambition much higher compared to a sole individual in the same situation. \n   </blockquote> <p>This tension between creating and maintaining a sense of belonging and the urge for individuality can make forming and running a successful collective a challenge. However, for all these four groups, a shared energy and a sense of belonging remain the most valuable ingredients for success. For Kamerades, being surrounded by a group of people that share the same values and attitudes and who also experience the same uncertainties and problems are crucial elements to survive in this solitary and often egoistic profession. “If there is mutual trust and good flow of energy within the group, as in any other profession or any other team, this can lift the bar of ambition much higher compared to a sole individual in the same situation. Besides ambitions and striving for better, it’s normal to share failures and fears as well.” </p> \n   <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n   </div>Belgrade, Serbia, 04.11.2019.

Does working collectively cause its own set of problems? There are of course many practical challenges that a collective faces. For example, if members live and work remotely, it can be difficult to deal with distance and different time zones and languages. </p> <p>Laura of Native says that it can be hard to keep everybody active and engaged. “When working as a group, you will always have more active members than others. This is for different reasons: some might have sporadic access to the internet, be on assignment on the field, be less comfortable with the language of communication used, such as English. Less active members can easily fall into some sort of passive mode which makes it more difficult to help them and have them contribute to common projects and group discussions.” 20Fotógrafos concur, explaining that it can sometimes be challenging to push a project forward, make decisions efficiently, executions and unify the “voice” of the work. </p> \n    <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n    </div>Portraits of all the participants of 20 Fotógrafos Bolivia, made in instant films by Santiago Escobar-Jaramillo (Colombia).

As Marko from Kamerades explains: “Everyone comes with their own thoughts, specific values and sensibility, skills and energy. And then we unite all of this within a group effort. And it’s a mess. There’s tension, and it hurts sometimes, but in the end, it usually works. We achieve something that might not be possible in this form if there was only one creator with their values, energy and skills.” </p> \n    <blockquote>\n     Everyone comes with their own thoughts, specific values and sensibility, skills and energy. And then we unite all of this within a group effort. And it’s a mess. There’s tension, and it hurts sometimes, but in the end, it usually works. \n    </blockquote> <p>Being flexible with these skills is also important. “This applies both to mutual projects but even more to everyday functioning. There are many things to be done around a collective if one wants to nurture it in the direction of progress. We literally split roles based on our personal skills and specializations,” he says. “One person is an accountant, another a graphic designer, someone else is a driver… These roles change with every new occasion. We are all still basically photographers, but within a collective we are whatever we need to be if we want to make it work.” </p> \n    <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n    </div>Krnjaca refugee camp, Serbia, 08.02.2019. A family takes a nap on the floor of their eight square meters room in a refugee camp in Krnjaca, Serbia. They started the journey from Afghanistan three years ago, after the father of the family Naqib had recovered from a rocket attack undertaken by the Taliban against the government caravan for which Naqib was working at the time. He was heavily injured and his leg was amputated. After this event, due to insecurity and the lack of prospects for their two children, the family decided to leave, embarking on a long journey through Iran, Turkey and Bulgaria. They already tried to cross into EU through Bosnia several times, without success. Now they are waiting for spring in a refugee camp in Serbia, so they can try to move forward in a safer way.

They come and go. They evolve through different phases of existence. Kamerades compares the experience as living a very typical love story. “First, there was flirting and that tickling feeling in our stomachs. Then there was passion, followed by big dreams and plans for the future. Then came marriage with its own ups and downs—cooling down, giving another chance, then passion again, with a lot of fighting. Then giving up, then a second chance again… We think that in our case we are going through a phase of mature love now,” Risovic explains. “The passion is long gone, but we still do love each other. And we are trying to solve our multiple problems by getting back to that safe place of mutual values and friendship, and by giving a chance to new young members who are supposed to give us new energy.” </p> <p>Sometimes collectives don’t have much success. There are different reasons for this, from the lack of a manifesto or common goal, to not being financially sustainable or poor communication among members and competing passions. Then, they fail or simply transform into a different shape. The combined wisdom of these four groups speak to the positives of working collectively: the joys of learning from others, getting out of your comfort zone, switching from an individual approach to a collaborative one, promoting dialogue and building communities. The more you give, the more you’ll get. </p> \n     <div> \n      <em>Editor’s note: You can find out more about each collective at their respective websites: <a

A riot of garish colors and plastic (or sad-looking real fast food burgers), Jonathan Blaustein’s still lifes subvert the visual language of product photography to explore the themes of American consumption and consumerism.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em></em><em>Jonathan Blaustein’s book</em>, Extinction Party<em> published by Yoffy Press in 2020, is a compilation of four bodies of work intersecting themes of American consumption and consumerism. A collection of still-life images with little decor and minimalist stylization, Blaustein’s blunt photographic style brings to the forefront a direct and unabashed confrontation with the aesthetics of his chosen subject matter.</em> </p> \n<p><em>Woven into the threads of this tapestry of photographs are deep concerns over American overconsumption, and what it means for our bodies, our lifestyles, the wastes we leave that tarnish our environments, and above all, the impoverishment of what American society has come to represent in the values of what we spend our money on. The book’s title, ‘Extinction Party’, acts as a tongue-in-cheek reflection of how mass-produced and consumerist lifestyles, and their environmental consequences, have placed the world on a path of unsustainability brought on by demand for convenience and novelty. </em> </p> \n<p><em>The work in this book began in the midst of the financial collapse of 2008, and has now been published on what was the cusp of America’s COVID-19 spread; symbolic bookends that each represent areas of significant societal failures. In the midst of the current pandemic, we turn our attention to the most immediate threat to our livelihoods and health, perhaps forgetting for a moment the continued decline of climate sustainability that underscores much of Blaustein’s concerns. In this interview, Blaustein talks to Gregory Eddi Jones for LensCulture about the evolution of the project, tackling the aesthetics of consumerism and the tumultuous new era this book was born into. </em> </p> \n<p><em></em> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Yellow plastic fedora and yellow plastic tablecloth © Jonathan Blaustein\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jonathan-blaustein-extinction-party#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>Gregory Eddi Jones: So you just published <em>Extinction Party</em> with Yoffy Press. I’d love to start by asking just in broad strokes about the genesis of this work. When did you begin it?</strong> </p> \n<p>Jonathan Blaustein: Well, it’s really a two-part answer, so I’ll try to keep it brief. <em>Extinction Party</em> features four interconnected projects shot over ten years, and I began the superstructure in 2008, when I made <em>The Value of a Dollar</em>. It’s a series in which I shopped for food in the markets of New Mexico, and then photographed $1 worth of each item on my studio table. </p> \n<p>I finished shooting the last project, <em>Party City is the Devil</em>, in 2018. As for the book, it began in February, 2019, when my publisher, Jennifer Yoffy, came to visit me in Taos for a little ski weekend. We chatted about the idea of a book on the ski lift, and then she asked to see my material after dinner, to have a crack at it. It happened in a natural, unplanned way, and my wife and I liked her edit enough that we decided not to even speak to any other publishers. We trusted her to help us make a cool book. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Covers of “Extinction Party” © Jonathan Blaustein\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jonathan-blaustein-extinction-party#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>GEJ: Each of the projects interlaced in the book explores different facets of American consumption. There’s a certain wryness that defines a lot of your pictures, a funny tension between the blunt way you photograph things, and the almost grotesque nature of some of your subject matter. One image you made in 2008, <em>One Dollar’s Worth of Potted Meat Food Produc</em><em>t</em>, tugs at me in different ways. I’m amused at it, but kind of sickened as well. It’s sort of a heartbreaking picture. Could you talk a little about what initially prompted you to explore consumption, and how you settled on the visual strategies/rhetoric to do so?</strong> </p> \n<p>JB: That’s an easy one, because the root of the entire book stems from the McDonalds double-cheeseburger photograph. Back in 2007, I began noticing a lot of billboards and tractor trailers painted like the perfect Mickey D’s burger. Out here in the West, these trucks will pass you at 85 miles an hour on I-25, flying by with their 18-foot-wide, lacquered burgers and airbrushed French fries. </p> \n<p>It bothered me that photography, the medium to which I had devoted my adult life, had been co-opted to create such a nefarious set of illusions. All of the fast food advertising was based on a false reality, but it was so powerful, it still enticed people into over-consuming fast food. Everyone knows the Big Mac doesn’t look like the picture, but they buy it anyway. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>One dollar’s worth of double-cheeseburger from McDonalds © Jonathan Blaustein\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jonathan-blaustein-extinction-party#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>After about six months thinking about it, I decided to act, and started shopping for <em>The Value of a Dollar</em> in the spring of ‘08. My big idea was to go to the store, buy the burger, slap it down on my studio table, and shoot it with no additional lighting or retouching. I wanted to create a parallel reality, based on the thing itself, that would then sit out there in popular culture as a counter-narrative. You have the burger in the ad, and then the burger as it actually is. So of course, that way of thinking and shooting persisted over the course of the next group of projects, as they’re all interconnected. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>One dollar’s worth of tomatillos from Mexico © Jonathan Blaustein\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jonathan-blaustein-extinction-party#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>GEJ: In the book are also selections from your most recent series, <em>Party City is the Devil</em>. It’s work that, in no uncertain terms, forms a critique on cheap tokens of consumerism like colorful plastics and paper products that are designed for parties. It’s doubtless that the demand for these sorts of products is one of the many factors in the declining health of the natural world. And your pictures in turn, frame the punchy colors and promises of fun these items offer as a sort of deceit, a promise of fun not to be trusted. Am I reading this project correctly?</strong> </p> \n<p>JB: Totally. It’s all about attraction and repulsion, on multiple levels. I’m using party supplies, and Party City, as a stand in for American overconsumption, because the connections are so obvious. They use hyper-saturated, slick, candy colors in everything they sell, to get people to buy more things that will go straight into a landfill at the end of the day—if they don’t end up in the ocean. And everything is branded in our favorite Marvel and Disney IP, or maybe it’s actual candy. </p> \n<p>Party City seduces us into consumption with color and sparkle, just as we artists seduce viewers into considering our ideas, and our symbols, by using color and pizazz in the same way. So I wanted the pictures to be attractive in a way that felt wrong, while also representing the shiny veneer of a hollowed out society. </p> \n<p>I know it’s a cliché, but I wanted these pictures to have a ‘playing music on the decks of the Titanic while she’s going down’ kind of feel, and it seems like people get that. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Blue streamers and red plastic tablecloth © Jonathan Blaustein\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jonathan-blaustein-extinction-party#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>GEJ: The publication of the book came just as news about the looming pandemic began to break, and I can’t help but find intersections between the themes of consumption in your work and how our lives have changed as a result of the stay-at-home orders. Certainly, both overlap with a certain dread that I feel about the state of humanity, which just seems to be drowning in a heap of global threats of our own making. I’m wondering how you see your work in relation to this new world the book was born into. And on a larger scope, I’m curious if you share my sense of dread, or if you are perhaps more hopeful that we can overcome our own follies?</strong> </p> \n<p>JB: Tough question, for sure. Like everyone else, I’m having trouble making sense of how drastically the world has changed. Everything was irrevocably different after 9/11, and I suppose this is the next era for 21st Century America. </p> \n<p>To answer your question directly, though, yes, I share your sense of dread. There is very little to be optimistic about now, but I spent much of 2019 thinking about the comparisons to 100 years ago, when so much wealth was concentrated in an oligarchy. Back then, it took a World War and the Great Depression to break the stranglehold, so I wondered what could ever come along that would be big enough to change the course of American politics? </p> \n<p>Now that the disruption is here, we know what it looks like. But we planned the book in February 2019, and I named it in March 2019, so there was no way to know what was coming.

As for my work, though, I haven’t really been interested in making a photo project, since I finished <em>Party City is the Devil</em>. Last year, I made wall installations out of party supplies for a museum show, and also did a drawing series, based on appropriated portraits from the internet. Basically, I’m in an experimentation phase, so who knows where my creativity will take me? </p> \n<hr> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <div class=\"picture\"> \n   <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18876-extinction-party\"></a> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"title\">\n   Extinction Party \n   <br> </br>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"author\">\n   by Jonathan Blaustein\n   <br> </br>\n  </div> \n  <div class=\"publisher\">\n   Publisher: Yoffy Press\n   <br>ISBN: 978-1-949608-10-6<br> </br></br>\n  </div> \n </div> \n <p><br> </br></p> \n <p><br> </br></p> \n <p><br> </br></p> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <p><br> </br></p> \n </div>\n <p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/sabine-pearlman-ammo\">AMMO</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-blakemore-the-stilled-gaze\">The Stilled Gaze</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-editors-photobooks-of-the-year-part-ii-24-personal-favorites\">Photobooks of the Year, Part II: 24 Personal Favorites</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/ernst-haas-ernst-haas-color-correction\">Ernst Haas: Color Correction</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/david-molina-the-human-apart-on-the-borders-of-hungary-and-serbia\">The Human Apart: On the Borders of Hungary and Serbia</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/alexa-becker-the-making-of-photobooks-insight-from-kehrer-verlag-s-acquisitions-editor\">The Making of Photobooks: Insight From Kehrer Verlag’s Acquisitions Editor</a></li>\n </ul>\n <section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n  <figure>\n   <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bad2accd-ce09-4118-9b87-6d4e9dbe78e3.jpg\" />\n   <figcaption>\n    My icicles\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n   <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/48cccb95-ce69-4414-9bf7-7778edd17c12.jpg\" />\n   <figcaption>\n    Don't worry everything is going to be OK?\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n   <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9de3cc8b-7605-4305-9811-e473e17788e6.jpg\" />\n   <figcaption>\n    My snowballs\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n   <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a0c87f8c-8506-40bd-a679-59a66d9b4f1e.jpg\" />\n   <figcaption>\n    No one's hands are clean\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n   <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d0366d73-0827-42fa-b58a-c336900e0fc6.jpg\" />\n   <figcaption>\n    Yellow mask and yellow plastic tablecloth\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n </section> \n</hr>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:46:23 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/48cccb95-ce69-4414-9bf7-7778edd17c12.jpg","linkMd5":"90d2166ba010156f945eeac7dedbd97d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-48-052_01160efe8e19d0cf.webp","destWidth":632,"destHeight":474,"sourceBytes":50801,"destBytes":20320,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/48cccb95-ce69-4414-9bf7-7778edd17c12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-48-052_01160efe8e19d0cf.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bad2accd-ce09-4118-9b87-6d4e9dbe78e3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-07-508_f95ec49ab989c16e.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/48cccb95-ce69-4414-9bf7-7778edd17c12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-56-405_cd7a353287fe3d0a.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9de3cc8b-7605-4305-9811-e473e17788e6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-06-371_800e96ac95384752.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a0c87f8c-8506-40bd-a679-59a66d9b4f1e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-03-425_59ba2a99ced1389b.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/d0366d73-0827-42fa-b58a-c336900e0fc6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-00-813_eac9875f1711ad86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066812},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Pseudologia","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rebecca-horne-pseudologia","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Pseudologia</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Rebecca Horne</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/aa3fdafa-b966-498d-848d-4bc18882793d.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Rebecca Horne arranges everyday objects into illusion-filled still lifes and tableaux, creating worlds of unexpected visual relationships.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>‘Pseudologia fantastica’ is a psychological term used to describe someone who weaves quasi-delusional tales into their own personal narrative. In many ways, it is an idea somewhat synonymous with art-making. Photo-based artist Rebecca Horne borrowed from this term for her upcoming publication, <em>Pseudologia, </em>which will accompany her exhibit, <em>Buried Intentions,</em> at Galerie Confluence in Nantes, France this fall. She explains, “I don’t actually think of an artist as a liar, so much as someone who makes things up and lives, at least part of the time, in an alternate reality of their own creation. I like that the <em>pseudo</em> can refer to the <em>almost</em> or <em>nearly</em> quality of the photos, which in this book are iterative, building on each other, and dependent on their relationships.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div> © Rebecca Horne\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rebecca-horne-pseudologia#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The images in this softcover artist book catalog the “mini-performances, temporary sculptures, and unscientific experiments” she stages for her camera. She explains, “I’m often chasing a singular image, one that perfectly describes an idea. However, I began to realize that the photographs I made on the way to making the standalone pictures felt more vibrant. So I started an exploration of these looser, more active images, organizing, shooting, and creating bridges between them. I welcomed the iteration over finality.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div> © Rebecca Horne\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rebecca-horne-pseudologia#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>These looser photographs explore iterations of shapes like a sphere, or its opposite: a hole. In the image <em>Lunar Calendar</em>, she cut paper and paper plates into the shapes of moon phases. She then arranges the pieces to reference a moon phase chart, drawing visual similarities between household objects and astronomical phenomena. The viewer immediately recognizes a paper plate as both itself and the moon, offering the photographic image as an analogy, rather than an indexical representation of reality. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div> © Rebecca Horne \n<p>By borrowing the visual language of scientific photography and re-presenting it within an impossible world of her own creation, Horne draws on photography’s assumed relationship to truth, playing with our inclination to believe what we see as a tool to shake our sense of reality. “My dad was an archaeologist, and I think that perhaps some of my impulses come from going on digs with him as a kid. I have noticed how anthropologists try to reconstruct a culture from the smallest fragments of evidence. It’s imperfect, and, at times, it seems like they’re making things up in order to recreate lost worlds. Nonetheless, those fragments are important,” she states. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Rebecca Horne\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rebecca-horne-pseudologia#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In <em>Pseudologia</em>, the slippages between the three-dimensional everyday objects pictured and the concepts they simulate on the two-dimensional photographic plane, suggests the world we experience comes as much from the inside-out as the outside-in. What we perceive in the physical world has its origin in the world of our imagination. </p> \n<p><em>Editor’s note: You can pre-order </em>Pseudologia<em> through Horne’s </em><a

Homayra Adiba captures the hushed, ephemeral moments of everyday life that unfold across the rooftops of Bangladesh’s city of Dhaka.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>Blue is a shape shifting, mood altering, atmospheric color. It can be filled with as much melancholia as nostalgia, as much serenity as ecstasy. In Homayra Adiba’s photographic series, </em>Where Blue Birds Fly<em>, a blue light suffuses the images, seeping into corners, illuminating quiet moments. </em> </p> \n<p><em>There is an essay in Rebecca Solnit’s book </em>A Field Guide To Getting Lost<em> entitled “</em>The Blue of Distance”<em>. It begins with the lines, “</em><em>The world is blue at its edges and in its depths. This blue is the light that got lost.” Adiba’s work is infused with this particular blue. A blue of longing for spaces, horizons, rooftops. It is a blue that speaks to separation, connection, and memory. The artist’s own connection to these rooftops touches each of these images, viewed from afar, asking questions about how we keep places within ourselves once we move away. </em> </p> \n<p><em>Plants grow, women gather, children fly kites, fireworks explode, life unfolds upon these spaces. Throughout the series we see the sprawl of the city, growing upwards and outwards. The rooftop then is perhaps a conduit to escape, an outdoor room to grow, a way to lay claim to a bit of sky. It is a space where past and present overlap, where the future can be felt in the sky opening up to possibility. In this interview for LensCulture, Magali Duzant speaks to Adiba about dipping into her childhood memories, life lived on the city of Dhaka’s rooftops and the thorny concept of ‘home’. </em> </p> \n<p><em></em> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong>Magali Duzant: As a starting point, I’m wondering how you found your way to photography? </strong> </p> \n<p>Homayra Adiba: I would like to think of myself as a storyteller. Photography happens to be one of those mediums I fell in love with. When I was little, one of my aunts gathered all the cousins in the living room. She gave us each a sheet of paper and asked us to write down what we wanted to be when we are older. I vividly remember that she read my paper loudly in front of the audience! Not because I wanted to be an astronaut but because I wrote: “If lord (Allah) wishes!”<br><br>Soon enough, I understood that my chances of becoming an astronaut were slim. If you are from Dhaka, being a doctor or an engineer is the only option you get from family. Anything else would turn you into a black sheep. I was a black sheep. I couldn’t set my mind for either of those. I wanted to be something else but l had no idea what! And then it was time to go to college. I went for a degree in graphic design and multimedia. My parents were not very happy about it. Honestly, I wasn’t sure either. But that path eventually led me to photography. </br></br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><br>I soon went to my parents to tell them I wanted to go for photography and that wasn’t easy. I had already dropped out of graphic design school. They had lost faith in me. But thank goodness for cinema, I could steal enough convincing dialogue to get them to let me transfer to a photography school! They had one condition. If I go for photography, I will be on my own. I took the challenge and applied to Pathshala South Asian Media Institute. I worked hard and got a scholarship there, which supported my education. Pathshala had opened a new world of photography for me, it was a proud transition in my life. </br></p> \n<p><strong>MD: Once you started photographing in earnest how did this body of work, <em>Where Blue Birds Fly,</em> begin?<br /></strong><br>HA: I always like to wander in the past, in memories. I like to live there. Everybody says you need to live for the future. But there I was, living in the past. Those days gave me hope to live for the future. </br></p> \n<p>This work started in my second year at Pathshala under the course of documentary. It was a weekly assignment about space. I thought to myself, ‘space’. That’s funny! Where the heck would I find a piece of space in Dhaka city? A city where on the public bus I had to tolerate the warm breath of my fellow passenger. Sometimes they would sleep on my shoulder! A city consisting of 18 million citizens! Is there really any space? I was thinking all of this on a late afternoon sitting on my rooftop. I thought, <em>oh well</em>. That’s a space. </p> \n<p>I started photographing rooftops. Initially it was just for that assignment. Those photographs were different than how the work turned out today. When the assignment was over, I kept taking pictures of different rooftops. Rooftops were bringing my childhood back. It was always so peaceful to end a hectic day on top of a rooftop; looking at the city, at the sunset, as the birds returned to their nests. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MD: When your work was first brought to my attention I was captivated by the color you use. The tinge of the photographs feels almost as if we are viewing these images through the fog of memory, there is a blue light that feels both familiar and otherworldly. Can you talk about the palette of your photographs and how it might connect to greater themes in the work?</strong> </p> \n<p>HA: Over time, <em>Where Blue Birds Fly</em> directed me towards many narratives, multiple meanings, and observations. But truly it’s a work where I relived my memories. I grew up in a joint family. A red old building in Dhaka where my cousins and I grew up. The rooftop was the place where we met. Even today, all the memories are as alive as if I were still 10 years old. Plabon (one of my cousins) used to play detective, he would spend hours trying to find out how that piece of pearl ended up on the rooftop. My uncle gave me lessons about trees and how they function there. My uncle, mejho mama, is a poet. He used to play flute on the rooftop. Till this day, that melody tinkles in my ears when I watch the city from a rooftop! I never heard anything like that after he became paralyzed. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>One afternoon, he was very upset—one mango tree wasn’t producing any fruit for a couple of years; that mango tree was big for a rooftop tree. He worked so hard on it. I went to the tree and started scratching it, beating it, asking for mangos! I was mad, because uncle was dear to me. Uncle later sat me down and informed me about trees having life, emotions. He taught me about the scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose who was also Bengali and who used his own invention, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescograph\">Cresco graph</a> to measure plant response to different stimulation and thereby scientifically proved parallelism between animal and plants. </p> \n<p>He told me: “You have to be patient, for we don’t know when nature will take its place.” He asked me to apologize to the tree. I went and asked for forgiveness. You see, I learned trees had life on top of a rooftop. A year later, there were mangoes on that tree. My cousins and I would fly kites, count stars, sing a song there. When it rained, my mother and I would go there, and it’s a little cinematic, but we actually used to sing while being washed by raindrops! </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MD: Can you tell me a bit more about the specific rooftops you visited?</strong><br><br>HA: Our apartment was on the top floor, the rooftop had a garden planted by my father. He had a lot of pigeons; they would circle above the building before sunset. My father used to sit there, watching them, letting the day pass. The rooftop was a ritual, a place we city kids used to plan our picnics,where we would all meet when there was a power cut. I knew each person in my family a little intimately there. I watched crows schooling from my rooftop. I received my first love letter, from a strange teenage boy from the next building, on the rooftop. As if under the sky you become more open. When you can look down at the city, you want to slow down and rest. Even on my friend’s rooftop, we made many memories. You can just go there and sit you know? For however long you want. </br></br></p> \n<p>As it turns out, every rooftop had its own story—even the abandoned one. It told me about those people who don’t visit. The rooftops of office buildings were funny; so abandoned that it seems no one ever stepped foot there. Like, the moon landing! As if I was the first. In three years, I have been to many rooftops in Dhaka city. As a photographer, I even noticed that if you show up, randomly and ask for an entrance, people do welcome you to their rooftop! They would start conversations, little things to introduce their very own place. “See, from here you can see the new flyover or from here you can see the Mosque. You should come during this time to watch the fireworks!” Some of the old buildings were made in a way, where if you wanted to get to the rooftop you had to make your way through their bedrooms; those are the best kinds. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MD: Did you usually shoot at the same time of day?</strong><br><br>HA: I wanted to keep this feeling of nostalgia in my images. Most of them are taken in the evening, before sunset. That’s usually the time you would find me playing on my rooftop back in the 90s. I don’t know why exactly, but till this day I feel melancholic when the day is coming to an end. That time of the day when the sun is setting, everyone is heading towards home… even the crows go back to their nests. I feel both sadness and relief. Another day ends, tomorrow will be a new day. </br></br></p> \n<p>Like my childhood, the ‘rooftop generation’ is fading. The city is growing fast, now we have more high-rise apartments and less time to spare. In a three year span of working on this project, I could vividly feel how some kids in Dhaka city had never spent a moment on their rooftop. How they might not have a hint of how to improvise a polyethylene bag and turn it into a balloon when you are bored! Do teenage boys still pass small letters to the girls next door and secretly meet on the rooftop? </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MD: There is a lovely social aspect to the images—you are meeting neighbors, discovering other’s personal spaces, a communal feeling through image making emerges. In your biography you write about the idea of home being rooted in your photography and you mention that you moved to Michigan in 2016.Has this transition made its way into your imagery? </strong><br><br>HA: When I started working on my documentaries, I thought I had all the ideas one needs about home. For me, home was there. Where my land is, where my family is, where my friends are. Little did I know that ‘home’ might bring a different meaning to my life! A meaning, that seemed absurd in the beginning, and for a long time after. I was very determined, when I moved to the USA, that soon enough I would come back to my land, my home. And I did, within two months of moving, I actually came back to Dhaka. But home wasn’t there anymore. The city was the same, but someone else was waiting for their family on the top floor of that red old building. My family was in Michigan. And my friends were all busy. <br><br>It’s a strange feeling, when you are in a different land, the weather is different, the people are, the language is, the roads, even the trees! And you are not really a tourist there. I felt like a tropical tree in Michigan… with no roots. Displaced. I am not from here. I don’t have a clue! How is it to be someone from here? Never in my life had I felt so alien. But once I returned back to Dhaka, I felt the same. Disconnected. As if, there wasn’t a little bit of home left for the city to offer me. I became, what I felt at that time, homeless. </br></br></br></br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>It felt like forever that, as a storyteller, I had lost my story. No place to call home. No past to wander around. Sure, I had a present, but no clue what I was supposed to do with it. Not that I had plans of moving to a different country! So I really had no idea what I could do here. My family, including myself, had to survive here first. The first couple years were just working at a minimum wage job, paying rent and for what? I felt trapped really. Broken and lost. In those times of misery I would look at snow and think, how mesmerizing! Would you give up everything to watch a snowy night? I tried being friends with the trees here. Like my uncle taught me. And they did help me. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From the series “Where Blue Birds Fly” © Homayra Adiba\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/homayra-adiba-where-blue-birds-fly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>MD: Do you see or feel a difference in your work or working methods? </strong> </p> \n<p>HA: The more I try to understand the definition of ‘home’, and the new meaning it offers me, I am not sure if I like any of them but they are all true. I even googled the definition of ‘home’: “A place where one lives permanently, especially as a member of a family.”<br><br>A year back, I realized I know one or two things about this place. I know one or two people. I have one or two memories. I have taken one or two pictures. I have learned one or two new things here. </br></br></p> \n<p>For now, this may be home. I live in a not so busy but not so quiet area in Michigan. I like it here. The neighbors are nice, the geese are a little aggressive… deer here are dear and squirrels are always asking for more food! The kids do play outside still. Everyone loves a sunny day and no one likes the snow. These are the things I take pictures of. In the transition, when my family and I had to survive first, I didn’t always have the opportunity to take pictures. But this lack of opportunity made my mind explore different media. Linocut and print and recycled paper making are two of those I am practicing beside photography recently. </p> \n<p>My way of working has changed from photography and text to mixed media. I am still experimenting with all these resources and I’m spending time with my ongoing stories to understand what does it mean and how does it feel to exist? </p>\n<p>Enjoy more great

Paglen’s recent installation of some 30,000 color photographs in the Barbican’s Curve Gallery, <i>From ‘Apple’ to ‘Anomaly’</i>, took its cue from René Magritte’s 1964 painting <i>Ceci</i> <i>n’est pas une pomme</i>, which dismantled the assumed relation between word, image and thing. Magritte’s awareness of the arbitrary nature of the sign has currency in light of the ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) machines are now trained to ‘see’ the world.<br> </br></p> \n<blockquote>\n We began with the relative innocence of descriptive labels and images—“apple”, “apple tree”, “fruit”— but soon the categories and images identified with them demonstrated the more insidious side of this process— “alcoholic”, “debtor”, “drug addict”, “homeless”, “racist”. \n</blockquote> \n<p>Set apart from the mass of photographs and displayed on its own wall, Paglen presented a framed reproduction of Magritte’s painting as it would be labelled for AI networks, with bounding box annotations identifying what is represented within the picture — “a large white sign”, “black and white sign”, “a large green leaf”, “red and green apple”. Here, the process of labelling in its dumb literality remains blind to the joke of the painting itself and a pointer to the inherent problems of AI vision that we were shown through the spectacle of photographs arrayed along the Barbican’s curved wall. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>The Treachery of Object Recognition, 2019 © Trevor Paglen, Courtesy of the Artist, Metro Pictures, New York, Altman Siegel, San Francisco \n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/trevor-paglen-from-apple-to-anomaly#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The photographs are taken from ImageNet, a database with currently more than 14 million images and over 21,000 categories and one of the main sources for training AI machine-learning technologies to facially recognize people and things. AI networks are taught to see the world as a result of being fed vast amounts of visual information sorted into various groupings known as “training sets”. The point of Paglen’s installation was to show us the mendacity at the heart of technological developments — the dominant value systems that get encoded within them. Nouns are not always neutral or innocent, images are treacherous, and how we identify images and things contains inherent prejudices and value judgments. We began with the relative innocence of descriptive labels and images—“apple”, “apple tree”, “fruit”— but soon the categories and images identified with them demonstrated the more insidious side of this process— “alcoholic”, “debtor”, “drug addict”, “homeless”, “racist”. The final category “anomaly” included people, many in disguise, masked and in costumes, their identity and classification uncertain. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Trevor Paglen: From ‘Apple’ to ‘Anomaly’ Installation view, The Curve, Barbican, 26 September 2019 – 16 February 2020 © Tim P.

In contrast, here we dwell with people’s social media images, the aesthetic of on-line vernacular photography, uncopyrighted populist images that ImageNet scraped from Google, Flickr, Facebook and Bing. </p> \n<p>Paglen showed us images that have been unethically appropriated and used without the permission of those who took them. The work, then, also raises issues about the loss of privacy and control of images posted on line. These images are not hidden or secret, they are common, testimony to how much of the life-world we now photograph— crazy, dizzying clusters and swarms of images, an absurdist visual encyclopedia, ranging from pictures of the sun, sky, dust storms, spy satellites (a clear in-joke), to spam (tins of), false teeth, pizza and banana boats. We know these images, they are not unfamiliar, in many ways they are numbingly banal. The point is however we are not meant to see them like this. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Trevor Paglen: From ‘Apple’ to ‘Anomaly’ Installation view, The Curve, Barbican, 26 September 2019 – 16 February 2020 © Tim P.

And the problem arises when it is pictures of people that are labelled and classified, when assumptions are made about how they look and their behavior. But while Paglen’s spectacular display alerted us to the problems in the process of developing AI training, it still remained silent about an important human dimension and paradox integral to ImageNet—AI machine vision is based on the intensive labor of piecemeal online workers looking at and tagging images. ImageNet’s current database required fifty thousand low-paid workers, all employed using Amazon’s crowdsourcing labor platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk. </p> \n<p>— Mark Durden </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Trevor Paglen: From ‘Apple’ to ‘Anomaly’ Installation view, The Curve, Barbican, 26 September 2019 – 16 February 2020 © Tim P.

narrative.</figcaption></figure><p><em>“See Naples and die.” </em><br>— Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, Italian Journey, 1786.\n</p>\n<p>During the golden age of Spanish Bourbon rule, Naples was considered one of the most opulent and enchanting cities in the world. Many found it impossible to leave, only doing so upon dying.\n</p>\n<p>In a modern context, the phrase may be read as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the over-documented gang violence of the city. While outsiders may associate the phrase with the presence of the Camorra and glamorize the idea of violence and organized crime, they understand it solely through the lens of TV and film. To me, “See Naples and Die” bears a much more complex reading.\n</p>\n<blockquote>Over a year I was guided by the locals into the heart of this multi-layered city where eccentricity thrives, flamboyant clothing is paired with machismo, and gender politics is the opposite of the expected.\n</blockquote>\n<p>My project focuses on four of central Naples’ historically rich and contemporarily volatile areas – Forcella, Quartieri Spagnoli, Rione Sanità and Santa Lucia. Over a year I was guided by the locals into the heart of this multi-layered city where eccentricity thrives, flamboyant clothing is paired with machismo, and gender politics is the opposite of the expected. Here, where others seek easily identifiable caricatures such as ‘the brute boss’, I saw people filled with contradiction and the troubles and joys of everyday life.\n</p>\n<p>I was invited to share glimpses of their private lives, slowly coming to understand that to see Naples entirely would actually take a lifetime, perhaps giving new meaning to the phrase “See Naples and Die”. This project scratched the surface of my experiences and in many ways is the beginning of an on-going investigation into one of the world’s most vibrant and mysterious cities.\n</p>\n<p>— Sam Gregg\n</p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This project was selected as a Juror’s Pick for the <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/2020-lensculture-portrait-award-winners\">LensCulture Portrait Awards 2020</a>.

Investigating self-portraiture, I ask viewers to consider their own responses to queerness as they see it. By utilizing my own identity and queer experience, I hope to engage the viewer in an unfamiliar set of circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>The photos ask: Can we live comfortably outside the norm? How do these characters challenge societal ideas of masculinity?\n</p>\n<p>Driven by emotion and intuition, I produce a melodrama that reflects ideas of visibility, and invisibility, what is

the conservative conventions of schooling in Poland, Karolina Wojtas has given a carte blanche to her inner child, resulting in an explosion of mess, materials and experimentation.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>While attending art school is seen as a rite of passage for artists working across all mediums, a common experience amongst art students is the feeling of limitation and lack of inspiration that the four walls of a classroom impose. Priority and praise is more often given to artists creating serious work built on classical themes, rather than peculiar, messy projects that lack boundaries and cohesion.</em><br> </br></p> \n<p><em>Against the odds, Karolina Wojtas has managed to transform her own experience of feeling stifled at school into a rebellious practice. The artist is no stranger to experimentation and pushing the limits of what we consider photography. Each of her images and exhibitions are built upon a foundation of impulse and chaos, perhaps better representing a genuine thought process than the clean limitations we see in traditional methods. Her series </em>abzgram <em>is a direct commentary on her educational experience, and in her project </em>We Can’t Live Without Each Other<em>, she speaks to the peculiar inner lives of siblings, and the tension that exists in the lifelong dynamic with her next of kin.</em> </p> \n<p><em>In this interview for LensCulture, <em>Wojtas</em> speaks to Cat Lachowskyj about the limitations of arts education, her creative process, and why she thinks it’s important to find beauty in the ugly and banal.</em> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Abzgram” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>Cat Lachowskyj: When you started exploring your creativity, were you drawn to other mediums and forms, or were you always interested in photography? </strong> </p> \n<p>Karolina Wojtas: I decided that I wanted to be a photographer when I was 12 years old! To learn about art, I had to attend a specialized high school and gymnasium in my city, where we also learned how to work with other mediums like painting and sculpture. But yes, I have to say that I was always primarily focused on photography, and I hated learning about other techniques and mediums. That might have had more to do with the teachers—they didn’t give us any freedom, and they wanted us to conform to their own vision of art. </p> \n<p>Now, I try breaking the rules of straight photography by incorporating as many other mediums as I can. When it comes to photography, I’ve always done whatever I want, but when I revert back to something like painting, I still feel that sense of fear that I had during my time at art school. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Abzgram” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CL: That’s sad to hear about education, especially for someone so young. I think that when we create things when we are younger, the beauty of those creations is that they don’t possess boundaries. Instead, we make things for the sake of making them, and that approach is still very present in your work. It’s probably why so many people are drawn to it: you create in ways that adults wish they still could, before they learned the rules. Tell me about your own mental state when you start making a project. What are the guidelines you give yourself, and how much planning is involved? How do you know when to start and stop?</strong> </p> \n<p>KW: Oh, I never know when it’s time to stop! None of my work is officially finished, because I’m always thinking about new photographs or objects that I need to create for an exhibition. I always try to prepare something new and different. Because of that, I don’t put my images in expensive frames. I prefer to create more temporary forms that I can modify. All of my projects are inspired by my surroundings—usually a banal thing that I see or experience each day. I photograph first, then read books, then photograph again. Once I have some images, I start reading more focused articles and sociology books to help me find other points of view. I also mix staged images with documents. </p> \n<p>That said, the most important thing is that I never stop working, and try not to think so much about those first steps. I always try to remain as present as possible. I don’t think I ever grew up from my childish approach—maybe my younger brother helped me with that. I am more childish than him. During family gatherings, I always sit with the children. They’re my best friends. They have these relentless, crazy ideas. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “We can’t live without each other” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CL: Aside from that early experience, how has your subsequent arts education affected your work?</strong> </p> \n<p>KW: At school, you’re taught to work on a single project, and it needs to be very serious. It’s very easy to feel afraid and feel blocked. At my school, there were some teachers who didn’t understand my work at all. Sometimes, I would start making work the way they wanted me to, but over time I realized that this way of working wasn’t for me. I started showing my own spontaneous work more and more, but the reaction wasn’t pleasant. I hope arts education continues to change, and that schools are equipped with more understanding lecturers. The most important people for me in art school were my peers—we created, cooked and spent so much time together. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “We can’t live without each other” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CL: In that same vein, <em>abzgram</em> is an interesting interpretation of the rigidity of education systems. You clearly drew from a repository of inspiration for the project, but when did you realize you wanted to make a photography project about these issues?</strong> </p> \n<p>KW: At some point, the Polish government decided to change the education system, and wanted to close down the gymnasium where I had taken art lessons as a child. They started reorganizing schools in my town, and decided to turn the gymnasium into a nursery. </p> \n<p>This irritated me, so I started doing research about the changes. Since my brother was in primary school, the changes hit close to home. And since things were changing so rapidly, many people were negatively affected. The school wasn’t prepared for the switch, affecting both the young students and teachers, who striked for almost three weeks. Schools were closed, and exams were executed in very strange ways. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Abzgram” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>So, it was—and still is—a strange time for education. Especially now with the pandemic, school is a nightmare. Teachers send a ton of homework to students and perform strange video-exams to prohibit cheating. TV at school used to be fun, but now the most boring, horrible, hellish version of school is viewed on our screens. </p> \n<p><strong>CL: Which of your personal experiences shaped the inspiration for the project? Do you have any specific memories that have gone into your work?</strong> </p> \n<p>KW: Themes surrounding schools have been on my mind for a long time. I hated high school, and the only nice thing about it was that I started photographing everything there: horribly messy rooms, strange places, and my friends at parties or having fun in the classroom. I always felt misunderstood throughout the education process, but I never had a definitive idea about what was wrong. The teachers were meant to be treated like God—like they could do anything. And the children were only meant to listen and be kind. </p> \n<p>I have lots of bad memories from school in Poland: teachers saying I was the worst writer, that they had never seen someone write as terribly as me. Now, I hate writing. It takes me days to force myself to answer an email. School is so important, because children spend so much of their time there, and teachers can very easily kill their freedom and creativity. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “We can’t live without each other” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Similarly, groups of teenagers all start looking the same: the same shoes, the same shirts. School eliminates their creative thinking, and forces them to align with what the authors of books are perpetuating—not what they personally think or feel. Students who are able to quickly learn how to achieve good grades do so as a means of survival. They figure out which teacher never checks homework, or who they know will give a surprise exam. That information helps them pretend to be subordinate, which makes school a factory for producing a new mass of stupid citizens. The government creates a core curriculum, and sometimes schools feel like prisons—there are bars in the windows and doors. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Abzgram” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CL: On top of the general visual chaos in your work, there’s an underlying tension coursing through your images. You often focus on subject matter that’s considered gross or ugly. Why are you drawn to this subject matter? </strong> </p> \n<p>KW: I live in a town where a Colosseum and pyramid were built! It’s so kitschy—we pretend we are rich, but the way we project that never looks good. I grew up in a time when it was fashionable to have glitter in your hair, wear frills, and own a red or green bag with matching shoes. This was the best outfit for formal occasions! I grew up around ugly things, but on the other hand, there is beauty in that ugliness. I love collecting strange materials, as well as bags and shoes. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “We can’t live without each other” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CL: Your younger brother seems to feature in your work a lot. In your series <em>We Can’t Live Without Each Other</em>, you take your viewers on a visceral journey through the unconditional love and tension that exists in sibling relationships. How did you approach making these visuals? Were there specific moments that inspired certain images?</strong><br> </br></p> \n<p>KW: I was an only child until I was 13 years old. Any time my parents asked me if I wanted siblings, I responded with something like, “I will find an axe, kill the kid and eat them.” But one day, my brother appeared, and our war with each other began. </p> \n<p>I use him as a model throughout this project, but in the past I always used to paint him blue, or put a sausage on his face. Last summer, while creating work for the Unseen ING Talent Award, I had to create a new project around the theme ‘Nature of Change.’ Our mentor was Adam Broomberg, and over a number of meetings, each of the artists discussed their projects. I thought about doing something with my brother, and remembered that when I was younger, I never wanted siblings. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled, from the series “Abzgram” © Karolina Wojtas\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/karolina-wojtas-making-a-mess#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Drawing from those memories, I began creating weird and scary torture scenarios. I found a ton of posts on the Internet made by children looking for advice on how to scare or harm their brothers and sisters. Sibling relationships are so strange—they are your closest family members, but are also sometimes your worst enemies, fighting over the love of your parents. But not to scare anyone: all of the images were staged. And I have an excellent relationship with my brother! </p> \n<p><strong>CL: How did this project inspire your subsequent work? What are you working on now? </strong> </p> \n<p>KW: Me and some friends resurrected our student gallery in the Lodz Film School’s dormitory. Because we are in quarantine, we host <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/palarniasztuki/\">one-day residencies</a> with different artists on Instagram. Right now we are focused on photography, but over time we will definitely be mixing mediums and techniques. I have to say, during this strange time, I’ve tried to make something, but most of the time I start and cannot finish. </p> \n<hr> \n <p><br><br> </br></br></p> \n <p><br><br> </br></br></p>\n

I found myself on a slippery road in a country reeling under apartheid and it made sense to me to communicate stories using my camera instead. I also wanted to further my education in art and architecture. So, leaving behind a part of my soul, I departed to Italy in 1972. </p> \n<p>Why Africa? I am always asked that, but it’s impossible to put it in a nutshell: it’s such a complicated, raw and beautiful fact, born of circumstance. My roots were in what was then South West Africa (today’s Namibia). For years I had yearned to return to the continent, and I did—when freedom permitted—over the next thirty years. I travelled its length and breadth in search of what was at the heart of my being: art and symbolism, building and shelter… the woman’s domain. As a photographer, and a white woman at that, I found surprising welcome and acceptance. My survival tools helped me overcome the fundamental hardships of travelling into remote areas, of hunger, and of the meaninglessness concept of time. I found hope amidst much hopelessness. But above all, I learned to bond with people, place and predicament. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Leopard.

Looking at the images from your other works, and then turning to your book, I see some sort of an aesthetic departure into another realm; they look and feel different. Can you talk a little about these differences? Were they intentional?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: Yes, <em>Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain </em>is a departure from my earlier work. Firstly, I stopped taking (analog) photographs altogether. After the publication of my last book in the trilogy on the art of African women, I dedicated ten years to promoting women’s art through exhibitions and returning to the Ndebele community in the new South Africa to build a training centre for women and the youth. In 2009, I decided to return permanently to Namibia, where I was born. I was shocked to find a country—after twenty years of independence—still shackled to the remnants of apartheid and the ongoing struggles of poverty, greed, an environment in crisis, and the advance of transnational mining giants. </p> \n<p>I traded in my analog cameras and bought my first digital Sony X100 with one fixed lens. I wanted to embrace social portraiture and the appallingly hostile landscape in a way that was ‘different’ to my previous work. This new work investigated the closeness between people and the space they occupied. After making friends and winning the trust of the people who live in this challenging part of the world, I used the 35mm lens that allowed me to incorporate them <em>into</em> the landscape, with its unparalleled light, to produce a synthesis of what was there. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Crushed Hopes In an attempt to flag down a tourist vehicle, Alexandrine Hanabis, reaches out.

How does one manage both mentally and physically within such difficult conditions—specifically as you were recovering from a life-threatening illness, as revealed in the foreword of your book? Did the conditions limit the project at all?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: The diagnosis of cancer hit me like a ton of bricks, as it would anyone. The desert of my childhood, known to me as a place of healing, became my direction, my compass. In between chemotherapy cycles, I made brief sorties that gradually lengthened as I became stronger and more determined to bring to light the hostile conditions of this land. I did not know that we would be facing a six-year drought. There were times I had to cut short a journey for lack of water or because I’d seen enough carcasses strewn across the desert floor. </p> \n<p>I have seldom felt limited by conditions, either physically or mentally. My sense of purpose—and to some degree obstinacy—is the energy that drives me. Knowledge of the land and the potential to communicate and embrace friendships on many layers are forces that creativity alone cannot achieve. Key to this is taking time; not days or weeks, but months and years. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Noah’s Ark in a Sandstorm.

He was always deeply concerned about my journeys into an ‘unknown’ Africa, alone, white and challenged beyond my wits. We corresponded on photography, about being in the world and bringing back some fragments of it, and about desperate situations that mirrored my own existential struggles. We exchanged ideas on techniques and print-making, and challenged each other on the role of photography in the unravelling of apartheid. At times our paths diverged and I became more overtly politically active while David was documenting the Christian hypocrisy of apartheid South Africa in images of the Dutch Reformed church. But it was during this past decade that he became both my most ardent critic as well as a compassionate admirer of my work. I am grateful and privileged to have been able to draw courage, discipline and integrity from our long friendship. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Nara melons (Acanthosicyos horridus), an essential food source for the Topnaar (ǂAonin) people, are endemic to the Namib Desert.

Can you tell me about your working process?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: My earlier books were produced by large publishing houses at a time before digital photography. Book designers were hired or in-house. I was very fortunate that Massimo Vignelli, a noted book designer of his time, agreed to take on the challenge of scrutinising thousands of transparencies over a lightbox. He set out to capture the sequencing and essence of each image using a now famous pencil! All my books were proofed, printed and shipped between the USA, Japan and Southeast Asia. </p> \n<p>This is a far cry from the methods or ‘procedures’ used today, and particularly by Gerhard Steidl, my publisher on <em>Cry Sadness into the Coming Rain.</em> Steidl—publisher, printer and ‘navigator’—allows visual artists, curators and museums to become personally involved in the process of book creation. David, who was also working in Steidl’s library at the time, joined the teamwork on sequencing. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Menete Hȗsas with her dog Penduka (Herero for “wake up”).

As we progress, their presence becomes more evident, especially when we are moving into the DRC (Displaced Refugee Camp) section of the book. Can you tell me more about these sequencing decisions?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: Having returned to the country after a long absence, I needed to <em>feel </em>my way around gradually. It made sense to start in my backyard, to become acquainted with my local community and immediate environment. It was also important to establish the acceptance (or otherwise) of a concerned white woman with a camera, however unobtrusive. Over the course of many months and spanning several years, I accompanied women and children from their impermanent shelters to their workplace—which, for many, was a drudge to the town garbage dump in search of food, firewood and building materials. Gradually, I followed them inland to their places of birth to understand why they had chosen to migrate to an urban area. </p> \n<p>So the book begins with the landscape, and slowly the remnants of former habitats alongside once productive land as well as places now littered with ‘No Entry’ mining boards and dysfunctional water points. My journey extends into the seeming nothingness, where real lives exist on the fringes, and it follows my connection to place and its unfolding narrative, until I return to my neighborhood and backyard. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Experimental plot for the assessment of grass types and measurement of rainfall.

How have your personal histories, family stories and experiences moulded you as a person and a photographer?</strong><br> </br></p> \n<p>MCC: My ‘African-ness’ is at the heart of my inspiration. I was fortunate to have parents who encouraged my love for art. But it was my childhood experience of growing up on a farm that taught me both survival and the importance of storytelling. These elements are fundamental to who I am and what I have done with my life. Finding photography in my late teens allowed me to travel into remote places and find my voice. </p> \n<p>In my current work on the people of the Kalahari Desert, my grandfather’s photographic archive of his journeys into the interior of this country during the late 1920s and 1930s has played an important role. </p> \n<p><strong>NJK: Although you are photographing your home, there are vast social differences between photographer and subject. How do you overcome such obstacles to gain trust and provide images that are not, might I dare say, exploitative? Did you encounter any opposition?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: As I have said before, what is important is to make time to develop a rapport. This is a social process, an ongoing relational conversation, of knowing how to interact with land and its people, to observe without provoking. Opposition was seldom encountered. I do believe that, as a woman, people feel less ‘threatened’ by my presence. Also, Namibia is currently locked into a desperate time in our history, born of injustices in the past and exacerbated by a six-year drought and government indifference. A vast majority of people are anxiously in search of a ‘listener’. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Talita Witbooi, shepherdess.

How do you hope your images function?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: Over thirty years a lot has changed. Initially, I found photography to be a sensitive subject. After years of exploitation and the ‘immortalizing’ of the spirit, Africans often rejected the visual portrayal of their lives as seen through the eyes of European values. In Muslim countries, I entered an Africa that I could not identify with, where women were veiled and housebound and photography was not permitted without the consent of husbands. Time and bonding became central to my experience. As Maya Angelou once said to me, “You can only do your best, until you know better… brace yourself for humiliation.” The art I was in search of had little to do with the harsh realities of day-to-day living, with wars and disease, or grinding socio-political and economic conditions; instead, it was about how women sought to assert their identities and beautify their space. </p> \n<p>In <em>Cry Sadness into the Coming</em> <em>Rain</em> my focus changed. It is my hope to take viewers to familiar places, and ask them to question their perception of those places within the ‘New Namibia’, an unparalleled country that is being sold off to mining magnates and unsustainable tourism—never mind corrupt individuals and international consortia. For this reason, I have turned my lens on the aspirations of the poor, their quest for shelter and water in a ravaged land, and the environment in crisis. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Ashanti Gaises, born and raised in Khorixas, has moved south with her baby in search of work.

Can you describe the experience and the commonalities, if any, between your two mediums?</strong> </p> \n<p>MCC: Maya Angelou and I did not meet by chance. Maya’s first five biographies were part and parcel of my ‘survival’ baggage throughout my travels in West Africa. By then she had returned to America. Her writings would offer me courage, first of all, and then wisdom and humour, strength and dreams, passion and endurance, poetry and ideas. Her books were the ideal companion (and consolation), for they told me that someone else had survived the pain, loneliness and the hardships of being in a ‘foreign’ land. And I drew strength from them because Maya was strong and fearless. </p> \n<p>What Maya and I had in common was that neither of us was what we seemed; this is a partial explanation of our attraction. Born and bred in Africa, I had dedicated most of my life to documenting Africa’s people and art. Maya appeared to be African, but was born in America. Our differences brought us together. She invited me to her home and asked to write the foreword to <em>African Canvas</em>. It was a meeting of minds, perhaps a cross-fertilization of African-Americanness. She would tell me, “I am who I am because you are who you are.” </p> \n<p><strong>NJK: What do you think governments should be doing to protect the people and the land? Have you seen any changes for the better? And what, in your opinion, prevents positive change?</strong><br> </br></p> \n<p>MCC: Thirty years after independence, the struggle for the majority of Namibians is still to subsist—and, often, even to merely exist—on the very land they fought for. According to the government website, twenty-five per cent of Namibia’s two million people live a basic life in informal settlements, in rudimentary shelters and shacks, without the security of ownership. In a supposedly wealthy country, thousands of Namibian families live on patches of desolate and overgrazed land where survival depends on a drop of rain that may or may not fall. </p> \n<p>What prevents positive change is a stifling economy, greed, a lack of accountability for eroding corruption, illiteracy, the retarded allocation of land rights, all bearing deep consequences for the underprivileged, the jobless. In other words, a sincere economic liberation needs to follow its political counterpart. So, in my opinion and experience, I have seen very few changes for the better since independence. </p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/mana-mana-beyond-belief\">MANA - Beyond Belief</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/laetitia-vancon-at-the-end-of-the-day-aig-deireadh-an-latha\">At the End of the Day—“Aig deireadh an latha”</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vasantha-yogananthan-love-family-brotherhood-ancient-themes-in-contemporary-india\">Love, Family, Brotherhood: Ancient Themes in Contemporary India</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lucy-conticello-the-editorial-portrait\">The Editorial Portrait</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-design-announcing-the-winners-amp-finalists-lensculture-portrait-awards-2015\">Announcing the Winners &amp;amp; Finalists – LensCulture Portrait Awards 2015</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/adam-panczuk-actors\">Actors</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/168e7035-24b1-4b51-842e-2aab2cf8be8a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/afa29cf6-c2b4-48d9-be89-a53e5315f14f.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9775458c-b551-4148-bb68-d5664073cc89.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1d0445e1-6776-4e4d-b9b4-eade0a50086a.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/46ae30a7-02d5-4666-97b0-73cb84d2169c.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4da74f29-2f6a-4202-885a-849a30fbf3aa.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ead6895a-92a3-48e2-98f9-f2d592ef5b64.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 04 May 2020 10:04:21 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/afa29cf6-c2b4-48d9-be89-a53e5315f14f.jpg","linkMd5":"a1b9e7b71340804a1dea10769ebdf574","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-47-615_2d6e1aadba739c2a.webp","destWidth":750,"destHeight":1334,"sourceBytes":258447,"destBytes":192600,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/afa29cf6-c2b4-48d9-be89-a53e5315f14f.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-47-615_2d6e1aadba739c2a.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/168e7035-24b1-4b51-842e-2aab2cf8be8a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-07-994_c6090d7b1368aec7.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/afa29cf6-c2b4-48d9-be89-a53e5315f14f.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn40@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-54-404_48688d66ed8c08f5.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9775458c-b551-4148-bb68-d5664073cc89.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-57-509_6cb614ab79293ac8.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1d0445e1-6776-4e4d-b9b4-eade0a50086a.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-07-576_34a96f42fee8702b.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/46ae30a7-02d5-4666-97b0-73cb84d2169c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-00-154_39e1b68b11367eae.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/4da74f29-2f6a-4202-885a-849a30fbf3aa.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn48@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-06-843_6df14c8d0a4da38f.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ead6895a-92a3-48e2-98f9-f2d592ef5b64.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-59-398_718c358f5e8c5e37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066819},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Bluid and Sweat","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Bluid and Sweat</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Stacey Tyrell</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/d3011b7f-0145-4003-98f9-24c4663cdf94.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  In her meticulously-staged portraits, Stacey Tyrell explores race and identity, drawing on her own family’s histories of immigration to probe overarching structures of colonialism, white supremacy and capitalism.&nbsp;\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>Stacey Tyrell’s work draws from her own family’s histories of immigration.

The word means an article of movable property, and it also means ‘slave’. You’ve noted that “nearly every aspect of the island, its structures and people have at some point been chattels”. The way the title situates the images, especially the portraits, really hits home the horror of people classed as objects. Can you tell me about the photographs of broken-down farm machinery and the empty shells of buildings?</strong> </p> \n<p>Stacy Tyrell: The machinery and buildings that you mention are the ruins of the centuries-old sugar trade that was the main industry on the island. Almost all of the mechanical parts used to process sugar cane were imported from England and Scotland beginning in the late 18th century as the industrial revolution took hold, allowing plantation owners to harness the power of steam to speed up production. The buildings are a lot older and are what is left of the windmills that were used, along with animals and humans, to power the machinery. It’s also interesting that the entire trade created a captive closed market for goods manufactured in Europe. </p> \n<p>That history permeates our everyday lives in so many ways we are unaware of. The products, and the money that was generated, fed Western economies and set the ground for the democracies and wealth that we all live in now. The fact that we all still use sugar, silk or tea or any of these products, just on a quotidian level, shows that it’s all around us. But then there are the deeper ways in which, even to this day, certain laws are structured for certain people. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Nevis Pond Hill Kitchen, from the series ‘Chattel’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CS: The project traces the hidden, widespread consequences of these histories. Where do you see these histories of slavery and colonialism haunting our world today?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: Entire towns and families were transformed. In Nevis, there is a family called the Pinneys, who owned a lot of land—there’s even a beach and resort named after them. But what you don’t see is the huge scale of their effect on the other side of the ocean. In Bristol, England, there’s a historical mansion called the Georgian House that is the end result of all of the blood and sweat of my ancestors in Nevis that afforded this family a certain lifestyle, and created the infrastructure that made that man a member of British high society. </p> \n<p>I still have a lot of relatives in the UK, and the Windrush experience is still a very sore spot. A lot of the beautiful buildings there wouldn’t exist if it were not for that money rushing in from the colonies, and many people are now in public life that would not have that status if not for those profits. And the people that created that wealth are still oppressed to this day. There are tentacles of slavery’s history all over—across all the continents. There’s a lot missing in the Western conversation on it, such as Spain and Latin America’s role. The vast majority of Africans were brought to South America and Mexico. They helped building this huge system of colonialism. </p> \n<p><strong>CS: You are constantly collecting images, objects and data. Sometimes these have directly become a series, like <em>Great White Hope</em>, but more often it’s background work that leads to producing a series, or even just one image. The term ‘research-based practice’ is popular right now. I’m not sure if you identify with that label, but can you speak about the importance of research for you and how you started working this way?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: Well, it started with wanting to find out more about my mother before I knew her—she was a child of the Windrush generation—and wanting to know the many layers of that story. That was the seed that this way of working blossomed around. </p> \n<p>In relation to that term, yes I do, but at the same time the fact that it’s a new thing is sort of at odds with the idea that there’s <em>so</em> much research that goes into <em>all</em> artists’ work. Whether you see it or not, and whether that research is actually going to the library and taking notes, or just observing or experiencing things in your everyday life. It’s part of my personality to enjoy reading about historical events and stuff so that leads to more of that background of my work. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Whitening Skin White Soap, from the series ‘The Great White Hope’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>There is so much information out there that people are generally not aware of, just sitting there in books and archives. The way history is presented to us is through a very particular lens. Certain narratives rise to surface, stay in the background or just disappear. The same event is taught in schools in different countries in completely different ways. For example, how the Vietnam war is taught to Vietnamese children versus in the US. </p> \n<p>The phrase ‘history is written by the victors’ is important to me, but also questioning who the victors are—primarily white men—and how their beliefs echo through to now. Enlightenment ideas of racial hierarchy persist even though we know that they were pseudo-science. Rudyard Kipling’s concept of the ‘white man’s burden’ was used to frame colonialism, and taken up by, I believe, Roosevelt. So this great American president was going around the world with this belief. He visited Brazil where they had a program to whiten the black population. But the general public just knows these figures as faces carved into a mountain, or inscribed onto banknotes. That’s where their knowledge starts and stops. So it’s the drive to research and understand these kind of things. </p> \n<p><strong>CS: You grew up here in Canada but you’ve lived in New York City for the last 15 years. How differently do you think the two countries deal with, or narrate, their histories of colonialism and slavery?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: There are marked differences. I love Canada. It’s where I’m from, but they completely omit their complacency and compliance with a lot of the American laws that helped perpetuate slavery. And there was also slavery within Canada; of the Indigenous communities, as well as the small African population. In the US, the African-American narrative is so present. At least there’s a willingness for the most part to note, “we were a part of this very horrible thing and that has made the race relations in our country very complicated.” Whereas Canada wants to step in and be the good guy. You can still be the good guy but admit to the history of what has happened. </p> \n<p>It’s a shame because for generations certain racial problems have been framed as being strictly an American problem. “Oh, that doesn’t happen here, we fixed that in the 60s.” I’ve heard all these things come out of the mouths of people here. And this gives rise to the question: why do we have to talk about or deal with this again? There needs to be more of a movement towards acknowledging these histories. Although, I have to say, things are a heck of a lot better in terms of race relations here than in the US within everyday experiences. But you don’t have to go very far back to see that the roots of racism are still there and are very familiar. Black people of different origins here still find themselves marginalized in the same ways as in the US. There needs to be some acknowledgment that that’s happening. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Mistress Keys Slave Papaya, 2018 © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CS: In the recent past Canada has attempted to reckon with Indigenous relations more. We’ve had the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Enquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. But in these endeavors, and I imagine in efforts the US government makes to address their ‘complicated’ history, there’s always a bottom line in admitting liability—and it’s that they don’t want to be financially liable. Honoring land treaties and issuing reparations for slavery are never seriously considered by them.</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: The people it affects don’t have economic power to impact on policy and procedure. With the Caribbean particularly, these countries that fought hard for independence were then just cut loose. After Colonial powers had pumped them for all the money they were worth, there was no support during these huge transitions. Nevis had land so rich for growing sugar that they purposely never grew any food crops—slave owners were rich enough to just import it. That’s the reason for the current situation in Haiti, because it was fined and penalized by France continually. </p> \n<p>It’s the same sort of situation with the Indigenous population here. When I think back to what I was taught in school, it was shamefully little. “Oh, seven major tribal groups, not much known about this one, all these ones died.” That’s the end of the story. And now maybe double that is taught. But double is still almost nothing. It’s really crazy to think about how many other people and histories silently occupy this country. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Rhona, from the series ‘Backra Bluid’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CS: In <em>Backra Bluid</em> the white figures that you become are uncanny; doppelgangers with slight variations. There’s this slippage between real and unreal, their faces are unsmiling masks, and the smoothness of the skin is featureless. Did you always want this play between falseness and veracity? How would the series be different if you’d made them more ‘convincing’?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: There was always something uncanny that I wanted, and a ‘tell’ if you look hard enough. And of course, there were technical and budgetary challenges, so all that blended together to give this effect. </p> \n<p>A lot of the visual research I was doing was in Victorian photography where you had to keep very still so there’s a stiffness to the poses. I also wanted the images to have that quality some paintings have, where the eyes are always on you no matter where you stand. Very off-putting! It also wasn’t necessarily the point to make them as real as possible. I thought back to that Benetton ad campaign, where they made the queen very convincingly African, but it still looks ‘real’ and like her. But, to me, my figures are not so much real people. They are more like creatures, and that plays into the use of certain markers that I equate with having that type of whiteness. It’s a kind of drag: private school uniforms, designer clothes logos. I was digging through thrift stores looking for visual punctuations to lead the viewer to thinking of a certain social strata. </p> \n<p><strong>CS: Are they all completely imaginary? Or are some of them based on real relatives?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: A lot of them are archetypes, but then also composites and caricatures. Not necessarily of individual people, but more types of people I have observed. In my previous day job at a photo studio, a lot of people came from upper class or rich backgrounds. On weekends they’d go to the country club or the yacht club, and the activities they’d do would be things like horseback riding. That’s their social world. And I thought about the schools they would’ve gone to growing up, so it’s culmination of all of those things and my own ideas and biases. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Mara, from the series ‘Backra Bluid’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CS: Did you think about these images occupying a certain time period? It’s hard to pin down in most of them. They could be contemporary or from different times in the 20th century. But there’s one that stands out as a more historic period costume—the Scottish one.</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: That was actually my friend’s old highland dancing costume from the 1980s! I remember as a child there were some kids’ parents would make them go to these lessons and competitions, and I remember thinking they were so cool. Which is hilarious because when I talked to my friend she hated it and thought it was so dorky! Certain ones have the feel of a historical time period. That friend is Canadian but of Scottish descent. Given the style of the 1980s, and the colour palette that was available, it is already an interpretation by one older time period of another. Taste changes—the highland costumes being made now would be slightly different. </p> \n<p><strong>CS: In that series you transformed yourself into white women from the age of 9 all the way to 62, and in your newest work <em>Pour la Victoire</em>, you again become white feminine allegorical figures, this time strangely ageless. For <em>Backra Bluid</em> did you think about transforming into male relatives, or was gender a sort of through-line for you, a way that you felt more connected to these characters?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: I thought about doing male characters, but the female ones did speak to me more, so that’s where I went with it. I think it also had to do with how much more I would have to change my face. It would be a lot more manipulation to make it close to natural and read as male. And I was interested in how I only had to change my face very <em>slightly</em> in this surface way to completely transform how I’m interpreted. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Canadiana, from the series ‘Pour La Victoire’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>CS: <em>Pour la Victoire</em> is a series on ‘national personifications.’ These are Athenian figures that countries involved in the transatlantic slave trade have invented to use in propaganda, especially during the colonial era. They tend to relate to concepts like liberty or wisdom, traits at that time usually associated with men, yet the majority of these constructs are women. In most of their representations, they don’t seem like real women of flesh and blood. Are you making a connection to gender?</strong> </p> \n<p>ST: That’s exactly what’s going on: white femininity as a justification for violence. The reference to Roman and Greek society as the pinnacle of civilization. And depicting these women as so virginal all plays into this concept of nationhood as something pure that men need to rally behind. A sexualized woman wouldn’t be respected, but because it’s seen as this <em>pure </em>cause that is ordained by God, this mission to bring enlightenment and culture to these dark corners of the earth. The way visually to get people behind that is to have a female figure who is virginal, benign, but also a little matronly. And like she needs protecting. </p> \n<p>A figure like Britannia has been referred to for centuries and she was perfect to illustrate ideas to an illiterate population in an obvious and cartoonish way. For example she’s depicted as opening a book to these savage looking figures. People immediately sort of understand what’s going there. I started off with the main players everyone thinks about as involved in the slave trade; England, France, Spain, Portugal and Holland. But then Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark all had a huge presence. Even Malta, the knights of Malta, or Poland, and Prussia. They were involved by making specific barrels used for those industries. All of these little connections. Some were a little surprising but also not really, because when you look at the spellings of some places in the Virgin Islands, they are definitely Swedish and Danish names. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Hispania, from the series ‘Pour La Victoire’ © Stacey Tyrell\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stacey-tyrell-bluid-and-sweat#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>These countries do partially recognize that they were involved. It suggests that the majority of the white population do actually care about learning that part of their history. There’s a lot of people in Europe that can’t wrap their head around actually how bad it was in terms of the chopping-off of limbs and the torturing of people in front of their family—that this was happening up until 70 or 80 years ago, if not even as we speak! In different ways and in different places. </p> \n<p>Not to harm anyone’s national identity, but there needs to be an awareness of the fact that no country, especially in continental Europe, is exempt from having participated in this. It’s impossible to think that England or Spain on their own 100% perpetuated and maintained all of this yet somehow managed to pass through all these other countries on their way to where they were going, and that the other countries didn’t participate in this economic bonanza that sort of fell into their laps. </p> \n<hr> \n <p><br> </br></p>\n <p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n <ul>\n

But what does a computer see? </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">In <i>Recognition Patterns</i>, Marcus DeSieno applies the technology of machine learning and artificial intelligence to his personal collection of found images. In this eerie meeting of archival photographs and cutting edge technology, he gives us a glimpse into computer vision, making visible the way manmade super structures look back at us. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">With this work, the idea of photography as a historical document becomes a foundational layer onto which the line-work of Artificial Intelligence etches itself.

In DeSieno’s series, it is the computer that actively sees and interprets the world — in strict and geometric terms. Found photographs from the early 19th and 20th century, which have long lost their original meaning, are transformed through the vision of the computer. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Recognition Pattern #17b.

Geometric lines create visual illusions of folds and shapes, brought upon somewhat generic archival pictures: family photos, yearbook pictures, monuments, and documents of public history. Through DeSeino’s images, we catch a glimpse of the lens through which a computer views us. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">In the quiet of the picture, we are confronted by stark and unemotional lines. The implications of what this means, and the difference it has to the way we see, interpret, and independently discern choices is immediately compromised as nuanced details are meted out. These lines may seem playful, but upon closer observation, they slice up soft human figures and interrupt the relation of the face to the physique of the person in the portrait with little regard for their identity.</span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\"></span> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Recognition Pattern #179d.

The loss of the individual life depicts, as DeSenio describes, the consequences of power and the farce and absurdity that underlies technological analysis. </span> </p> \n<p><span class=\"s1\">At such a crucial juncture in the developments of technology, <i>Recognition Patterns</i> demands that we look at the reality of a technological future and the way it will shape humankind. What does it mean to be human?

words in your imagination: Elegant. Clear. Provocative. Nostalgic. I am trying to find the right words to describe <em>Highway 61: Photographs by Jessica Lange.</em> In so many ways, this is exactly what every book of photography aspires to become. </p> \n<p>Compelling. Dreamy. Hard. Inspiring. The idea here is classic. The project takes us on a road trip down Highway 61, from Grand Marias in Minnesota to New Orleans. The book’s jacket says: “Lange was raised in Northern Minnesota and has travelled the length of Highway 61 countless times since her childhood and throughout her life.” Lange herself writes, “These photographs are a chronicle of what remains and what has disappeared. It has a long memory, Highway 61.” The photographs are not a record of one epic trip, but rather a narrative. Each turn of the page takes us farther south on the highway. Each turn of the page takes us a bit deeper into the story of home. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Mississippi. From ‘Highway 61’ © Jessica Lange, published by powerHouse Books\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-lange-highway-61#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Historic. Loving. Familial. Honest. The book is elegant in its design. Every photograph is on the right hand page. Verso is blank, except for a very small page number. Open the book at the beginning, or anywhere, and the image is all you get. The image is everything you get. It’s large on the page. There is no text with the images, no captions or dates or apologies or claims. Just an old woman looking in a supermarket cooler. Just some guy sitting by himself in a café with checkered tablecloths. Just a mechanic in his shop. Just a cook in a café. Just some billboard under a contrailed sky. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Iowa. From ‘Highway 61’ © Jessica Lange, published by powerHouse Books\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-lange-highway-61#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Each photograph is black and white (the jacket says tritone). Most of the photographs are grainy with some element of blur or haze. Every photograph has a smudged black border to give it the impression of age. It’s as if Lange has perfected a way to photograph memory. Actually, I take that back. Forget the “It’s as if.” </p> \n<p>Pleasant. Deep. Heartwood. <em>Highway 61</em> is insistently rural. The road itself is no Interstate Highway, and the images are county fairs, small town cafes, repair shops, old motels, farm animals, dogs, children, blue collars and weather. If you’ve ever read E. B. White’s essay <em>Once More to the Lake</em> or listened to J. Unger’s “Ashokan Farewell”, you know the spirit of <em>Highway 61</em>. There is in nostalgia an element of hope and even the hardest or saddest photograph here holds some expression of hope. Look at the little girl on a rodeo horse. Look at the riverboat or the guy standing by railroad tracks. Perhaps Lange’s hope is only that a memory of them will persist. But isn’t the desire for memory the strongest desire? And when every other argument has come and gone, isn’t photography finally a hope for memory? </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Missouri. From ‘Highway 61’ © Jessica Lange, published by powerHouse Books\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-lange-highway-61#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Persistent. Hopeful. Old. The book is physically large but comfortable to hold in a deep, old chair. A large book here means large images, each of them inviting an unrushed conversation. One of the things I love about this book is the confidence that the images can stand alone. Yes, I know this isn’t possible with other genres of photography—conflict photography, for instance—but if the image is subject instead of example, then let it be what it is. </p> \n<p>In her brief epilogue, Lange writes, “Highway 61 is almost 1600 miles long and passes through eight states. When it rolls along the Mississippi it is called the Great River Road. When it heads south out of Memphis through the ancient floodplains of the Delta it becomes known as the Blues Highway—home to some of the great blues singers of the last century, many of whom recorded songs about 61…Long stretches of 61 are empty, forlorn, as if in mourning for what has gone missing—the hometowns, the neighborhoods, family farms, factories, and mills. Even the strip malls have failed. Stores all boarded up, weeds growing through the asphalt of countless vacant parking lots. Some of the people left, creating a ghostly beauty in their leave-taking. Some remain, perhaps yearning for that more vibrant past but reluctant to abandon the place called home. If, as Roland Barthes says, ‘every photograph is a certificate of presence,’ then these photographs are a chronicle of what I witnessed along and near High 61. It has been a long drive, wrapped in my story.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>New Orleans. From ‘Highway 61’ © Jessica Lange, published by powerHouse Books\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jessica-lange-highway-61#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>There is, in the back pages, a list of where the photographs were taken, but only by state. No city or county names. No dates. The intent is to focus on the moment of capture and the world of story hiding in that one sixtieth of a second. There are only 84 pictures in the book, and a world in every one. Remarkable. Unexpected. Necessary. </p> \n<div> \n <br> </br>\n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/david-ellingsen-the-last-stand\">The Last

After an immersive experience of art-making, the memories of her return home to the Ivory Coast will forever be tainted by global events. On the same day she boarded her flight, airlines across the world were thrust into high alert when a trio of suicide bombers attacked Brussels Airport and a major metro station. Yet, for Choumali, the epicenter of another tremor struck much closer to home, a mere nine days before. </p> \n<p>On March 13, 2016, terrorists gunned down nineteen people, injuring at least 33 others, on the beaches of Grand Bassam, a resort town near her home in Abidjan where Choumali’s family often met for Sunday lunch. Upon her return, memories of this once-familiar landscape were drowned out by a tragic sense of loss. Choumali walked the shoreline and felt waves of sadness in the air. “The energy was different as if life was painfully running in a melancholic slow motion. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Ça va aller”, 2019 © Joana Choumali\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joana-choumali-responding-to-tragedy-with-art-and-hope#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>”Where restaurants and beachfront hotels were once brimming with tourists, Choumali instinctively documented this new sense of hollowness in largely vacant spaces, using her smartphone, before participating in a psychiatric conference that encouraged residents to take advantage of free consultations at the General Hospital in Grand Bassam. “Except for the first week, people would hardly talk about their experience and the trauma. They would end the conversation with this very Ivorian expression: ‘Ça va aller’ (It will be okay).” A phrase of comfort concealed emotional avoidance. The complimentary services were intended to help people better cope with trauma born from this collective suffering. </p> \n<p>For Choumali, the process of healing emerged through creation. She never intended for the casual collection of smartphone images to come together in the way they did. This direction was born from intuition as she began piecing thoughts and emotions together during long periods of time spent at home or in waiting rooms where she, herself, was healing from illness. “I had this urge to express myself and to continue to work; to spend time with the pictures.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Ça va aller”, 2019 © Joana Choumali\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joana-choumali-responding-to-tragedy-with-art-and-hope#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>What started in the privacy of her own room began to spill out and absorb other areas of her life. “I would take a canvas with me in a little bag and embroider from the hospital waiting room, in traffic, etc. I was stitching every day, all day.” Some pieces took several weeks to complete and the work continued over a period of three years.<br><br>Choumali describes herself as self-taught in the art of embroidery and found herself repeating the same stitch, suturing her photographs, “as if it was to repair a wound.” She shares fond memories of the N’zassa tradition, an artform symbolizing the unity of multiple cultures through assorted pieces of cloth bound together by thread. “I remember my maternal grandmother used to stitch all day, doing patchworks with little leftovers of wax fabrics. I was fascinated by her patience. I wondered why she would put so much effort in stitching with a needle and thread.” </br></br></p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled from the series “Ça va aller”, 2019 © Joana Choumali\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joana-choumali-responding-to-tragedy-with-art-and-hope#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>When Choumali asked her grandmother why she didn’t use the sewing machine for these patchworks as she did when making dresses, the response was merely silence and a soft smile. “Today I fully understand the effect of hand-stitching. I was able to allow myself to embroider on my images in an instinctive way, marking a turning point in my way of understanding/processing life through my art. My inner universe merges with the exterior; the photographs I had taken. This meditative approach allows me to discover another way of experiencing certain events in my life.” </p> \n<div> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Untitled from the series “Ça va aller”, 2019 © Joana Choumali\n <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/joana-choumali-responding-to-tragedy-with-art-and-hope#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n</div> \n<div>\n In one of her pieces, a man is wrapped in a red embrace like veins spreading outwards into threaded white air.

The most important thing is to recognize it, to work on it, and take each step forward as a positive step; one day at a time.” </p> \n<div> \n <br> </br>\n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/david-maisel-library-of-dust\">Library of Dust</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/olivia-maria-rubio-fluid-forms-oliva-maria-rubio-s-take-on-art-photography\">Fluid Forms: Oliva María Rubio’s Take on Art Photography</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/tadas-kazakevicius-between-two-shores\">Between Two Shores</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/guilherme-gerais-the-best-of-mr-chao-a-futurologist-collection\">The Best of Mr. Chao: A Futurologist Collection</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/panayotis-papadimitropoulos-meta-photographs\">Meta-photographs</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/sofie-amalie-klougart-reaching-europe\">Reaching Europe</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1f45ac8d-3e6f-47a3-8c13-5c43edf0e714.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/012332b9-1594-4051-a735-d48153add861.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/21d78522-68c7-4347-93a2-5bb82d58a2f8.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/26a20c69-b6c7-42f2-83b4-a1a1d8a36b06.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/055c7539-5a1c-4597-a51a-e4561e80aebe.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ce99bc2a-ed61-4b8a-a321-9a2df16ab244.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/90088237-9832-4b90-b534-b1fa1dea3e04.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3340e77e-313e-48bc-a145-a7dae246f14d.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:02:51 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/055c7539-5a1c-4597-a51a-e4561e80aebe.jpg","linkMd5":"588c4d47b5d617b56d5274c42d1e8461","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-47-888_00f9de8cda5ce519.webp","destWidth":1124,"destHeight":1124,"sourceBytes":1648785,"destBytes":332288,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/055c7539-5a1c-4597-a51a-e4561e80aebe.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-37-47-888_00f9de8cda5ce519.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/1f45ac8d-3e6f-47a3-8c13-5c43edf0e714.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn24@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-03-909_d13eb120ec6ddc5b.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/012332b9-1594-4051-a735-d48153add861.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-01-118_ab83bb3276c5c5b7.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/21d78522-68c7-4347-93a2-5bb82d58a2f8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-07-094_d009679ff0ed6003.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/26a20c69-b6c7-42f2-83b4-a1a1d8a36b06.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-16-588_9d6f13eff3ac56f0.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/055c7539-5a1c-4597-a51a-e4561e80aebe.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-15-205_7b4042ded48cbba7.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/ce99bc2a-ed61-4b8a-a321-9a2df16ab244.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-59-163_9f16ce86007f33cf.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/90088237-9832-4b90-b534-b1fa1dea3e04.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-58-634_efce0f5f5d25d7f6.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/3340e77e-313e-48bc-a145-a7dae246f14d.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-52-817_172898ec555f357b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066814},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Myth of a Woman","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/agnieszka-sosnowska-myth-of-a-woman","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Myth of a Woman</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Agnieszka Sosnowska</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/43014d6a-609e-4e04-b3c7-1fa7787db14e.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Agnieszka Sosnowska’s striking self-portraits chronicle rural life in the volatile landscape of her adopted homeland, East Iceland.&nbsp;\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>How can we picture the somewhat invisible relationship we have with our surroundings?

In terms of your choice to emigrate to Iceland, do you think the desire to live closely with nature is often misunderstood?</strong><br> </br></p> \n<p>Agnieszka Sosnowska: I think it’s often romanticized. I read <em>Into the Wild</em> by Jon Krakauer while visiting Iceland. That book was a huge influence in my life. I questioned what I wanted out of it. I knew I wanted to be with nature, not to visit it. Before making the decision to move to the countryside in East Iceland, I would share my plan with fellow Icelanders. The response from many was: “You are very brave.” </p> \n<p>I believed that surviving New England winters had prepared me for anything. I was wrong. I thought I was tough. I was not.

If you are not, then you can’t do it. Years back our water-source dried up. It was a very dry summer. We were not the only farm with this problem. Getting water from a nearby stream the entire summer to wash dishes, cook, flush toilets and wash ourselves got old pretty quickly. My husband surveyed our land, found a new spring underground, and spent months digging a new water system. The project was immense. The distance he dug was 1km away from our farm. He laid the pipeline from the new spring to our farm and created better water pressure. I was so relieved he had the skills to do this himself. </p> \n<p>Currently we are in the process of replacing the roof of our farm. For years he has been acquiring the carpentry tools to work the wood himself instead of buying it straight from a hardware supplier. Living this way is both rewarding and exhausting. I think we both have a deep sense of pride when we accomplish a project. It is long, hard and often involves a lot disagreeing. I often say if you really want to test a relationship with anyone, build something together over a long period of time and see if you succeed. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Holding On.

Can you speak more about this desire and sense of ‘not knowing’, and how it relates to your work?</strong> </p> \n<p>AS: In 2005, I married an Icelander and moved to a farm in the Eastern part of Iceland. This was not my plan. At the time, I had been living in Boston and working as a teacher. I have grown in three ways since moving to Iceland. </p> \n<p>The first was becoming a wife and learning to compromise. The second was coming into my own as a woman. I have found strength and support from Icelandic women. This encouraged me to become confident and celebrate who I am, rather than apologize for it. The third was to be in a constant dialogue with nature. Living in place with frequent earthquakes, crazy wind speeds and the occasional volcano eruption reminds a person just how small they really are. </p> \n<p>I met my Icelandic husband while on a three day visit to Iceland during Thanksgiving break. Iceland was not on my list of places to travel. My girlfriend’s daughter, who was turning sixteen, picked Iceland as the place she’d most like to visit for her birthday. I was asked to accompany them for the trip. </p> \n<p>At the hotel in Iceland my friend´s daughter picked the most expensive day tour to experience. A snow mobile ride on top of a glacier. I was terrified and completely out of my element. The tour guide arrived to the hotel lobby to pick up the group. Four years later I married the tour guide and moved to Iceland. Needless to say it was a good tour. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Floating, 2019.

We set a date and a time to take pictures, we plan around an idea or a personal interest of theirs that we want to try to play with in the pictures. I then set a specific time frame that we’ll be working, between one and three hours. Often it’s what we’re doing together, rather than the picture itself, that becomes the end result.

I might take a few items from my farm that I want to play around with to tell a story. One such thing was a reindeer skin. I was with my husband for his first reindeer hunt. It was pretty epic. To pull a 250kg reindeer down from the top of a mountain is impossible and surreal. That reindeer skin was part of our wedding ceremony. We exchanged vows on it. Many years later I was running around the farm with the skin trying to make a nude self portrait. My husband would go crazy watching me do this because tanning the skin cost him a fortune. He didn’t want to see it destroyed and rightly so. What was I trying to communicate? I had no idea. </p> \n<p>I guess I was trying come to terms with a marriage that had nearly ended. We had been having problems. Perhaps by wrapping that skin around my skin I was searching for our union again. I was trying to connect with who we had become as a couple.

None other have gripped my curiosity more than “Móðir mín í kví, kví,” an Icelandic poem sung in East Iceland. This poem tells the tale of a woman haunted by the death of her newborn child. </p> \n<p>Throughout Iceland’s history women that bore children from circumstances that were not acceptable at the time would abandon the newborn to die in the wilderness.

Maybe they were scared that their families, friends or society would dismiss them? </p> \n<p>When faced with such choices these women would leave their newborns out in the wilderness to die of exposure.“Móðir mín í kví, kví,” tells of a woman haunted by the voice of her abandoned child and driven to madness by her choice.

In a way I connect with these Icelandic women and their sacrifices. </p> \n<p>To have the ability of motherhood taken away from you by means out of your control can be consuming. This is why I started making pictures for <em>Myth of a Woman</em>. These self portraits are my myths. They are love, hope, desperation, and awe. They are my truth.

I take great pleasure in growing, planting and weeding. </p> \n<p>My flowers and vegetables are a huge sense of pride.Often even more than picture making.

While waiting out the plague back at Woolsthorpe Manor, Newton pondered the nature of color and improvised experiments to test his theories. In one, he hung a prism in his bedroom until a sunbeam struck it at just the right angle, shattering light into a rainbow across his wall. These experiments eventually lead his treatise: <em>Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions, and Colours of Light,</em> the earliest basis for our contemporary understanding of color. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Angles of Pi.

For her series <em>Traveling Light</em>, she collected prisms and lenses to create abstract compositions comprising immaterial lines and shapes of color. “I’m not a scientist, but I’m intrigued by physical phenomena,” Bay explains. “It’s interesting to see the way that light interacts with these optical objects; a color will appear on one part of a lens, but light angling onto a different side will bring in other hues.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Angular Velocity. Constructed photograph using lenses and prisms to explore the behavior of light and color. © Deborah Bay\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deborah-bay-traveling-light#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Bay’s delightful process is akin to an improvised game. “My approach is largely intuitive and not unlike that of a child playing,” she explains. “Sometimes, I go to the studio with an idea, and other times, I go with no particular plan. I create similar or complementary groupings of transparent or translucent objects. Every time I change my lighting, I get a new image.” This approach is reminiscent of Dada and Surrealist darkroom experiments, black and white photographic abstractions made from a love of improvisation and curiosity as well as unselfconscious explorations of the phenomenal world. </p> \n<p>A century after Dada’s and Surrealism’s first experimental inquiries, using chance procedures as an artistic investigation strategy remains a crucial element of many photographers’ practices. By working with small, often imperfect optical objects, Bay deliberately opens up her process to chance, allowing her to discover subtle phenomena she might never have seen otherwise. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Probability Theory. Constructed photograph using lenses and prisms to explore the behavior of light and color. © Deborah Bay\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/deborah-bay-traveling-light#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>“Often, when we look, we miss seeing so much. Because my elements are only 1 or 2 inches in diameter, I am never sure exactly how a photograph is going to look until after I have shot it. In my 40-inch prints, I can see subtle details that I never would never observe with my naked eye or take the time to appreciate, like the way light moves around the thin rim of a lens,” says Bay. <em>Traveling Light</em> suggests that we could always see more than our senses will allow. By unlocking these tiny rainbows for the viewers, Bay transforms her experimental impulses into an expansion of our own vision. </p>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/alain-laboile-reflexion-autour-du-bassin\">Réflexion autour du bassin</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/takashi-homma-the-narcissistic-city\">The Narcissistic City</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/julien-magre-on-the-road-dream-narrative\">On the Road, Dream Narrative</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/jill-booker-shards\">Shards</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/alex-webb-la-calle-on-the-streets-of-mexico\">La Calle: On the Streets of Mexico</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/barbara-peacock-american-bedroom\">American Bedroom</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/694b3f70-cd06-4cfb-995d-1908db8bb382.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Mondrian Dialectic\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/809787a1-31b0-4c68-8430-dbe9ccd2b829.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Triangle Theorem\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f7e13e1c-4ae2-42b6-8565-f11f84c4ea34.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   The Geometry Lesson\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/c1a618c2-d56d-4645-a833-41422d690a37.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Reflections on the Square\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/97bd3e3b-bee2-4258-871f-71b6c69036c9.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Circular Domains\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a78aaeed-8761-4209-8177-6c4b59abc5d7.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Tangential Point\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/16b5036f-fa9f-4567-ba12-f835d1ce7b03.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>\n   Circular Thinking II\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:16:39 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/809787a1-31b0-4c68-8430-dbe9ccd2b829.jpg","linkMd5":"5982fcd6f43006c5f3733dd6178bde18","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-48-187_0f584151b4ddbf7e.webp","destWidth":675,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":62587,"destBytes":22644,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/809787a1-31b0-4c68-8430-dbe9ccd2b829.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-48-187_0f584151b4ddbf7e.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/694b3f70-cd06-4cfb-995d-1908db8bb382.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-09-836_ae5aac3837cd9ff2.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/809787a1-31b0-4c68-8430-dbe9ccd2b829.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-10-411_4c9026392652e5aa.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/f7e13e1c-4ae2-42b6-8565-f11f84c4ea34.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-51-929_8aa39a8df7d5e216.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/c1a618c2-d56d-4645-a833-41422d690a37.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-14-823_7b2a8c5533e785e2.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/97bd3e3b-bee2-4258-871f-71b6c69036c9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-08-791_6c2f048e20ff014c.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/a78aaeed-8761-4209-8177-6c4b59abc5d7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-55-513_046686f5fbd68ae1.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/16b5036f-fa9f-4567-ba12-f835d1ce7b03.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-52-981_b61d95e35ee9aa42.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066819},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"Photos that Should Not be Possible","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/toby-binder-photos-that-should-not-be-possible","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>Photos that Should Not be Possible</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Toby Binder</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/c5833a1a-d712-407e-818f-7fdbe6a9c1a5.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  In “Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast”, Toby Binder captures the ebbs and flows of teenage life across the divided communities of Northern Ireland.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For thirty blood-soaked years, one overriding narrative framed the photography of Northern Ireland: the Troubles. It was a felicitous term that allowed people on both sides of the armed conflict—and those who thought there was a position somewhere in the middle—to refer to the same violent hostilities without revealing their particular perspective. </p> \n<p>The grim reality behind the euphemism was a war between the British state, sometimes in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries, and an Irish Republican Army (IRA) demanding a united Ireland. Of the thousands that died, more were civilians than combatants. Massive social inequalities underlay the conflict that subsumed them and the bad news is that these disparities remain and continue to blight the lives of marginalised communities. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast.

His first trip to Belfast was in 2006 but it was the Brexit referendum that galvanized an interest in returning. “Here the decision for or against Brexit ran tight along the sectarian lines. And there were different majorities of over 80% in a very confined space,” he explains. </p> \n<p>“The majority in Catholic-nationalist neighbourhoods voted to stay in the EU, most people in Protestant-loyalist neighbourhoods voted for Brexit. This referendum result made very clear how different the vision of Northern Ireland’s future is in these two camps and how deep the resentment of the past lies<em>.</em>” The result of his fresh interest are the images in <em>Wee Muckers - Youth of Belfast, </em> taken from different neighbourhoods of Belfast. Some of these communities are anxious to preserve an identity that is Protestant and part of the UK; others are nationalist and Catholic, looking to a united Ireland. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast. Belfast, Shankill. Girls’ group at Woodvale Park. © Toby Binder\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/toby-binder-photos-that-should-not-be-possible#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Binder’s pictures—‘wee’ is an informal adjective for small or little while ‘muckers’ is a colloquial word for friends and companions—are in the recognizable tradition of street photography as a ‘theatre of life’. They are though quite different from, say, <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/helen-levitt-helen-levitt-new-york-streets-1938-to-1990s\">Helen Levitt’s photographs of children</a> on the sidewalks of poor neighbourhoods in New York. Levitt’s youngsters own the streets and their spontaneous playfulness kindle amusement but those in Binder’s pictures occupy contested territory and artless joy looks to be in short supply. There is one photograph of a girl running along the ground with unrehearsed glee but the heavy presence of police vehicles isolates her vitality. In a harsh, urban landscape, she becomes almost quixotic. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast. Belfast, Carrick Hill.

The girl running past the police vehicle is in Carrick Hill, a nationalist area, and in another photo, taken from behind a police line in the same area, a young boy on a bicycle stands as if questioning the restriction on his right to roam. In Belfast, confrontations with uniformed authority begin in childhood. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast. Belfast, Carrick Hill. Brendan behind a police line on Trinity Street. © Toby Binder \n<p>In staunchly loyalist areas, like Sandy Row and Shankill (a murderous loyalist gang was known as the Shankill Butchers), pro-British insignia is photographed on walls. Although the pictures are divided by neighbourhood, what comes across strongly is what these muckers share: a social ecology defined not by religion or politics but class. The working-class youth, as Binder puts it “have much more in common than either side would like to admit.” Aware also that “young people actually always have a very good sense of whether one is honest with them”, he built up rapport by being open, sharing photographs from previous visits and getting to know some of them. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Wee Muckers – Youth of Belfast.

And sad, as well, to feel that it is still possible to take such pictures. ‘Muck’ can also be used as a verb to mean messing around, without due consideration. The youngsters of Belfast, affected, as Binder says, “by unemployment, drug and gang crime and social disadvantage” have themselves been badly mucked around with. </p> \n<hr> \n <p><em>Editor’s note: Toby Binder was a top winner with this series in the <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/2020-lensculture-street-photography-award-winners\">LensCulture Street Photography Awards 2020</a>.

As for many in the arts, the global pandemic is posing huge and unfolding challenges for the entire photography community, from individual practitioners, to collectives and agencies, as well as global institutions and organizations. </i><i>The COVID-19 situation impacts us all in different ways and there are certainly more uncertain times ahead, but one thing we know for sure: the global photography community is rallying to provide support.</i><br>\n</p>\n<p><i></i><i>We’ve curated a list of initiatives, ideas and resources currently available for image-makers to help navigate the coming months, whether that be financial support, professional development opportunities, or inspiring things to read and watch to fill extended time at home. </i><i>Pulling this list together was a heart-warming experience. Witnessing the scope of this massive collective response from organizations big and small has felt something like a virtual hug, one we wanted to extend to photographers around the world.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i></i><i>While not exhaustive, our hope is that you’ll find something in this list that helps, no matter your location or your situation.

On the park bench beside him, his girlfriend Jackie smokes a cigarette, while his brother Louis circles them with his camera, making portraits of the two lovebirds out in the park on a clouded London afternoon. Once the sparrow is sighted, Justin adds its name to a notebook filled with bird lists, notes on bird songs, drawings of birds and the odd poem. Justin, now in his 50s, has been obsessively birdwatching since the age of nine. “Why do you think you’ve kept it up?” his brother asks. “…the birds that you see reflect the earth back inside of yourself, they reflect the earth back in you,” Justin replies. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled © Louis Quail\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/louis-quail-big-brother#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Justin and Jackie have both been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The photographs in<em> Big Brother</em> were made by Justin’s younger sibling Louis, who began documenting Justin’s life shortly after their mother—who was also diagnosed with schizophrenia—passed away. An estimated one in four people will struggle with mental health issues at some point in their lifetime, and for Louis the lack of public awareness and support for the mentally ill drove him to begin making the work. “I want Justin to be seen,” he writes, “I want to fight the ignorance and the stigma.” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Justin on his way to Kew Gardens strikes a pose, possibly in protest at the relentless gaze of my camera, although I only guess. Justin is idiosyncratic, something to be cherished and celebrated in a world of conformity. © Louis Quail\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/louis-quail-big-brother#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In <em>Big Brother</em>, Louis Quail defies the reductive stigma surrounding Justin’s illness by creating an intimate portrait of his brother’s everyday experience. “Justin is no saint,” writes Louis, “but there is a lot more to him than his mental illness. It doesn’t define him.” In a series of chapters, each a title from one of Justin’s favorite songs, Louis uses text and image to document the different themes playing out in Justin’s life. In ‘Shine on You Crazy Diamond’, Justin meditates and paints landscapes. In ‘Holiday, It Could Be So Nice’, Justin and Jackie travel to Northern Ireland on vacation. In addition to Louis’ photographic observations, Justin’s voice is present throughout <em>Big Brother</em>: on pages and inserts of drawings, bird lists, and poetry excerpts, sitting alongside the images of him meditating, bird watching, or sharing a moment with Jackie. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Untitled © Justin Quail\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/louis-quail-big-brother#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Justin instinctively practices his hobbies, especially birdwatching, and for Louis they are the source of his resilience. “It’s hard to quantify the benefits that Justin’s hobby has in helping his illness,” writes Louis, “I see it as absolutely vital in maintaining his mental health and sense of well-being.” However, his condition brings about an oscillation between extreme highs and extreme lows—and Louis does not shy away from depictions of the debilitating depression and paranoia his brother endures. In a number of different sequences throughout the book Justin lays prone on a couch incapacitated by his anti-psychotic drugs, telling Louis, “I can’t do anything after a depo, they make me feel foggy, like wading through mud.” </p> \n<p>In a chapter titled ‘I Fought the Law and the Law Won,’ Louis takes the reader through the challenges presented to Justin and Jackie by the lack of social support. Jackie, who has given up on the increasingly overwhelmed social care workers, has a habit of turning to the police whenever a misunderstanding arises between the couple. As a result, a litany of minor offences are attached to Justin’s name such as criminal damage to a cigarette, breach of bail, common assault, assault by battery. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Jackie’s flat, East Sheen May 2012 © Louis Quail\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/louis-quail-big-brother#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>The peaks and troughs of this intimate relationship point to a larger systemic failure. Louis believes that, “what we see are symptoms of a system that appears to be spiralling out of control. Resources that were once pumped into [social services] are now diverted to the Criminal Justice system.” The result is instead of the option to resolve their misunderstandings (and there are many) with the help of trained professionals, Justin and Jackie are now at the mercy of untrained police officers working in an unempathetic judicial system. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Jackie follows Justin as he searches for birds in a field near Tring, Hertfordshire. It’s a testament to the strength of the relationship that Jackie joins Justin on this trip as she is not really that interested in birds or walking in the countryside for that matter. © Louis Quail\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/louis-quail-big-brother#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In spite of the challenges Justin and Jackie face, their resilience and love continue to bring them together. “At its heart,” writes Louis, “this is a love story.” After a lifetime of being the one supporting Justin, making this work also changed the relationship between brothers. “Justin trusted me with his story,” says Louis, “it was his gift to me; something powerful for a change.” Reflecting on Justin and Jackie’s relationship, Louis writes that, “if by accepting them we can accept ourselves, treat each health condition as is appropriate, and resist the ghettoization of the mentally ill, then we can improve our individual health as well as that of society.” </p> \n<div> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <div class=\"picture\"> \n   <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18782-big-brother\"></a> \n

sun-soaked images of the Mediterranean capture the contradictions of contemporary existence, where holidaymakers lounge against the backdrop of a looming post-industrial landscape.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><em>Spanish photographer Txema Salvans’ new book, </em>Perfect Day,<em> is a collection of bittersweet images that offer a surprisingly insightful view into the contradictions of our post-industrial civilization. Over the course of fifteen years, Salvans traversed the shores of the Mediterranean Sea photographing scenes of people relaxing, sunbathing, and carving out a small personal paradise amid the seemingly inescapable backdrop of the industrialized landscape.</em> </p> \n<p><em>The post-industrialized lifestyle lurks ever-present, both literally and figuratively, as a backdrop to the sun-washed moments of bliss captured in </em>Perfect Day<em>. All at once, the people in Salvans’ images become sympathetic punchlines, figures of stubborn insistence, and symbols of a contemporary condition where we see the pressures for individual productivity continually encroach upon our need for escape and leisure. In a simple visual gesture, Salvans offers us profound truths about the inescapability of societal expectations for the labor force. The demands of economic production, sharply alluded to in </em>Perfect Day<em> and ever-present in our own lives, simply cannot be quieted.</em> </p> \n<p><em>In our current moment, defined by a pandemic that has isolated us, the pictures perhaps ring even more relatable. We feel the longing for escape to any place outside our own dwellings and for those of us working from home, there is a continual blurring between times of work and leisure. In this interview, Salvans speaks to Gregory Eddi Jones for LensCulture about what photography means to him, making work on home turf and our faltering relationship to nature.</em> </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020).

I’m curious, how did you get started with this project and what sustained your interest in this work for such a long period of time?</strong> </p> \n<p>Txema Salvans: Fifteen years? Why not? Nobody was waiting on my photos. I don’t have any scholarship or help, I have no excuses or I have them all. I can’t afford to publish a work to which I haven’t given everything, so I better do it right. That’s my commitment to myself, to you, and to photography. </p> \n<p>Photography is a state of mind that I cannot shake. It allows me to experience an intellectual pleasure, to observe the complexity of our species. It allows me to be alone, to wander and remain in a state of contemplation that at times frees me from the need to be the protagonist of my own life. And that is a great liberation. Like all artists, I try to find a personal voice, and probably because I studied science at university—I studied biology—I feel comfortable speaking about things that I can understand. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020).

I have to have a physical connection with the landscapes and an emotional connection with the people. Being part of this reality helps me to be more critical and to go deeper into Spanish culture. So, for the last twenty years I have focused on a big project, taking photos all along the Spanish Mediterranean Coast. And more precisely, looking at how people spend their free time. As a photographer, I understood that I had to focus my point of view, otherwise the work could become too scattered. ‘Leisure’ allowed me to be a photographer every day; I didn’t need long journeys or anomalous situations to be able to work. </p> \n<p>I have become a ‘super specialist’ in a very specific subject, and for that reason, I believe that my work can transcend photography to become a document at the mercy of historians, ethnologists, architects, journalists. But the most difficult thing is to transcend the document, to be able to have your photos go beyond what the photograph shows. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<blockquote>\n “My photos are not only a document about the Mediterranean, the Spanish or holidays, they are above all a document about the human condition.” \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>GEJ: There’s an underlying tension in the pictures that speaks to the relationships between work and leisure. It’s really interesting that some of the reasons your subjects seek out moments of leisure is to escape from the anxieties, and perhaps unnatural lifestyles, brought on by industrialization. To see the evidences of industrial development within the pictures provides the sense that it’s an inescapable condition, aside from the few privileged who have the means to visit a truly remote paradise.</strong> </p> \n<p>TS: Our existence is framed between the highly improbable event of being born and another inevitable event that is death. From that binary perspective, every second of life is a ‘perfect day’. But from an existentialist perspective, our existence resembles that of plankton: living organisms, with little or no ability to move without the mercy of waves and currents. For a society that values its individuals for their production capacity, doing nothing has become the holy grail of our free time, and considering that death is a proven fact, it’s a great paradox! </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020). Courtesy of Txema Salvans and MACK.\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/txema-salvans-perfect-day#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>GEJ: It’s strange and funny to me how, given the book’s release amid this global pandemic, the title almost becomes sarcastic, or perhaps a statement of longing. And it’s noteworthy that the people in your images, appearing alone, sometimes lonely, fall in line with the current context of social distancing and isolation. I wonder: has the pandemic changed your own interpretation of these pictures you’ve made?</strong> </p> \n<p>TS: We could say that this pandemic is global thanks to one human invention, “the combustion engine” that facilitates human movement on a global scale. The paradox is that it is stopped by another human invention, “the vaccine”. We are a totally denaturalized species. We have stopped relating to life and our natural environment, and have begun to relate more to dead materials, like plastic. We are opportunistic animals, we have adapted. <em>Perfect Day</em> tells us about the incredible physical and emotional resilience of our species. In this resilience, paradoxically, lies the tragedy of the human being. Where other species surrender, we are able to endure a little longer. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020).

You photograph with your back to it. It might seem funny to say, but I can almost read these pictures as having been made by the sea, distant and impartial, looking back at humanity and considering both its ingenuities and its follies. It seems important to me that these pictures were made around the Mediterranean coastline. Can you talk a little about the significance you found in photographing scenes from the Mediterranean specifically, as opposed to any other body of water?</strong> </p> \n<p>TS: I love your idea! How the Mediterranean sees us! The Mediterranean is above all landscape, and has a positive representation in the collective unconscious. My photos show the current reality of much of this landscape. The future of a landscape depends on its complexity, on the interrelationship of flora, fauna, meteorology… even the dunes of a desert never stay still. Our species devastates, demolishes, forces, and violates the landscape until it is sterilized by adding cement. A landscape without a future is a dead landscape. We are heirs to the violence of those who preceded us, and the Mediterranean has been deeply wronged, yet we have adapted. We are bordering on dystopia. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020). Courtesy of Txema Salvans and MACK.\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/txema-salvans-perfect-day#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p><strong>GEJ: One of the most notable characteristics of these pictures is the sense of humor that comes with your vibrant color palette, the formal playfulness of your compositions, and the calmness of your detached viewpoints. To a degree, I have the sense that you are photographing with a forgiving eye toward humanity. We are eating ourselves and destroying the world, but we really just can’t help it, can we?</strong> </p> \n<p>TS: If I had to draw a parallel with literature, I see myself as a theatre playwright: I stand off-stage, very much centered in the theatre hall, and I observe. My photography is classic, it doesn’t pretend to surprise by a technical display. Nor does it pretend to explain. I like the observer to have room for interpretation. Photography is polysemic, its readings don’t depend entirely on just what I try to say. The viewer, through their emotional experience, gives meaning to that image. My photographs make sense when they leave me and someone else fills them with meaning. </p> \n<p>In terms of my technique, one of the reasons why I use analog photography is because I like to follow my intuition. With analog photography you cannot correct the photo you just made; you just have to keep going. Keep yourself very focused on what you do and stop, at least, every time you change the film. Digital photography is much faster. You are always attentive to what goes on the screen, which is ultimately the photo. </p> \n<p>I appreciate the wait I was subjected to when I sent the photographic rolls to the laboratory. I like to look at the backlit negatives. In short, I like the rituals of analog photography. While it is true that photography exists as a consequence of a technological fact, that is the camera, this interface between the world and the artist makes me very uncomfortable. The camera discovers you and interrupts your thoughts. But at the same time, in the realms of aesthetics and form, it offers you a multitude of possibilities that you can use skillfully. The great paradox of working with a large format analog camera mounted on a tripod, is that it complicates the rituals that accompany the photographic act. The more visible I am, the more unnoticed I am too. </p> \n<p><strong></strong> </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>From “Perfect Day” (MACK, 2020).

Each book deals with a very precise theme that at the same time alludes to three circumstances that define us as a species: sociability, self-awareness and our relationship with the physical environment. This trilogy focuses on a dystopian version of these circumstances. <em>The Waiting Game 3</em> is the project that closes the trilogy. </p> \n<p>The images are also taken again in the Spanish Mediterranean and once again follow the same working protocol. In this case, the relationship between man and dog is a theme that allows me to address the way in which man relates to his environment in a dystopian way. The subject of my work is the dog on a leash, chained to the walls or fences of factories, industrial estates, farms, properties. It is the dog that waits and protects, that is born and dies in the same place and that lives at the mercy of its owner. A human capable, as in many other facets of our relationship with the environment, of distancing themselves emotionally from their animal to the extent of cruelty. </p> \n<div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n <div class=\"picture\"> \n  <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18885-perfect-day\"></a> \n </div> \n <div class=\"title\">\n  Perfect Day \n  <br> </br>\n </div> \n <div class=\"author\">\n  by Txema Salvans\n  <br> </br>\n </div> \n <div class=\"publisher\">\n  Publisher: MACK\n  <br>ISBN: 978-1-912339-68-6<br> </br></br>\n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n <div class=\"picture\"> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n  <div class=\"picture\"> \n  </div> \n  <p><br> </br></p> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/martin-middlebrook-isolation-afghanistan\">Isolation: Afghanistan</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/zhang-kechun-between-the-mountains-and-water\">Between the Mountains and Water</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-editors-the-best-of-lensculture-in-2014\">The Best of LensCulture in 2014</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/raymond-meeks-halfstory-halflife\">Halfstory Halflife</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/salma-abedin-prithi-mundane\">Mundane</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/scarlett-coten-mectoub\">Mectoub</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/2508c7ee-fab4-49a6-9328-9426307198bc.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n <figure>\n  <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9d87e7ee-29ea-49b1-92e5-b2bd5789b418.jpg\" />\n </figure>\n</section>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 10:19:57 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/2508c7ee-fab4-49a6-9328-9426307198bc.jpg","linkMd5":"8fdf9c645003e1ec9eade01b7f698fea","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-49-051_248a783d43fddc31.webp","destWidth":375,"destHeight":250,"sourceBytes":152389,"destBytes":20780,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/2508c7ee-fab4-49a6-9328-9426307198bc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-37-49-051_248a783d43fddc31.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/2508c7ee-fab4-49a6-9328-9426307198bc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-37-52-624_2bfe802f0731e352.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9d87e7ee-29ea-49b1-92e5-b2bd5789b418.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-13-469_e3820760a4db77b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066809},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"to Hans","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vivian-keulards-to-hans","description":"<hgroup>\n <h1>to Hans</h1>\n <h3 class=\"fl-author\">Vivian Keulards</h3>\n</hgroup>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/bc49768c-14c7-4e03-a426-48edd813a216.jpg\" />\n <figcaption>\n  A quiet ode to a brother loved and lost, Vivian Keulards’ book “to Hans” finds a form to dwell on the human stories behind addiction, and the complex web it spins around those it touches.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The first image in Dutch photographer Vivian Keulards’ book <em>to Hans</em> is an old archival one from her family album, depicting her and her older brother as small children in 1974. Standing in front of their house in the late-afternoon light they wear helmets and grin up into the camera, his arm around her, their small frames throwing long shadows across the lawn. The image is all washed out orange and warm tones, taken on Kodachrome or Polaroid SX-70, perhaps. Several blank pages later, the next photograph is markedly cooler and starker; part of a concrete-lined pond seen from above on a dark, grey day. Most of the images from here retain this palette. What follows are rainy reflections, shadowy doorways and beds unslept in at the first light of morning. Occasionally, there is a portrait with the face blanked out, or a still life staged for the camera. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Hans and Vivian (1971) – photo from the family’s archive. From the book “To Hans” © Vivian Keulards\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vivian-keulards-to-hans#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>In <em>to Hans</em>, Keulards finds a way to speak for the first time about her brother’s addiction-related death after almost 15 years of her family keeping it—and his struggle leading up to it—under wraps. “It’s a personal story with a universal mission: to show the human story behind addiction,” she writes. Her brother’s illness became taboo, wrapped up in shame, but at some point, she says, she decided to “open up the curtains. With all the consequences. Good and bad…” This book has been the result. Hans, of course, had a personal trajectory of addiction—a story of how one vice replaced another until eventually something bigger than him took his life—but Keulards doesn’t tell us any of those specifics here. At least not directly. She tells us more in interviews and on her website, but it feels right to only try to read the book with what parts of him we’ve been given in the pages. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Spread from “to Hans” © Vivian Keulards\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vivian-keulards-to-hans#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>It would be almost impossible to try to shrink down and crystallize a whole life, with all of its complexities and pains and joys, neatly into a set of images, but what we can do with photography—what is vital to do with photography—is to use it to feel around the edges of experiences and how they move us, to visualize them in ways other forms of language cannot, and that is what Keulards does with great sensitivity here. She refers to her process of making this book as a sort of organizing of thoughts and feelings, and we come to learn that it is not so much about Hans, but more about the presence and subsequent loss of him and how that eclipsed her own existence over the years; an exercise in how to make art about yourself through the impressions someone else has left on you. Throughout the sequence of the book, Keulards travels to the hotel in Berlin in which Hans died in 2005, confronts the space, opens the curtains and looks out of the windows, wondering what he saw or thought about in those last hours. Photographs detailing all of that journey are catalogued here. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Curtains hotel room. For years we kept the cause of his death and his struggle with addiction secret. It was a taboo. I decided to open up the curtains. With all the consequences. Mainly good ones and a few bad.

In one image that folds out towards the end of the book we see her back arched forwards with rose thorns placed all the way along her spine, appearing creature-like with protective spikes. These pictures specifically work like small reminders throughout the sequence that bodies are worn, and can be worn away, by the things that happen to us and the people we love. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Rose thorns on back. As a child when I had nightmares my scary dreams always ended between my shoulder blades: biting, scratching, a knife… Looking back and working on my feelings I grew rose thorns to protect myself. I became strong and dare to stand for what I believe in.

Keulards’ question, in pictures, is the exact opposite: why him and not me? Mohren refers to himself as a puzzle, and that stuck with me, reminding me of my own father, who suffered with alcoholism throughout my childhood. It made me think of space, and how an addicted person’s mood can shape a whole room, their anger or sadness or joy swelling up and filling every crack and crevice, and every pocket of time in the day. “It eats away at you from within. Destroys you. Devours you alive,” continues Mohren, “Oh, and it devours all those around you too…” </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Horse. This was the beginning of my quest, in 2013. I was uncomfortable and not feeling well. Hans died in 2005. This was 8 years later. I knew it was time for me to start healing. For two years I have been living under a rock, visited a therapist and excluded dear people from my life. I looked back to everything that happened in my life. Not easy, but for the better now. From the book “to Hans” © Vivian Keulards\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vivian-keulards-to-hans#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>All of the images in <em>to Hans</em> work like puzzle pieces, scattered out across pages, with endless white space between them. Keulards has made it our job as the viewer to sit and spend time with the book and piece the story together. Her use of Japanese binding places us next to her as she “opens the curtains.” There are surface images we can see clear as day—inside the room, as it were—and then gauzy, ghostly ones printed on the underside of the folds, inaccessible for a proper look, symbolizing what’s beyond the curtain. Those pictures haunt the visible ones, and the dichotomy between them reminds us of what’s said and what’s not said; what’s on the surface and presented, and what lingers in the lacunae beneath. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>Bell boy. Visiting the Berlin hotel, he was the first person to welcome us. Unintentionally he gave me the shivers, not knowing the real reason for my visit. \n<br>Spread from “to Hans” © Vivian Keulards<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/vivian-keulards-to-hans#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> <p>The whole time I was writing about Keulards’ book, I was thinking about a literary meditation the American poet and essayist Anne Boyer wrote on her diagnosis with cancer in <em>The New Yorker</em> last year. In it, she talks at length about the state of illness, or ‘being ill’ and its slow spread into all parts of her life, and details the moment she told her daughter that her genetic test had come back negative, meaning that she doesn’t have to worry that she is predisposed to getting it too. Her daughter’s response floored her: “You forget,” she answers, “that I still have the curse of living in the world that made you sick.” </p> <p>These powerful words work here with Keulards too, because addiction is an illness, and in some ways it feels like that is what she’s saying. “The cause then: something in the genes, predisposition, upbringing. Or not. Just a series of switches in the wrong position. We don’t know exactly,” Mohren says eventually. “It’s not a huge disaster. What’s more important is how we deal with it. And when I say ‘we’, I mean every one of us.” Punctuating the edit with more family pictures, Keulards makes it clear that Hans’ life—in all its beauty—affected hers in good ways, regardless of its tragic end. </p> \n <div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n </div>Forest. My quest was hard and scary, but necessary to order my thoughts and feelings. I wanted answers to my life questions. With this project I stand for what I believe in. Sharing pain is healing. I believe in the good of people. I share this personal project for a bigger purpose: showing the human being behind addiction.

I remember thinking how fitting it was that it was Autumn and he’d turned with the leaves. It was alcohol-related jaundice, I found out later, but at the time I wondered if it was possible that bodies could turn different colors based on the things we’d done—as if our emotional temperatures could color our outward appearances. How odd that he’d turned yellow then, I thought, before I really understood. Of all the colors, red would surely have seemed more fitting. I don’t know why Keulards chose yellow for the cover of <em>to Hans</em>—it’s one of the only design choices she doesn’t explain—but in many ways it works as the color most associated with the ripple-effects of addiction.To me, at least, but I’d imagine to others whose lives have been altered by the presence of a person addicted too. “Addiction doesn’t exclude anyone…No race, no orientation, not your background, not the color of your hair. Not if you have yellowed or snow-white teeth…” writes Mohren. Somewhere on the way to mustard but not quite, the yellow of Keulards’ cover has parts of a xerox-quality gridded image of Hans printed upon it. It makes his face the brightest bit of the book. </p> \n <hr> \n  <div> \n   <div class=\"article-incut -book-incut\"> \n    <div class=\"picture\"> \n     <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/books/18887-to-hans\"></a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"title\">\n     to Hans\n     <br> </br>\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"author\">\n     by Vivian Keulards\n     <br> </br>\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"publisher\">\n     Publisher: Schilt Publishing\n     <br>ISBN: 9789053309384<br> </br></br>\n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div>\n  <p>Enjoy more great photography:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/luis-gonzalez-palma-scenes\">Scenes</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/photo-london-photo-london-2016-portrait-focus\">Photo London 2016: Portrait Focus</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/daniel-terna-things-we-can-relate-to\">Things We Can Relate To</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rafael-soldi-reflecting-on-childhood-aggression-and-intimacy-at-the-playground\">Reflecting on Childhood: Aggression and Intimacy at the Playground</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/alberto-giuliani-surviving-humanity\">Surviving Humanity</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/timo-kelaranta-the-house-of-poets\">The House of Poets</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <section class=\"fl-slideshow\">\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bc49768c-14c7-4e03-a426-48edd813a216.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9017f958-c1a0-4c54-93a1-00a76b9a675e.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/0ac2f447-b82f-4c54-a80a-9fb32fa2b0fa.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/69f842be-8be6-4a24-bdd7-4a308859ffcb.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8e140731-d7df-49f7-8ee1-69b90018876d.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n   <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/large/357c1188-14e4-439f-8572-161de7eed029.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n  </section> \n </hr></br>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:02:50 +0000","feedId":13500,"bgimg":"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/bc49768c-14c7-4e03-a426-48edd813a216.jpg","linkMd5":"7f19e47bd880259c54e1359c3d377fe2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-47-066_1e4a36f51bec9a38.webp","destWidth":562,"destHeight":843,"sourceBytes":395304,"destBytes":11402,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/bc49768c-14c7-4e03-a426-48edd813a216.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-37-47-066_1e4a36f51bec9a38.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/bc49768c-14c7-4e03-a426-48edd813a216.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-00-675_46ce7ae15ec9d17c.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/9017f958-c1a0-4c54-93a1-00a76b9a675e.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-38-11-382_9ca3a72bc1573248.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/0ac2f447-b82f-4c54-a80a-9fb32fa2b0fa.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-00-902_82f0859e384021bc.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/69f842be-8be6-4a24-bdd7-4a308859ffcb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-37-55-421_451ce5a0c330ee39.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/8e140731-d7df-49f7-8ee1-69b90018876d.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-37-55-016_cd62e0cac3335fca.webp","https://photos.lensculture.com/large/357c1188-14e4-439f-8572-161de7eed029.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-38-05-271_fe5952351dbc03a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323066810},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:37:46","title":"65 Amazing Photo Series Inspired by the Earth","link":"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-editors-65-amazing-photo-series-inspired-by-the-earth","description":"\n        <hgroup><h1>65 Amazing Photo Series Inspired by the Earth</h1><h3 class=\"fl-author\">LensCulture Editors</h3></hgroup><figure><img src=\"https://photos.lensculture.com/flipcover/9fcbb7f1-9190-4bd5-bbd7-6fc60d7c08e9.jpg\"/><figcaption>The wonders and calamities of nature and life on Earth seem as endless as the cosmos themselves — Here are 65 amazing photo series that draw their inspiration from the beauty of nature, the cycles of life, changing weather and environments, and much more.</figcaption></figure><p>\n\tThe wonders and calamities of nature and life on Earth seem as endless as the cosmos themselves.

<figcaption>\n  A London-based street photographer gives us an intimate look inside UK supermarkets during the coronavirus pandemic.\n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Adapting to new protocols demanded by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, even something as mundane as the “Saturday shop” — the weekly routine for most working individuals and families only a few weeks ago — feels like ancient history. As the new normal sets in, it has created a huge chasm between today’s reality and life BC (Before Corona). </p> \n<p>London-based street photographer Dougie Wallace has adapted his calling (to capture the zeitgeist in his uniquely droll style) as he sets out to document the “only show in town”. Supermarket shopping is now one of the only public activities that calls for live interactions, and Wallace catches the moods and fashions as winter turns to spring, and shoppers adapt to new routines. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Dougie Wallace\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dougie-wallace-adapting-to-covid-19-in-london-s-supermarkets#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>After early days of panic buying and empty shelves, life under lockdown has started to develop its own new ways. Shoppers patiently queue to get into a shop while killing time by staring into their mobiles or reading newspapers or books. White-collar workers dress down, as their professions allow them to work from the comfort of their homes. The rebels dress up, as if to defy the curfew on social gatherings. Supermarket workers keep it ticking for everyone, often at great personal risk over long hours. </p> \n<p>The mask continues to be the symbol of this crisis. There’s been a lot of polemic about the UK government’s unpreparedness for the pandemic and the resultant fear of stock depletion of medical masks for frontline workers. It seems that one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world could not provide enough masks and protective equipment for those whose jobs involve saving lives, let alone for ordinary citizens. To substitute for the lack of availability, people got creative. Some homemade masks are simply functional, using advice circulating online on how to make your own mask. Others are more inventive – ranging from outlandish to plain bonkers. For the fashion-conscious, entrepreneurial makers are also beginning to oblige. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Dougie Wallace\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dougie-wallace-adapting-to-covid-19-in-london-s-supermarkets#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>While we are all in this together, the real heroes of this story are the supermarket staff and the other key workers. Uniformed security guards regulate the flow of shoppers on a “one-in-one-out” basis, as in nightclubs. Checkout staff, directly facing customers, each a potential carrier of this deadly threat, are on the front line. Shop floor staff are doing their utmost to go about their duties, servicing customers, whilst trying to observe the newly imposed two-trolley-width distancing rules – all but impossible when stocking shelves in the narrow aisles of a Tesco Metro. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Dougie Wallace\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dougie-wallace-adapting-to-covid-19-in-london-s-supermarkets#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>According to reports, some supermarket staff faced resistance from employers in relation to wearing protection, for fear that customers would find them unsettling, or worse, that the workers would demand “hazard pay” considering their greater level of exposure to the virus. Over time, employers, nevertheless, introduced a range of safety measures to create a new barricaded shopping landscape. These include plexiglass partitions for checkout lanes and branded uniforms, whether aprons or T-shirts, all blasted with slogans such as “Keep-2m-Apart”. However, unlike shoppers, who are encouraged to be expedient with their shopping trip, staff, if they are to work, have no choice but to spend eight hours or so a day trying to breathe damp, exhaled air through fabric. </p> \n<div class=\"article-photo-placeholder\"> \n</div>© Dougie Wallace\n<a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/dougie-wallace-adapting-to-covid-19-in-london-s-supermarkets#\" class=\"add-to-collection-inline-photo\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></a> \n<p>Street photography can be challenging at any time but navigating through the health warnings of 2m distance-keeping makes the challenge of getting a good shot even greater. Wallace shoots with an Olympus EM1 Mark 3, which is small, fast and light. Yet he says he’s still struggling with the professional hazard of holding a camera close to the face while trying not to touch one’s face and remembering to regularly sanitize hands and equipment to protect against the invisible enemy. “No matter how long I’ve been doing this, some of the new practices still feel counterintuitive. We’re all learning how to do this new thing together,” he says.<br> </br></p> \n<p>— Lida Hujic </p> \n<hr> \n <p><em>Dougie Wallace has published six photobooks.
