The villages' surroundings were filled with nuts, stone fruit, berries, and herbs—several non-native to the area and many that would never grow together naturally. The significance of these forest gardens went largely overlooked and unrecognized by modern archeology for the next 50-plus years.</p>\n<p>In the last few decades, archeologists have learned that perennial forest management—the creation and care of long-lived food-bearing shrubs and plants next to forests—was common among the Indigenous societies of North America’s northwestern coast. The forest gardens played a central role in the diet and stability of these cultures in the past, and now a <a href=\"https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art6/\">new publication</a> shows that they offer an example of a far more sustainable and biodiverse alternative to conventional agriculture.</p>\n<p>This research, which was done in collaboration with the Tsm’syen and Coast Salish First Nations, shows that the gardens have become lasting hotspots of biodiversity, even 150 years after colonists forcibly removed the inhabitants from their villages. This work, combining archeology, botany, and ecology, is the first to systematically study the long-term ecological effects of Indigenous peoples’ land use in the region. The gardens offer ideas for farming practices that might restore, rather than deplete, local resources to create healthier, more resilient ecosystems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765746#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765746&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 20:15:11 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stsailes-FG-Aerial-800x600.jpg","linkMd5":"ca5f27360d766093c86c8a453e90a6d7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-01-747_ef9552ebfe128b42.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":98687,"destBytes":61690,"author":"Ars Contributors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stsailes-FG-Aerial-800x600.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-01-747_ef9552ebfe128b42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn51@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-674_a2bb705bf77352f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=3-170gmnLpA:AO3dtHY_Nrs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn37@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-32-655_240eab67d75217a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn57@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-636_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-656_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161629},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Climate change is erasing humanity’s oldest art","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765735","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Image-3-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"color photo of archaeologists examining rock art in a dark cave\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Image-3.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"960\" data-width=\"1280\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Detailed rock-art recording by ARKENAS archaeologist in Maros-Pangkep.

As water flows through a limestone cave system, it carries minerals from the local bedrock, and the minerals eventually end up in the limestone. At the limestone's surface, those minerals oxidize into a case-hardened rocky crust. Nearly all of the oldest rock art in Maros-Pangkep—like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/this-painted-pig-is-the-worlds-oldest-figurative-art/\">the oldest drawing in the world</a> that depicts an actual object—is painted in red or mulberry-purple pigment on that hard outer layer.

People who had been infected by the virus produced varying amounts of antibodies, and it wasn't clear what levels were needed to provide protection. Similar issues applied to figuring out how long protection lasted, given that antibody levels appeared to decline over time. Those questions have implications for whether we will eventually need booster shots to maintain our immunity.</p>\n<p>The most common way of looking at immunity at the beginning of the pandemic was to check for neutralizing antibodies, which could block the virus's ability to infect new cells. But we've gone through much of the pandemic without knowing exactly how levels of these antibodies relate to protection.</p>\n<p>Evidence has been building that neutralizing antibodies directly correlate with protection, and a new paper provides some of the most decisive evidence yet.

Physicists have now discovered a rare material known as a quasicrystal in one of the trinitite samples. According to <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101350118\">a new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that makes the discovery the oldest <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropogenic\">anthropogenic</a> quasicrystal yet known.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nautil.us/blog/the-unlikely-rocks-found-in-mosques-siberia--outer-space\">very definition of a crystal</a> assumes a precisely symmetrical ordering of atoms in periodic patterns that repeat over and over in a 3D lattice. The patterns look the same no matter which direction you look at them, but quasicrystals are different. They clearly follow mathematical rules, but each cell has a slightly different configuration of cells nearby rather than repeating in an identical pattern. It's that unique structure that gives quasicrystals their unusual properties.</p>\n<p>Think about tiling a bathroom floor. The tiles can only be in certain symmetrical shapes (triangles, squares, or hexagons); otherwise, you wouldn't be able to fit them together without leaving gaps or overlapping tiles. Pentagons, icosahedrons, and similar shapes with different symmetries that never precisely repeat just won’t work—except in the case of quasicrystals, where nature decided they <em>could</em> work. The trick is to fill the gaps with other kinds of atomic shapes to create the unlikely aperiodic structure.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765764#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765764&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 21:10:02 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quasiTOP-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"061be6900af35533003aee6a70326fe6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-723_8314db35426d2710.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":52577,"destBytes":33694,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quasiTOP-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-723_8314db35426d2710.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-32-841_15927172a2330c53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=rIS6bSQIW6Q:nUdhkEh45F8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn100@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-32-653_b515235b06b0485c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn57@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-636_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-656_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161629},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Shake-up reported at the CDC; two high-profile officials depart","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765994","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1232824852-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"A serious woman speaks into a microphone while seated next to a pump dispenser of hand sanitizer.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1232824852.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2000\" data-width=\"3000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, May 11, 2021.

Among animals, however, laughter usually communicates something along the lines of “this is playtime—I’m not actually going for your throat.”</p>\n<p>According to new research from the University of California, Los Angeles, there are likely at least 65 different creatures, including humans, that make these vocalizations. They’re most commonly found in primates, but they have also been noted in distant relatives like birds. It’s not clear whether this is because laughter has arisen several times over the course of evolution or if it’s more widespread and we just haven’t noticed.</p>\n<h2>Laughter in the library stacks</h2>\n<p>To reach this number, Sasha Winkler, a PhD student in UCLA’s anthropology department, searched high and low for any mention of animals making noises during play sessions. Some of the articles she found were quite old—one paper on mink dates back to 1931—so she ended up dusting off some aged tomes in the university’s library.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765400#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765400&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 May 2021 13:57:23 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-173054411-800x640.jpg","linkMd5":"e33f11bff0775601157150f31028e346","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn18@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-922_e1ad4c65bd27aa50.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":83212,"destBytes":42738,"author":"Ars Staff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-173054411-800x640.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn18@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-922_e1ad4c65bd27aa50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn94@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-32-862_40f3474dcf5bd6b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=MUHA7juxIG4:h69txQqvDj4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn62@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-999_34a8bc253606c8d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn57@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-636_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-656_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161629},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Rocket Report: Starship orbital flight details, Ariane 5 may delay Webb launch","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765014","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/51171019709_19e6fc54b3_k-800x485.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke and flame surround a squat rocket as it lifts off.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/51171019709_19e6fc54b3_k.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1240\" data-width=\"2047\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Starship SN15 takes to the skies in early April.

Once a crisis hit a critical point—when things became a matter of life and death—people would come around, the thinking went.</p>\n<p>Obviously, that hasn't been the case. The US public's skepticism toward science is extending toward one of its most important developments: vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines offer both the prospect of a return to normal life and limits on the risk of dangerous coronavirus variants evolving—but only if enough people are vaccinated.

Neuroscientists just pick the (animal) neurons they’re interested in, genetically engineer them to express a light-responsive protein, and then stimulate them with the right type of light. This technique can be used to inhibit or excite a select subset of neurons in living, breathing, moving animals, illuminating which neural networks dictate the animals' behaviors and decisions.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of work done in miniaturizing the optogenetic hardware, researchers have now used optogenetics to alter the activity in parts of the brain that influence social interactions in mice. And they’ve exerted a disturbing level of control over the way the mice interact.</p>\n<h2>Going small</h2>\n<p>A big limitation for early optogenetic studies was that the wires and optical fibers required to get light into an animal’s brain also get in the animals’ way, impeding their movements and potentially skewing results. Newer implantable wireless devices were developed about five years ago, but they can only be placed near certain brain regions. They're also too tiny to accommodate many circuit components and receiver antennas, and they have to be programmed beforehand. Pity the poor would-be mind controllers who have to deal with such limited tools.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765264#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765264&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 May 2021 20:24:11 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-520065012-800x538.jpg","linkMd5":"a86e6b87cb806fb506f9711250b449a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-727_4c08eaa08c196696.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":538,"sourceBytes":101180,"destBytes":85362,"author":"Ars Contributors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-520065012-800x538.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-727_4c08eaa08c196696.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn54@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-989_581e5cfea079745f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=u7Hr2EMKFic:1Q9lsJgeP0w:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-32-861_b909ef57b86f1881.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn57@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-32-636_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-656_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436161629},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:01","title":"Mount Vesuvius victims died just moments away from rescue","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765087","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/a61a6df9cc16d0199129c99cd61b5b81.jpg\" alt=\"armi del soldato\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">armi del soldato </p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>When Mount Vesuvius destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii in 79 CE, the eruption also killed hundreds of people huddled on the shores of nearby Herculaneum. A recent study of the remains of one victim, who died on the beach not far from a small naval vessel, suggests that he might have been a senior naval officer. If so, archaeological director Francesco Sirano and his colleagues suggest, the man may have been a rescue mission leader who arrived just in time to die with the people he was trying to save.</p>\n<h2>An untimely rescue</h2>\n<p>Pliny the Elder was a Roman naturalist and author who also found time to command the imperial fleet in the port city of Misenum, across the Bay of Naples from Pompeii and Herculaneum. During the height of Mount Vesuvius' eruption, Pliny the Elder sent boats to rescue survivors from the beach at Herculaneum, which lies northwest of Pompeii and almost due west of the volcano. At least 300 people had fled for the shore, only to find themselves trapped between the volcano’s wrath and the sea. Some sought shelter in nearby boat sheds while others gathered on the beach to wait for help.</p>\n<p>They never made it off the beach. A towering plume of material that had blasted skyward from the volcano finally collapsed under its own weight and sent a deadly wave of hot gas and debris, called a pyroclastic flow, flooding down the mountain’s slopes at nearly 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour). Like the pyroclastic flows that struck Pompeii, this one <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/\">brought instant, searing death</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765087#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765087&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=7HrPAPAoEhI:cNTPBfOm-bE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 May 2021 16:51:24 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/a61a6df9cc16d0199129c99cd61b5b81.jpg","linkMd5":"b49b0122640c25cbb1c1852f792686b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn10@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-933_c7f42bf0eb982b86.webp","destWidth":515,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":52737,"destBytes":44396,"author":"Kiona N.

Last year, astronomers proposed a possible underlying mechanism—an increase in the density of oxygen atoms—although the theory was admittedly speculative. Now, a new analysis by researchers at the University of Helsinki provides evidence to confirm that explanation, according to <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020AV000338\">a recent paper</a> published in the journal AGU Advances.</p>\n<p>Most people have a passing familiarity with the atmospheric phenomenon known as the northern lights (or the southern lights if they appear in the southern hemisphere). The spectacular kaleidoscopic effects are the result of charged particles from the Sun being dumped into the Earth's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere\">magnetosphere</a>, where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules—an interaction that excites those molecules and makes them glow. Auroras typically present as shimmering ribbons in the sky, with green, purple, blue, and yellow hues. The lights tend to only be visible in polar regions because the particles follow the Earth's magnetic field lines, which fan out from the vicinity of the poles.</p>\n<p>Discoveries of possible new types of auroras are rare. Back in 2016, enthusiasts observed a different kind of aurora that was visible at more southern latitudes.
