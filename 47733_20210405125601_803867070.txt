There are a variety of ways to approach your accessibility implementation, but the first step is to perform an audit on your app. By auditing your app, you can identify all of the improvement areas and outline the items needed to make your app fully accessible.</p>\n<p>When it comes to auditing your app, there are a variety of tools and methods available to help. Generally, you&#8217;ll want to spend time getting familiar with accessibility features and navigating through your app as one of your users. Xcode also provides the Accessibility Inspector, which is a handy way to see what accessibility settings might be missing on User Interface (UI) elements.</p>\n<h2>Manually Auditing</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s best to explore the different accessibility options on your iOS device before anything else. Getting familiar with how users navigate apps using assistive technologies is essential to understanding where you should improve your app.</p>\n<h3>VoiceOver</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/voiceover-settings/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4738\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4738 size-full\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings.png\" alt=\"iOS VoiceOver settings\" width=\"1242\" height=\"2688\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings.png 1242w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings-139x300.png 139w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings-473x1024.png 473w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings-768x1662.png 768w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings-710x1536.png 710w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voiceover-settings-946x2048.png 946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a>When thinking about accessibility, the first thing that comes to mind is VoiceOver. iOS does a decent job at making labels, buttons, and sometimes images accessible by default, but there is still room for improvement. To tell how accessible your app truly is, enable VoiceOver on your device and run through it as a user. It&#8217;s important to both note which elements are focusable (they&#8217;ll appear with a box around them when focused and be read aloud) and the overall flow of the focus. To get a full example of using the app as a user, it&#8217;s helpful to enable the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">screen curtain</a> feature which will black out your screen while allowing you to use VoiceOver gestures. Once you have VoiceOver on, the easiest way to toggle screen-curtain is by using the three-finger triple-tap gesture.</p>\n<p>Try experimenting with different VoiceOver rotor options to see how elements are focused. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the rotor, <a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/getting-familiar-with-ios-voiceovers-rotor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">&#8220;Getting Familiar with iOS VoiceOver&#8217;s Rotor&#8221;</a> will get you started.</p>\n<h3>Display &#38; Text Size</h3>\n<p>VoiceOver isn&#8217;t the only accessibility feature you should explore. &#8220;Display &#38; Text Size&#8221; is another prominent feature and might be even more widely used than VoiceOver. Some users may be able to see but have a difficult time with small fonts on their devices. In the iOS Accessibility settings, there is an option to increase text size significantly. However, <code>UILabels</code> do not handle this out of the box. To test different font sizes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to Settings</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Display &#38; Text Size&#8221;</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Larger Text&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here you can change the text size with the slider at the bottom of the screen. To use even larger sizes, enable the &#8220;Larger Accessibility Sizes&#8221; toggle. Now the slider should show an even larger range of sizes.</p>\n<p>Returning to your app, take note of which labels, if any, respond to this setting. It&#8217;s important to take note if text gets cut off, truncated, or appears incorrectly. Buttons should also scale and increase their text size per the settings. It may be an edge case, but be sure to check the largest size together with the &#8220;Bold Text&#8221; option (also on the &#8220;Display &#38; Text Size&#8221; screen) to account for the largest option. Making your app look good and function at the largest size is a great way to ensure all sizes in between will likely work.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/dynamic-text/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4739\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4739\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dynamic-text.gif\" alt=\"Example of dynamic text\" width=\"888\" height=\"1920\" /></a>Tip:</strong> Try using &#8220;Smart Invert&#8221; to find items that aren&#8217;t inverting but should and vice-versa. The more you track down and fix, the more useful your app will be for accessibility users!</p>\n<h3>Voice Control</h3>\n<p>Voice Control is a handy feature that can also aid you in assessing accessibility. It assumes that users have sight and voice and can use their voice to navigate their device using commands like &#8220;Swipe left,&#8221; &#8220;Tap,&#8221; etc. There&#8217;s also an &#8220;Overlay&#8221; option where you can enable &#8220;Item Names&#8221; which provides a nice at-a-glance view of what accessibility sees.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/voice-control/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4740\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4740 size-full\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voice-control.png\" alt=\"Voice control screen\" width=\"740\" height=\"1331\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voice-control.png 740w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voice-control-167x300.png 167w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/voice-control-569x1024.png 569w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a>Using Accessibility Inspector</h2>\n<p>Manually testing your app to see what is accessible is essential, but there are also tools available that can speed up your assessment by identifying the low-hanging fruit. The Accessibility Inspector can help you step through your app and scan all of the accessibility settings on UI elements for issues to fix. You can find the Accessibility Inspector in Developer Tools:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/accessibility-inspector-navigation/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4741\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4741\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/accessibility-inspector-navigation.png\" alt=\"Navigation to accessibility inspector\" width=\"874\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/accessibility-inspector-navigation.png 874w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/accessibility-inspector-navigation-300x218.png 300w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/accessibility-inspector-navigation-768x557.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" /></a>Open the &#8220;Xcode&#8221; menu in the menu bar</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Open Developer Tool&#8221;</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Accessibility Inspector&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In order to use the Accessibility Inspector to check your app, you&#8217;ll have to connect your device to your MacBook or launch your app in a simulator.

For the purposes of accessibility, we&#8217;re going to focus on the &#8220;Basic&#8221; section. In there, you can see the values set for the <code>accessibilityLabel</code>, <code>accessibilityValue</code>, <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, and the <code>accessibilityIdentifier</code>. By pressing the &#8220;Audio&#8221; button, you can also hear the label read aloud. Keep in mind that this isn&#8217;t always exactly what VoiceOver speaks on a device! For one thing, it does not voice or show the <code>accessibilityHint</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/inspector-populated/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4743\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4743 size-full\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated.png\" alt=\"Inspected element cowboy hat detail screen\" width=\"1278\" height=\"1286\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated.png 1278w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated-298x300.png 298w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated-1018x1024.png 1018w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated-150x150.png 150w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspector-populated-768x773.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px\" /></a>There are multiple options available for navigating through the focusable elements in your app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/blob/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/inspection-pointer.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/raw/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/inspection-pointer.png\" alt=\"\" /></a> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4745 alignnone\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/inspection-pointer.png\" alt=\"inspection pointer\" width=\"58\" height=\"40\" /> Enable the <strong>Inspection Pointer</strong> which allows you to hover over simulator elements.</li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4748 alignnone\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/previous-button.png\" alt=\"previous button\" width=\"58\" height=\"40\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4746 alignnone\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/next-button.png\" alt=\"next button\" width=\"58\" height=\"40\" /> Use the <strong>Next/Previous element buttons</strong> to manually move through elements in focus order.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/blob/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/play-button.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/raw/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/play-button.png\" alt=\"\" /></a> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4747 alignnone\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/play-button.png\" alt=\"play button\" width=\"58\" height=\"40\" /> Press the <strong>Play button</strong> to automatically move through elements as VoiceOver finishes voicing each one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/blob/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/audio-button.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/raw/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/z/audio-button.png\" alt=\"\" /></a> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4744 alignnone\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audio-button.png\" alt=\"audio button\" width=\"58\" height=\"40\" /> You also have the option to navigate through the elements without any audio by toggling the <strong>audio button</strong> off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By going through your app with the Accessibility Inspector, you can verify accessibility settings and perform a more in-depth audit of what is missing.</p>\n<h3>Inspector Audit</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, the Accessibility Inspector also has an audit feature! This goes through all of the UI elements on the screen and lets you know which ones may be inaccessible with VoiceOver. It also lets you know which elements don&#8217;t support Dynamic Text.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/audit/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4749\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4749 size-full\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit.png\" alt=\"accessibility inspector audit screen\" width=\"1278\" height=\"1286\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit.png 1278w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-298x300.png 298w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-1018x1024.png 1018w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-150x150.png 150w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-768x773.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px\" /></a>Simply switching to the audit screen and pressing &#8220;Run Audit&#8221; gives you a list of issues to fix. Above, you can see that the screen audited is missing accessibility settings on multiple UI elements, and its labels don&#8217;t allow dynamic sizing. The eye button next to each item will show you which UI element the warning is referring to. There is also a button with a question mark in a circle next to that which provides suggestions on how to fix the issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/auditing-your-app-for-accessibility/audit-issue/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4750\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4750 size-full\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue.png\" alt=\"audit issue example\" width=\"2256\" height=\"2106\" srcset=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue.png 2256w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue-300x280.png 300w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue-1024x956.png 1024w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue-768x717.png 768w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue-1536x1434.png 1536w, https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audit-issue-2048x1912.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2256px) 100vw, 2256px\" /></a>Fixing all of these warnings is a great start to making your app more accessible! As you fix issues, you can re-run the audit periodically to check what is left to fix. These tools are a great starting point, but it&#8217;s critical to also manually test your app as a user to verify things work as expected when using accessibility options.</p>\n<h3>Inspector Settings</h3>\n<p>You might have noticed that there&#8217;s a settings button available in the Accessibility Inspector as well. These settings allow you to make real-time adjustments to your app to test accessibility. For example, if you enable Dynamic Text on a label, using the font size slider will change the size of text on the simulator immediately.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"user-content-conclusion\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/bignerdranch/blogposts/blob/d5f572b058894f653228a841a56a16f591e9446c/post.md#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a><a href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/?attachment_id=4751\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4751\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4751\" style=\"margin: 0;\" src=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/increase-text-size.gif\" alt=\"increase text size example\" width=\"600\" height=\"510\" /></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Making your app accessible isn&#8217;t as daunting as it seems. With all of the tools available and some time to audit your app, you can identify significant usability improvements. Implementing these improvements is a huge win for your users and makes your app more user-friendly for everyone!</p>\n<p>Ready to start implementing VoiceOver? <a
