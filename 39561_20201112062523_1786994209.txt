It cannot be created,” wrote Peter Shaffer in Equus, the marvelous play about a young man who commits an incomprehensible crime.  Once arrested, the young man is assigned a psychiatrist to try and make sense of the heinous crime. Uncovering the psychology of the distressed young man leads the psychiatrist to realize that to “cure” him is akin to a kind of lobotomy of his psyche: “He'll be delivered from madness. What then? He'll feel himself acceptable! What then? Do you think feelings like his can be simply re-attached, like plasters? Stuck on to other objects we select? Look at him! ... My desire might be to make this boy an ardent husband - a caring citizen - a worshipper of abstract and unifying God. My achievement, however, is more likely to make a ghost!” The play uses the heinous crime and subsequent psychological analysis of the young man as a springboard for a meditation on “normality” and “socialization”, asking uncomfortable questions about the soul-killing effects of compliance and conformity: “The Normal is the good smile in a child's eyes: - alright. It is also the dead stare in a million adults.” If you’ve never seen or read the play, I recommend it.  The final line has the psychiatrist resign himself to the fact that to “fix” this boy, he has amputated a part of his psyche. This realization leaves him alone in the dark, uttering these words: “There is now, in my mouth, this sharp chain. And it never comes out.”","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:35:12 +0000","feedId":39561,"bgimg":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/D3hNPum0MjI/hqdefault.jpg","linkMd5":"19422c07537b7cacc1957b147193ab67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_4/2020/11/12/06-25-22-173_14ec4a07b043529a.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":360,"sourceBytes":9931,"destBytes":12426,"author":"Jason Silva: Shots of Awe","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605162322031}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 14:25:22","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 14:25:22","feedId":39561,"fetchDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 06:25:22 +0000","fetchMs":26407,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":27323,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":15,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"259fd9e3ae01f734143a220053069654","hostName":"europe-25*","requestId":"808d6640c6654b00800a839a3c2399b6_39561","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx7":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:33:44","id":39561,"name":"Jason Silva: Shots of Awe","url":"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA","subscriber":81,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.youtube.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn55@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-33-43-255_338d4b3529898bf7.ico","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605162295618,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":26408,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":910,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/D3hNPum0MjI/hqdefault.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":480,"destHeight":360,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_4/2020/11/12/06-25-22-173_14ec4a07b043529a.webp","sourceBytes":9931,"destBytes":12426,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":39561,"totalSpendMs":763,"convertSpendMs":8,"createdTime":"2020-11-12 14:25:22","host":"us-54*","referer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3hNPum0MjI","linkMd5ListStr":"19422c07537b7cacc1957b147193ab67","githubUser":"myreaderx7","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"12.1 KB","compressRate":"125.1%","sourceSize":"9.7 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx7":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
