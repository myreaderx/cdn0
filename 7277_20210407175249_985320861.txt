also includes important keyword metrics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By default, you should see the following metrics in the keyword list:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Keyword search volume</li>\n <li>Your competitor’s rankings</li>\n <li>Your competitor’s organic clicks from that keyword</li>\n <li>The keyword’s difficulty rating</li>\n <li>The keyword’s average Cost Per Click (CPC)</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Take note that you can view other metrics by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>‘Columns’&nbsp;</strong>button and selecting them individually.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The additional metrics you can include in the keyword list are as follows:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Clicks –&nbsp;</strong>The total number of organic and paid clicks the keyword generates.</li>\n <li><strong>Not Clicked –&nbsp;</strong>The percentage of users who don’t click on any page from the search engine results page or SERP.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Mobile Searches –</strong>&nbsp;The percentage of users who used a mobile device when searching for the keyword.</li>\n <li><strong>Desktop Searches –&nbsp;</strong>The percentage of users who used a desktop or laptop when searching for the keyword.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Paid Clicks –</strong>&nbsp;Measures the percentage of users who click ads when searching for the keyword.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Organic Clicks –</strong>&nbsp;Measures the percentage of users who click organic results when searching for the keyword.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Monthly Cost –</strong>&nbsp;The estimated monthly cost advertisers spend on average to advertise for the keyword.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Ads –</strong>&nbsp;The number of advertisers that targeted the keyword in Pay Per Click (PPC) campaigns in the past 14 months.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Homepages –</strong>&nbsp;The number of homepages within the top results for the keyword.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img

With SpyFu, you’re only minutes away from unlocking a massive keyword list along with pertinent keyword metrics.</p> \n<p>Not to mention that SpyFu automatically groups keyword types into useful categories.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The transactional keywords group, in particular, is extremely helpful if you want keywords that can generate purchase-ready traffic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It may not be my absolute favorite keyword research tool.

And second, there’s the “Estimated Visits” metric, which measures the organic traffic your competitor gained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The estimated visits metric takes into consideration a couple of factors, namely:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Your competitor’s average SERP positions</li>\n <li>Their organic click-through rate (CTR)</li>\n <li>The average search volume of the keyword</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Finally, let’s take a quick look at the metrics KWFinder includes for the SERP overview.</p> \n<p>Check them out:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Domain Authority (DA) –&nbsp;</strong>An SEO ranking score developed by Moz. It is evaluated using different variables like the domain’s backlink profile, the quality of referring domains, and so on.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Page Authority (PA) –</strong>&nbsp;Basically the same as DA, but on a page-level. Similar to DA, it takes into consideration the domain’s backlink profile and other factors.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Citation Flow (CF) –</strong>&nbsp;This is a different SEO ranking score developed by Majestic. However, it ties more to the quantity of links that point to the domain or page.</li>\n <li><strong>Trust Flow (TF) –</strong>&nbsp;Also developed by Majestic, TF determines the ranking score of sites based on the quality of links. Quality is affected by the rank-worthiness of referring domains, which also depends on several on-page factors.</li>\n <li><strong>Links –</strong>&nbsp;This next metric measures the total count of backlinks that point to a specific URL. KWFinder also breaks down the total number of referring domains, referring IPs, and referring subnets.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Facebook Shares –</strong>&nbsp;KWFinder uses data fed by the Facebook API to measure the total number of shares a URL has. This can help you paint a picture of your competitor’s sharing activities.</li>\n <li><strong>Link Profile Strength (LPS) –</strong>&nbsp;Of course, Mangools also developed their own metric for their own SERP overview report.

Yes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Does it get the job done? Sure.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, I really wish they implemented a more compact design for the filter panel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I personally think the vertical layout of the filter options negatively affects usability.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It may not be an issue for all.

This includes their phone numbers, email, and social media profiles.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Initiate communications with prospective link sources –</strong>&nbsp;Added contacts will now appear in your outreach project. You can then initiate outreach from your SpyFu project through the contact methods available.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Track your progress with each prospect –</strong>&nbsp;As you wait for your link to be built, you can monitor your progress through the live tracker. Just update the status of each prospect to tags like “under review,” “need to reply,” “rejected,” and “link accepted.”</li>\n</ul> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h4>SpyFu Backlink Analysis Rating: 4 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>As much as I appreciate SpyFu’s backlink analysis tool, they left out a vital piece of information: link anchor texts.</p> \n<p>Your competitor’s anchor texts can tell you a lot about their link building strategy. More specifically, they can help you determine if they’re prioritizing branded or keyword-optimized links.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the bright side, SpyFu’s social outreach tool is surprisingly powerful. That’s something that can really turn backlink analysis insights into tangible action plans.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3 id=\"backlinkskwfinder\">KWFinder: Find current, new, and lost backlinks with LinkMiner</h3> \n<p>Again, KWFinder users will have to rely on another Mangools tool for backlink analysis.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With LinkMiner, your competitor’s backlink data – including new and lost backlinks – is at your disposal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After entering your competitor’s URL, LinkMiner will hit you with a nice, compact list of backlinks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Do note that you can tick the “One link per referring domain” option to tidy up the list.&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n  <img src=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LinkMiner-Search-Results.png\" alt=\"LinkMiner Interface\" class=\"wp-image-4050449\" srcset=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LinkMiner-Search-Results.png 1200w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LinkMiner-Search-Results-300x260.png 300w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LinkMiner-Search-Results-1024x887.png 1024w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LinkMiner-Search-Results-768x666.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Right there, you can immediately tell that Mangools put their best foot forward in terms of design.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The backlinks are neatly presented and it’s easy to locate the crucial metrics you should be paying attention to, namely:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul>\n <li>The referring domain’s Citation Flow and Trust Flow</li>\n <li>Number of external links on the referring page</li>\n <li>Number of Facebook shares</li>\n <li>The referring domain’s Alexa Rank</li>\n <li>The backlink’s target page</li>\n <li>Anchor text used</li>\n <li>Link Strength</li>\n</ul> \n<p>For your information, Link Strength is a metric developed by Mangools to measure a backlink’s SEO value.

But from a pure backlink analysis perspective, LinkMiner outclasses it in almost every way.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the only advantage SpyFu has over Mangools as far as backlinks are concerned is the quantity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While SpyFu can technically grab unlimited backlink data, LinkMiner starts at 100,000 rows per month for Mangools Basic users. Still, I think 100,000 backlink rows are more than enough, which is why I think Mangools should win this round.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h2 id=\"extra\">6.

But it’s still a very solid, well-rounded platform regardless.&nbsp;</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>KWFinder: Powerful toolbox for solo bloggers</h3> \n<p>When it comes to extra features, KWFinder’s advantage lies in the other tools under Mangools’s belt.&nbsp;</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Rank tracking&nbsp;</strong>– As a KWFinder user, you can use SERPWatcher to track the organic keyword rankings of any domain. It’s easy to set up and lets you track multiple keywords from KWFinder, a file upload, or through manual entry.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>SEO browser extension –&nbsp;</strong>Whether you’re a Mangools subscriber or not, you can take advantage of their homebrewed browser extension.

The tool also obtains data for those pages, including their Link Profile Strength, DA, and referring domains.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Anchor text filters –&nbsp;</strong>Mangools’s SiteProfiler not only displays the anchor texts in your competitor’s backlink profile. It will also give you a clear breakdown of their anchor text types, be it branded, naked, or keyword optimized.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts –&nbsp;</strong>Mangools supports keyboard shortcuts in all its SEO tools except for SiteProfiler. This simple feature has a huge, positive impact on your productivity.</li>\n</ul> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h4>KWFinder Extra Features Rating: 5 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>With the right approach, the Mangools suite of juicy SEO tools can help newbie bloggers become SEO rockstars.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But what’s really impressive is that they managed to make even their extra features easy to learn and use.

As a matter of fact, it’s more than capable of providing you with a long list of profitable keyword ideas.</p> \n<p>But since SpyFu can and will give you unlimited keyword suggestions, it’s objectively a step ahead of KWFinder this time.</p> \n<p>The winner of this round is&nbsp;<strong>SpyFu</strong>.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>3. Keyword filters</h3> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Filters-Winner.png\" alt=\"Keyword Filters Winner\" class=\"wp-image-4050466\" srcset=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Filters-Winner.png 1000w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Filters-Winner-300x120.png 300w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Filters-Winner-768x307.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\n</figure> \n<h4>SpyFu: 4 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<h4>KWFinder: 4 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>Both SpyFu and KWFinder handle keyword filters in their own way.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>SpyFu wins in terms of the sheer number of metrics you can use as filters. KWFinder, on the other hand, wins in terms of convenience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This round is a&nbsp;<strong>draw</strong>.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>4. Competitor research</h3> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Competitor-Research-Winner.png\" alt=\"Competitor Research Winner\" class=\"wp-image-4050467\" srcset=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Competitor-Research-Winner.png 1000w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Competitor-Research-Winner-300x120.png 300w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Competitor-Research-Winner-768x307.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\n</figure> \n<h4>SpyFu: 5 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<h4>KWFinder: 4 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>True to its name, SpyFu proves it’s one of the leading competitor research tools money can buy right now.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Compared to KWFinder, SpyFu is simply better if you want to analyze competitor data – period.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The winner of this round is&nbsp;<strong>SpyFu</strong>.&nbsp;</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>5. Backlink Analysis&nbsp;</h3> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Backlink-Analysis-Winner.png\" alt=\"Backlink Analysis Winner\" class=\"wp-image-4050468\" srcset=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Backlink-Analysis-Winner.png 1000w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Backlink-Analysis-Winner-300x120.png 300w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Backlink-Analysis-Winner-768x307.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\n</figure> \n<h4>SpyFu: 4 out of 5 stars&nbsp;</h4> \n<h4>KWFinder: 5 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>Now, this caught me by surprise.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I honestly expected SpyFu to outperform KWFinder. But after a side-by-side comparison of their backlink analysis features, KWFinder came out on top.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Apart from the seamless backlink filter option, it can also help you spot new and lost links. It also reveals the anchor texts used in links – something SpyFu can’t do.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The winner of this round is&nbsp;<strong>KWFinder</strong>.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>6. Extra features</h3> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Extra-Features-Winner.png\" alt=\"Extra Features Winner\" class=\"wp-image-4050469\" srcset=\"https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Extra-Features-Winner.png 1000w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Extra-Features-Winner-300x120.png 300w, https://masterblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Extra-Features-Winner-768x307.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\n</figure> \n<h4>SpyFu: 4 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<h4>KWFinder: 5 out of 5 stars</h4> \n<p>Both SpyFu and KWFinder are loaded with extra features to keep you busy for days.</p> \n<p>However, KWFinder has a much more practical set of those extra features, especially for the average blogger. Some of SpyFu’s additional features, however, are more helpful to agencies and freelancers who offer SEO services.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The winner of this round is&nbsp;<strong>KWFinder</strong>.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3>Which one should you choose?</h3> \n<p>Here’s where we’re at:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>SpyFu has a total of&nbsp;<strong>26.5 out of 30 stars.&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p>KWFinder, alongside the entire Mangools library of tools, also has&nbsp;<strong>26.5 out of 30 stars.&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><em>Two different SEO tools, the same overall rating.</em></p> \n<p>However, that doesn’t mean SpyFu and KWFinder are equal.</p> \n<p>If you want:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Aggressive competitor research tools</li>\n <li>Cheaper entry-level plan</li>\n <li>Unlimited SEO and PPC data</li>\n <li>Customizable SEO reports for clients</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Then&nbsp;<strong>SpyFu&nbsp;</strong>is the better option for you.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, if you want:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Better backlink analysis&nbsp;</li>\n <li>More extra features</li>\n <li>Cheaper mid-range plan&nbsp;</li>\n <li>A more pleasing experience</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Then go with&nbsp;<strong>KWFinder</strong>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are certain things KWFinder does better than SpyFu. At the same time, SpyFu outperforms KWfinder in some respects.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, KWFinder is not a SpyFu alternative and vice versa.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>My advice is, understand your own goals and pick the tool that best serves them.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p>We already covered the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. It’s only a matter of picking the one that excels in the tasks that matter to you.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3> \n<p>What did you think of our SpyFu vs KWFinder showdown?</p> \n<p>Did you find your go-to SEO tool for 2021?</p> \n<p>I hope I helped you make this crucial decision.
