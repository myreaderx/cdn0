Better yet, what if anyone could contribute to Street View, using only their phone?</p><p>With our updated <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street\">Street View app</a> on Android, it’s now easier than ever to collect your own Street View imagery and put it in the right place on Google Maps. Using our new connected photos tool in the app, you can record a series of connected images as you move down a street or path. </p><p>These images are captured using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/ar\">ARCore</a>, the same augmented reality technology we use to produce experiences like <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/new-sense-direction-live-view/\">Live View</a>. After you record your images and publish them via the Street View app, we automatically rotate, position and create a series of connected photos. We then place those connected images in the right place on Google Maps, so your new Street View can be found in the exact location where it was taken for others to see and explore. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"You first record your connected photos in the Street View app as seen in this example from Government Camp, Oregon.

That’s why for years we've been building new ways for people to contribute their own imagery to Google Maps. In fact, we've seen millions of Street View images contributed from people in every country on Earth, from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z1hBJHi1Zo4\">Bermuda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHtyuFZF2bg\">Tonga</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vXWEsGCvniI\">Zanzibar</a> and<a href=\"https://youtu.be/gyL5xKBV_Mo\">Zimbabwe</a>.</p><p>Where people contribute connected photos, they will appear in the Street View layer on Google Maps as dotted blue lines—simply drag Pegman around to find them. Where we have existing Google Street View imagery, we’ll show that as the primary Street View experience with a solid blue line. While it’s still early days for this beta feature, there are already examples of people adding their own connected photos—from Nigeria to Japan and Brazil.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div aria-label=\"Connected Photos imagery from a contributor in Brazil\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Brazil.max-1800x1800.jpg);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Connected Photos imagery from a contributor in Brazil</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In early testing, people contributed connected photos from Brazil ...</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div aria-label=\"Japan.jpg\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Japan_5EIpP7O.max-1800x1800.jpg);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Japan.jpg</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>... took the Street View app for a scenic drive in Japan</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div aria-label=\"Nigeria\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Nigeria.max-1800x1800.jpg);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Nigeria</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>... and created new Street View by walking around town in Nigeria</p></div></figcaption></figure></li></ul><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - left click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Previous\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - right click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Next\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__navigation\"><div class=\"glue-pagination-page-list uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - dot click\"\n           }'></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>As with our other <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-imagery-powers-our-map/\">imagery</a>, these pictures will help make Google Maps more accurate and up-to-date for everyone. For example, we can use the information in Street View imagery to update Google Maps with details like the names and addresses of businesses that aren’t currently on the map and maybe even their publicly posted open hours. We’ll also give these connected photos the same privacy controls, including face and license-plate blurring treatment that you see in the regular Street View photos that Google captures. We also make it easy for people to report imagery and other types of contributed content for review. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Anyone can contribute to Google Maps and Street View</h3><p>Driving through a town where Street View cars have never been?
