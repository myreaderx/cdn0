But rather than modernizing the drama about a suburban family living in the 1960s, <em>The Wonder Years</em> reboot is taking a different approach with the same formula.</p>\n<p>Produced by <strong>Lee Daniels</strong>, <em>The Wonder Years</em> reboot will follow a Black family living in Montgomery, Alabama in the 1960s, providing a much different perspective than the original series that starred <strong>Fred Savage</strong>, Danica McKellar, Dan Lauria, Alley Mills, Jason Hervey, and Olivia d&#8217;Abo as The Arnold Family. The new series will focus on The Williams Family, and a first look photo has officially been revealed.<span id=\"more-666222\"></span></p>\n<p>Lee Daniels posted the first photo of The Williams Family on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNagmqmpY3j/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> just before the weekend:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666224 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderyears-reboot-firstlook-williamsfamily-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"The Wonder Years Reboot First Look\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderyears-reboot-firstlook-williamsfamily.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/wonderyears-reboot-firstlook-williamsfamily-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Wonder Years</em> reboot stars <strong>Dulé Hill</strong> (<em>Psych</em>), <strong>Laura Kariuki</strong> (<em>Black Lightning</em>),<strong> Saycon Sengbloh</strong> (<em>In the Dark</em>), and <strong>Elisha “EJ” Williams</strong> (<em>Henry Danger</em>) in the role of Dean Williams, who takes the place of Fred Savage&#8217;s character Kevin Arnold. <strong>Don Cheadle</strong> will provide the voice of adult Dean, who will narrate the series, just as <em>Home Alone</em> co-star Daniel Stern did in the original version of <em>The Wonder Years</em>.</p>\n<p>Running from 1988 through 1993, The Wonder Years was a beloved series that was nominated for and won several Emmys and Golden Globes. It famously tackled young love and family drama, not to mention historical 1960s issues such as racism and the controversy of the Vietnam War. However, it did so through the perspective of a middle class white family. Similar stories and issues will look drastically different through the eyes of a Black family living in the South during the 1960s, and it sounds like one of the more compelling reboots that have come together in recent years.</p>\n<p>Fred Savage is executive producing the series reboot along with Lee Daniels. <em>The Wonder Years</em> star has become an accomplished TV director in his adult life, helming episodes of <em>It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>, <em>Modern Family</em>, <em>Party Down</em>,<em> The Goldbergs</em>, and more. He&#8217;s rarely tackled TV drama, so this will be uncharted territory for him behind the camera. But since Savage was the star of the original series, he surely knows the ins and outs of the original series in order to make it feel familiar and refreshing at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>The Wonder Years</em> reboot is expected to debut in the 2021-2022 television season on ABC.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-wonder-years-reboot-first-look/\">Get a

And it was Youn who won the night in her acceptance speech, joking that the award was especially meaningful as she found the British to be &#8220;snobbish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here are the winners for the 2021 BAFTA Awards (via <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bafta-awards-2021-winners-unveiled\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>):</p>\n<p><b>Best Film<br />\n</b><b><i>Nomadland &#8211; </i>WINNER<br />\n</b><i>The Father</i><br />\n<i>The Mauritanian</i><br />\n<i>Promising Young Woman</i><br />\n<i>The Trial Of The Chicago 7</i></p>\n<p><b>Leading Actress<br />\n</b><b>Frances Mcdormand, <i>Nomadland &#8211;</i> WINNER<br />\n</b>Bukky Bakray, <i>Rocks</i><br />\nRadha Blank, <i>The Forty-Year-Old Version</i><br />\nVanessa Kirby, <i>Pieces Of A Woman</i><br />\nWunmi Mosaku, <i>His House</i><br />\nAlfre Woodard, <i>Clemency</i></p>\n<p><b>Leading Actor<br />\n</b><b>Anthony Hopkins,<i> The Father </i>&#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b>Riz Ahmed, <i>Sound Of Metal</i><br />\nChadwick Boseman, <i>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</i><br />\nAdarsh Gourav, <i>The White Tiger</i><br />\nMads Mikkelsen, <i>Another Round</i><br />\nTahar Rahim, <i>The Mauritanian</i></p>\n<p><b>Director<br />\n</b><b><i>Nomadland</i>, Chloé Zhao &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Another Round</i>, Thomas Vinterberg<br />\n<i>Babyteeth</i>, Shannon Murphy<br />\n<i>Minari</i>, Lee Isaac Chung<br />\n<i>Quo Vadis, Aida?</i>, Jasmila Žbani?<br />\n<i>Rocks</i>, Sarah Gavron</p>\n<p><b>Rising Star<br />\nBukky Bakray &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b>Conrad Khan<br />\nKingsley Ben-Adir<br />\nMorfydd Clark<br />\nSope Dirisu</p>\n<p><b>Outstanding British Film<br />\n<i>Promising Young Woman &#8211; </i>WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Calm With Horses</i><br />\n<i>The Dig</i><br />\n<i>The Father</i><br />\n<i>His House</i><br />\n<i>Limbo</i><br />\n<i>The Mauritanian</i><br />\n<i>Mogul Mowgli</i><br />\n<i>Rocks</i><br />\n<i>Saint Maud</i></p>\n<p><b>Original Score<br />\n</b><b><i>Soul</i>, Jon Batiste, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Mank</i>, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross<br />\n<i>Minari</i>, Emile Mosseri<br />\n<i>News Of The World</i>, James Newton Howard<br />\n<i>Promising Young Woman</i>, Anthony Willis</p>\n<p><b>Documentary<br />\n<i>My Octopus Teacher </i>&#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Collective</i><br />\n<i>David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet</i><br />\n<i>The Dissident</i><br />\n<i>The Social Dilemma</i></p>\n<p><b>Outstanding Debut By A British Writer, Director Or Producer<br />\n<i>His House</i>, Remi Weekes (Writer/Director) &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Limbo</i>, Ben Sharrock (Writer/Director), Irune Gurtubai (Producer) [Also Produced By Angus Lamont]<br />\n<i>Moffie</i>, Jack Sidey (Writer/Producer) [Also Written By Oliver Hermanus And Produced By Eric Abraham]<br />\n<i>Rocks</i>, Theresa Ikoko, Claire Wilson (Writers)<br />\n<i>Saint Maud</i>, Rose Glass (Writer/Director), Oliver Kassman (Producer) [Also Produced By Andrea Cornwell]</p>\n<p><b>Supporting Actor<br />\nDaniel Kaluuya, <i>Judas And The Black Messiah</i> &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b>Barry Keoghan, <i>Calm With Horses</i><br />\nAlan Kim, <i>Minari</i><br />\nLeslie Odom Jr., <i>One Night In Miami…</i><br />\nClarke Peters, <i>Da 5 Bloods</i><br />\nPaul Raci, <i>Sound Of Metal</i></p>\n<p><b>Original Screenplay<br />\n<i>Promising Young Woman, </i>Emerald Fennell &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Another Round</i>, Tobias Lindholm, Thomas Vinterberg<br />\n<i>Mank</i>, Jack Fincher<br />\n<i>Rocks</i>, Theresa Ikoko, Claire Wilson<br />\n<i>The Trial Of The Chicago 7</i>, Aaron Sorkin</p>\n<p><b>Supporting Actress<br />\n</b><b>Yuh-Jung Youn, <i>Minari &#8211; </i>WINNER<br />\n</b>Niamh Algar, <i>Calm With Horses</i><br />\nKosar Ali, <i>Rocks</i><br />\nMaria Bakalova, <i>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</i><br />\nDominique Fishback, <i>Judas And The Black Messiah</i><br />\nAshley Madekwe, <i>County Lines</i></p>\n<p><b>Cinematography</b><br />\n<b><i>Nomadland, </i>Joshua James Richards &#8211; WINNER<br />\n</b><i>Judas And The Black Messiah</i>, Sean Bobbitt<br />\n<i>Mank</i>, Erik Messerschmidt<br />\n<i>The Mauritanian</i>, Alwin H.

At least, that&#8217;s what it appears he&#8217;ll do, based on the stunts and fight choreography they have him performing during combat training. Let&#8217;s just say Isaac gets pretty stabby with a few stunt team members.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666281\"></span></p>\n<p>Could <em>Moon Knight</em> be the most violent Marvel series to debut on Disney+? It would certainly be a feat for a family-friendly streaming service, but based on Oscar Isaac&#8217;s <em>Moon Knight </em>training video, we might get a Marvel Disney+ series that features some straight-up murder. Or at least, Isaac murdering what&#8217;s left of our hearts.</p>\n<p>A training video released by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNfi98OpR-x/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mad Gene Media</a> has been dropped, revealing Isaac&#8217;s brutal training regimen to get in shape for <em>Moon Knight</em>. The video features Isaac performing fight choreography which features a surprising amount of throat-slitting, which would be a surprise for a Disney+ series, but perhaps not one whose premise centers around a mercenary with multiple personalities.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2enjX-qIc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great to see Isaac getting in shape for the series, and taking well to the intense fight choreography, which almost looks like something out of a <em>John Wick</em> film<em>.</em> This bodes well for <em>Moon Knight</em>, an action adventure series about a mercenary left for dead in the Egyptian desert. In the comics, Moon Knight is a mercenary named Marc Spector who has dissociative identity disorder who is left for dead by his boss after the two find an archaeological dig site. Spector is approached by Khonshu, the Egyptian god of the moon, and given a second chance at life if he agrees to be Khonshu’s avatar on Earth, and Spector agrees. Spector returns to the world of the living and develops multiple secret identities, including a millionaire named Steven Grant and a taxicab driver named Jake Lockley, which give him access to different sectors of society.</p>\n<p>The intense fight choreography Isaac is performing makes sense for Moon Knight, a former Marine and boxer who is considered an expert in hand-to-hand combat. But he also has super strength which he draws from the moon: the fuller it gets, the stronger he gets. At least, that&#8217;s what he believes.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeremy Slater</strong> (<em>Umbrella Academy</em>, <em>Fantastic Four</em>) is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/she-hulk-and-moon-knight-writers/\">serving</a> as the writer and showrunner for <em>Moon Knight</em>, which does not have a release date set yet. Expect the character to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-heroes-mcu-movies-she-hulk-ms-marvel-moon-knight/\">appear in MCU films</a> after headlining his own show.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/oscar-isaac-moon-knight-training/\">Oscar Isaac Might Actually Kill People in &#8216;Moon Knight&#8217;, Based on This Brutal Training Video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cd1zuzyLU9w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 16:30:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5b4295ac2639fd47de74da149287f614","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-44-457_0bceeb1080809554.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":16726,"destBytes":8092,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-44-457_0bceeb1080809554.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-05-630_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn95@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-05-463_a58980c90b4c5190.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-06-009_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cd1zuzyLU9w:PcaUl8pPvZk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-05-603_f347b105139cbcae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cd1zuzyLU9w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-05-616_c9542f26de115fe0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245794651},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","title":"This Week In Trailers: Silo, Beast Beast, Sugar Daddy, The Unthinkable, Why Did You Kill Me?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665802","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-576905 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"This Week in Trailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Trailers are an under-appreciated art form insofar that many times they’re seen as vehicles for showing footage, explaining films away, or showing their hand about what moviegoers can expect.

The distributor, who usually supports unique visions and content, seems to be focused on something a little more traditional. I&#8217;ve watched this trailer a few times, and while it&#8217;s based on a true event, the way it&#8217;s presented feels wholly fresh. There isn&#8217;t a mandate that true stories have to look and feel like they were made in a sterile film lab.

We&#8217;re not allowed to see where we&#8217;re ultimately going, and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re driving a little blind. Just get a taste of these characters, see them in their natural environments.

This is a story of a woman who is a financial hit away from complete ruin. The desperation, the need to obtain money just to stay alive, is palpable, and this movie like it&#8217;s going to be a wild ride. She doesn&#8217;t know how to exist in a world where her friends would certainly look at her with askance if they found out, nor how to navigate this new life of trading her physicality for cash. There is a bit of pressure being applied to both sides of her essence. The trailer blends fantastical imagery with moments that feel genuine. This is not your usual indie, and thank goodness for that.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEXV8Rif8Vc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Why Did You Kill Me?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to go down a true crime road, this seems like a splendid avenue.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The line between justice and revenge blurs when a devastated family uses social media to track down the people who killed 24-year-old Crystal Theobald.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to this kind of content, Netflix has it on lock. I went from not knowing anything about this poor woman who was murdered to being completely dialed in to what followed. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s borderline Dateline NBC quality, but I&#8217;m now needing to know how this ends. The trailer isl lays out the premise easily: we&#8217;re out to catch a murderer through social media. Elegantly simple, but heartbreakingly real.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSwOzbO9WIo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>The Unthinkable</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Victor Danell&#8217;s</strong> high concept idea looks just wild enough to be amazing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s midsummer and Sweden wakes up to a state of emergency. TV, internet, and telephone networks are down, and before anyone realizes what&#8217;s behind the collapse, a series of unexplained attacks take place around the country. Alex, a successful pianist whose controlled existence is upturned when his mother dies in a suspected terror attack, returns to his childhood village to arrange the funeral. There, he must reconcile with both his father and his old flame, Anna, who he has desperately been trying to forget. As old feelings come back to the surface, more mysterious attacks plunge Sweden into chaos and confusion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an age where more people are giving movies with subtitles a chance, this looks like something that could satisfy everyone in the family. It&#8217;s got guns, it&#8217;s apocalyptic, it&#8217;s got romance, and there are helicopters going down in the middle of a Swedish forest. It&#8217;s exceptional. The trailer tries to pack as much as it can into this to get everyone it can onboard with its vision. The explosions, the confusion, the intermingling of end-of-days action and romance, it&#8217;s bizarre, but it works. I need to see this.</p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Nota bene: If you have any suggestions of trailers for possible inclusion in this column, even have a trailer of your own to pitch, please let me know by sending me a note at Christopher_Stipp@yahoo.com or look me up via Twitter at @Stipp</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>In case you missed them, here are the other trailers we covered at /Film this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mainstream-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Mainstream Trailer</strong></a> &#8211;

It&#8217;s disturbing and heartbreaking and manipulative and powerful, all at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Viewing</strong>: Because it&#8217;s the type of galvanizing video that might actually inspire change.<span id=\"more-666170\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G393z8s8nFY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Comparisons to Wes Anderson&#8217;s <em>The Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> are probably inevitable, but I love the character design of Ralph, with his big expressive face and eternally optimistic personality shining through as endures horror after horror. The production design is wonderful, too – note the rocket ship painting in the bathroom scene when Ralph is talking about humans going to space, a detail that humanizes the character even more and gives you the idea that he has hopes and dreams and passions that continue when the camera isn&#8217;t on him. You might miss it because of Waititi&#8217;s accent and upbeat delivery, but Ralph&#8217;s entire family – including his children! – have all been killed by humans, and there are memories of those family members sprinkled throughout the background of Ralph&#8217;s 1970s-style apartment, like the &#8220;World&#8217;s Greatest Dad&#8221; cup that holds his toothbrush (and maybe even the toothbrushes of his dead kids, too).</p>\n<p>Look, I&#8217;m not trying to be willfully naive here. I know the companies who still participate in this type of animal testing are huge and have tons of well-paid lobbyists at their beck and call who can influence legislation on their behalf and do whatever they can to make sure regular people don&#8217;t think about the cruelty that happens during tests like these. But every change starts somewhere, and with the involvement of people like Waititi and fellow voice actors <strong>Ricky Gervais</strong>, <strong>Zac Efron</strong>, <strong>Olivia Munn</strong>, <strong>Pom Klementieff</strong>, <strong>Rodrigo Santoro</strong>, and <strong>Tricia Helfer</strong>, maybe this short film will be the spark that gets enough people to care about this to be able to counteract the apathy that these companies are banking on consumers having about this topic.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but watching this has convinced me to check out the labels and do some research about everything in my bathroom.

Sure, they&#8217;re made from plastic instead of metal, but that&#8217;s what makes them cost so much less than the other prop replicas out there. Like Hasbro&#8217;s Infinity Gauntlet replica, the Eye of Agamotto features a weathered gold paint scheme designed to simulate a metallic build, so it doesn&#8217;t look like a cheap

comedic chops. Though her hosting debut on <strong><em>Saturday Night Live</em></strong> undoubtedly let Carey Mulligan get a little bit more loose, she was still mostly relegated to the same position that many prestige British actresses end up: the straight-person. The good news is that the sketches still mostly delivered some solid laughs, even if they tapped into a lot of familiar and recurring bits.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s get down to the best and worst sketches from the Carey Mulligan hosted <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.<span id=\"more-666227\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Best</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrdPCmY0_bQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Wrong with This Picture with Carey Mulligan</strong> &#8211; <em>Saturday Night Live</em> relies on the game show format regularly. And I&#8217;m always a sucker for when they do a game show where the contestants are oblivious to the actual game&#8217;s rules and are basically idiots. This is one of those instances, and it&#8217;s all elevated by Kenan Thompson&#8217;s incredible, incredulous host schtick, which never gets old no matter how many times I see it. I wonder  just how many different wacky takes on these pictures are tried out before they settle on the final answers.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgaLlP0xmqE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Lesbian Period Drama</strong> &#8211; Considering the kind of movies Carey Mulligan has made over the years, it&#8217;s kind of a miracle that she hasn&#8217;t made a movie like the one being lampooned in this trailer. Mocking recent acclaimed dramas <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em> and <em>Ammonite</em>, this faux trailer hits all the tropes of the lesbian period drama. Mulligan&#8217;s presence makes it an excellent gag, and if she&#8217;s lucky, this will be enough to get her out of ever having to actually star in one of these dramas.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXFE2VYKUYU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>IBS Medicine Ad</strong> &#8211; Sometimes it&#8217;s good old-fashioned toilet humor that gets the job done. In this case, it&#8217;s an IBS medicine that comes just a little too late after a mother totally destroys a school bathroom with her bowel movement. The commercial gets interrupted by Kenan Thompson&#8217;s aghast reaction and Aidy Bryant&#8217;s administrative concerns to great effect, and the only thing that might have improved the situation is if Carey Mulligan was allowed to spread her wings in a more goofy fashion.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_GNz8IaUiM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>L&#8217;Eggs</strong> &#8211; This is exactly the kind of 10-to-1 sketch I like to see towards the end of the night. The set-up of a freestyle rap group was already an odd enough element, but Carey Mulligan and Aidy Bryant doing a full-on guerilla marketing campaign to drum up interest in L&#8217;Eggs pantyhose again made this a gem. This feels like a sketch that may have originally been crafted for Kate McKinnon to do with Aidy Bryant, and it might have been even better in that form, but Mulligan&#8217;s work here is commendable, even if it still requires her to still play things a little more straight.</p>\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/carey-mulligan-hosted-saturday-night-live-season-46-best-and-worst-sketches/2/\"><strong>Continue Reading Carey Mulligan SNL Review &#62;&#62;</strong></a></strong></h2>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/carey-mulligan-hosted-saturday-night-live-season-46-best-and-worst-sketches/\">Carey Mulligan Stars in a Lesbian Period Drama and Gets IBS on a Familiar But Funny &#8216;Saturday Night Live&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rTlBIyRG1Vo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 19:17:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/snl-careymulligan-bumper1-700x394.jpg","linkMd5":"cda10309dd0524bf48233c3b4a56c6ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-43-213_b95ab59f4d7188be.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":51037,"destBytes":37892,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/snl-careymulligan-bumper1-700x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-43-43-213_b95ab59f4d7188be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-05-630_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-05-679_e1fa6befc059b139.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-06-009_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rTlBIyRG1Vo:uSpK84lTpYY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn84@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-05-454_79212bd0ac30550c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rTlBIyRG1Vo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-05-421_db51a2f1837b0139.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245794939},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","title":"‘My Best Friend’s Exorcism’ Will Pit Friendship Against the Devil with ‘Eighth Grade’ Star Elsie Fisher","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666216","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666218 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"My Best Friend's Exorcism Movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Whenever a horror movie with an exorcism comes along, it usually threatens to tear apart a family who has just moved into a new home.

If you haven&#8217;t heard of the book on which the movie is based, here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The year is 1988. High school sophomores Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since fourth grade. But after an evening of skinny-dipping goes disastrously wrong, Gretchen begins to act…different. She’s moody. She’s irritable. And bizarre incidents keep happening whenever she’s nearby. Abby’s investigation leads her to some startling discoveries—and by the time their story reaches its terrifying conclusion, the fate of Abby and Gretchen will be determined by a single question: Is their friendship powerful enough to beat the devil?</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Elsie Fisher</strong>, the breakout star of the indie darling <em>Eighth Grade</em>, will lead the movie as Abby while <strong>Amiah Miller</strong> (one of the leads in David Oyelowo&#8217;s<em> The Water Man</em>) will portray Gretchen. Joining them will be<strong> Cathy Ang</strong> (the lead voice in <em>Over the Moon</em>) and <strong>Rachel Ogechi Kanu</strong> (making her feature film debut) as Abby and Gretchen&#8217;s friends.</p>\n<p>The book has been described as <em>Heathers</em> meets<em> The Exorcist</em> that &#8220;blends teen angst, adolescent drama, unspeakable horrors, and a mix of ’80s pop songs into a pulse-pounding supernatural thriller.&#8221; You get some horror, and you get some coming-of-age drama along with it. Sounds good to me. Our own Chris Evangelista has read the book in question, and says it&#8217;s not only good, but it&#8217;s also very sweet. It would have to be in order for friendship to triumph over the power of the devil. Plus, how can it not be good when it has cover art like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666219 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-full-700x1050.jpg\" alt=\"My Best Friend's Exorcism Movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-full.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mybestfreidnsexorcism-bookcover-full-333x500.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Damon Thomas</strong>, who has directed episodes of<em> Killing Eve</em> and <em>Penny Dreadful</em>, is at the helm of the movie.

In response to the new voting restrictions signed into law on March 31, Georgia-based corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/delta-coca-cola-georgia-voting-law.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have spoken out against</a> the new laws, and now it&#8217;s starting to impact film productions that bring jobs and revenue to the state.</p>\n<p>In a press release, director/producer <strong>Antoine Fuqua</strong> and producer/star <strong>Will Smith</strong> announced that they will be moving Apple&#8217;s production of the runaway slave drama <strong><em>Emancipation</em></strong> out of Georgia because of the aforementioned voting restrictions passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Brian Kemp.<span id=\"more-666267\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Emancipation</em> was scheduled to begin filming down in Georgia in June this year. The film follows Will Smith as Peter, a fugitive from slavery on a harrowing journey north from Louisiana. Known by the name &#8220;Whipped Peter,&#8221; the man emancipated himself from a Southern plantation and joined the Union Army. The name comes from a series of photos taken of Peter during his Army medical examination that appeared in the July 4 issue of Harper&#8217;s Weekly. The photos in questions showed Peter&#8217;s mutilated back as a result of being whipped by plantation owners John and Bridget Lyons.</p>\n<p>After Georgia became a key state in solidifying a victory for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Republican lawmakers in the state have been doing everything they can to keep Democratic voters from turning out in such high numbers again. Fuqua and Smith have seen what many political pundits and election experts have already pointed out. In a joint statement, they said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice. We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access. The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is clearly an important issue for Fuqua and Smith, because moving the production out of Georgia will cost around $15 million due to the tax rebates that originally made the state an appealing shooting location. But the cost is nothing compared to the significance of taking a stand against a state that&#8217;s actively trying to oppress Black voters.</p>\n<p>If Georgia follows through on these voting restrictions, this likely won&#8217;t be the last production that ends up moving out of the state. But it remains to be seen if a big studio like Disney will take a stand by pulling various Marvel Studios productions out of the state where many movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been shot.</p>\n<p>If this is the first you&#8217;re hearing of this voting law controversy in Georgia, you can head over to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/10/georgia-new-voting-law-explained/7133587002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USA Today</a> for a comprehensive breakdown of all the changes the new voting laws will institute.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/emancipation-movie-leaving-georgia-due-to-new-voting-restrictions/\">Antoine Fuqua and Will Smith Pull &#8216;Emancipation&#8217; Production from Georgia Due to New Voting Restrictions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mWasU6e3p-Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:30:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/willsmith-iamlegend-pointing-angry-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"4a465c7cb8dad8d528bf7440914f5a63","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-53-965_e1c0735b6ad7054e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43861,"destBytes":28186,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/willsmith-iamlegend-pointing-angry-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-53-965_e1c0735b6ad7054e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-05-630_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-05-619_84d9d8afea004575.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-06-009_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mWasU6e3p-Y:UaOMihW4Yms:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-05-895_4caa151cd37a869b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mWasU6e3p-Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn3@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-05-481_81f73ec22eee50d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245794822},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:14","title":"‘Bad Trip’ Has a Deleted Haunted Motel Prank with a Full-On Exorcism","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665893","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-665904 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/badtrip-andre-howery-sittingoncar-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Trip Exorcism Prank\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/badtrip-andre-howery-sittingoncar.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/badtrip-andre-howery-sittingoncar-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Bad Trip</em></strong> is the latest Netflix project that pulls shocking pranks on unsuspecting people. Produced by <strong>Jeff Tremaine</strong> of <em>Jackass</em> and <em>Bad Grandpa</em> fame, the film features a buddy road trip story starring <strong>Eric André</strong> and <strong>Lil Rel Howery</strong>, with <strong>Tiffany Haddish</strong> hot on their trail. The narrative connects a series of wild gags unleashed on the clueless public, taking the road trip on some crazy twists and turns, from Eric André being sexually assaulted by a gorilla to Lil Rel Howery getting stuck in the bottom half of a port-a-potty. But one prank just didn&#8217;t fit in the movie, even though it was one of the best they pulled off.<span id=\"more-665893\"></span></p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, <em>Bad Trip</em> follows Eric André and Lil Rel Howery as best friends Chris and Bud as they embark on a trip so Chris can finally proclaim his love for his high school sweetheart. Along the way, they have a series of mishaps that unfold in front of real people, including many <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-bad-trip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">who are surprisingly kind and helpful</a> in the most insane situations.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://thefilmstage.com/eric-andre-and-jeff-tremaine-on-bad-trip-storytelling-with-pranks-deleted-scenes-and-jackass-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Film Stage</a>, Eric André discussed a prank that got cut from the movie, even though he says it was &#8220;probably the best prank on its own.&#8221; It involves an exorcism that was performed by a real priest. André explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had this prank where we stayed the night in a motel that was haunted. I start getting sick and become possessed by a demon spirit. Rel got this real preacher to come in and perform an exorcism on me. We have all these hidden practical effects. I’m levitating in the bed, the walls start bleeding, lights are flickering. Cockroaches came out of a painting. And this real preacher is trying to get Rel to exorcise the demons out of me. Rel keeps cursing and he’s like, ‘in the name of Jesus Christ get the fuck out of my friend!’ The preacher was like ‘Okay, that’s good, but don’t curse’ and the guy was really on the hook.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s a hell of a prank to pull on a priest and it sounds like it&#8217;s on a whole other level when you see the rest of the pranks in the movie. It takes it to a much more unbelievable place. That doesn&#8217;t keep us from wanted to see this deleted scene though, especially knowing what kind of practical effects they utilized to pull it off. Hopefully Netflix will release the deleted scene as a bonus feature or something like that, because it sounds like it deserves to be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: You can see the deleted scene in question in this assembly of other cut scenes from <em>Bad Trip</em>:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/82eqckEcfLU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/deleted-bad-trip-exorcism-prank/\">&#8216;Bad Trip&#8217; Has a Deleted Haunted Motel Prank with a Full-On Exorcism</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/XS5krH-MhkQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 18:00:47 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/badtrip-andre-howery-sittingoncar-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"9f556aed359e9cc208fe7a6bbfc2883c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-45-505_4b1338506ad4ddde.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":50165,"destBytes":36846,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/badtrip-andre-howery-sittingoncar-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-43-45-505_4b1338506ad4ddde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/12/16-44-05-630_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_6/2021/04/12/16-44-06-076_72fab4f20f5ac2bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_1/2021/04/12/16-44-06-009_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XS5krH-MhkQ:s74v-NRZiN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn63@2020_2/2021/04/12/16-44-08-335_3d2b565bfbd7d58c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/XS5krH-MhkQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/12/16-44-05-508_0f2d65e5e7632ec8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245794923}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:15","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:15","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 16:43:15 +0000","fetchMs":196,"handleMs":3981,"totalMs":60032,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3a3b749630aab1400a7ff77055877a26","hostName":"us-014*","requestId":"d751d2d7d9fc42f1bb928aa3e179b66a_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":978444,"bgimgsTotal":12,"bgimgsGithubTotal":12,"articlesImgsTotal":65,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":65,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":3,"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx7":3,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx6":2,"myreaderx16":2,"myreaderx4":3,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx3":2,"myreaderx33":2,"myreaderx12":2,"myreaderx13":2,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":2,"myreaderx27":3,"myreaderx21":2,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":3,"myreaderx29":3},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
