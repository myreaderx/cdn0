With that initial launch period behind them, Indra is now focused on the first major update to <em>Raziel</em> which adds all sorts of new stuff to what was already a content-filled game.</p> \n<p>First and foremost this update adds a new playable hero to the roster, an elven druid named Pirrosa Mander who “finds herself a reluctant but infinitely valuable ally of the human struggle against the undead invasion.\" Her ranged fire spells and shape-shifting abilities make her a nice complement to swap back and forth to from a heavy-hitting melee-focused hero like Rock or Bison. Players will be able to unlock Pirrosa Mander for free by collecting Blazing Mysterious Shards or Almighty Shards. You can see a cinematic introduction to Pirrosa in the video below, followed by a couple screens of her different gear loadouts.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-eTMydx8BlU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273718\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa1.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa1-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa1-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa1-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273719\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa3.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa3-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa3-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pirrosa3-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Another major portion of this latest update to <em>Raziel</em> is a new mercenary sidekick system which allows you to recruit mercenary companions to tag along and assist you in battle. The various mercenaries available have unique abilities and can be equipped with armor and weapons, basically adding in an entire new layer to consider when outfitting your own hero with gear and planning strategies. You can recruit mercenaries who specialize in dishing out high damage numbers, those who are experts at area of effect attacks, or those who are proficient with crowd control. It’s all up to you and how you want to complement your starting team of two heroes before heading into battle. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary3.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary3-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary3-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary3-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273721\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary4.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary4-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary4-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mercenary4-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>In addition to these major new additions, Indra have also added a bunch of new content to the existing portions of <em>Raziel</em> in the form of new Tavern Challenges, Abis Demon Land floors, World Map zones, and a hard mode for Chapters 1-5 of the main story. There’s also a new gameplay mode for guilds called Guild Resource War where guild members will be able to challenge dungeons twice a day and earn points for their guild to hopefully boost them up past rival guilds in the rankings. And finally, given that this update falls just before Halloween, all of the heroes in <em>Raziel</em> now have their own unlockable costume sets which are, well, creepy as Hell if you ask me. In a good way, of course!</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273723\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume1.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume1-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume1-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume1-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273724\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume2.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume2-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume2-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/costume2-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Raziel: Dungeon Arena</em> is noteworthy in the relatively crowded free-to-play action RPG genre due to its focus on a lengthy, story-driven campaign, and alongside that is all the other stuff you’d likely expect from a game like this including tons of multiplayer and social features, and tons of loot and customization options. It’s all wrapped up in an extremely impressive visual package, too. With this first major update out in the wild, <em>Raziel: Dungeon Arena</em> gives players even more awesome stuff to do, so be sure to check it out for free on both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1522241983\">the iOS App Store</a> or on Android on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indra.en.raziel\">the Google Play Store</a>.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p> \n <center></center></p> \n<div style=\"border-radius: 25px; background: #393949; padding: 20px; line-height: 1em; width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n <span style=\"color: #f2a200; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Sponsored Content</span> \n <p><span style=\"color: white; line-height: 14px;\">This article is sponsored content written by TouchArcade and published on behalf of Indra Software to promote a major new update to their mobile action RPG <em>Raziel: Dungeon Arena</em>.

Lots of stuff inspired by the 16-bit or 8-bit eras, but occasionally some that go back even further than that. Like the monochrome era of the original Game Boy or the surprisingly vibrant world of graphing calculator homebrew. These are what immediately came to mind when I first fired up <em>Pixboy</em>, a new platformer from developer Oaky Games.</p> \n<p>When you’re dealing with essentially just black and white, you have to go that extra mile to give your visuals some extra detail and life, and <em>Pixboy</em> does a great job with this. It’s the kind of game that looks totally lo-fi on the surface, but actually runs so smoothly and is filled with fancier things like particle effects that wouldn’t have been possible on actual hardware of the day. There’s also a couple dozen unlockable color palettes so you can change up the look while retaining that retro visual style.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVwSyow3iyI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>In fact unlockables are a big part of what I’m digging so much about <em>Pixboy</em>. This game is absolutely <strong>stuffed</strong> with secret areas to discover which hide hidden coins and popsicles to seek out and collect. A crown badge awaits those who collect all coins, and one for all popsicles, and a third for beating a level’s completion time. There’s even a special Pacifist badge to earn if you’re able to beat a level without killing any enemies, which can be super challenging. </p> \n<p><em>Pixboy</em> won’t redefine what you expect out of a platforming game. It’s mostly straightforward with some interesting wrinkles thrown in here and there to keep things fresh, and of course countless secrets to discover and goals to shoot for in its 40 well-designed levels. For platforming fans looking for their next fix, this should do nicely, and the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/pixboy-by-oaky-games.411954/\">players in our forums</a> have been enjoying this one a lot too so be sure to see what others are saying about <em>Pixboy</em>.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 01:54:47 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8a617bf94b1f3977bafb112af03b7b08","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jared Nelson","publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129205560},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:45","title":"SwitchArcade Round-Up: ‘Pikmin 3 Deluxe’, ‘Clea’, ‘Mad Rat Dead’, and Today’s Other New Releases and Sales","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=273806","description":"<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for October 30th, 2020. The list of new sales today is absolutely <em>massive</em>. One of the bigger ones we’ve seen in a while, outside of formally-organized major events. There are also a bunch of new releases to look at, with the charge led by Nintendo’s own <em>Pikmin 3 Deluxe</em>. And that’s really all I had time to stuff into today’s article! That’s just how things go sometimes, friends. Let’s check it out!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Pikmin 3 Deluxe ($59.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273807\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pikmin3deluxe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pikmin3deluxe.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pikmin3deluxe-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pikmin3deluxe-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pikmin3deluxe-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Nintendo’s quest to make sure there’s no reason to keep your Wii U plugged in marches one step further with the release of <em>Pikmin 3 Deluxe</em>, an enhanced version of the quirky real-time strategy sequel. Command various Pikmin to collect items, defeat enemies, and make your way past whatever obstacles stand in your way. The Deluxe in the title amounts to some new side-missions featuring Olimar and Louie, a co-op option for the Story mode, and all of the DLC packed in. It’s a really good game, and there isn’t a whole lot out there exactly like the <em>Pikmin</em> series. Perhaps not the Halloween game you were hoping for, but when a giant monster is eating your Pikmin and riding your butt, it can actually be a bit terrifying.</p> \n<h3><strong>Clea ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273808\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clea.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clea.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clea-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clea-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clea-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Okay, I get it. You want something <em>really</em> spooky for Halloween. How about <em>Clea</em>, then? This is (thankfully) a jumpscare-free horror game that follows a girl named Clea and her brother as they try to escape from the monster-filled Whitlock Mansion. You have to listen carefully, peek under doors, and generally do whatever you can to avoid the Chaos Servants that are stalking you. Solve puzzles to move through the house and eventually find your way to freedom. Search for memory orb items to unlock bonus memories that fill you in on more of the back story behind the house and its inhabitants. <em>Clea</em> is very well-regarded on Steam, and this Switch version seems to have done a fine job of carrying the experience over. Very cool game with a really attractive presentation.</p> \n<h3><strong>Mad Rat Dead ($39.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273809\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/madratdead.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/madratdead.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/madratdead-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/madratdead-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/madratdead-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p><em>Mad Rat Dead</em> is a rather clever little game. It’s a rhythm-based platformer with an incredible soundtrack where you have to jump, dash, and smash your way through levels. See, you’re a rat who has died without achieving your dream. You’ve been given a chance to do your last day on Earth over again, but you’ve got to pump your heart in time with the music lest you drop dead again. Help this revenge-minded rat settle the score before his number is up for good! Very fun, and the music is as awesome as it needed to be. Mikhail’s working on a little review for this one that you can look forward to in Monday’s article.</p> \n<h3><strong>Pixel Puzzle Makeout League ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273810\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pixelpuzzlemakeoutleague.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pixelpuzzlemakeoutleague.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pixelpuzzlemakeoutleague-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pixelpuzzlemakeoutleague-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pixelpuzzlemakeoutleague-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Yeah, this is laser-aimed right at me. It’s a <em>Picross</em>-style game, but also a visual novel with dating elements. About superheroes! And it’s absolutely off the wall in its sense of humor. It’s a solid game of <em>Picross</em>, with more than 250 puzzles to solve. The story is ridiculous, and the characters are absurd. I love it. You can date a giant alien puzzle piece! A <em>superhero</em> giant alien puzzle piece! What else do you want? I’ll be doing a review of this one that should pop up early next week, but if you like <em>Picross</em> and have a quirky sense of ha-ha, you’ll want to grab this.</p> \n<h3><strong>Legends of Ethernal ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273811\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/legendsofethernal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/legendsofethernal.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/legendsofethernal-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/legendsofethernal-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/legendsofethernal-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Gosh, there are some really nice-looking games out there these days. We’re kind of spoiled, if you think about it. I really look the bright, clean look of <em>Legends of Ethernal.</em> It’s a 2D action-adventure about a boy who, after losing his home and family, strikes out on a journey to find out what happened. You’ll have to solve puzzles and battle enemies to make your way through these lovely environments, picking up new weapons and items as you go. A crafting system is in place because you almost need to have one of those in your adventure game now. I haven’t had a chance to play this one yet, and it doesn’t seem like anyone else is talking about it either. I’ll investigate and get back to you all if it turns out to be really outstanding.</p> \n<h3><strong>The Language of Love ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273812\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelanguageoflove.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelanguageoflove.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelanguageoflove-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelanguageoflove-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelanguageoflove-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Okay, so you don’t want to make out with a giant alien puzzle piece. A <em>superhero</em> giant alien puzzle piece! Fine. I get it. More superhero giant alien puzzle piece smooches for <em>me</em>, then. How about a more typical romance? In this visual novel, you follow a university student named Mitsuki who finds himself outside of the circle of his fellow students due to being a little older than them. Things seem bad until he meets Himuro Kyouko, a single mother who lives in the same apartment building as him. She offers to help him study, and in return he offers to babysit Kyouko’s daughter Tama. Over the course of the year, a romance blooms between the two. An atypical love interest for a game of this type, but otherwise it’s the usual fluffy stuff that you either love or leave.</p> \n<h3><strong>Haunted: Poppy’s Nightmare ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273813\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hauntedpoppysadventure.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hauntedpoppysadventure.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hauntedpoppysadventure-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hauntedpoppysadventure-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hauntedpoppysadventure-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>You know, I can usually find more than enough information about any given game to at least give you all the general picture in these paragraphs, but I’m at a total loss here. It seems to be a Halloween-themed action-adventure game of sorts where you play as a little kid dressed as a witch who may actually be a witch? Ghosts are apparently after you, so you’ll probably need to avoid those. And there’s some business in the description about decorating the garden with objects? I’m not sure what to say about this one, but if it miraculously turns out to be something special I’ll report on it in the future.</p> \n<h3><strong>Family Mysteries 2: Echoes of Tomorrow ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273814\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/familymysteries2echoesoftomorrow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/familymysteries2echoesoftomorrow.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/familymysteries2echoesoftomorrow-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/familymysteries2echoesoftomorrow-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/familymysteries2echoesoftomorrow-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s your Artifex Mundi fix for the week. It’s another hidden object adventure, complete with a weird plot that somehow manages to string you along to the end. In this one, a scientist who has been framed travels through time to save his wife and find out the identity of her kidnapper. Oh, and the kidnapper is a time traveler too. Yeah, things are going to get messy. Apparently the bulk of the game takes place in a cyberpunk-ish future, which seems to be very trendy this eon. I feel like fans of these games know more or less what to expect by now; this game will not defy those expectations.</p> \n<h3><strong>Slither Loop ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273815\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/slitherloop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/slitherloop.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/slitherloop-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/slitherloop-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/slitherloop-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Well, that’s a nifty spin on the usual puzzle of this sort. You draw lines between dots, using the numbers as clues for how many lines should be surrounding it. You get 90 puzzles in here, running the gamut from easy to tough. There’s some relaxing background music, and… well, that’s about it really. If you like logic puzzles, you’ll probably enjoy this one well enough to get your five dollars’ worth out of it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Case 2: Animatronics Survival ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273816\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/case2animatronicssurvival.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/case2animatronicssurvival.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/case2animatronicssurvival-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/case2animatronicssurvival-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/case2animatronicssurvival-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Is this…? Oh my gosh, it <em>is</em>! It’s a <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> knock-off! It’s like a photocopy of a photocopy of Charles Entertainment Cheese! A first-person stealth horror game about avoiding rampant animatronics in an abandoned theme park, <em>Case 2</em> is the sequel to the original <em>Case</em>, which I am just now remembering is on the Nintendo Switch. Looking at reviews for that game, the consensus from critics was that it was so-so, but players seemed to take to it a lot better. I’d imagine that will be the same situation here. The Steam reviews for this sequel are quite positive, after all. Not my thing at all, so I won’t say too much more about it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Angry Video Game Nerd 1 &amp; 2 Deluxe ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273817\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/angryvideogamenerd1and2deluxe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/angryvideogamenerd1and2deluxe.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/angryvideogamenerd1and2deluxe-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/angryvideogamenerd1and2deluxe-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/angryvideogamenerd1and2deluxe-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>No need to go back to the past to play a sh… well, you know how it goes. You can play a pair of rage-inducing games right <em>here</em> in the present day with this pack of both of the <em>Angry Video Game Nerd</em> games. The first game has been completely rebuilt with the second game’s engine, and there are all sorts of new features to make playing the games a bit less frustrating if you want. Of course if you still want the bone-crunching difficulty, you can play the games as they were originally designed. It’s all up to you, friends. Personally, I’m kind of over the Nerd these days (hey, he lasted longer than most comedians tend to) and I didn’t care much for the first game when I played it on 3DS, but if you feel differently about either of those things? You really can’t go wrong here. There’s even a bit of extra content to wrap things up if you manage to finish both games.</p> \n<h3><strong>Umihara Kawase BaZooKa! ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273818\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/umiharakawasebazooka.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/umiharakawasebazooka.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/umiharakawasebazooka-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/umiharakawasebazooka-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/umiharakawasebazooka-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Phew. This… this is <em>not good</em>. I can see what the developer was going for here. Take the cult favorite<em> Umihara Kawase</em> characters and throw them into an arcade-style single-screen action game. But wow, it just doesn’t work at all. Not conceptually, and certainly not in practice. The basic flow of the mechanics, which sees you grabbing enemies and objects to use as ammo for your bazooka to take out other enemies, just isn’t well-balanced. You’ll often end up in positions where you can’t get ammo without taking a hit. The tight physics the main games in this series are known for are nowhere to be found here, either. Throw in some stiff controls and poor collision detection and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. It’s not even fun in multiplayer, which is a hard job to pull off.</p> \n<h3><strong>The Knight of Queen ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273819\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/theknightofqueen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/theknightofqueen.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/theknightofqueen-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/theknightofqueen-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/theknightofqueen-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is a VR RPG. A fairly simple virtual reality take on a <em>Dragon Quest</em>-style game. If you have the VR Toy-Con, you can play this as it was clearly meant to be played. Is it a great game? No, not really. But it’s amusing enough for a few hours, and it’s hard to argue with that price. Frankly, it’s nice to have a reason to pull those goggles out of storage even if only for a weekend. It sure isn’t much to look at, though. And the step-by-step movement is a bit uncomfortable on the eyes when you’re playing in VR.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Ha ha ha, oh <em>wow</em>. There are about 250 games in the list of new sales, and for whatever reason I actually included <em>all</em> of them. Well… I’ll mostly leave it you to find what you want. I will mention that <em>Thimbleweed Park</em> rules and is rarely on sale. <em>Wulverblade</em> is another rarely seen title in these lists, and at 90% off it’s a beat-em-up worth having. But hey, lots there. Have fun. Don’t forget the outbox.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-247878\"

I hope you all find some way to enjoy Halloween tomorrow in spite of all the… <em>stuff</em> going on out there. November is the last big month of releases before things start slowing down again, with the big hitters being Square Enix’s<em> Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</em> and Nintendo/Koei Tecmo’s<em> Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>. If those games don’t tickle your fancy, worry not: there will be literally hundreds of other games coming out next month alongside them. Have a nice weekend, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 19:03:58

Nintendo did a nice little stealth Direct yesterday, giving us some news and shadow-dropped games to enjoy. I’ll briefly go over that before heading into the tons of new releases we need to summarize today. There are also the usual lists of incoming and outgoing sales to look at. Plus, we’ll be doing a giveaway of two North American digital copies of<em> Torchlight III</em> for Switch through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toucharcade\">the TouchArcade Twitter account</a>, so make sure to check that out. Let’s go!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Bravely Default II’ and More Feature in the Latest Nintendo Direct Mini</strong></p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-dgmufhx4c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Nintendo dropped what it says is its final Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase for the year, and it had a lot of interesting things in it. We got a better look at <em>Bravely Default II</em>, which is now coming in February of next year. Two streaming games, <em>Hitman 3</em> and <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>, were announced, with the latter now available on the eShop. A new <em>Story of Seasons</em> was shown off, and <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> has a demo available now. There’s plenty to see in there, so do give that video a watch if you haven’t done so yet.</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>No More Heroes ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273743\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Suda Goichi’s tale of a weirdo taking on the world’s top ten assassins makes its way to the Switch in grand style. This game was originally released on the Wii and if you want to maintain the motion controls of that version the Joy-Cons do a decent imitation. While this is definitely a beefed-up HD version of the game, it seems to be closer to the Wii version in most respects than the PlayStation 3 version. Trust me when I say that is a very <em>good</em> thing. Anyway, this is a really fun and charmingly unique game that is definitely worth the reasonable price they’re asking for here.</p> \n<h3><strong>No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273744\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nomoreheroes2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The sequel to <em>No More Heroes</em> has, until now, only been available on the Nintendo Wii. It launched on that system in 2010, which means it didn’t quite get as much as attention as the first game did. Perhaps that might have you thinking that it is not as worthy a game as the first, but that would be a mistake<em>. No More Heroes 2</em> is awesome. Three years after clawing his way to the top of the assassin world, Travis Touchdown finds himself tumbling all the way down to number 51. Making matters worse, another assassin specifically has it in for him. Can Travis get his groove back and survive to see another day? The game has been given the HD treatment and is looking its absolute best here.</p> \n<h3><strong>Control Ultimate Edition – Cloud Version (Free, $39.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273745\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/controlultimateeditioncloudversion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/controlultimateeditioncloudversion.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/controlultimateeditioncloudversion-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/controlultimateeditioncloudversion-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/controlultimateeditioncloudversion-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Well, this is interesting, isn’t it? Realistically speaking, Remedy’s action-adventure <em>Control</em> was <em>never</em> going to make it to the Switch hardware as we know it. We’ve seen the limits of down-porting high-end games to the Switch, and it sits somewhere between <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds</em>. So instead, 505 Games has opted to make a different sort of compromise. <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em> is a streaming game on Switch, which means you have to have a good, reliable internet connection at all times while playing. Your mileage will vary as to how well that’s going to work, but the publisher has been kind enough to let you test the first five minutes of the game for free to check before asking you to plunk down $39.99 for full access. I’m a little mixed on this, because while it certainly opens up options for games that would not have been possible on the Switch before, I really don’t like being chained to my internet connection. Fantastic game, though.</p> \n<h3><strong>Cthulhu Saves Christmas ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273746\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cthulhusaveschristmas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cthulhusaveschristmas.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cthulhusaveschristmas-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cthulhusaveschristmas-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cthulhusaveschristmas-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>After saving the world, what else could be next but saving Christmas? Join Cthulhu, Baba Yaga-Chan, the Snow Maidan, and Belsnickel as they seek to save Santa from the League of Christmas Evil in this holiday-themed JRPG from the fine folks at Zeboyd Games. This is a compact experience, running about four or five hours in total, but it is densely packed. A great combat system that advances on the one seen in<em> Cthulhu Saves the World</em>, much nicer visuals, a relationship system that lets you build bonds with friends and enemies, and more await. This Switch version also includes a New Game+ mode that allows you to max out all of the R’lyehtionship levels with everyone, which is quite welcome. I’ll have a review of this one next week, but I’ve yet to play a Zeboyd RPG that I didn’t like and this won’t be the one to change that.</p> \n<h3><strong>Part-Time UFO ($8.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273747\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parttimeufo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parttimeufo.jpg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parttimeufo-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parttimeufo-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parttimeufo-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>This is an expanded version of the rather lovely mobile game released by HAL Labs a while back. You play as a cute little UFO who is trying to earn some extra money by taking on various part-time jobs. All of them involve using your UFO’s hook to pick things up and drop them, and you’ll often find yourself needing to stack some very oddly-shaped objects. This new version includes some extra modes, including a two-player simultaneous mode that can get pretty chaotic to say the least. I’ll have a review of this one detailing the new content early next week, so keep an eye out for that if you need more details.</p> \n<h3><strong>Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition ($16.66)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273748\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yuppiepsychoexecutiveedition.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yuppiepsychoexecutiveedition.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yuppiepsychoexecutiveedition-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yuppiepsychoexecutiveedition-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yuppiepsychoexecutiveedition-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>And you thought <em>your</em> first job was bad? Brian Pasternack starts his first day at Sintracorp, one of the world’s largest corporations. His first job? Hunting a witch who helped the company become what it is and is now back to collect the debt. In this horror adventure, you need to find the witch before they realize you’re on to them, all while navigating an office building filled with weird and wild characters. Great puzzles, an excellent story, and a unique atmosphere make this a trip worth taking for fans of horror games or adventure games. Don’t let the cartoony look fool you: things can get pretty bloody. And they probably will. Good luck at the office! This game has great reviews in its PC form, and I imagine it will find a receptive audience on the Switch as well.</p> \n<h3><strong>Wallachia: Reign of Dracula ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273749\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wallachiareignofdracula.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wallachiareignofdracula.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wallachiareignofdracula-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wallachiareignofdracula-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wallachiareignofdracula-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>One of the hard facts I’ve had to face over the last several years is that <em>Contra</em> and <em>Castlevania</em> are both effectively dead as ongoing brands. But we’re seeing a lot of games that want to try to recapture the spirit of those legends, to varying degrees of success. I think <em>Wallachia</em> is the first one I’ve seen that tries to capture the spirit of <em>both</em> games at once. You battle through seven levels to take down Vlad the Impaler. Your character wields a bow and a sword, and she’ll be making considerable use of the former as she makes her way through waves of enemies. The developer made some <em>Castlevania</em> fan games in the past, managed to swing an unlockable bonus costume from<em> Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>, and even brought in Robert Belgrade (the original voice of Alucard in <em>Symphony of the Night</em>) as a voice actor. This game was well-received when it hit PC a couple years back, so I’m excited to see how it takes to Switch.</p> \n<h3><strong>Barbearian ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273750\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/barbearian.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/barbearian.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/barbearian-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/barbearian-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/barbearian-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>This enjoyable hack-and-slash carved its way into our hearts when it launched on mobile a couple of years ago, and it’s still a lot of fun now. You play as a barbarian dressed like a bear who likes to solve problems with his axe. There are more than 100 levels of action, with loot, upgrades, and plenty of weapons to play with. Sometimes you rescue prisoners and recruit them to your army, but don’t worry that the focus will ever be taken away from the pure thrill of battle. Just minor detours on your path of destruction, I promise. Not much to add, really. This isn’t the most complicated of games, so my description can only go so far.</p> \n<h3><strong>Crimzon Clover – World EXplosion ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273751\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crimzoncloverworldexplosion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crimzoncloverworldexplosion.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crimzoncloverworldexplosion-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crimzoncloverworldexplosion-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crimzoncloverworldexplosion-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Sometimes a screenshot tells just about everything you need to tell about a game, and that screenshot right there sure does say a lot about <em>Crimzon Clover</em>. It’s a vertical shoot-em-up of the bullet hell variety, and it wears that badge with pride. Multiple difficulty settings and play modes aim to give you a way to adjust the experience somewhat to fit your needs, but it’s obviously not going to change the basic hardcore nature of this one. As long as you’re willing to punch that particular ticket, you’ll find this to be an absolutely awesome shooter that will test your skills while delivering solid thrills. You’ll be chasing scores until the wee hours of the night, practicing again and again to overcome the stiff challenge of this intense title.</p> \n<h3><strong>Touhou Spell Bubble ($54.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273752\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/touhouspellbubble.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/touhouspellbubble.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/touhouspellbubble-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/touhouspellbubble-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/touhouspellbubble-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Well, that’s a bold price. That’s Taito for you, though. Anyway, this probably looks a lot like<em> Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move</em>, but it actually adds in a rhythm game element to make it feel like a whole different animal. And hey, Taito made <em>Puzzle Bobble</em> so I’m fine with cutting them some slack. You get a whole bunch of <em>Touhou</em> characters to choose from, lots of songs to play to, and a variety of modes to play. And yes, ZUNTATA is on the soundtrack. If the 48 included tunes aren’t enough for you, you can buy more song packs. It’s expensive, and frankly I think it’s somewhat overpriced, but if you’ve got the money to burn the game itself is definitely awesome.</p> \n<h3><strong>Arcade Archives 64th Street ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273753\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/arcadearchives64thstreet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1368\" height=\"770\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/arcadearchives64thstreet.jpg 1368w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/arcadearchives64thstreet-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/arcadearchives64thstreet-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/arcadearchives64thstreet-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This week’s <em>Arcade Archives</em> release flashes us back to 1991, when Jaleco released a beat-em-up named <em>64th Street</em>. It follows a mustachioed detective named Rick and his cap-wearing partner Allen as they bash their way through the streets to save the daughter of a company president. It’s more than a little inspired by <em>Final Fight</em>, but it’s amusing enough for what it is. A nice example of the flavor of the era, just before<em> Street Fighter II</em> caught fire and everything became one-on-one fighters for a long while. You could probably make the case that <em>64th Street</em> ended up spawning <em>Rival Turf</em> and its progeny, which makes it at least a little noteworthy. Hamster did its job well as usual, giving you the finest <em>64th Street</em> you could ever hope for.</p> \n<h3><strong>Esports Life Tycoon ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273754\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/esportslifetycoon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/esportslifetycoon.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/esportslifetycoon-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/esportslifetycoon-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/esportslifetycoon-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>ESPORTS!</strong> </em></span>Statistically speaking, some of the people reading this like or even love them. And maybe some of those people also love sim games, and would like to mash the two together into a sweet little ball of sweat and pride. Well, my fragrant friends, this game may well be for you! Hire the big stars, set their training as you see fit, join tournaments, and try to make the big bucks so you can roll them back into your growing team. Hang back and watch the matches play out or step in to make certain decisions at critical moments. This game has middling reviews on other platforms, but I feel like games targeting specific demographics like this does tend to do fine as long as they’re not completely terrible.</p> \n<h3><strong>Demong Hunter ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273755\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonghunter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonghunter.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonghunter-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonghunter-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/demonghunter-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Anyone can hunt demons, but these heroes are a special sort that spend their adventuring days tracking down demongs. This is an action game with some light RPG elements, and if you feel like you’ve seen it before that’s probably because it’s the first of a series of games that have been on mobile for a while. It’s free-to-play there, with microtransactions for gold and characters. I’m not sure how that all works here in the Switch version, but I can say that there aren’t any IAPs in here according to the eShop description. It has its fans on mobile and I appreciate that they didn’t go completely bananas with the price here. Some cute art, too. Give the free version a try on mobile first to see how you like it before you drop the eight bucks on it, of course.</p> \n<h3><strong>De: Yabatanien ($13.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273756\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deyabatanien.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deyabatanien.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deyabatanien-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deyabatanien-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deyabatanien-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is something of an escape room puzzle game where you need to make your way out of a mansion with more than 100 rooms. You will come across girls caught up in a variety of traps, and your actions will determine if they will live or die. The ending you receive at the end is connected to how many of the girls you manage to save. The pixelated, cutesy graphics put a disarming face on what is actually a pretty disturbing game at times. I’m not a big escape room guy, but if you’re into them you might find <em>De: Yabatanien</em> to be an interesting, slightly different take on the genre.</p> \n<h3><strong>Wonder Blade ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273757\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wonderblade.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wonderblade.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wonderblade-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wonderblade-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wonderblade-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Wonder Blade</em> was a fun homage to <em>Castle Crashers</em> when it arrived on mobile a couple years back. I know Jared really loved it, and I think many of our readers did as well. Here it is on Switch! It’s pretty much as you remember it, but without the IAPs. Can this game thrive on the same platform as <em>Castle Crashers</em>, selling for the same price? I don’t know, but it’s nice to have the option to just pay an extra ten bucks and not deal with microtransaction nonsense if nothing else. Personally, I’m not a huge fan of<em> Castle Crashers</em> so I’m not really the sort that is going to chase down similar titles.</p> \n<h3><strong>Diamond Girl *An Earnest Education in Love* ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273758\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diamondgirlanearnesteducation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diamondgirlanearnesteducation.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diamondgirlanearnesteducation-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diamondgirlanearnesteducation-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diamondgirlanearnesteducation-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Otome</em> visual novel time? <em>Otome</em> visual novel time. In<em> Diamond Girl</em>, you play a so-called love-allergic girl who lays about the house and doesn’t even bother to properly get dressed. That is, until you suddenly find out that you are in fact the heiress to an enormously wealthy trading company. You’re whisked away to a mansion where you need to learn the ins an outs of your new role in life, finding yourself in contact with a charming and protective butler, a moody and arrogant fiance, a cool and strict brother-in-law, and an airheaded bad-boy cousin. One of these men will be your smooching target, but you’ll have to make the right decisions to make it happen. Nothing particularly outstanding about this one, but if you’re hungry for what it’s serving, don’t let me stop you.</p> \n<h3><strong>#Halloween, Super Puzzles Dream ($5.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273759\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloweensuperpuzzlesdream.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloweensuperpuzzlesdream.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloweensuperpuzzlesdream-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloweensuperpuzzlesdream-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/halloweensuperpuzzlesdream-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is the third<em> Super Puzzles Dream</em> game, and aside from the Halloween theme it’s basically the same deal as the first two. Kind of a falling-piece jigsaw puzzle game, which is a cute enough idea. If you enjoyed the first two games and are hungry for more, particularly with a theme that will be past its sell-by date in three days, you won’t be unhappy with this. Pull in a friend or family member and you can enjoy the puzzle-solving action cooperatively and competitively. Not a whole lot more to say about it, so I won’t.</p> \n<h3><strong>Super Puzzle Pack ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273760\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/superpuzzlepack.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/superpuzzlepack.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/superpuzzlepack-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/superpuzzlepack-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/superpuzzlepack-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>There are four different types of puzzle game in here, which initially sounds like a pretty good deal. Let’s see what you get. First, a match-3 game with 100 levels and a pirate theme. Oh, there’s another match-3 theme here too. Well, that’s fine. Jigsaw puzzles, 200 of them. Not very exciting, but okay. Some people dig these digital jigsaw puzzles. Next, a 2048 game. Mmm. The last game is a match-5. Alright then. Some of the games have a local multiplayer option in case you want to do some competitive 2048 or cooperative jigsaw-puzzling. So how much is this, about ten bucks? <em>Thirty</em>?! That’s… good luck with <em>that</em>, I suppose.</p> \n<h3><strong>Detective Puz ($5.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273761\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/detectivepuz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/detectivepuz.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/detectivepuz-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/detectivepuz-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/detectivepuz-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>An odd little puzzle game that at first glance reminds of Square Enix’s classic <em>GO</em> games. But a second glance reveals that the first glance was largely mistaken, I’m afraid. Gosh, I would love to have those games on Switch. Oh well. <em>Detective Puz</em> tasks you with completing 40 levels where you need to collect diamonds and defeat enemies in turn-based strategic gameplay. There’s a decent idea at this game’s core, but it feels just a bit too slight in the end even at a fairly reasonable price.</p> \n<h3><strong>The Last Blade: Beyond the Destiny ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273762\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelastbladebeyondthedestiny.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelastbladebeyondthedestiny.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelastbladebeyondthedestiny-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelastbladebeyondthedestiny-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thelastbladebeyondthedestiny-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s the fourth release in SNK’s NEOGEO Pocket Color collection, and it’s another fighting game. This time it’s <em>The Last Blade</em>, and it’s fine. Definitely stripped down from the rather technical NEOGEO original, but it’s a solid handheld fighter for its era. There are lots of unlockables in this one, so there’s a lot of fun to be had even if you don’t have a second player to join in. Of course, it’s better if you do have a friend. The unusual tempo of <em>The Last Blade</em> isn’t for everyone, but if it’s your bag you’ll probably appreciate this handheld take on it. The nice people at Code Mystics have given this the same treatment they did the other three Switch releases, giving you the nicest possible presentation of the game you could expect.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>This is the calm before the storm as usual, with the rest of the sales likely coming in after I write this but before you see it. We’ll catch up with the remainder tomorrow. What we have already isn’t too shabby, though. Lots of new games on there, plus a rare discount on <em>SmileBASIC 4</em>. <em>Vampyr</em> for twenty bucks is quite a treat for fans of Western RPGs. The outbox is somewhat small, but there are some good games in there to consider as well.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273675\"

It’s like, where do you even GO from there? How do you improve on perfection? Well somehow these developers have figured out a way, and just about 6 weeks after its release on desktop, the iOS version of <em>Death Road to Canada</em> has just received the massive KIDNEY update. It didn’t receive an actual enlarged kidney, but KIDNEY is the codename for this update and boy howdy is it ever a biggie. So big, in fact, that there’s no way I’m going to try and list everything that’s new. No way. You can find the exhaustive details in the update section of the game’s App Store page, or <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/252610/view/5277612140661726443\">over on Steam</a>. One thing I will mention though is UNLOCKABLE HATS. Also, in a similar vein to ILEUM’s more realistic dog poop, Rocketcat and Madgarden continue to show that they know what features are truly important to their players as the KIDNEY update now features headlights and taillights on vehicles. Take that, Ray tracing. </p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ee9L_NiwGlc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Alongside this update comes some rather earth-shattering news in the world of Rocketcat. As you may already know, they are known for never putting their mobile games on sale in an act of defiance towards the “race to the bottom\" mentality of the App Store. Instead, they actually <strong>raise</strong> the price of their games by a dollar with each major update, thus rewarding early adopters AND justifying the costs of development of new content. It just makes the most sense to do things this way, but for whatever reason mobile gaming has done things in pretty much the opposite way since its inception. However, they haven’t applied their “no sales\" rule to other platforms, and on Steam they’ve had frequent sales with positive results. So starting in December they’ll be including iOS in the various sales they do throughout the year. This also means an end to the “raise the price with each update\" thing they’ve been doing. </p> \n<p>With one exception…</p> \n<p>Rocketcat has revealed that there’s a “very big update\" in the works for <em>Wayward Souls</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id857555369?mt=8\">($6.99)</a>, our <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2014/12/26/toucharcade-game-of-the-year-2014-wayward-souls/\">2014 Game of the Year</a>, and they’ll be raising the price of the game one last time to coincide with the update’s release. <em>Wayward Souls</em> received heavy support for a couple of years following its release, then it went kind of dormant for a couple of years, and then in March of last year Rocketcat <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/03/20/wayward-souls-full-screen-update/\">released an update</a> that was largely just compatibility with new screen sizes and other small fixes. <strong>Don’t get me wrong</strong>, I was more than ecstatic to have one of my all-time favorite video games finally updated with fullscreen support, but I also would love to see some new content released. Could this finally be the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/05/08/wayward-souls-paladin-videos/\">long, LONG-awaited Paladin update</a>? We just don’t know yet, but Rocketcat says that more news on this forthcoming <em>Wayward Souls</em> update will be coming soon.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qM2JwebnfLg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>In the meantime, there should be P-L-E-N-T-Y to keep you busy with this new KIDNEY update for <em>Death Road to Canada</em>. Did I mention that <em>Death Road to Canada</em> was <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/12/29/toucharcade-game-of-the-year-2017-death-road-to-canada/\">also one of our Game of the Year picks</a>, this one back in 2017? Because it was. Along with <em>Wayward Souls</em> in 2014. Yes, we like Rocketcat’s games a lot. They actually just launched a new game called <em>Cannibal Crossing</em> <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304090/Cannibal_Crossing/\">into Early Access on Steam</a> last week, and it’s been getting a positive response so far. Might that make its way to mobile someday, and perhaps be in the running for yet another Game of the Year crowning? Who knows! For now let’s just focus on all this <em>Death Road to Canada</em> goodness and the possibility of a new <em>Wayward Souls</em> update. Though, now that I think about it, I <strong>would</strong> love a <em>Punch Quest</em> update. Hmmmmm…</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 22:55:31
