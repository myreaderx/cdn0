In this wintry follow-up, the surface hates you and the water is your refuge right from the start. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=1GmPKR0jzKQ:DAH2TQz7H3U:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=1GmPKR0jzKQ:DAH2TQz7H3U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/1GmPKR0jzKQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 May 2021 12:39:26 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review-1.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/subnautica-below-zero-review-1.jpg","linkMd5":"e603cf7a4b81f9f4a43bc6654f58120c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-04-618_b50d3e9cb4c47c70.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":202917,"destBytes":136062,"author":"Brendan Caldwell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review-1.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/subnautica-below-zero-review-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-04-618_b50d3e9cb4c47c70.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/1GmPKR0jzKQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn95@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-36-507_b95fca1a8a1388c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163217},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Best Arma 3 mods","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-arma-3-mods","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/arma-3-best-mods-header.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/arma-3-best-mods-header.jpg\" /> <p>As an on-off <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-3\">Arma 3</a> fan (250 hours seems like nothing in the Arma scheme of things), I generally find the base game not much of a game.

The LG 34GP83A is essentially the 34\" ultrawide version of the company's 27GL850, a monitor that was in almost every tech outlet's best monitor roundup after it debuted last year. The ultrawide version uses the same kind of 'Fast IPS' panel, providing excellent motion clarity plus the accurate colours and wide viewing angles IPS screens are known for. It's a great combination that makes for a strong all-around monitor, and perhaps it's no surprise that the 34GP83A has been almost impossible to find at MSRP for months - until today, when it finally reappeared online for $799.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-34-lg-ultrawide-gaming-monitor-is-finally-back-in-stock\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=RnYfeazaGzQ:ZaIp_t_rd3g:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=RnYfeazaGzQ:ZaIp_t_rd3g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/RnYfeazaGzQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:03:25 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/ultragear.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/ultragear.jpg","linkMd5":"e605d758f2f190b9941da1267d41aa69","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-05-213_e1966c33a8e8c4e0.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":183135,"destBytes":97738,"author":"Will Judd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/ultragear.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/ultragear.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-05-213_e1966c33a8e8c4e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/RnYfeazaGzQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-37-252_6c93ca8d5f751d43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163219},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Intel AI makes GTA 5 look photorealistic but not better","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-ai-makes-gta-5-look-photorealistic-but-not-better","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/gta5-intel-ai.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/gta5-intel-ai.jpg\" /> <p>Yesterday saw <a href=\"https://preview.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-has-arrived\">the release of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a>, a remaster which used AI to upscale many of the original game's textures so they look better at 4K. \n</p>\n<p>That's nothing compared to what Intel are working on, however.

In fairness, I still don't really get it if I'm being honest, because having finally waded through the end of Resident Evil 7 earlier this week, I'm here to tell you that I actually <em>liked</em> the second half of Resi 7, and I don't care who knows it.

If you hadn't come up with a plan yet, you can always go with one of the classics: going on a cross-country road trip with a con man to somehow save your mom's video store from mobsters. That's what local sarcastic 90s teen Ali is doing in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-big-con\">The Big Con</a> this summer, anyhow. I hope she makes some lasting memories, because I've got bad news for her about the eventual longevity of her mom's VHS store.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-big-con-is-a-90s-teen-adventure-game-coming-this-summer\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=l07EoB5ccQY:6eLz2gIm-OY:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=l07EoB5ccQY:6eLz2gIm-OY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/l07EoB5ccQY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 May 2021 16:11:35 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/the-big-con-ali.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/the-big-con-ali.jpg","linkMd5":"cae93b12770c5fc1496be062c4e52ce1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-743_b2002122c01e461a.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":375196,"destBytes":185428,"author":"Lauren Morton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/the-big-con-ali.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/the-big-con-ali.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-743_b2002122c01e461a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/l07EoB5ccQY":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163220},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"The Ascent's top-down cyberpunk shooting is looking, you know, fine","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ascent-preview","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ascent-coop.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/the-ascent-coop.jpg\" /> <p>Going by the art for top-down cyberpunk shooter <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-ascent\">The Ascent</a>, I thought I'd be in for a thrill ride. It's bold and red and has these three menacing characters with guns that look ready for <em>violence</em>.

I'd expected to coat walls with human bolognese and clog up machinery with cooked frags, but the kitchen wasn't quite as frantic as that.

I've noticed mech games, for example, are having a bit of a moment these last few years. It's not huge, and I don't see them absorbing everything like survival games or bloody roguelikes, but they're definitely picking up. It's a bit of a thin premise for a whole article though, right?</p>\n<p>And then there's simultaneous turns. I want to cheer them on, to bewail the lack of games that dive into that rift between turn based and real time tactics and scheming. But so few games do it that I haven't found the champion I need.

French finalist Alfredino&rsquo;s Archmage of Fire, leading his High Elves from the back of a giant eagle, pushes past the safety provided by ranks of elite archers. His Russian opponent Evenstar's Wood Elf caster drops a Tempest spell. The arcane whirlwind plays havoc with Alfredino&rsquo;s Archmage, leaving the elf caster wounded and near immobilised. It&rsquo;s then the Wood Elves&rsquo; deadly arrows come, sealing the Archmage&rsquo;s fate.\n</p>\n<p>\nLosing a general is always a morale hit, but for players this practised, it isn&rsquo;t always a death sentence. In this case it&rsquo;s a disadvantage Alfredino, despite some excellent cavalry plays, never quite manages to recover from. The finals wrap, and Evenstar takes the lion&rsquo;s share of the $4,200 prize pool. A relatively humble figure, as far as organised e-sports go, but this isn&rsquo;t some sponsored, glitzy event.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-total-war-warhammers-players-built-themselves-a-world-championship\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=7uxOdJTWuWA:rHKM2TvR4e8:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=7uxOdJTWuWA:rHKM2TvR4e8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/7uxOdJTWuWA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-world-championship-2.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/warhammer-world-championship-2.jpg","linkMd5":"7856b6d34508d1e8a91c2a87ec95131c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-04-210_9d5ba9a77db77945.webp","destWidth":967,"destHeight":544,"sourceBytes":68680,"destBytes":50072,"author":"Nic Reuben","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-world-championship-2.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/warhammer-world-championship-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn79@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-04-210_9d5ba9a77db77945.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/7uxOdJTWuWA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn49@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-325_d114a2249ce07184.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163218},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Total War: Warhammer 3's new trailer shows off Kislev's big, awesome bears","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-new-cinematic-trailer-kislev-vs-khorne","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-kislev-bears.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/total-war-warhammer-3-kislev-bears.jpg\" /> <p>\n  Kislev and Khorne are going head to head in the newest <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii\">Total War: Warhammer 3 </a>trailer that just landed today.

But because these were my introductions to the genre, I don't really go in for the big town-planning-paloozas like <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity\">SimCity</a>, because I find having to efficiently place sewage systems a bit stressful.

It's a fantasy setting where you can choose from four standard fantasy races (human, dwarf, elf or orc) and, eventually, will have a bustling city where they all mingle together. And my favourite thing about it so far is that there isn't some tortured allegory for real life racism. All the races are basically described as, like, \"a great bunch of best pals! :D\" but with different hobbies. And my most favourite thing is that also applies to the orcs. They are chill hippies who like meditation and farming and I love them.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bless-this-fantasy-city-builder-for-its-orc-positivity\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=IT88GN42DB0:BCCKlrHL8G8:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=IT88GN42DB0:BCCKlrHL8G8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/IT88GN42DB0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 May 2021 13:10:36 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/distant-kingdoms-orc-bio.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/distant-kingdoms-orc-bio.jpg","linkMd5":"60c10c5fd514bcc14347ad00975bf48e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-04-844_c38afa059c442417.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":211218,"destBytes":127852,"author":"Alice Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/distant-kingdoms-orc-bio.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/distant-kingdoms-orc-bio.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-04-844_c38afa059c442417.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/IT88GN42DB0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn94@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-320_18c60b37f29a1551.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163221},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Dell's RTX 30-series laptops and desktops are 20% off today","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dells-rtx-30-series-laptops-and-desktops-are-20-off-today","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/dell.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/dell.jpg\" /> <p>RTX 30-series graphics cards have been almost impossible to come by since they launched last year, but the situation seems to be slowly improving in the UK.

As of 2090, it's one of the hottest places to be, the biggest border city between the future states and the badlands, and the place where you'll make or break it.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/text-based-rpg-cyberpunkdreams-is-out-now-and-free-to-play\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=N6JgJFTnLEo:23tx25-775U:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=N6JgJFTnLEo:23tx25-775U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/N6JgJFTnLEo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 May 2021 21:56:44 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunkdreams.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/cyberpunkdreams.jpg","linkMd5":"f051630d7bc6c9ba2e1932b9915c1147","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn55@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-04-796_b04533fcdcace0db.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":324049,"destBytes":185086,"author":"Lauren Morton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunkdreams.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/cyberpunkdreams.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn55@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-04-796_b04533fcdcace0db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/N6JgJFTnLEo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn40@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-36-427_ffbd937613367471.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163213},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"The Mass Effect remaster got an 11GB patch last night","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-mass-effect-remaster-got-a-beefy-11-gb-patch-last-night","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-me1-5.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/mass-effect-legendary-edition-me1-5.jpg\" /> <p>\n<a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition\">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> received its first big update last night, bringing some helpful calibrations to BioWare's freshly remastered sci-fi RPG trilogy.

Back then parents fretted that Pikachu was secretly conscripting children into Satan&rsquo;s army, what with the paranormal tinge of its bestiary and the presence of &lsquo;undead&rsquo; Ghost types. When, as we all know, the only Pok&eacute;mon you need to watch your kids around is Mr Mime. <em>Powerful</em> Operation Yewtree energy.</p>\n<p>All the while Shin Megami Tensei was doing its thing in Japan, actively encouraging you to negotiate with a snake with the head of a dog in order to secure your rule in post-apocalyptic hellscapes. Pikachu was just a diversion! Well played, The Devil, well played. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-megami-tensei-3-nocturne-hd-remaster-review\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=VdeyNBAxbKU:nGbl-rRDAeQ:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=VdeyNBAxbKU:nGbl-rRDAeQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/VdeyNBAxbKU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-megami-tensei-3-remastered-9.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/shin-megami-tensei-3-remastered-9.jpg","linkMd5":"0466c1314df440af80c6a3e0729f1fb5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-576_49fd2797a7dd7ee0.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":109251,"destBytes":75058,"author":"Matthew Castle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-megami-tensei-3-remastered-9.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/shin-megami-tensei-3-remastered-9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-576_49fd2797a7dd7ee0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/VdeyNBAxbKU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-36-833_426049755ce8c472.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163223},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"EWS podcast episode 139: the best giants special","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-episode-139-the-best-giants-in-games-special","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-extreme-close-up.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-extreme-close-up.jpg\" /> <p>The EWS <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/podcast\">podcast</a> was on hiatus last week, because I was in a cottage where milk gets delivered in old-school glass bottles and then isn't drunk but left in the fridge unopened so it curdles but still looks new <em>and then my cup of tea is ruined</em>.

Reportedly, some of WB's games studios will stay with AT&amp;T, while others will go with the new company. \n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-games-reportedly-being-split-up-after-att-merger\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=7pV_nLM-5nM:eRx_lLDq-xc:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=7pV_nLM-5nM:eRx_lLDq-xc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/7pV_nLM-5nM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 13:35:55 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-rocksteady.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/batman-rocksteady.jpg","linkMd5":"d2b2d8d3c9f76294698e9c1c39167f1c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn79@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-05-396_b8c0db53f5be78a5.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":190123,"destBytes":113482,"author":"Imogen Beckhelling","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-rocksteady.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/batman-rocksteady.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn79@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-05-396_b8c0db53f5be78a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/7pV_nLM-5nM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn6@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-36-325_687728ad7192ea58.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163205},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"I like the look of retro-styled cyberpunk shooter Sprawl","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-dig-the-look-of-retro-styled-cyberpunk-shooter-sprawl","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/sprawl.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/sprawl.png\" /> <p>If your first-person shooter is set in a dystopian futurecity and has zippy movement, you need to have fights bouncing and dashing across rooftops.

That's why, as internal SSDs have become table stakes for gaming machines, external SSDs have also started to become quite popular. By pairing fast flash memory with a high-speed USB connection, you can get storage that feels just as rapid as the <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming\">best SSDs for gaming</a>, but can travel with you to be used with desktops, laptops, TVs and game consoles. Amazon's Gaming Week sale includes quite a few of these modern marvels, so we're going to break down the best buys available from the likes of WD and SanDisk.</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-external-ssd-and-hdd-deals-from-amazon-gaming-week\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=WWKGYITwS0Q:EM2dWVuAaPo:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=WWKGYITwS0Q:EM2dWVuAaPo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/WWKGYITwS0Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 May 2021 21:03:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/wd-black-external-storage.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/wd-black-external-storage.jpg","linkMd5":"eeaa34dffd05e38b09145a91e761add5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn26@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-637_f58b4ce4d04e9fd4.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":144985,"destBytes":115242,"author":"Will Judd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/wd-black-external-storage.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/wd-black-external-storage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn26@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-03-637_f58b4ce4d04e9fd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/WWKGYITwS0Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-714_586d39931a043052.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163223},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Lost Ruins has combat, platforming, fancy particle effects, and a terrible idle animation","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-ruins-has-combat-platforming-fancy-particle-effects-and-a-terrible-idle-animation","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-ruins-header.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/lost-ruins-header.jpg\" /> <p>Lost Ruins is a 2D sidescrolling action platformer in which you can mix-and-match abilities while fighting monsters, but I'd hesitate to put it in a box alongside Dead Cells.

While you're at it, you're being hunted yourself - by another assassin who can played by your pals. I'm really hoping <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored\">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane will deliver something great with this one, and having seen an action-packed (if hands-off) preview, I can't imagine any other studio pulling it off. \n</p>\n<p>\nI was given the low-down on all the weird and wonderful supernatural abilities at your disposal in Deathloop, and Arkane also showed off how missions on the game's 60s-themed party island can go down. While it offers you plenty of stealthy opportunities, however, it seems pretty different from the Dishonored experience, sometimes favouring the guns-blazing approach.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-preview\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Y67WOHSLFP4:mdgFt0Nj04c:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=Y67WOHSLFP4:mdgFt0Nj04c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Y67WOHSLFP4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:06:23 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop_may_01-8637260941513cc78b5.14268356.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/deathloop_may_01-8637260941513cc78b5.14268356.png","linkMd5":"44505f335ac05e0c298743dcf4ff185b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn20@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-05-245_81527292305561d8.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":269451,"destBytes":189056,"author":"Imogen Beckhelling","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop_may_01-8637260941513cc78b5.14268356.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/deathloop_may_01-8637260941513cc78b5.14268356.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn20@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-05-245_81527292305561d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-36-773_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-36-795_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/Y67WOHSLFP4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn77@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-37-233_376b0d1c46ded9fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436163223},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:03","title":"Have You Played...

You knit a bunch of triangles together, they make shapes, right. Now everytime I open Twitter there's someone posting an intricately detailed 3D model and writing \"actually, this is just a sphere\" above it, or posting a fully animated 3D character and saying, \"this is really just a shader.\" \n</p>\n<p>But today's graphics marvel is the voxel. I previously thought of them as betamax to polygon's VHS, but voxels have had a resurgence of late via various indie games. And I've never seen anything voxelly as intricately detailed as an in-development engine by a programmer called John Lin.
