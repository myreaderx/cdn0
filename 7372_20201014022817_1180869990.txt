Reports show that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/06/12/covid-19-accelerated-e-commerce-growth-4-to-6-years/#3ad7cb42600f\" target=\"_blank\">online revenue is growing 5 times faster than pre-COVID growth</a>, and conveniences such as <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Retail/Our%20Insights/Adapting%20to%20the%20next%20normal%20in%20retail%20The%20customer%20experience%20imperative/Adapting-to-the-next-normal-in-retail-the-customer-experience-imperative-v3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">buy-online-pick-up-in-store are showing signs of permanent adoption</a>. As retail businesses continue to adapt to these changing behaviors, providing an easy and safe shopping experience is more important than ever before. One channel that solves for both of these shopper behaviors is email. </p><p>Today, we are hosting <a href=\"https://amp.dev/events/amp-fest-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Fest</a> where we are excited to announce that AMP-based emails are coming to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. AMP is an open-source web component framework <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages/\" target=\"_blank\">started by Google</a>that simplifies how businesses can build user-first websites, emails, ads and more. </p><p>AMP in email makes the inbox experience more useful and engaging, and even more so when we partner with companies like Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Let’s check out some examples.</p><p><b>Scheduling and Checkout from Gmail</b></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"scheduling from gmail.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/scheduling_from_gmail.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With AMP emails, when customers need to visit a store in person, companies can include the ability to schedule a 1:1 appointment—with real-time availability—enabling customers to conveniently plan a safe visit directly from Gmail.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"checkout from gmail.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/checkout_from_gmail.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>On the other hand, when shoppers want to shop online, you can enable customers to buy products with one click from your email, like with <a href=\"http://skipify.com/email\" target=\"_blank\">Skipify’s</a> 1-touch buy button. Yup, that's right, we’re talking about shopping without ever leaving the inbox.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"order status in gmail.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/order_status_in_gmail.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>And while a simpler online shopping experience is certainly relevant today, the excitement only grows as you think about future possibilities—scheduling grocery delivery, a shipping notification that always has a real-time status update or allowing customers to set a website alert for a product and then completing the transaction from the back-in-stock notification email—and doing all of this without ever leaving your inbox.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"shopping in gmail.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/shopping_in_gmail.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><a href=\"http://ecwid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecwid</a>, one of our early senders of AMP emails for eCommerce, has seen that using AMP leads to a direct impact on revenue, as their merchant’s sales are up 27% by using AMP components in their abandoned cart email. </p><p>Keeping up with customer behavior in the midst of the COVID pandemic can seem overwhelming, but with AMP the process doesn't need to be. AMP for Email lets retailers take advantage of an already established marketing channel to create a seamless, safe and new shopping experience. Thus only available dates, times, products and information are returned, enabling an interactive customer experience that simplifies how businesses communicate with their customers. </p><p>Today, AMP emails are supported on both mobile and desktop for Gmail. For email marketers and developers, AMP will be supported through Salesforce Marketing Cloud and a host of <a href=\"https://amp.dev/support/faq/email-support/\" target=\"_blank\">others</a>.
