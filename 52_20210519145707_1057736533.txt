Instead, embrace the power of the blur!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"slow-down-your-shutter-speed\">1. Slow down your shutter speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the <em>fundamental </em>motion blur tip:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"slow shutter speed (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">slow shutter speed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, the reason for motion blur is simply that your camera&#8217;s shutter remains open for a significant period of time. In other words: you get motion blur when your shutter speed is long, whereas you freeze the action when your shutter speed is short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the number one tip for capturing movement is to select a longer shutter speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208302\" style=\"width:998px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:998px; padding-top:150.3%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"998\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?resize=998%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"motion blur in front of buildings\" class=\"wp-image-208302\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?w=998&#38;ssl=1 998w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#38;ssl=1 399w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If your shutter speed is too fast (e.g., 1/4000s), you&#8217;re not going to capture much movement. But if you dial in a lengthy shutter speed (e.g., five seconds) you won&#8217;t need your subject to move much at all before you start to see blur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long should your shutter speed be? Here, the speed of your <em>subject </em>comes into play. A moving snail and a moving racecar will give you very different results at the same shutter speed. The slower your subject, the slower the shutter speed needs to be to create blur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other factor that comes into play when determining shutter speed is how much light exists in the scene. A longer shutter speed lets more light into your camera and runs the risk of blowing out or overexposing your image. Below, we&#8217;ll cover some ways to let less light in (so you can use long shutter speeds <em>without </em>overexposure concerns).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no <em>one-size-fits-all </em>shutter speed for motion blur. It&#8217;ll depend on the speed of your subject, the brightness of the scene, and how much motion blur you want to capture. The key is to experiment!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"stabilize-your-camera\">2. Stabilize your camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to get a feeling of motion in your images:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Have your subject move.</li><li>Have your camera move.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the type of photo we&#8217;re after today, it&#8217;ll be the <em>subject </em>that&#8217;s moving. In such cases, you need to do everything you can to keep your camera perfectly still. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll capture a blurry subject &#8211; but you&#8217;ll also end up with a blurry background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you stabilize your camera?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208311\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:58.13%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"872\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C872&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"boats in the water\" class=\"wp-image-208311\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=300%2C174&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=600%2C349&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=768%2C446&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=717%2C417&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A tripod is ideal, but you can also place your camera on some other steady object (e.g., a table or a bench). I&#8217;d recommend using a <a aria-label=\"remote shutter release or a self-timer mechanism (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">remote shutter release or a self-timer mechanism</a>; that way, you can trigger the shutter <em>without </em>touching your camera (because the more you touch your camera, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll introduce blur).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"try-shutter-priority-mode\">3. Try Shutter Priority mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know, the shutter speed is crucial to achieving a beautiful blurred look. Even small changes will have a big impact upon your shot &#8211; so you should use a camera mode that gives you full control over your camera&#8217;s shutter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have two options. First, you can switch your camera to full <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Manual mode (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Manual mode</a>. It&#8217;ll work well, and it&#8217;s a good idea for more experienced photographers &#8211; but in Manual mode, you&#8217;ll also need to select your <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"aperture (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">aperture</a> and <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"ISO (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ISO</a> (and you&#8217;ll need to make sure that the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO interact to create a perfect exposure). So if you don&#8217;t yet feel confident working in Manual mode, you have another option:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Shutter Priority mode</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Shutter Priority, <em>you </em>set the shutter speed (and the ISO, if you so choose), but your camera will set the aperture to ensure the shot is well exposed. It&#8217;s a very handy mode for motion blur photography because it ensures you get the movement effect you&#8217;re after while <em>also </em>capturing generally well-exposed images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208308\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"motorcyclist motion blur photography\" class=\"wp-image-208308\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"how-to-compensate-for-long-shutter-speeds-when-there-is-too-much-light\">How to compensate for long shutter speeds when there is too much light</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember what I said about a long shutter speed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer the speed, the more light that will get into your camera, and the brighter your photos will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So unless you compensate for this, whenever you try to capture motion blur, you&#8217;ll end up with overexposed shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, I&#8217;ll suggest three easy methods for preventing this overexposure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: A fourth method is to simply wait for the light to change &#8211; i.e., for it to get darker. Many shots that incorporate blur are taken at night or at dawn/dusk for this reason.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-a-small-aperture\">1. Use a small aperture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the first, and simplest, method of preventing overexposure:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narrow the aperture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the narrower the aperture, the less light that will hit the camera sensor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re shooting in Shutter Priority, your camera will actually narrow the aperture for you. As soon as it detects a slow shutter speed, it&#8217;ll close down the aperture and deliver a well-exposed shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re shooting in Manual mode or Aperture Priority, the aperture can generally be changed via a dial on your camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to bear in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjusting the aperture won&#8217;t <em>just </em>affect your photo&#8217;s exposure. Aperture also affects the <em><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">depth of field</a></em>, which refers to the amount of the scene that&#8217;s sharp. A wide aperture creates a limited depth of field, like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208303\" style=\"width:1200px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1200px; padding-top:125%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"watch with spinning hands capture motion blur photography\" class=\"wp-image-208303\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?resize=240%2C300&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#38;ssl=1 480w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?resize=768%2C960&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-6-1.jpg?resize=717%2C896&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas a narrow aperture ensures the entire scene is sharp throughout:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208304\" style=\"width:1001px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1001px; padding-top:149.85%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1001\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=1001%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"capture motion blur photography car driving\" class=\"wp-image-208304\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?w=1001&#38;ssl=1 1001w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1074&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So while it&#8217;s easy to combine a deep depth of field with a well-exposed motion blur image, working with a shallow depth of field while <em>also </em>ensuring well-exposed motion blur can be tough. If you&#8217;re after a shallow depth of field effect, you&#8217;ll need to counteract overexposure another way, as I explain in the next section:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"decrease-your-iso\">2. Decrease your ISO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve tried narrowing your aperture and still aren&#8217;t getting you the results you need, or if you&#8217;re after a shallow depth of field, here&#8217;s an alternative method for preventing overexposure:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drop your ISO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISO impacts the sensitivity of your digital camera&#8217;s sensor to light, where a higher number will induce <em>greater </em>sensitivity (and therefore a brighter exposure) and a lower number will induce <em>less </em>sensitivity (and therefore a darker exposure). </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208307\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:74.87%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1123\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1123&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"train moving fast with platform\" class=\"wp-image-208307\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C575&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C537&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can adjust your ISO in Manual mode or Shutter Priority mode, so simply dial in a low ISO (such as 100) and watch as your exposure decreases. Of course, there&#8217;s a limit to how low you can drop your ISO; once you get to ISO 100 or ISO 50, your camera won&#8217;t allow you to go any further. But it&#8217;s always worth checking whether a lower ISO is an option because it&#8217;s a simple way to prevent overexposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"try-a-neutral-density-filter\">3. Try a neutral density filter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you&#8217;re after a motion blur photo, but you just can&#8217;t get the exposure dark enough.

It&#8217;s a piece of glass that blocks light from passing through your lens &#8211; sort of like sunglasses &#8211; and lets you use a <em>long </em>shutter speed while preventing overexposure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re shooting a seascape in bright sunlight and you want to blur the water, you&#8217;ll end up with a blown-out, overexposed scene &#8211; even with a narrow aperture and low ISO. But pop a neutral density filter over your lens, and you can slow the shutter speed right down while keeping a perfect exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208305\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"long exposure seascape blur\" class=\"wp-image-208305\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>(By the way, a <em><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">polarizing filter</a> </em>can have a similar effect, though it&#8217;ll also impact the look of your images by cutting out reflections.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that neutral density filters come in many strengths.

The exception is the 20 fps continuous shooting rate, and I’ll admit that I’m skeptical; after all, it’s a feature matched only by Sony’s highest-level full-frame models and is wholly unnecessary for vloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can also expect Sony’s standard <a aria-label=\"autofocusing (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/focus-on-autofocus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">autofocusing</a> capabilities, including its vaunted Real-time Eye AF, plus outstanding subject tracking and generally speedy focusing, all of which will appeal to vloggers and still shooters alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be sure to keep an eye out for further Sony a6900 news, especially if you’re interested in a compact, vlogging-focused camera; we should get an official release before the month is out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think of the Sony a6900?

It&#8217;ll take <em>seconds </em>&#8211; and when you&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll be able to resize dozens (or hundreds!) of photos at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"batch-resizing-in-photoshop-step-by-step\">Batch resizing in Photoshop: step by step</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Batch resizing isn&#8217;t hard, and it takes very little knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, make sure you open <em>some</em> files in Photoshop (though note that you don&#8217;t need to open all the files you&#8217;re aiming to resize; a random file or an empty canvas will do just fine). As you can see below, I&#8217;ve opened a blank document:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208966\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:64.13%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"962\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=1500%2C962&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a blank canvas in Photoshop\" class=\"wp-image-208966\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=300%2C192&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=600%2C385&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=768%2C493&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=115%2C75&#38;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-batch-resize-in-Photoshop-14.jpg?resize=717%2C460&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to cover the <em>Image Processor </em>method of batch resizing. Pretty much anyone can do it, and it generally works well. However, if you have more complex batch resizing requirements, consider <a aria-label=\"writing an action (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-create-and-use-photoshop-actions-to-speed-up-your-workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">writing an action</a>; that way, you can tailor the resizing to your particular needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at the batch resizing process, starting with:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"step-open-the-image-processor\">Step 1: Open the Image Processor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose <strong>File&#62;Scripts&#62;Image Processor</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208967\" style=\"width:1108px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1108px;

To really understand a lens &#8211; and to determine whether it’s a worthy addition to your camera bag &#8211; you have to see how it holds up in practical, real-life, everyday situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why I recently sat down with Ken Hubbard, Tamron’s Field Services Manager and resident bird photography extraordinaire. Ken’s been using the new 150-500mm for quite some time now, so I knew that he could give me the low-down on its real-life capabilities.

And as many beginners quickly realize, even a 70-300mm zoom doesn’t cut it &#8211; especially when you’re shooting distant and unapproachable subjects such as birds of prey or tiny subjects such as songbirds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where the Tamron 150-500mm comes in handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoomed in to 500mm, you can get ultra-close to birds, even those that are skittish or small. You can capture birds in flight, and you can produce gorgeous, detailed shots of songbirds such as orioles and goldfinches. Ken shared a few of these beauties with me:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209333\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"goldfinch in a tree\" class=\"wp-image-209333\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209334\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"oriole landing on perch\" class=\"wp-image-209334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have a shorter 300-400mm range just in case you need it. If you’re shooting at your backyard feeders or at a location where birds have become acclimated to humans, you can just zoom out to capture the perfect frame.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you’re after more environmental images, you might even try working at 150-300mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick tip: When you’re photographing a perching bird, don’t frame it <em>too </em>tightly. It might spread its wings, which will get clipped by the frame’s edges (a big no-no in bird photography!). Leave a bit of space around the bird; that way, when you get a nice wing spread, you can capture the pose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"the-incredible-optics-provide-ultra-sharp-feather-detail\">2. The incredible optics provide ultra-sharp feather detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a simple fact about the Tamron 150-500mm:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s really, <em>really </em>sharp, even at its widest apertures.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the phenomenal sharpness was the first thing Ken noticed upon viewing his images.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For bird photographers, this is a big deal, because birds offer lots of tiny details worth capturing (feathers!), plus you’ll sometimes want to crop in for a frame-filling final result. And if the sharpness isn’t there, your photos just won’t pass muster.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the feather detail on this owl:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209335\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.8%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1002\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=1500%2C1002&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"owl perching\" class=\"wp-image-209335\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=600%2C401&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-16.jpg?resize=717%2C479&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem that bird photographers often face &#8211; especially when shooting darker birds against a bright sky &#8211; is chromatic aberration. It appears as colorful fringing along high-contrast edges such as bird wings, and it looks <em>terrible</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, chromatic aberration on the 150-500mm is negligible, certainly not enough to cause problems (even for a serious bird shooter like Ken).&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"thanks-to-the-lenss-lightweight-build-you-can-handhold-without-trouble\">3. Thanks to the lens’s lightweight build, you can handhold without trouble</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultra-telephoto lenses tend to be insanely heavy. Which means that handholding for long periods of time is often out of the question.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem, of course, is that handholding can be useful, especially if you like the freedom and flexibility of pointing your lens in every direction from every reachable perspective, or you just don’t want to carry a tripod on <em>top </em>of cameras and lenses and other accessories.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as it turns out, the Tamron 150-500mm is surprisingly lightweight (it comes in at 60.8 oz or 1725 g). Yes, it feels like a lens, and it’s not exactly a feather, but you should be able to handhold without issue.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographers will also appreciate the lens’s three Vibration Compensation modes, which keep your shots sharp when handholding at slower shutter speeds. In fact, two of the modes &#8211; Mode 2 and Mode 3 &#8211; seem tailored to birds and other action subjects, which means you can shoot sharp action images even in low light.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"a-small-minimum-focusing-distance-guarantees-close-ups-of-tiny-objects-such-as-songbirds\">4. A small minimum focusing distance guarantees close-ups of tiny objects (such as songbirds)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine this:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re standing in a clearing, surrounded by beautiful yellow warblers. As they hop from branch to branch, getting closer and closer, you wait with your camera &#8211; but then, just as one tiny subject fills the frame, your lens <em>fails to focus</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you miss the shot. And the next shot, and the one after that, because your lens just can’t focus close enough.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, every lens has a particular <em>minimum focusing distance </em>(or <em>MFD</em>). Once your subject crosses the MFD, a lens won’t be able to focus any closer, and your shots will turn out blurry.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This becomes especially important when photographing tiny subjects such as songbirds and shorebirds. If you want to fill the frame, you need a lens with a small minimum focusing distance (in other words, you need a lens that can focus <em>close</em>). You do have the option of purchasing extension tubes, but these can be annoying to carry around and use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tamron 150-500mm, however, is an unusually close-focusing lens. Its minimum focusing distance is 70.9 in (1.8 m) at 500mm, which means you can create intimate portraits of tiny goldfinches, or you can capture tight headshots of larger birds such as owls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s how Ken manages to capture images like this:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209336\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"owl close-up\" class=\"wp-image-209336\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209337\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"barred owl face close-up\" class=\"wp-image-209337\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-15.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>(As an aside, you can also create some great photos of insects and flowers. While the Tamron 150-500mm isn’t a true macro lens, it can still get you pretty darn close!)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"an-arca-swiss-compatible-mount-makes-for-easy-tripod-use\">5. An Arca-Swiss compatible mount makes for easy tripod use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, I explained how the 150-500mm lets you handhold in low light.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes you’ll want to consider working with a tripod. Tripods are great for smooth panning, and they’re also nice for situations where you’re photographing in the same position for hours on end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, working with telephoto lenses on a tripod can be a pain. You don’t want to mount the lens to the camera and the camera to the tripod; that can put stress on the lens and camera mount, which is <em>definitely </em>a bad thing. So instead you need to put a tripod collar on the lens, which then attaches to an Arca-Swiss plate, which mounts to the tripod head and balances the whole setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the above does apply to the Tamron 150-500mm. It comes with a tripod collar, which slips around the lens. But very conveniently, the collar <em>includes </em>an Arca-Swiss compatible foot.

Ken often shoots in the f/6.7-f/8 range for this reason; it’s how he gets optimal detail in his bird photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tamron 150-500mm offers a maximum aperture of f/5 on the wide end, which increases to f/6.7 by 500mm. And as you can see from the photos above, this works out great!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would it be nice to have an f/4 aperture for low-light shooting? Sure &#8211; but as Ken explains, a wide maximum aperture comes with tradeoffs, such as size (f/4 ultra-telephoto lenses tend to be <em>huge</em>), weight, and price. So if you’re after a more compact lens that still reaches those ultra-telephoto distances, the Tamron 150-500mm is a stellar option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"you-can-use-the-flexible-zoom-lock-to-keep-a-constant-focal-length\">7. You can use the flexible Zoom Lock to keep a constant focal length</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll admit:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zoom Lock wasn’t a feature I had thought about until Ken mentioned it. I knew what it did &#8211; it lets you lock the lens focal length in place &#8211; but not why it was useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, once Ken explained it to me, I realized that it was a neat little addition, especially for shooting birds high up in trees.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, heavy zooms tend to suffer from something called <em>lens creep</em>, where the lens barrel starts to contract as you aim the lens upward (and extend as you aim the lens downward). In other words: when you shoot eagles against the sky at 500mm, you may notice your focal length dropping over time. It can be frustrating, especially if you’re photographing subjects from a consistent distance.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zoom Lock, however, prevents lens creep. Once you’ve settled on a focal length, you simply push the zoom ring forward, and it locks the zoom mechanism in place. Then, once you’re ready to adjust the focal length again, you pull the zoom ring back to disable the Zoom Lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you won’t always use this feature, it’s nice to have &#8211; and in certain situations, it’ll be a huge help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"you-can-focus-on-fast-moving-birds-with-the-vxd-mechanism\">8. You can focus on fast-moving birds with the VXD mechanism</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’re likely aware, birds are <em>speedy</em>. Which means that photographing moving birds can be a challenge, especially if your equipment isn’t up to snuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So going into the discussion with Ken, I wanted to know, point blank: Does the Tamron 150-500mm focus fast?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken confirmed that yes, it does focus fast. In fact, thanks to Tamron’s VXD technology, focusing is both ultra-fast and super accurate. The lens stops on a dime, and it can lock onto moving subjects with ease. (It’s also very quiet, in case you&#8217;re shooting in situations where you don’t want to be noticed.)&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s great for birds in flight:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209340\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"hawk flying toward the camera\" class=\"wp-image-209340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as birds taking off:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209341\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"bald eagle taking off from branch\" class=\"wp-image-209341\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it is worth noting that focusing depends on three things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Your technique</li><li>Your lens</li><li>Your camera</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The 150-500mm won’t guarantee you perfect focus, the same way a world-class guitar won’t guarantee you beautiful music. But if you refine your technique, and you use a reasonably fast-focusing camera (most of Sony’s recent full-frame or APS-C cameras will work <em>great</em>), then the 150-500mm will give you that final variable in the focusing equation.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of focusing technique, I asked Ken to share how he gets photos like those featured above.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains that focusing begins with your camera settings. Put your camera into AF-C mode so that it continues to focus as long as you hold the shutter button. If you have it, activate Animal Eye AF. You’ll also want to choose an AF area mode that works for moving subjects, such as Sony’s Zone AF, and you should select the fastest-available burst mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, if your subject is perched on a branch, pre-focus. Get your AF zone over the bird, and be locked and ready to go. As discussed above, make sure your framing isn’t too tight &#8211; remember, you don’t want to clip the wings! &#8211; then as soon as the wings extend, fire off a long burst of shots. Track the bird with your camera, continuing to shoot as it flies by.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capturing a bird <em>already </em>in flight is harder, but still doable. Use all the same settings as above:&#160;AF-C, burst mode, and an optimized AF area mode. Put your eye to the viewfinder, but &#8211; here’s the trick! &#8211; keep <em>both eyes open</em>. One eye should be looking through the viewfinder, while the other eye searches the wider sky.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then move your lens to follow the bird, and half-press your shutter button to lock on. Keep your framing loose, and try to center the bird (you can always crop later!) &#8211; then fire off burst after burst.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209342\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"falcon flying in the forest\" class=\"wp-image-209342\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tamron-150-500mm-bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: If you <em>really </em>want to maximize your accuracy, try using back-button focus. It decouples focusing from the shutter button, so you can maintain focus even when your finger comes off the shutter.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken shares that you’ll end up with a <em>huge </em>number of shots, and only a few of them will actually look good, with a well-lit head, a nice wing position, and a nice background.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s okay, he says. Because you can easily go through your photos later on the computer; the good ones will stick out, you can flag them, and get rid of the rest.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(One more tip: Buy the fastest memory cards available. Without fast cards, your camera won’t be able to shoot long bursts, which can lead to missed photos in critical situations.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"the-strong-build-quality-is-perfect-for-outdoor-photography\">9. The strong build quality is perfect for outdoor photography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bird photography (and outdoor photography in general) can get pretty rough.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re often traveling in dusty conditions, lying in mud, and/or dealing with high humidity. And the best shots tend to come from the <em>worst </em>weather: when you’re standing in the cold, getting soaked by rain or snow.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need a camera setup that can handle the elements.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I (and Ken) can’t speak to your camera. But the Tamron 150-500mm offers <em>very </em>solid build quality &#8211; it’s likely the first thing you’ll notice when you pull it out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, thanks to its moisture-resistant construction, you can shoot in messy weather without worry (though I still recommend you use a waterproof cover!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"tamron-mm-takeaways-final-words\">Tamron 150-500mm takeaways: final words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there you have it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nine key takeaways after shooting with the Tamron 150-500mm Di III VC VXD.

Don&#8217;t be. To help understand this a bit better, remember that the focal plane is your sensor&#8217;s point of focus, where all the light from your lens should join together to be correctly captured and recorded. But depending on the construction of your lens, your chosen focal length, and even the aperture that you&#8217;ve used, certain wavelengths (colors) may arrive at points <em>in front of </em>or <em>behind</em> the focal plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the diagram below. Do you see how the red, green, and blue light hits the sensor in different spots? That&#8217;s chromatic aberration at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"What is chromatic aberration and why it happens. \" title=\"ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When CA occurs, you end up with telltale color fringing around the edges of your photograph. Check out the photo below. The left-hand side shows red and green fringes along the sharp edges of the subject. As you can see, it doesn&#8217;t look so great. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Chromatic Aberration example\" title=\"OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But although you can edit out low levels of chromatic aberration in <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-fix-chromic-aberration-in-photoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Photoshop</a> and <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/fix-chromatic-aberration-lightroom-5/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Lightroom</a>, the reality is that it&#8217;s annoying to remove CA from each and every photo, plus every moment you spent touching up a photo is one moment less that you have for photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Cheetah Chromatic Aberration Comparison\" title=\"OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"why-does-chromatic-aberration-occur\">Why does chromatic aberration occur?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromatic aberration happens because your lens acts as a prism. It bends light, and much like the triangle-shaped prism made famous by Pink Floyd, colors passing through the lens are split at different angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Why does chromatic aberration occur\" title=\"ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, it&#8217;s important to remember that light is actually made up of several different wavelengths (colors). So for your camera&#8217;s sensor to detect the combined color of light, your lens needs to make all wavelengths of that particular ray hit the exact same point on your sensor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may sound simple, but various wavelengths (and thus various colors) strike your lens all at once, and <em>each </em>of these wavelengths will behave slightly differently depending on the lens glass that it is passing through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feat of engineering required to correctly align all of these different light rays is usually achieved by the manufacturer&#8217;s use of a lens array. In fact, if you were to pull your lens apart, you&#8217;d probably find upward of 16 lens elements &#8211; all designed to correct for various things along the light&#8217;s journey between your lens and your sensor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Lens elements\" title=\"OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is also where chromatic aberration tends to rear its ugly head. Hidden within the design of these lens elements are defects &#8211; either in the glass or the design of the lens itself &#8211; which, under specific conditions, may cause your photos to exhibit CA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying you need a pro-level lens. In fact, a key point is that <em>all </em>lenses suffer from chromatic aberration in one form or another, no matter the cost. What matters is whether or not your lens exhibits <em>visible </em>chromatic aberration, and whether the amount of visible CA is a dealbreaker for your particular needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, even if you&#8217;re stuck with a CA-prone lens, you can still take steps to prevent image-quality issues, as I discuss in the next section.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"how-to-avoid-chromatic-aberration-defects-strategies\">How to avoid chromatic aberration defects: 4 strategies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromatic aberration is a major problem, especially on cheap lenses. But the good news is that, if you <em>are </em>stuck working with a lens that exhibits some form of visible chromatic aberration, there are several easy-to-understand strategies to remove or minimize its effect on your photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"avoid-high-contrast-scenes\">1. Avoid high-contrast scenes</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"CA Cheetah High Contrast\" title=\"OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromatic aberration tends to flare up when shooting high-contrast scenes. Particularly problematic are darker subjects surrounded by white backdrops, landscapes against a bright sunrise, or &#8211; as in the example of the cheetah above &#8211; heavily backlit subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no easy in-camera method of avoiding contrast. So there&#8217;s often nothing you can do here except adjust your <a aria-label=\"composition (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">composition</a>. Swap your backdrop out to something that more closely matches your subject&#8217;s tones, or simply wait for more favorable lighting conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you absolutely must capture an image as-is, then shoot in <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"RAW (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">RAW</a> and prepare for a touch-up in post-production.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"adjust-your-focal-length\">2. Adjust your focal length</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Chromatic Aberration Focal Length\" title=\"OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it&#8217;s nice to have access to a wide range of focal lengths, the fact is that most <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/primes-versus-zoom-lenses/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"zoom lenses (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">zoom lenses</a> exhibit chromatic aberration at their focal length extremes. So setting the focal length toward the middle of your lens&#8217;s range will usually help remove the offending CA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that using a zoom lens at its widest will usually introduce various other defects in your image. So if you&#8217;re set on a wide-angle perspective, choose a <a aria-label=\"prime (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/prime-lenses-an-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">prime</a> wide-angle lens to handle the job, or make a panorama at a longer focal length, then join the photos in post-processing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"stop-down-your-aperture\">3. Stop down your aperture</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"CA Aperture\" title=\"OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the result will depend on the type of lens you are using, stopping down your aperture helps minimize most lens defects, including chromatic aberration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(You&#8217;ll need to consider reducing the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"shutter speed (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shutter speed</a> or boosting the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"ISO (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ISO</a> to compensate for the light loss.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of using an f/2.8 or f/4 aperture, try going to f/8 or f/11 &#8211; then take a few test shots to see if the chromatic aberration has disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"reframe-with-your-subject-at-the-center-of-the-image\">4. Reframe with your subject at the center of the image</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"chromatic aberration rhino reframe\" title=\"OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromatic aberration is often more noticeable toward the edges of the frame, <em>not </em>the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is generally due to the curvature of the lens elements.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, if you reframe your shot but put your main subject closer to the <em>middle</em>, you&#8217;ll often end up with little-to-no chromatic aberration on your subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you may still have noticeable CA around the edges of the frame, but you do have the option to crop this away. It&#8217;s not ideal if you need to retain every pixel in your photo (e.g., for large prints), in which case you should consider one of the other preventative measures discussed above. But if you&#8217;re creating small prints or you plan to distribute your photo online, cropping shouldn&#8217;t be a big issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"chromatic-aberration-final-words\">Chromatic aberration: final words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything you need to know about chromatic aberration, including what it is and how to avoid it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know how to keep your images free of CA. And you can capture stunning photos &#8211; even with cheaper lenses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over to you:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you struggling with chromatic aberration in your photos?

Specifically, I&#8217;ll discuss:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to pose a group like a pro</li><li>A simple trick to capture <em>everyone </em>in the group looking their best</li><li>How to pick the perfect group photo location</li><li>Much, much more!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re ready to become a group photography expert, then let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"prepare-ahead-of-time\">1. Prepare ahead of time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is <em>nothing </em>that will make group photo subjects turn on you faster than you not being prepared. People don&#8217;t like to be kept waiting, so plan ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I recommend you do several hours (or days) before the photo:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Scope out the location of your shot beforehand</li><li>Think about how you will <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/posing-guide-21-sample-poses-to-get-you-started-with-photographing-groups-of-people/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">pose people</a> and frame your shot</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, a few minutes before the photo:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Make sure everyone you want in the shot <em>knows </em>that you want them in the shot</li><li>Make sure your camera is on and has charged batteries</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205429\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to take group photos three women\" class=\"wp-image-205429\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-4-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"carefully-choose-the-location\">2. Carefully choose the location</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The group photo <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-choose-a-great-portrait-photography-location/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"location (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">location</a> is important for a number of reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it can give the photo context. For example, a shot of a sports team on their playing field says more than a shot of the team in front of a brick wall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the location can help emphasize your group &#8211; or it can draw the eye. To make the group stand out, you&#8217;ll need a location with no distractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So choose a place where your group will fit, where there is enough light for the shot, and where there are no distracting surroundings. Also, avoid setting up a group shot directly in front of a window where the light from your flash might reflect back in an unpleasant way. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205426\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"group posing on a mountain\" class=\"wp-image-205426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"take-multiple-shots\">3. Take multiple shots</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s tough to get <em>everyone</em> looking just right at the exact same time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I highly recommend you take multiple photos quickly; I often switch my camera to <a aria-label=\"continuous shooting mode (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">continuous shooting mode</a> and photograph in short bursts. The first shot is often no good &#8211; but the shot or two directly after gives a group that looks less posed and more relaxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a related note, shoot some frames before everyone is ready. Sometimes, the organization of a group shot can be quite comical and image-worthy (as people tell each other where to go and jostle for position).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205428\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"kids in a group waving\" class=\"wp-image-205428\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, mix up the framing of your shots a little. If you have a zoom lens, try capturing some shots at a wide focal length and some shots that are more tightly framed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"get-in-close\">4. Get in close</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to get as close as you can to the group you&#8217;re photographing (without cutting out group members, of course!). The closer you can get, the more detail you&#8217;ll capture in their faces &#8211; something that can really elevate a shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your group is small, step in and take some <a aria-label=\"head and shoulder shots (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-photographing-great-headshots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">head and shoulder shots</a>. Another effective technique is to get everyone to lean in; that way, you can move even closer without cutting out subjects. You might also try moving everyone out of a one-line formation and placing some people in front and behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"pose-the-group\">5. Pose the group</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-91223\" style=\"width:1280px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1280px; padding-top:75%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/133823195_13dd92f2d6_o.jpg?resize=1280%2C960&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to take group photos people in uniforms looking up\" class=\"wp-image-91223\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/133823195_13dd92f2d6_o.jpg?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/133823195_13dd92f2d6_o.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/133823195_13dd92f2d6_o.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/133823195_13dd92f2d6_o.jpg?resize=717%2C538&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, your group will pose itself pretty naturally (after all, we&#8217;ve all been in a group shot at some point). Tall people will go to the back, short people to the front. But there are other things you can do to improve the photo&#8217;s composition: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If the event is centered around one or two people (like a wedding or a birthday), make the hosts the focal point by putting them right in the middle of the group (you can add variation by taking some shots of everyone looking at the camera and other shots of everyone looking at the person/couple).</li><li>For formal group photos, put taller members toward the back <em>center </em>of the shot, with shorter people along the edges.</li><li>Try not to make the group too deep (i.e., keep the distance between the front line of people and the back line of people as small as you can). This will help keep everyone in focus. If the composition does end up being deep, use a narrow aperture.</li><li>Tell everyone to raise their chins a little; they&#8217;ll thank you later when they see the shot without any double chins!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"time-your-group-shot-well\">6. Time your group shot well</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carefully pick the moment for your photo. Try to choose a time that works with what is happening at the gathering. I find it best to do a group shot when people are already close together and when there is a lull in the proceedings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The start of an event can be a good time to shoot; everyone is together, they all look their best, and if there is alcohol involved, it hasn&#8217;t significantly affected the group yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205432\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:72.2%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1083\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1083&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"girls on a hill\" class=\"wp-image-205432\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C217&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?resize=600%2C433&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C554&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-2-1.jpg?resize=717%2C518&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"think-about-the-light\">7.

The way you should do this varies from situation to situation &#8211; but consider using a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/starting-with-off-camera-flash-techniques/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"flash (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">flash</a> if the group is small enough and you are close enough for it to take effect, especially if the main source of light is coming from behind the group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s a bright, sunny day and the sun is low in the sky, try not to face your subjects toward the light &#8211; otherwise, you&#8217;ll end up with a collection of squinting faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205433\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"group in the ocean\" class=\"wp-image-205433\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?resize=600%2C338&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-6.jpg?resize=717%2C403&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"take-control\">8. Take control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been in a number of group photos where the photographer almost lost control of their subjects. It happened for two reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>They weren&#8217;t quick enough.</li><li>They didn&#8217;t communicate well with the group.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When shooting a group photo, it&#8217;s important to keep talking, let the group know what you want them to do, motivate them to smile, tell them that they look great, and make clear how long you&#8217;ll need them for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to give your subjects a reason to pose for the photograph (and to listen to you). At a wedding, you might motivate people by saying &#8220;The happy couple has asked me to get some group shots.&#8221; At a sporting event, you could say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a group photo to celebrate our win.&#8221; When you give people a reason to pose, you&#8217;ll find they are much more willing to stand for a few minutes while you snap photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another very useful line to use with a group: &#8220;If you can see the camera, then it can see you.&#8221; This one is key if you want to be able to see each person&#8217;s face in the final image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are other photographers, just wait until they&#8217;ve all finished their shots, then get the attention of the full group. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll get everyone looking in different directions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t want to be a dictator when posing your group &#8211; otherwise, your group shots will include some very angry expressions. The best photographers know how to get people&#8217;s attention and communicate what they want, while also keeping people relaxed and having fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205431\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"how to take group photos girls in a line\" class=\"wp-image-205431\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-8.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"get-up-high-when-photographing-large-groups\">9. Get up high when photographing large groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Large groups of people can be very difficult to photograph. Even with careful staggering and tiering, you&#8217;ll struggle to fit everyone into the shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One solution is to <em>elevate </em>yourself. If I&#8217;m photographing a wedding and the couple wants one big group shot, I&#8217;ll arrange for a ladder to be present, or I&#8217;ll find some other way to get up high (I&#8217;ve even climbed up onto church roofs!). A high vantage point lets you fit a lot of people into the frame while still remaining quite close to the group. It also gives an interesting perspective, especially if you&#8217;re using a nice, wide focal length. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"use-a-tripod\">10. Use a tripod </h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205435\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.93%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1004\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1004&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"kids posing for a group photo\" class=\"wp-image-205435\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=600%2C402&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=768%2C514&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=436%2C293&#38;ssl=1 436w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-5.jpg?resize=717%2C480&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why tripods are great for group photography. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a tripod communicates your seriousness and can help get the group&#8217;s attention (it&#8217;s amazing what a professional-looking setup can do!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, a tripod gives you more freedom to pose your subjects. Simply set your camera on a tripod, set the exposure, and set the focus. Then guide your subjects through different poses &#8211; and when everything looks just right, you can quickly press the shutter button!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"use-an-assistant\">11. Use an assistant</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a very large group, an assistant can be super helpful. For one, they can get the group organized &#8211; tell people when to come, where to stand, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An assistant is also incredibly handy if you are taking multiple group shots (like at a wedding when you&#8217;re photographing different configurations of a family). In such a case, I often ask the couple to provide me with a family member or a friend who can ensure we have everyone we need in each shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a family member act as your assistant ensures you don&#8217;t miss anyone (assuming they&#8217;re related to members of the group). Plus, the group will be familiar with them and will therefore respond well when the &#8220;assistant&#8221; orders them around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"smile\">12. Smile</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, <em>you </em>should smile! During a group session, there&#8217;s nothing worse than a grumpy, stressed-out photographer. Have fun and enjoy the process of getting your shots, and you&#8217;ll find the group will, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, after photographing a wedding, I usually come home with an incredibly sore face from all the smiling I&#8217;ve done! I find the best way to get the couple and their family to relax and smile is to smile at them. It really does work. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-205434\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"business group photo\" class=\"wp-image-205434\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"bonus-tip-let-your-imagination-run-wild\">Bonus tip: Let your imagination run wild!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One more quick tip.

Include a mix of subjects at different scales; for instance, pick some wide shots that show the entire scene, as well as some detail photos that show lots of texture and personality. Without one or the other, the story won&#8217;t be complete. And it won&#8217;t carry the level of emotion that you&#8217;re after. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of <a aria-label=\"storytelling (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/8-tips-storytelling-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">storytelling</a>: It often does help to focus on the story you&#8217;re trying to tell. Do you want to offer a narrative surrounding an event? Do you want to clearly convey a meaningful concept? Make sure to take this into account when picking photos!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One more tip: If possible, include at least three photos and no more than eight. Too few photos, and you won&#8217;t be able to tell the full story. Too many photos, and you&#8217;ll confuse the viewer with clutter (plus, it&#8217;ll be tough to show off individual details).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"step-open-the-selected-images-in-photoshop\">Step 2: Open the selected images in Photoshop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve picked your photos, open them all in Photoshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you can drag and drop files directly onto the document window, or you can select <strong>File>Open</strong> and click on the relevant images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209030\" style=\"width:570px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:570px;

If you&#8217;re working with big JPEGs and you aim to print, you should probably pick a 5000+ pixel width and height. If you want to display your collage on a standard web page, however, a 1500 pixel width and height will do just fine (though you can always start big and resize later, as discussed in <strong>Step 8 </strong>below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I do recommend you make the file size a bit larger than the size you want in the end; that way, you can do a final crop to deal with any arrangement issues.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"step-add-your-images-one-at-a-time\">Step 3: Add your images one at a time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to your first open photo, then select it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you can drag with the <a aria-label=\"Marquee tool (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/five-secrets-of-the-marquee-tools-in-photoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Marquee tool</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209034\" style=\"width:291px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:291px; padding-top:168.73%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"291\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?resize=291%2C491&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"marquee tool how to make a Photoshop collage\" class=\"wp-image-209034\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?w=291&#38;ssl=1 291w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?resize=178%2C300&#38;ssl=1 178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can hit <em>Ctrl/Cmd+A</em>.

It&#8217;s simply not possible to see the aurora whenever and wherever you want &#8211; you must be in the right region and follow a few simple steps, as I discuss below:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"be-in-the-northern-hemisphere\">1. Be in the Northern Hemisphere</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The northern lights aren’t visible all over the world. As the name indicates, they are a phenomenon visible in the Northern Hemisphere.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places such as northern Norway, Iceland, and Alaska are typical areas you can witness the northern lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you generally want to be north of the Arctic Circle (or close to it), you can witness the lights further south during extreme solar storms. But this is not as common and the display is rarely as impressive compared to &#8220;northern&#8221; northern lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When planning your trip to the north, you&#8217;ll need to bear one more fact in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The northern lights season lasts from late fall to early spring. After all, northern lights are only visible in the <em>night </em>sky, and in the Arctic, the sun doesn&#8217;t set during the summer months &#8211; so there&#8217;s no darkness and no northern lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208643\" style=\"width:979px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:979px; padding-top:153.22%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"979\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?resize=979%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the northern lights over the ocean\" class=\"wp-image-208643\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?w=979&#38;ssl=1 979w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?resize=196%2C300&#38;ssl=1 196w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?resize=392%2C600&#38;ssl=1 392w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1177&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1099&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"get-away-from-light-pollution\">2. Get away from light pollution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s nearly impossible to see the northern lights from the downtown of a large city. You <em>might </em>catch a glimpse if the northern lights are strong, but the display won&#8217;t be nearly as impressive as if you leave the city lights behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase your chances of capturing the northern lights, you should get away from <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/six-killers-night-sky-photography-how-avoid-them/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"light pollution (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">light pollution</a> and find a location where you can clearly see the stars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few different tools you can use to find areas with minimal light pollution.&#160;<a aria-label=\"Dark Sky (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://darksky.org/idsp/finder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Dark Sky</a>&#160;is a great website&#160;for this purpose; it shows a detailed map of light pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208644\" style=\"width:1002px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1002px; padding-top:149.7%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the northern lights over ice\" class=\"wp-image-208644\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?w=1002&#38;ssl=1 1002w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#38;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-3.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"look-for-clear-skies-and-a-high-kp-index\">3. Look for clear skies (and a high Kp-index)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to see the northern lights, you need to see the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-tips-for-night-sky-and-star-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"stars (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">stars</a> &#8211; so cloudy nights aren&#8217;t good for aurora borealis photography. If the sky is cloudy, you might as well enjoy the comfort of a warm cabin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, when you’re north of the Arctic Circle, clear nights typically mean you <em>will </em>get a glimpse of the northern lights. The display might not always be strong, but chances are high that you&#8217;ll at least get a nice arch across the horizon.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that weather conditions change quickly in the Northern Hemisphere. Just because it’s cloudy one moment doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;ll be cloudy in an hour, so you should keep a close eye on the forecast and stick your head outside from time to time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, a quick tip: To predict the aurora display strength, refer to the Kp-index. Note that the higher the Kp-index, the stronger the display. (There are other factors involved in predicting the northern lights, but the Kp-index is the easiest and most convenient.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208645\" style=\"width:1002px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1002px; padding-top:149.7%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the northern lights over a mountain\" class=\"wp-image-208645\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?w=1002&#38;ssl=1 1002w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#38;ssl=1 401w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-4.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights\">How to photograph the northern lights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the northern lights, how do you actually photograph them? It&#8217;s easy to get overly excited and forget about the technicalities &#8211; after all, the northern lights are stunningly beautiful &#8211; but I urge you to study the next few steps so that you’re as prepared as possible when the sky explodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-a-tripod-and-a-remote-shutter-release\">1. Use a tripod and a remote shutter release</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographing at night means that you’re working with <a aria-label=\"long exposures (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">long exposures</a> (i.e., slow <a aria-label=\"shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shutter speeds</a>). It’s therefore essential that you mount the camera on a <a aria-label=\"tripod (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/tripod-for-landscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">tripod</a>. This will make sure that your camera stays still for the duration of the exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also consider using a <a aria-label=\"remote shutter release (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">remote shutter release</a> when you’re photographing the northern lights. This removes any chance of the vibrations caused when you press the shutter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative is to use the camera’s self-timer &#8211; but sometimes you want to capture the image at an exact moment with no delay, which is why I highly recommend a remote release.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208646\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.87%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1003\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1003&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the moon and the aurora borealis\" class=\"wp-image-208646\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=600%2C401&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=768%2C514&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=436%2C293&#38;ssl=1 436w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-5.jpg?resize=717%2C479&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-a-wide-angle-lens-with-a-large-aperture\">2. Use a wide-angle lens with a large&#160;aperture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I generally encourage photographers to experiment with different focal lengths, but there’s no getting around it: an <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/wide-angle-lenses-landscape/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"ultra-wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ultra-wide-angle lens</a> is ideal for photographing the northern lights.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A wide-angle lens allows you to capture <em>both </em>the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"landscape (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">landscape</a> and the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-shoot-the-night-sky-introduction-to-astrophotography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"sky (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">sky</a> in one shot. That way, you can incorporate the northern lights into a good composition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, when you first experience the northern lights, you&#8217;ll realize that they can fill up the entire sky. It&#8217;s impossible to capture all this beauty with a narrow focal length lens (in fact, even wide-angle glass isn’t always enough!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also important to <em>use the widest possible <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"aperture (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">aperture</a></em>. A wide aperture means more light reaches the sensor, allowing for a brighter exposure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that reason, apertures such as f/2 and f/2.8 work well for night photos. You can get away with f/4 if your lens doesn&#8217;t open to f/2.8 &#8211; but you&#8217;ll need to increase the <a aria-label=\"ISO (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">ISO</a> or extend the shutter speed to pull it off, neither of which are great for northern lights photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208647\" style=\"width:1002px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1002px; padding-top:149.7%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"aurora borealis over a river\" class=\"wp-image-208647\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?w=1002&#38;ssl=1 1002w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#38;ssl=1 401w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"adjust-the-shutter-speed-and-iso-according-to-the-northern-lights\">3. Adjust the shutter speed and ISO according to the northern lights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guides such as the 500 rule or the NPF rule are great indicators of the shutter speed you should use for night photography &#8211; but these do not work for northern lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the best shutter speed completely depends on how active the northern lights are. I’ve experienced extreme displays where I’m using a 1/2s shutter speed and an ISO of 200, yet I&#8217;m still overexposing the sky!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you need to adapt the shutter speed to the situation and make changes throughout the night. I typically use a shutter speed between 4 and 20 seconds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, a fast-moving northern lights display requires a faster shutter speed. The bright light moving across the sky will quickly get overexposed. But when the display is slower, you get away with a longer shutter speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ISO also depends on how bright the night sky is. I typically use a value between ISO 1600 and ISO 6400. That said, on rare occasions, I go all the way down to ISO 200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll admit that it does require some experience to get your settings right from the very beginning. But keep an eye on the image preview between every few shots, and you&#8217;ll learn exactly what to adjust for great results.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208648\" style=\"width:1071px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1071px; padding-top:140.06%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1071\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?resize=1071%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the aurora borealis over a mountain how to photograph the northern lights\" class=\"wp-image-208648\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?w=1071&#38;ssl=1 1071w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?resize=214%2C300&#38;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?resize=428%2C600&#38;ssl=1 428w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-6.jpg?resize=717%2C1004&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-a-cold-white-balance-k\">4. Use a&#160;cold white balance (3000-4000K)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that the <a aria-label=\"white balance (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">white balance</a> <em>technically </em>doesn’t matter if you’re shooting in RAW, but I’m someone who prefers to make the photo look as good as possible in-camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when photographing the northern lights, avoid using <a aria-label=\"Auto White Balance (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/auto-white-balance-yay-nay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Auto White Balance</a> or preset modes. While these often do a great job during the day, they’re less consistent at night. You <em>might </em>get some okay results with Auto White Balance, but it won&#8217;t always work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend that you set the white balance manually &#8211; use Kelvin mode and chose a value somewhere between 3000K and 4000K. This will produce a colder and more natural-looking sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Using values above 4000K makes the green in the northern lights look muddy and strange, which is something you want to avoid.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-208649\" style=\"width:1500px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:1500px; padding-top:66.8%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1002\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1002&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"purple and green aurora borealis how to photograph the northern lights\" class=\"wp-image-208649\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=600%2C401&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Christian-Hoiberg-Northern-Lights-8.jpg?resize=717%2C479&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"bring-something-warm-to-drink\">5.
