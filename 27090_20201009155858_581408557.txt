These rules are system generated and cannot be edited or removed. Most of them are necessary to track when a work item is activated, resolved, or closed. For a few of the rules, the value is less obvious, and in some cases are a cause of customer dissatisfaction with the product. Even though they made sense years ago, these rules have outlived their usefulness and it is time for them to be removed.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we wanted to share the impact of the first rule being removed. We also have a work around for those customers who still want to use the rule in their projects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"assigned-to-rule\">Assigned To rule</h4>\n<p>Although there are several hidden system rules across the different processes (Agile, Scrum, CMMI), the one rule that gets the most negative feedback is on the Bug work item type in the Agile process.</p>\n<p>This rule states..</p>\n<p><em><strong>When</strong> the bug moves to Resolved <strong>then</strong> automatically set the Assigned To value to the person who created the work item</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-wit-rule.gif\" alt=\"Image bug wit rule\" width=\"1920\" height=\"978\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59867\" /></p>\n<p>On the surface it makes sense to assign the bug back to the person who created it. They need to validate the bug is fixed. But in reality, teams don&#8217;t always work this way. Because bugs are a heavily used work item type, it makes sense to remove this hidden rule and keep things simple.</p>\n<p>This is the first rule to be removed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"customer-impact\">Customer impact</h4>\n<p>The rule will be removed from the Bug work item type in the Agile template starting in the Sprint 177 deployment (starting the week of October 19th, 2020). All projects using the system Agile process or an Inherited Agile process will be affected. Once the deployment reaches your organization, the rule will be removed from all bugs on all projects.</p>\n<p>If you are using Hosted XML, no changes will be made to your process templates and the behavior on the bug work item type will not be affected.</p>\n<h4 id=\"using-a-custom-rule\">Using a custom rule</h4>\n<p>For customers who like having bugs automatically assigned to the person who created them, you can create a custom rule. To do so, make sure you have <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/manage-process?view=azure-devops#create-an-inherited-process\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">created a custom inherited agile process</a>. Then go into the Bug work item type and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/apply-rules-to-workflow-states?view=azure-devops\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create a new rule</a>. Below is a screen shot of the specific rule you can use to set the Assigned To value to Created By when the state is changed to Resolved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule.png\" alt=\"Image bug state rule\" width=\"2503\" height=\"1223\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59866\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-color: #d3d3d3; border-width: 1px\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule.png 2503w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule-300x147.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule-1024x500.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule-768x375.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule-1536x751.png 1536w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule-2048x1001.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2503px) 100vw, 2503px\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"other-rules\">Other rules</h4>\n<p>This is the first rule we are going to remove. It is by far the most problematic for customers. We would love to hear your feedback on what other rules are causing you pain and why. Based on that feedback we are open to removing them in future sprints.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/removing-assigned-to-rule-from-bug/\">Removing Assigned To Rule from Bug</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops\">Azure DevOps Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:30:03 +0000","feedId":27090,"bgimg":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-wit-rule.gif","linkMd5":"4affdd28ae988cb1eb784e431505a6b4","author":"Dan Hellem","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-wit-rule.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/09/15-58-14-137_917d3595f671e1db.webp","https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn33@2020_5/2020/10/09/15-56-57-478_5aebaa4954922d7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602258895151}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:54:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 23:54:55","feedId":27090,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 15:54:55 +0000","fetchMs":384,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":243878,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ea53ec1fdc33d9a3e3a06ccd58c0f4c6","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"7e569014a0f14fb9ac1d2c56d88f4dc0_27090","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":370074,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:40:22","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:41:06","id":27090,"name":"Azure DevOps Blog","url":"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/feed/","subscriber":121,"website":null,"icon":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/10/Microsoft-Favicon.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn100@2020_6/2020/09/06/20-41-05-547_f0f5f16535f160af.png","description":"DevOps, Git, and Agile updates from the team building Azure DevOps","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:58:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 23:58:58","id":null,"feedId":27090,"linkMd5":"4affdd28ae988cb1eb784e431505a6b4"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":370074,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602258894758,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":385,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":78526,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":121767,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-state-rule.png","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":2503,"destHeight":1223,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn33@2020_5/2020/10/09/15-56-57-478_5aebaa4954922d7e.webp","sourceBytes":68354,"destBytes":35000,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":27090,"totalSpendMs":1437,"convertSpendMs":285,"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:56:56","host":"us-53*","referer":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/?p=59855","linkMd5ListStr":"4affdd28ae988cb1eb784e431505a6b4","githubUser":"myreaderx13","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"66.8 KB","destSize":"34.2 KB","compressRate":"51.2%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/bug-wit-rule.gif","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1920,"destHeight":978,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/09/15-58-14-137_917d3595f671e1db.webp","sourceBytes":1494865,"destBytes":335074,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":27090,"totalSpendMs":18306,"convertSpendMs":16835,"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:57:57","host":"us-53*","referer":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/?p=59855","linkMd5ListStr":"4affdd28ae988cb1eb784e431505a6b4,4affdd28ae988cb1eb784e431505a6b4","githubUser":"myreaderx29","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"1.4 MB","destSize":"327.2 KB","compressRate":"22.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx29":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
