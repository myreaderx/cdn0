Once in power, these fascist leaders replaced democracy with a cult of personality, steadily eroded democratic norms and truth, ratcheted up violence, and found scapegoats to victimize. They would lead their nations into war, and ultimately ruin, but not before creating a playbook for other charismatic autocrats who entice voters with simplistic solutions to complex problems.</p> \n<p>Originally aired on television, Steves has released the documentary on YouTube, hoping that 21st century citizens can \"learn from the hard lessons of 20th-century Europe.\" The text accompanying his documentary reads as follows:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>In this one-hour special, Rick travels back a century to learn how fascism rose and then fell in Europe — taking millions of people with it. We'll trace fascism's history from its roots in the turbulent aftermath of World War I, when masses of angry people rose up, to the rise of charismatic leaders who manipulated that anger, the totalitarian societies they built, and the brutal measures they used to enforce their ideology. We'll see the horrific consequences: genocide and total war. And we'll be inspired by the stories of those who resisted. Along the way, we'll visit poignant sights throughout Europe relating to fascism, and talk with Europeans whose families lived through those times. Our goal: to learn from the hard lessons of 20th-century Europe, and to recognize that ideology in the 21st century.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><em>The Story of Fascism</em> is recommended for students and adults alike. With World War II fading from living memory, we could use a good reminder, says Steves, of how \"nationalism can be channeled into evil, and how our freedoms and democracies are not indestructible…in fact, they are fragile.\"</p> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you like to support the mission of Open Culture?

The Dylan of the early 1960s adopted the voice of a prophet, in various registers, to tell stories of judgment and generational curses, symbolic and historical, that have beset the country from its beginnings.</p> \n<p>The verses of “Blowin’ in the Wind,” from 1963’s <em>The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan</em>, enact this repetition, both traumatic and hypnotic. In its dual refrains—“how many times...?\" and \"the answer is blowin’ in the wind” (ephemeral, impossible to grasp)—the song cycles between earnest Lamentations and the acute, world-weary resignation of Ecclesiastes. “This ambiguity is one reason for the song’s broad appeal,” as Peter Dreier writes at <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan\"><em>Dissent</em></a>.</p> \n<div class=\"oc-center-da\"></div> \n<p>Just three months after its release, when Dylan <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/bob-dylan-march-on-washington-civil-rights-video-1963/\">performed at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> on August 28, 1963, “Blowin’ in the Wind” had become a massive civil rights anthem. But he had already ceded the song to Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, who played their version that day. Dylan ignored his sophomore album entirely to play songs from the upcoming <em>The Times They Are a-Changing</em>—songs that stand out for their indictments of the U.S. in some very specific terms.</p> \n<p>Dylan played three songs from the new album: “When the Ship Comes In” with Joan Baez, “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “With God on Our Side.” (He also played the popular folk song “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.”) In contrast to his vaguely allusive popular anthems, “Only a Pawn in Their Game\"—about the murder of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers\">Medgar Evers</a>—isn't coy about the culprits and their crimes. We might say the song offers an astute analysis of institutional racism, white supremacy, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/jargon-watch-rising-danger-stochastic-terrorism/\">stochastic terrorism</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>A bullet from the back of a bush<br /> Took Medgar Evers' blood<br /> A finger fired the trigger to his name<br /> A handle hid out in the dark<br /> A hand set the spark<br /> Two eyes took the aim<br /> Behind a man's brain<br /> But he can't be blamed<br /> He's only a pawn in their game</p> \n <p>A South politician preaches to the poor white man<br /> \"You got more than the blacks, don't complain<br /> You're better than them, you been born with white skin, \" they explain<br /> And the Negro's name<br /> Is used, it is plain<br /> For the politician's gain<br /> As he rises to fame<br /> And the poor white remains<br /> On the caboose of the train<br /> But it ain't him to blame<br /> He's only a pawn in their game</p> \n <p>The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid<br /> And the marshals and cops get the same<br /> But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool<br /> He's taught in his school<br /> From the start by the rule<br /> That the laws are with him<br /> To protect his white skin<br /> To keep up his hate<br /> So he never thinks straight<br /> 'Bout the shape that he's in<br /> But it ain't him to blame<br /> He's only a pawn in their game</p> \n <p>From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks<br /> And the hoofbeats pound in his brain<br /> And he's taught how to walk in a pack<br /> Shoot in the back<br /> With his fist in a clinch<br /> To hang and to lynch<br /> To hide 'neath the hood<br /> To kill with no pain<br /> Like a dog on a chain<br /> He ain't got no name<br /> But it ain't him to blame<br /> He's only a pawn in their game</p> \n <p>Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught<br /> They lowered him down as a king<br /> But when the shadowy sun sets on the one<br /> That fired the gun<br /> He'll see by his grave<br /> On the stone that remains<br /> Carved next to his name<br /> His epitaph plain<br /> Only a pawn in their game</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>These lyrics have far too much relevance to current events, and they're indicative of the changing tone of Dylan’s muse. His refrains drip with irony. The killer of Medgar Evers “can’t be blamed”—an evasion of responsibility that becomes a powerful force all its own.</p> \n<div class=\"oc-video-wrapper\"> \n <div class=\"oc-video-container\"> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/?p=1080713/http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9OtzvX0_8\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/dG9OtzvX0_8/default.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" /></a></p> \n </div> \n <p> \n  <!-- /oc-video-embed --> </p>\n</div> \n<p>\n <!-- /oc-video-wrapper --></p> \n<p>Dylan revisits the themes of generational trauma and murder in “With God on Our Side” (hear him sing it with Baez at Newport, above). The song is a sharp satire of his historical education, with its inevitable repetitions of war and slaughter. Here, Dylan presents the exponentially gross, existentially dreadful, consequences of a national abdication of blame for historical violence.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Oh my name it ain't nothin'<br /> My age it means less<br /> The country I come from<br /> Is called the Midwest<br /> I was taught and brought up there<br /> The laws to abide<br /> And that land that I live in<br /> Has God on its side</p> \n <p>Oh, the history books tell it<br /> They tell it so well<br /> The cavalries charged<br /> The Indians fell<br /> The cavalries charged<br /> The Indians died<br /> Oh, the country was young<br /> With God on its side</p> \n <p>The Spanish-American<br /> War had its day<br /> And the Civil War, too<br /> Was soon laid away<br /> And the names of the heroes<br /> I was made to memorize<br /> With guns in their hands<br /> And God on their side</p> \n <p>The First World War, boys<br /> It came and it went<br /> The reason for fighting<br /> I never did get<br /> But I learned to accept it<br /> Accept it with pride<br /> For you don't count the dead<br /> When God's on your side</p> \n <p>The Second World War<br /> Came to an end<br /> We forgave the Germans<br /> And then we were friends<br /> Though they murdered six million<br /> In the ovens they fried<br /> The Germans now, too<br /> Have God on their side</p> \n <p>I've learned to hate the Russians<br /> All through my whole life<br /> If another war comes<br /> It's them we must fight<br /> To hate them and fear them<br /> To run and to hide<br /> And accept it all bravely<br /> With God on my side</p> \n <p>But now we got weapons<br /> Of chemical dust<br /> If fire them, we're forced to<br /> Then fire, them we must<br /> One push of the button<br /> And a shot the world wide<br /> And you never ask questions<br /> When God's on your side</p> \n <p>Through many a dark hour<br /> I've been thinkin' about this<br /> That Jesus Christ was<br /> Betrayed by a kiss<br /> But I can't think for you<br /> You'll have to decide<br /> Whether Judas Iscariot<br /> Had God on his side.</p> \n <p>So now as I'm leavin'<br /> I'm weary as Hell<br /> The confusion I'm feelin'<br /> Ain't no tongue can tell<br /> The words fill my head<br /> And fall to the floor<br /> That if God's on our side<br /> He'll stop the next war</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Dylan’s race/class analysis in “Only a Pawn in the Game” and his succinct People’s History of Christian Nationalism in “With God on Our Side” stand out as interesting choices for the March for several reasons. For one thing, it’s as though he had written these songs expressly to take the political, economic, and religious mechanisms and mythologies of racism apart. This was radical speech in an event that was policed by its organizers to tone down inflammatory rhetoric for the cameras.</p> \n<p>23-year-old John Lewis, for example, was forced to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/1/15/21063797/john-lewis-pancreatic-cancer-civil-rights\">temper his speech</a>, in which he meant to say, “We will march through the South, through the heart of Dixie, the way Sherman did. We shall pursue our own scorched earth policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground — nonviolently<em>.</em><em>…</em> the revolution is at hand, and we must free ourselves of the chains of political and economic slavery.\" As a popular white artist, rather than a potentially seditious Black organizer, Dylan had far more license and could \"use his privilege,” as they say, to describe the systems of political and economic oppression Lewis had wanted to name.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1080714\" src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/08/28001943/march-on-washington.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/08/28001943/march-on-washington.jpg 584w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/08/28001943/march-on-washington-234x360.jpg 234w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/08/28001943/march-on-washington-156x240.jpg 156w, http://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/08/28001943/march-on-washington-300x462.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" width=\"320\" /></p> \n<p>Dylan’s performance was one of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/dream-songs-the-music-of-the-march-on-washington\">handful of memorable musical appearances</a>. Most of the singers made a far bigger impression, like Mahalia Jackson, Marian Anderson, and Baez herself, whose “We Shall Overcome” created a legendary moment of harmony. No one sang along to Dylan’s new songs—they wouldn’t have known the words. But Dylan was never careless. He chose these words for the moment, hoping to have some impact in the only way he could.</p> \n<div class=\"oc-video-wrapper\"> \n <div class=\"oc-video-container\"> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/?p=1080713/http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=7akuOFp-ET8\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/7akuOFp-ET8/default.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" /></a></p> \n </div> \n <p> \n  <!-- /oc-video-embed --> </p>\n</div> \n<p>\n <!-- /oc-video-wrapper --></p> \n<p>The 1963 March's purpose has been overshadowed by a few passages in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s powerful \"I Have a Dream\" speech, co-opted by everyone and reduced to meme-able quotes.

Anyone who's followed Banksy's art career knows he possesses a well-developed instinct for catching and keeping public attention, and it has hardly deserted him in this venture. Why sponsor a refugee rescue boat, after all, when you can sponsor a bright pink feminist refugee rescue boat, emblazoned with a piece of original art?</p> \n<p>Despite having been named for the 19th-century feminist anarchist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Michel\">Louise Michel</a>, the motor yacht's operations encompass an even wider variety of causes: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/27/banksy-funds-refugee-rescue-boat-operating-in-mediterranean\"><em>The Guardian</em>'s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/27/banksy-funds-refugee-rescue-boat-operating-in-mediterranean\">Lorenzo Tondo and Maurice Stierl quote</a> \"Lea Reisner, a nurse and head of mission for the first rescue operation,\" saying that the project is also \"meant to bring together a variety of struggles for social justice, including for women’s and LGBTIQ rights, racial equality, migrants’ rights, environmentalism and animal rights.\" This multidirectional activism would seem to suit the artistic sensibility of Banksy, whose work strikes out in as many critical directions as both his admirers and detractors can interpret.</p> \n<div class=\"oc-center-da\"></div> \n<p>The&nbsp;<em>Louise Michel</em>, as Tondo and Stierl reported last Thursday, \"set off in secrecy on 18 August from the Spanish seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, and is now in the central Mediterranean where on Thursday it rescued 89 people in distress, including 14 women and four children.\" After picking up the first group of refugees, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/29/migrant-rescue-boat-funded-by-street-artist-banksy-pleads-with-europe-let-it-ashore/\">reports the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>'s Miriam Berger</a>,&nbsp;\"it then encountered a ship traveling from North Africa to Europe with 130 people aboard and some bodies of people who had died during the journey,\" and as a result \"quickly became overcrowded and could not properly steer, its Twitter posts said.\" All this happened \"at sea around 55 miles southeast of Lampedusa, an Italian island off the North African coast that has become a migration transit point.\"</p> \n<div class=\"oc-video-wrapper\"> \n <div class=\"oc-video-container\"> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/?p=1080736/http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxf_KbpxGzQ\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/pxf_KbpxGzQ/default.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" /></a></p> \n </div> \n <p> \n  <!-- /oc-video-embed --> </p>\n</div> \n<p>\n <!-- /oc-video-wrapper --></p> \n<p>Hours later two other vessels, one operated by the Italian coast guard and one by a German nongovernmental organization, came to take on passengers. Though hardly smooth sailing, <span style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">the </span><em style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">Louise Michel</em><span style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">'s first rescue mission proceeded more favorably than some: </span>\"A vessel named the <em>Talia</em>, which rescued 52 people almost two months ago, wasn't allowed into the port for 5 days,\" <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/50274/1/banksy-funds-rescue-boat-to-save-refugees-mediterranean-europe\">says Dazed</a>. \"<span style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">Now, a boat named the <em>Etienne</em> is in the longest record stand-off between authorities and rescuers ever, having spent three weeks at sea being denied disembarkation in Malta.\" </span>Banksy publicized the <em style=\"font-size: 13pt;\">Louise Michel</em>, which he sponsors without involvement in its operations, only after it had set sail. But for anyone with an interest in showing the world the dire circumstances of refugees today, the highly visible boat's highly visible difficulties certainly aren't bad publicity.</p> \n<p><strong>Related Content:</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/05/banksy-strikes-again-in-venice.html\">Banksy Strikes Again in Venice</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2020/07/banksy-strikes-again-in-london-urges-everyone-to-wear-masks.html\">Banksy Strikes Again in London &amp; Urges Everyone to Wear Masks</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2020/04/banksy-debuts-his-covid-19-art-project-my-wife-hates-it-when-i-work-from-home.html\">Banksy Debuts His COVID-19 Art Project: Good to See That He Has TP at Home</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/10/watch-dismaland-the-official-unofficial-film-a-cinematic-journey-through-banksys-apocalyptic-theme-park.html\">Watch <em>Dismaland — The Official Unofficial Film</em>, A Cinematic Journey Through Banksy’s Apocalyptic Theme Park</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/10/banksy-adds-new-spin-rich-tradition-artists-destroying-art.html\">Banksy Shreds His $1.4 Million Painting at Auction, Taking a Tradition of Artists Destroying Art to New Heights</a></p> \n<p><em>Based in Seoul,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Colin Marshall</a>&nbsp;writes and broadcasts&nbsp;on cities, language, and culture.&nbsp;His projects include the book&nbsp;</em>The Stateless City: a Walk through 21st-Century Los Angeles&nbsp;<em>and the video series&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/channels/thecityincinema\">The City in Cinema</a><em>.
