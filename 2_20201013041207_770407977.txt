But, according to one article in the series, the US is also failing to lower COVID-19 death rates—even as harder-hit countries have managed to learn from early disease peaks and bring their rates down substantially.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771841\">the analysis</a>, researchers Alyssa Bilinski of Harvard and Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania compared the shifting COVID-19 death rates of 18 high-income countries during three time windows. The idea was to see how death rates changed as countries adopted different public health interventions, especially if they had seen surges in cases early on that boosted their overall death rate during the pandemic. Specifically, Bilinski and Emanuel looked at COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people starting from February 13, May 10, and June 7, with all three windows ending on September 19.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1713533#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1713533&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 22:09:33 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-death-places-another-pin-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"27fd6548ebda79c0c652e3d9263da907","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-21-773_07c12fa7cc9129b7.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":147895,"destBytes":107662,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-death-places-another-pin-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-21-773_07c12fa7cc9129b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_1/2020/10/13/04-11-23-719_08e4c8db902517b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=bXhHWw9L2WM:TVnE-Xux_uQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-40-070_ae5a75c7aeff557e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_3/2020/10/13/04-11-43-983_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn13@2020_6/2020/10/13/04-11-42-028_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602562280810}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:21","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:11:21","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 04:11:20 +0000","fetchMs":357,"handleMs":1407,"totalMs":26013,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"6adc9ee180e15d93daf6364a5c318f90","hostName":"us-53*","requestId":"766a3847ce28411a880cd1db85ca4a4a_2","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":109208,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":5,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":5,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx31":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 13:47:33","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn62@2020_5/2020/09/05/05-47-27-309_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
