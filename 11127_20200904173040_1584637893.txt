It’s the most diffused kind of greeting, it is used by everyone—so simple and so daily to be able to associate all of us, wherever we are.</p> \n<p>Below you can find all four stamp designs.

In 2019, the creative team was asked to work on a new brand identity and packaging series for Casa Selva, a skincare line inspired by the old city of Tulum and its lush jungle botanicals. Their aim is to elevate the daily ritual of self-care with pure ingredients.</p> \n<p>Graphic design studio Menta designed a bespoke logotype where&nbsp;air and open space play graciously around each letter. They redesigned&nbsp;a symbol that features&nbsp;a sophisticated palm tree&nbsp;for Casa Selva, which is also a monogram that is used in selected pieces. Just have a look at the images below.

The volumes are inspired by the natural contours of the area and blend harmoniously into the environment. The meandering shape obscures the actual size of the house. Its protrusions and recesses make it possible to connect with the landscape of the surrounding parkland. All rooms are clad with natural stone and continuously exposed concrete on the edge of the roof connects everything perfectly.</p> \n<p>Below you can find a few images shot by photographer <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://www.simonebossi.it/photographer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simone Bossi</a>.

Inditango enables organizations to manage IT like a business. The company is one of Europe’s leading management consultancies with a focus on increasing the added value of IT. Inditango commissioned agency <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.eiga.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EIGA</a> to work on a relaunch of the existing brand identity. The goal was to create a new visual language that expresses the uniqueness of the company’s authentic and progressive approach through brand strategy, visual identity, and digital communication.

The abbreviation IT is reproduced as “India” and “Tango”. So it only seemed logical to use the visual system of the Morse code to complete the design—two dots for the letter “i” and a single dash for the letter “t”. All visual elements including logo, layout grid, illustrations, and icons are derived from these basic elements.

Architecture firm Marià Castelló designed a house that is organized in five clearly differentiated volumes. The first three volumes include the entire program for a large family with lots of social activities. The fourth volume offers most outdoor spaces, while the fifth volume can be used as a guest area with independent access. The fourth and fifth volume are separated by the pool and the main leisure area. The length of the five volumes is determined by the depth of the terrace on which the apartment is located, which helps to integrate the intervention into the landscape.</p> \n<p>Below you can find a few images of the house.

In addition to nature, his work is often associated with the experience of meditation.</p> \n<p>In 1964 at the age of only 16, Tomas Sanchez moved to Havana to study painting at the San Alejandro National Academy of Fine Arts. Two years later, he transferred to the newly founded National School for the Arts (<em>ENA</em>), whose program of study was more contemporary. In 1971, he graduated from the ENA. In the same year, he won his first prize in Graphic Art from the National Young Artists’ Salon, earning him the first recognition of his career.</p> \n<p>Below you can find some of his landscape paintings that have been created with acrylic on linen.
