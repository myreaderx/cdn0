According to research conducted in October 2019, as many as 70% of U.S. employees were no longer sitting behind a desk every day, and there were already more than 92 million mobile-enabled workers in the United States. Here is the competitive advantage of a mobile-enabled workforce.</p>\n<h3>The mobile-enabled workforce had grown 11X faster than the total workforce from 2005 to 2019.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-170295\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"587\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Employers were exploring the extent of this change and how it was impacting the business and bottom line. Those instituting mobile workforce plans believed they would ultimately be at a business advantage (though none could have foreseen how quickly that would manifest).</p>\n<p>Beyond the qualitative benefits of workplace flexibility, it was estimated that employers could save $11,000 per year for every mobile-enabled worker when taking into account workspace leases, amenities, and more.</p>\n<p>Clearly, not every business or employee can do their job or be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/how-to-ensure-high-productivity-of-your-remote-workers/\">fully productive</a> when they work remotely. Perhaps they need a particular piece of equipment to perform their job duties or don’t have an acceptable space to use for work. But groups that often work in the field, mainstream office employees, and people in leadership roles should be enabled to work remotely. What’s more, they can be just as productive working remotely as they are in the office.</p>\n<h3><strong>Acting Short Term While Thinking Long Term</strong></h3>\n<p>Namely, these businesses experience a less severe drop in productivity, efficiency, and output.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember, the advantages of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/27/remote-access-solutions-overcoming-the-challenges/\">having a sizeable mobile-enabled workforce</a> are not limited to situations such as the once-in-a-generation type response to COVID-19. Even lesser disruptions, like a power outage affecting an office or inclement weather making travel to the office slow or dangerous, are situations where being mobile-enabled is an advantage.</p>\n<h4>For business leaders looking to expand their mobile workforce’s numbers – either immediately or in the longer term – there are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/05/remote-working-culture-the-facts-business-owners-need-to-know/\">cultural and structural changes</a> that should be top of mind.</h4>\n<p>Culturally, organizations must find ways to limit the need for onsite attendance as the norm. The preparation should involve increasing the use of communication tools for collaborative work sessions and facilitate quick questions or back-and-forth discussion. Furthermore, businesses must set achievable goals when it comes to shifting the focus from staying at work during work hours to completing work during work hours.</p>\n<p>Structurally, the first and most apparent employee needs are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/19/5-actionable-strategies-for-boosting-employee-productivity/\">devices and tools</a> that will enable them for mobile work. Those devices must be secured appropriately for remote work and extended periods away from the office, which could present challenges for IT and regular activities such as patching.</p>\n<p>For those who can work from home, employees should be provided with what they need by the employer, or the expenses to pay for coverage at their home address – i.e., reimbursement for mixed-use assets – must be legally taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Reimbursement is vital and will be an exciting development to follow as businesses and the economy adjust to this <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/29/how-to-prepare-for-a-future-of-remote-teams/\">period of increased remote work</a>. Over the past few years, emerging trends in employment law have required employers to recognize even small tasks performed by employees on their own devices as work.</p>\n<p>Employee work includes quick duties like clocking in or out – amounts of time that would have been considered too small to track in the past. As a result, unpaid <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/26/byod-is-more-than-a-trend-heres-how-to-encourage-it-while-still-keeping-your-network-safe/\">BYOD programs</a> have recently exposed employers to lawsuits. In the recent rush to remote work, those legal considerations may be taking a back seat to the physical constraints preventing remote work &#8212; whether that continues to be the case as businesses see a return to standard remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating Flexibility Where You Have Control</strong></p>\n<p>There are issues outside a company’s control, and those are creating dramatic impacts during this outbreak. The making and shipping of goods, for example, is an area where companies are experiencing massive disruption, even those that pulled away from China before the spread of coronavirus began. The disturbance throughout global supply chains is unlike anything we have seen before. Tourism and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/travel-industry-building-its-immunity-with-artificial-intelligence/\">travel industries</a> are also among the most directly impacted during the height of the viral spread.</p>\n<p>Still, there are some issues a company can control. That’s where businesses can gain an advantage by focusing their efforts and creating flexibility. Implementing a reimbursement program can help encourage employees to upgrade their home internet service, so they have <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/28/4-video-lead-generation-strategies-for-more-engagement/\">better video quality</a> in virtual meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Companies can reduce employee stress over this period of change by communicating clear expectations and guidelines for conducting work in a remote setting.</strong></p>\n<p>Having a mobile-enabled workforce can ensure better business continuity in spite of office closures.</p>\n<p>Once a company has established a mobile-enabled approach, the business benefits are clear. In the near term, a mobile-enabled workforce can work through a health crisis without close physical proximity to coworkers that might put them at higher risk. But the advantages also extend to increased flexibility in multiple situations.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If you haven’t ironed out y<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/09/5-post-pandemic-changes-to-expect-in-the-workplace/\">our mobile workforce plan yet</a>, be sure to take the structural and cultural aspects of a good plan into account and keep state labor laws and reimbursement regulations on your radar. Once the current health crisis ends, your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/3-ways-you-can-empower-your-remote-employees/\">business will be more resilient</a> and in a better position to thrive in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Ketut Subiyanto; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/16/the-competitive-advantage-of-a-mobile-enabled-workforce/\">The Competitive Advantage of a Mobile-Enabled Workforce</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:26:54 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Competitive-Advantage-of-a-Mobile-Enabled-Workforce.jpg","linkMd5":"978c4496d5d34fbc4caa1c8eb68f6a56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-25-516_d8483ac10fab38b2.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Competitive-Advantage-of-a-Mobile-Enabled-Workforce.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":853,"sourceBytes":148510,"destBytes":66884,"author":"Ken Robinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Competitive-Advantage-of-a-Mobile-Enabled-Workforce-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-16-758_293b0e3fab8f71c3.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/photo-of-man-using-laptop-4049459-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-20-565_ccb5672a80cfd68b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875435},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Fundraising Now?

New talk of capital <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/charting-a-course-between-two-extremes-of-startup-cash-management/\">efficiency</a> is gratifying, but there was another lesson from pre-COVID-19 valuation struggles. Morality matters.</p>\n<h3><strong>Venture capitalists and early-stage <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/vc-funding-in-2020-what-investors-look-for-in-startups/\">investors</a> have told all of us, founders are critical to a startup’s valuation. </strong></h3>\n<p>These investors also tell you the founder’s role cuts both ways. As a unicorn approaches an exit, the balance sheet needs to make sense. But importantly, headlines around WeWork, Uber, and Juul that may be fading into memory too fast were a signal.</p>\n<p>These companies were a signal for founders and their early investors to reexamine their understanding of morality and valuation.</p>\n<h2><b>“Morality” is it too strong a word?</b></h2>\n<p>Most of us almost never use the word morality when talking about entrepreneurialism. It is a strong word driving deep into what’s in the soul, and publicly at least we work to avoid judging others. Like many of us, I’d rather focus on my own actions, and associate with others who I can learn from, and who I admire.</p>\n<p>That’s probably why we don’t hear <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/22/what-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-the-college-admission-scandal/\">morality</a> used often at business events. It’s a high stakes word. But we do hear it quietly standing behind other words we use more frequently, like reputation, purpose, brand, optics and litigation risk.</p>\n<p>WeWork’s founder was been accused of self-dealing, which in turn has thrown the company’s IPO into question. Investors saw the enterprise’s nearly $50 billion valuation eroded right as they were headed to the public markets.</p>\n<p>The founder stepped aside. Juul and its $38 billion valuation came under the spotlight after deaths and illnesses connected with vaping. Juul’s founder resigned.</p>\n<p>Uber is still living down reports of its founder’s past behavior, and California pushed to treat drivers like full-time employees and take on the associated costs.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic finally evolves into something more predictable, we can only wait for cannabis startups to find their way back into the news.</p>\n<p>Whether we believe a company is moral, or not, actually matters. As Marie Ekeland, founder of venture capital firm Daphni has suggested, it matters if a company represents what you want <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bibicheri/the-new-european-dream-44aeeb5bcd68\">the future</a> to look like. Alternatively, if a company is seen as faking it, tremendous value can evaporate. The conversation boils down further to whether the leaders of these companies can be trusted.</p>\n<h2><b>What people say behind your back</b></h2>\n<p>Amanda Hesser, the founder of Food52, has talked about this saying when we think about reputation, it’s kind of how people speak about you when you’re not in the room. Columbia University professor Sheena Iyengar has called out authenticity as being at the root of whether a customer, partner, or investor will do business with you.</p>\n<p>Iyengar suggests if you know who you are, and why you want to do what you’re doing, then you’re better at explaining it, and also you’re better at being more concrete about what <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/choice-authenticity-with-hanna-rosin-sheena-iyengar/\">choices</a> need to be made and what you’re looking to do when you make each choice.</p>\n<p>These ideas are right. Will people vouch for your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/04/purpose-balance-and-interface-are-keys-to-successful-teams/\">character</a> based on what they have seen of your actions. Do they believe you are transparent about your motivations and consistent in honoring what’s at your core?</p>\n<p><strong>A cynic can point to the fact that despite headline-grabbing behavior at Uber, the company continues.</strong></p>\n<p>Juul got far before events caught up with it. WeWork still does not appear on the verge of folding. The leaders who have caught the spotlight, have not seen their wallets hurt in any substantial way that we can see.</p>\n<p>That may be true.</p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s the logical conclusion of that lesson? Maybe it doesn’t hurt that much to push the line on ethical questions after all. In fact, the founders involved could argue, as could investors, that by pushing the line when others weren’t willing, much was gained. And the founders are only martyrs for the investors they made money for. And they are compensated for their troubles after stepping down.</p>\n<p>This may also be true… up to a point.</p>\n<h2><b>Investors step in</b></h2>\n<p>Investors balking at companies right now, that appear to be morally compromised are not wrong, and there is an alternative. Companies that prompt employees to speak up about ethical lapses <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/11/research-whistleblowers-are-a-sign-of-healthy-companies\">tend to be more profitable</a>. Companies ranked by <a href=\"https://www.worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees/\">Ethisphere</a> as among the most ethical, outperform the large-cap sector over five years by more than 14 percent.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/wonder-women-capitalizing-on-gender-equality-1499490243\">Jerome Dodson</a> of Parnassus Investments, Jane Gladstone of Evercore, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/these-investments-aim-for-workplace-diversity-and-gender-pay-equity.html\">Julie Gorte</a> of Pax World Funds and others have suggested &#8212; there&#8217;s tons of <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/05/the-investor-revolution\">research</a> that show companies that care about<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-gender-diversity-makes-firms-more-productive\"> gender</a>, equality, who care about diversity.</p>\n<p>These companies care about the environment and they actually perform better. Because the research is so compelling, the largest investors, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/blackrock-just-committed-climate-smart-investments-can-gender-smart-be-next\">BlackRock</a>, Vanguard, <a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b4fh28ys3mr9/State-Street-to-Turn-Up-the-Heat-on-All-Male-Boards\">State Street</a>, who are all the stewards of index funds — now represent the top three holders of almost every company. These companies have now started voting in sync with that because that&#8217;s just what&#8217;s best for their shareholders.</p>\n<h2><b>Fintech steps up</b></h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/27/covid-19-jobs-data-and-machine-learning/\">fintech</a> companies that are especially well equipped to help best practices and morality rise to the top. I’ve had the chance to work with many of them to see it firsthand.</p>\n<p>Harmonate, based in San Jose has developed private fund <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/17/3-people-reveal-a-formula-for-hedge-fund-data-operations/\">data operations</a> tailored to the complexities of tracking social impact investing. One of their investors, <a href=\"https://www.jtcgroup.com/\">JTC Group</a> has developed a specialty in this arena through a recent acquisition.</p>\n<p>Trust also comes into play supporting bankers who are now moving vast amounts of stimulus funds out to communities. They are trying to avoid getting it into the wrong hands. Fraudsters, organized crime, and others are stepping up to the trough.</p>\n<p>Banks need to weed them out but do so in a manner that does not hurt small businesses. Enterprise AI firm <a href=\"https://www.ayasdi.com/\">Symphony AyasdiAI</a> has developed a capability to reduce trust-eroding false positives to ensure the money that can have a social impact doesn’t get siphoned away or the wrong person is pilloried.</p>\n<p>Property technology company <a href=\"https://gracehill.com/\">Grace Hill</a> in South Carolina has refined digital training for multifamily housing teams to not just make it through the COVID-19 pandemic with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/03/share-other-health-data-in-real-time-like-its-a-pandemic/\">health</a> intact &#8212; but by building better <a href=\"https://gracehill.com/blog/another-timely-and-actionable-report-may-covid-19-resident-sentiment-survey-issue-2/\">relationships</a> with renters.</p>\n<p>The action includes training in the full range of customer service skills that bring in revenue. And that includes a better understanding of how to cut out discrimination, sexual harassment, and biases that can destroy the reputation and moral purpose.</p>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>We all have been talking about impact investing for some time. And maybe we’ve been talking about it for so long that we’ve stopped taking it too seriously. Founders building their venture from the ground up, and the venture capitalists that back them as angels and seed investors, should not pay lip service to reputation, brand, or morals.</p>\n<p>Economics should not be the driver for morality… but if that’s what it takes. We live in an age where powerful people appear to get away with trying to obscure the truth. But that can be ripped out into the open more than you expect. Bank on it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/15/fundraising-now-remember-morality-impacts-valuation/\">Fundraising Now?

By analyzing leads activity, AI prioritizes them and predicts the amount of profit each client might bright. </li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Facilitating better management of financial resources</b>. AI machines analyze patterns in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/14/consumer-behavior-is-shifting-business-models-how-industries-adapting/\">buyers&#8217; behavior</a> to predict income and cash-flow. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this in mind, let&#8217;s find out whether you can apply AI for business and what challenges you will face during AI adoption. </p>\n<h2>Does My Business Really Need Artificial Intelligence? </h2>\n<p>The first thing to bear in mind is that not all companies are ready to leverage AI. If you want to find out <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/18/why-your-business-needs-custom-internal-communication/\">whether AI suits your business</a>, consider the following. </p>\n<h3>Well-established Data Collection </h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence requires a large amount of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/06/the-artwork-behind-building-recommendation-engines-with-big-data/\">high-quality data</a> collected in the right way. Moreover, gathering high-quality data is an essential struggle for all AI specialists and data scientists. In this case, we talk not about the data accessible on the internet, but rather about data your company collects. </p>\n<p>But, there is no particular answer to how much information your AI solution will need since. It depends on the complexity of your business problem and the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/26/link-building-services/\">complexity of the AI algorithm</a> you are going to build. </p>\n<p>Thus, if you decided to hire data scientists to build an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/23/ai-learning-algorithms-find-your-new-target-groups/\">AI algorithm</a>, you need to make the following preparations:</p>\n<p><b>Check out errors in the data</b>. While AI algorithms can <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/its-time-to-truly-consider-the-privacy-implications-of-iot/\">find insights from big data</a>, they could not generalize the data format. For instance, if you did several misspells in a client&#8217;s name and still conclude that this is the one person, the AI algorithm doesn&#8217;t. In this case, AI machines will classify spelling variations as different persons, which impacts negatively on predictions. </p>\n<p><b>Keep the data up to date</b>. If you want your AI algorithm to make precise predictions and get really valuable insight, you should keep your data updates. It means that before using data for AI training, you need to delete all old and irrelevant information. Also, be sure that your data has no gaps, including missing outliners and values.  </p>\n<p><b>Use the unified format for data storing</b>. To enable AI algorithms to learn from your data, you need to keep all the inputs in one format. If your business keeps data in different formats, like PDFs, Word docs, or physical documents, you need to convert it in the form of a searchable database. </p>\n<h3>Particular Business Problem to Solve </h3>\n<p>If you have maintained the way your business collects and stores data, the next step is to figure out what you want from an AI algorithm. It means that you need to define what business problem you want AI algorithms to solve. To give you a clue about the area you can improve with AI, we listed the three most common AI usages. </p>\n<p><b>Bring value to existing products</b>. The example is how Netflix <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-2-d9b96aa399f5\">leverages AI and Machine Learning</a> for their recommender system. Machine Learning algorithms analyze the watching history of other users with similar tastes to recommend you the most exciting content. With such an approach, the company increased the number of paying users because users received more engaging experience.  </p>\n<p><b>Make data-driven business decisions</b>. You can apply AI to receive insights on how to control rent prices, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/15/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-global-logistics-and-supply-chain-management/\">optimize resource planning</a> and demand forecasting, and even predict when a piece of equipment might break. </p>\n<p><b>Automate business processes</b>. Artificial Intelligent Algorithms are perfect for routine tasks automation because they analyze all available data for one specific task, and they are good at it. If you want to find out what processes you can automate with AI, think about your business processes that are rich in data. Also, consider processes when your employees have to search through and analyze significant amounts of data. </p>\n<h3>Culture of Innovations </h3>\n<p>The culture of your company also defines whether you are ready to implement AI or not. For example, industry leaders such as Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, and others that leverage AI, have a track record on innovations. Thus, you need to value your data as a driver of changes.  </p>\n<p><b>AI-friendly corporate strategy.</b> Some businesses want to implement AI just for AIs&#8217; sake without having a well-though corporate strategy. In this case, enterprises receive long, drawn-out projects that never bring actual value. To avoid this, you need to be sure that your business strategy is flexible to make AI a central element.  </p>\n<p><b>Measurable results</b>. Before implementing AI technology, you should think about the way you will evaluate the efficiency and results of AI algorithms. In this way, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/10/why-multicultural-marketing-needs-machine-learning-and-facial-tracking/\">setting metrics</a> will demonstrate the technology&#8217;s return on investment. </p>\n<p><b>The margin for error</b>. It would be best if you considered that sometimes Artificial Intelligence does not work in the way it should. Thus, you should rely on AI algorithms from the very implementation and be okay with spending extra budget on data scientists who will maintain the algorithm during the post-launch period. </p>\n<h2>Key takeaways</h2>\n<p>AI is a great tool that might bring many benefits to the business. However, it is not a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution.  </p>\n<p>Before considering AI for small business, you should consider the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business produces very little data, AI is not your tech solution of choice. To learn, work properly, and give you valuable insights, AI needs a vast amount of data. </li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Artificial intelligence and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/04/06/7-ways-your-business-should-be-using-machine-learning-today/\">Machine Learning</a> is not magic, but math. Thus, do not consider those technologies as silver bullets to make your business earn more. </li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a small company that does not produce big data, you should not think that an AI algorithm will help you to earn more. </li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To adopt AI to your business, you need to have structured data, clearly defines business problems, and flexible corporate strategy. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/13/does-your-business-really-need-an-ai-solution/\">Does Your Business Really Need an AI Solution?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:00:06 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Does-Your-Business-Really-Need-an-AI-Solution.jpg","linkMd5":"2e943fe374018b1c8b9abf98145ed62d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-09-743_e188359f4f5bf83d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Does-Your-Business-Really-Need-an-AI-Solution.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1279,"sourceBytes":739264,"destBytes":790846,"author":"Anzhela Sychyk","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Does-Your-Business-Really-Need-an-AI-Solution-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-17-767_660722d25210e9f6.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CTMKT_754603_AI_Adoption_Challenges_GRAPHIC_R1B-587x719.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-28-516_149822f3d0def889.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880232},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"How is AI Transforming the Education Tech Space?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170175","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/23/how-is-ai-transforming-the-education-tech-space/\" title=\"How is AI Transforming the Education Tech Space?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-is-AI-Transforming-the-Education-Tech-Space-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"online education tech space\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-is-AI-Transforming-the-Education-Tech-Space-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-is-AI-Transforming-the-Education-Tech-Space-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-is-AI-Transforming-the-Education-Tech-Space.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Education has transformed into big-business in the recent COVID times. The US ranks 17th in education performance and 7th as the most literate country in the world. The literacy rate has increased up to 86% in the US. Primary, secondary and higher studies are seeing great improvements, and breaking records almost every year. Here is how AI is transforming the education tech space.</p>\n<h2>The method of teaching and learning has changed rapidly.</h2>\n<p>Some people are of the belief that there is nothing like classroom teaching. It&#8217;s true that classroom teaching and learning are wonderful &#8212; to an extent. But traditional learning comes with its own flaws. It is more general, constant and does not emphasize a self-development method, as much as is needed, nowadays.</p>\n<h4>Some students do not understand the purpose of learning topics that don’t interest them.</h4>\n<p>Not learning topics that interest a person has long been the contention of schools. Some think it hinders the whole point of learning in the first place. Especially kids believe that only using individual interests helps them get clear about their ambitions.</p>\n<h4>Thankfully, this is being changed by artificial intelligence.</h4>\n<p>As the traditional way of doing things changes rapidly, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/01/28/open-online-education-and-the-trend-towards-legitimacy/\">AI is increasingly becoming a part</a> of daily lives. AI learning is to an extent says its global revenue is expected to be at US$90B by the year 2025.</p>\n<p>The education tech space has turned progressively useful and customized because of AI for education.</p>\n<p>AI leads to personalized, engaging, and master learning. It has changed the manner in which learning takes place. Useful study material is now available through smart devices. It is now possible to take online tutoring (https://www.tutoreye dot com) classes and improve grades to a great extent.</p>\n<p>The percentage of AI will grow by 47.50% until the year 2021. The figure is based on a report published by the Artificial Intelligence Market in the US Education Sector. This percentage is reflective of a complete change in the education industry.</p>\n<h2> H<b>ow AI is transforming the education tech space</b>.</h2>\n<p>1.<b> THE TRANSFORMATION</b>: Around 16 million students prepare for exams on a yearly basis in the US. They are always on the lookout for useful study material on the internet. Although the internet provides plenty of help, yet the learning outcomes continue to suffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning depends largely on the quality of education that is delivered to the students.</strong></p>\n<p>Mostly, they don’t find regular online content to be useful. This is because it is just a copied version of traditional textbooks. This content is neither engaging nor interactive.</p>\n<p>Finding an effective solution to this problem, artificial intelligence has come into play. It is an impactful and engaging way of controlling the online education space better than ever. It bridges all the gaps where traditional learning used to lack. In addition to being cost-effective, it has improved the learning standards immensely with its benefits.</p>\n<p><b>2. BETTER LEARNING:</b> Artificial Intelligence is connected to education principally because of some tools that help in enhancing skills. The development of education tools has improved the process of teaching and learning to a big extent.</p>\n<p>With the help of AI, almost all aspects of traditional education have changed.

Due to its learning benefits, AI for the education industry will reach a market share of US$ 2 Billion by 2023.</p>\n<p>It has lead to a productive, personalized, and optimized process of learning. This allows the teachers to offer a better understanding of the topic to students. Utilizing the qualities of teachers and technology, the AI in education aims to create an enhanced learning scenario for the students.</p>\n<p><b>3. PERSONALIZED LEARNING:</b> The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/03/new-wave-of-online-education-helping-quiet-children-flourish/\">most important priority of all teachers</a> is to ensure that students understand concepts better. However, in a class of 25-30 students, this becomes difficult. This is where AI comes into the picture and allows an edge over traditional teaching methods.</p>\n<h4>To learn anything in a better way, the students need to understand the importance of what they are being taught.</h4>\n<p>Personalized learning inspires the students and convinces them that the information is worth learning. Since the year 2018, personalized learning has improved the grades of many students significantly. Reports suggest that between the years 2018-2023, personalized learning will change the education completely.</p>\n<p>Elearning platforms utilize AI to develop platforms that offer assistance to school and college-going students. One of the best benefits of personalized learning is the easy recognition of learning gaps. This helps in improving learning by understanding the topics better.</p>\n<p><b>4. INTELLIGENT CONTENT:</b> AI and education are closely related. The modern teaching methods are all that is needed to make sure that students achieve maximum academic success. Engaging and useful content is of primary importance when it comes to learning. Engaging content includes interactive videos, lectures, study material, etc. which helps in grasping the subjects in a better way.</p>\n<p>Smart content, right from digitized textbooks to personalized learning interfaces are proving to be useful for students. Companies like Netflix learning and Content Technologies Inc., are creating automated business content for primary and secondary education. Practice exercises, useful digitized content and constant feedback process help in getting a quality education.</p>\n<p>The traditional textbooks are taking a completely different turn with AI. Custom textbooks are created for different subjects to help students. The visual medium is used with new and improved learning interfaces to improve the grades of students.</p>\n<p><b>5. GLOBALLY AVAILABLE:</b> Education must not be limited by any boundaries. Artificial Intelligence has transformed the learning scenario by becoming globally available. It is now possible to learn any course from any part of the world. In addition to this, students with impairments can also learn with the help of AI. Problems like illnesses or different languages are not a problem anymore because AI-enabled technology offers new ways to educate everyone.</p>\n<p><b>6. EASY MANAGEMENT:</b> A teacher spends a good period of time in checking the homework, projects and assignments of students. This is where Artificial Intelligence steps in to simplify these tasks. It provides suggestions on how to bridge gaps in the learning process. The machines have been reviewing numerous OMR tests for a long time. Taking this forward, the option of checking written tests is also becoming possible now.</p>\n<p>With AI stepping into management tasks, the teachers will be able to spend more time with students. There is an increased potential to make teaching and learning processes proficient.</p>\n<p><b>7. TEACHER SUPPORT:</b> The whole process of teaching and learning is becoming increasingly advanced because of AI. In fact, very soon there will be a lot more available ranging across different types of learning styles.</p>\n<p>AI has immense potential in teaching students, helping them with their homework and preparing for tests.

The newish Apple HQ was estimated to cost around <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/how-much-every-inch-of-apples-new-5-billion-campus-cost-to-build.html\">$5 billion</a> and looks like something from a sci-fi movie.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_165934\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-165934\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-165934 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw.jpeg 1200w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw-900x503.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw-260x145.jpeg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-165934\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>How often do you work remotely?</strong></em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h2>Have<b> we seen the end of the business HQ?</b></h2>\n<p>Are all of these for naught? The up and coming Gen Z movement, which <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/anne-gherini/gen-z-is-about-to-outnumber-millennials-heres-how-that-will-affect-business-world.html\">recently</a> surpassed Millennials as the largest generation at 32% of the world population, says they prefer working from home.</p>\n<p>These workers want the ability to take their dog for a walk before a meeting or grab a coffee at their local shop before a 2 p.m. strategy session.</p>\n<h4>Gen Z and Millennials are tossing their two-hour commute for something more reasonable to fit their quality of life.</h4>\n<p>Focusing more on balance and mindfulness could lead to fewer and fewer workers concentrate on the bright shiny lights of the early 2000’s HQs.</p>\n<p>Although these traditional offices still do provide a great way for employees to connect and have a cultural 1:1 relationship.</p>\n<h2><b>People still want in-person connection</b></h2>\n<p>62% of office workers still prefer in-person communication. For digital tools, Gen X is 4x more likely to prefer video conferencing while Gen Z and Millennials are 3x more likely than the others to use Slack.</p>\n<h4>There is still very much a place for an HQ.</h4>\n<p>It can serve as a recruiting tool in an intensifying demand for engineers and AI experts, but how can companies like Google, Apple, and Adobe adapt to the evolving modern workplace?</p>\n<h2><b>Collaboration 2.0</b></h2>\n<p>94% of office workers list team collaboration as a top priority for them. Gen Z was the generation that showed the most affinity for collaboration. Maybe all of those mandatory team classes from Universities are having an impact.</p>\n<h4>Collaboration isn’t much of a changing trend.</h4>\n<p>Businesses have always been focused on ways to improve teamwork, create unity, and inspire collaboration.</p>\n<h4>What has changed is how we collaborate.</h4>\n<p>Email is fading in popularity with visuals and connections replacing it. More than 60% of Gen Z and Millennials said they would collaborate more if it&#8217;s done visually.</p>\n<h4>One of two office workers, regardless of generation said they would collaborate more if done visually.</h4>\n<p>This isn’t hard to see, we live in a visual world where video conferencing is the standard, Instagram fills our lunch breaks, and TikTok fills Gen Z’s weekend and night time.</p>\n<p>Visuals are the key to the future of collaboration, businesses that can harness the following tips will have a leg up to the next generation.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-165936\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/unnamed.jpg 512w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/unnamed-300x168.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/unnamed-260x145.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></p>\n<h2><b>How to join the modern workplace</b></h2>\n<p>With all of the focus on improving business, expanding omnichannel experiences, and keeping customers loyal, it can be easy to forget about employees. The old guard ways may not be enough to get the most out of future leadership.</p>\n<p>So what are some ways that businesses can incorporate the new collaborative and visual ways of the remote work future?</p>\n<h2><b>Change the culture</b></h2>\n<p>The time is now to put a culture in place to support remote work. For a startup, remote work may be how your entire company rolls. It can be a great way to save costs initially as you ramp up.</p>\n<p>If you are an enterprise company, you probably won’t be leaving the comforts of HQ for 10’s of thousands of employees. What you can do is support those who do choose to work remotely.</p>\n<p>Supporting those who wish to work remotely opens up the opportunity to recruit outside of your footprint and hire where the talent is vs. having to compete in a few areas.</p>\n<p>A culture shift could be something as simple as moving the standard meeting from a phone call to a video conference call or providing home office options for employees.</p>\n<h2><b>Lead by example</b></h2>\n<p>Transitioning to supporting a remote future of work starts from the top. Leaders can do this by doing All Hands over a video conferencing tool or providing recordings to all meetings that may happen when people aren’t able to attend.</p>\n<h4>The key to the modern workplace is for companies and leaders to find ways to embrace their potential future on their team.</h4>\n<p>Leading a remote team can be challenging. You need a focus on bringing your team together with common goals and a culture that supports your team not having spontaneous conversations throughout the day.</p>\n<h4>To be able to lead a remote team you need to try and put yourself in a remote mindset.</h4>\n<p>It could be beneficial to work remotely yourself a couple of times a week, or at least initially. It will help you to more fully understand the complexities that can come with not being next to your team, all day long.</p>\n<h2><b>Provide the tools</b></h2>\n<p>The modern workplace is remote, but also full of options for collaboration. There are many great tools to choose from to help enable your <a href=\"https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/remote-work-tools\">remote teams</a>.</p>\n<p>2019 was led by two tools growing in popularity in Slack and Zoom. Both of these collaboration tools became tech giants when they hit the stock market last year.</p>\n<p>They fit the mold of the modern worker by providing a visual live connection through Zoom or BlueJeans. The modern water cooler is Slack.</p>\n<p>Asana for task management, Air Table for calendar collaboration, and CloudApp for asynchronous communication with shareable screenshots, GIFs, and video make up the modern toolbox</p>\n<h2><b>Visual Communication</b></h2>\n<p>More than 60 percent of Gen Z said they would communicate more if done visually.</p>\n<p>Businesses who provide training and culture to support visual communication will thrive. The modern toolbox features a movement towards remote work.</p>\n<h4>One way to do this would be to have video conferencing as the standard.</h4>\n<p>For global enterprise-level companies, it can help to connect different satellite offices and remote workers better than a traditional phone call.</p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>High costs of living and long commutes in tech-centered areas have led to an increase in desires for remote work.</p>\n<p>As Millennials and Gen Z office workers begin to take leadership positions, these generational shifts will change the way we work.</p>\n<p>Businesses who enable remote work will have the ability to recruit globally and thrive outside the comforts of HQ.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/11/the-modern-workplace-may-come-with-a-couch-chips-and-netflix/\">The Modern Workplace May Come with a Couch, Chips, and Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:00:13 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Modern-Workplace-May-Come-with-a-Couch-Chips-and-Netflix.jpg","linkMd5":"8eaf958c13f09cfa549ca159d63b269c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-23-665_5434b11be4b9eb48.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Modern-Workplace-May-Come-with-a-Couch-Chips-and-Netflix.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1371,"sourceBytes":275383,"destBytes":189682,"author":"Joe Martin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Modern-Workplace-May-Come-with-a-Couch-Chips-and-Netflix-300x214.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-17-592_cf9b3c047075e5d8.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5d8cf864ace5c7997381160e_nCIhql515Tk58lds0ZGBd5Ve2vsfQgcn6IYO3nHAqfjZcOZMsgHmtNIBKEH8Gce-2PLp-1Ih2hSzjMqIqcfwegOZhXpHFUYDdC7KtCEvM4r22niinkY9iCDko4jufUVRZSmFEBRw.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-22-997_333696a9fe6ad0b3.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/unnamed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-13-280_fb224edaf627b5d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880843},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"IoT Hardware Product Development: How-To","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170291","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/06/iot-hardware-product-development-how-to/\" title=\"IoT Hardware Product Development: How-To\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IoT-Hardware-Product-Development-How-To-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"IoT hardware product development\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IoT-Hardware-Product-Development-How-To-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IoT-Hardware-Product-Development-How-To-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IoT-Hardware-Product-Development-How-To.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The number of connected devices increases day by day, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/how-ai-at-the-edge-other-iot-trends-are-transforming-every-industry/\">ubiquitous IoT adoption</a> provides more opportunities for hardware development. Of course, to outperform the Big Four (Amazon, Google, Samsung, Apple) and find your niche poses a significant challenge. Additionally, if you find a new use case for a next-level consumer gadget, you’d better prepare yourself for a long transformation of your idea into a viable product</p>\n<p>My aim is to help break the hardware development process into several phases and make sure each stage has been passed through.

Feasibility Study for Hardware Product Development</b></h2>\n<p>Hardware is a capital intensive industry. No matter how great your hardware startup idea is, you need to prove that it&#8217;s viable. Firstly, you need to check if the concept is technically feasible and has good potential market demand</p>\n<p>After you define the product’s core functionality and side features, compose a list of technical specifications. Checking local and international regulations in the early stages helps to avoid poor planning. For example, I heard of a case when an AI-powered app for kids encountered a 1-year production delay because they had to develop a solution from scratch to meet the requirements of the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act</p>\n<p>To assess the technical feasibility, the developers usually start with an evaluation of competing solutions. You can buy several popular products and disassemble them by yourself or check some of their teardowns online. Taking the time to tear-down and understand technical research should result in a datasheet of the main components and suppliers. Moreover, this is how you can evaluate popular devices by COGS (cost of goods sold). COGS is basically all costs spent on placing the device on the shelf: manufacturing, shipping, import/export tax, etc</p>\n<h4><b>Building Your MVPr</b></h4>\n<p>MVPr (minimum viable prototype) is your very first implementation of the product idea. The developers may spend several days to create the first prototype with basic functionality. It aims to confirm that the idea is valid and provide some certainty about its experience. Unlike MVP (minimum viable product) which should gather other users’ insights, it’s made mostly for internal assessment</p>\n<p>To create the MVPr for smart speakers, you can use commercially available modules or HDKs (hardware developer kits). Nowadays, tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Qualcomm and small companies provide HDKs. The HDKs ease the development process a lot. Developers gain access to the SDK (software development kit), test firmware, and sample applications in a bundle with the HDK</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_171721\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-171721\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-voice-service/dev-kits\"><img class=\"wp-image-171721 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits-900x328.png\" alt=\"HDK for hardware development\" width=\"900\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits-900x328.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits-300x109.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits-260x95.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits-1536x560.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DevKits.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-171721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-voice-service/dev-kits\">Intel Speech Enabling Dev Kit / DSP Group HDClear 3-Mic Development Kit</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>When you choose an HDK, you should consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target OS</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The target voice assistant that you plan to use: Amazon, Tmall Genie, Turing, JD, iFLYTEK, etc.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned specification of the device: processor frequency, architecture, number of microphones, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HDKs contain different numbers of microphones and are available in different price categories.</p>\n<h3><b>Marketing study </b></h3>\n<p>If the startup has drawn a multi-million dollar investment for its disruptive connected device, the product-market fit might not be there. Marketing managers pour lots of money into promoting the product. As a result, distribution channels notify you about sales growth. Meanwhile, once you slow down your activities, sales just stop, because customers don’t comprehend the value of your product</p>\n<h4>Market research helps you see the product idea from the user’s perspective.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should understand who your customers are, their social characteristics. During product development, the developers refer to these user personas while prototyping the design and UX</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main question is what value does the product provide? Which problem does it solve and how serious is this problem for your customer?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the unique features of the product? Which characteristics are crucial for the customer?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Competitive analysis is also important.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-171726 size-medium\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers-300x109.png\" alt=\"Speakers\" width=\"300\" height=\"109\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers-300x109.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers-900x328.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers-260x95.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers-1536x560.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/speakers.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis\">SWOT analysis</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_five_forces_analysis\">Porter’s Five Forces</a> model can serve as a starting point for more in-depth research. Besides strategic parameters such as brand positioning, pricing policy, market share, one should check the technical specifications of the top competitor products. By the way, it’s convenient to create a timetable with colored schemes to highlight the trends in hardware functionality</p>\n<h4>But, what happens to those ideas when they are turned into products?</h4>\n<h2>2. Patents in Hardware Development</h2>\n<p>Hardware startups should take care of design patents and utility patents as a top priority.</p>\n<p>Authenticity and aesthetics are valuable assets of every consumer device. Design patents aim to legally protect the unique visual features of the product. In contrast, utility patents guard the novelty of your engineering</p>\n<p>Patents are pricey and may cost up to $20 000. If you can’t file a full patent application, a “Provisional patent” might be your best bet. This application allows you to retain authorship for one year before filing a full application.

In fact, in order to create a truly high-quality and unique product, we recommend that you be patient. Take your time to develop a design language first.</p>\n<p><b>Why do you need a design language? </b></p>\n<p>Firstly, to create a unique, recognizable design that distinguishes your product from your competitors in the market.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it is very important to integrate the appearance of your device with the brand of the company. The design language for devices is similar to the brand book in digital design. Your product should be perceived as consistent with interfaces, mobile apps, and other components.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should set out the principles that will form the basis of industrial design for the entire line of devices.</p>\n<p><b>What does the design language include?</b></p>\n<p>1) The designers analyze existing products in the segment and hot trends in terms of their appearance and perception.</p>\n<p>2) Then they create moodboards that include: sketches, colors, physical materials, and regular pictures that form the general. mood of the future product.</p>\n<p>3) In the end, all the main distinguishing features, elements, and principles of the industrial design of devices should be described.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/apples-icons-have-that-shape-for-a-very-good-reason-720d4e7c8a14\">the corner radius of Apple’s products</a> is a fairly well-known design feature of their brand.</p>\n<h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Design &#38; Engineering of Consumer Electronics</strong></h2>\n<p>When creating devices, at each stage, the hardware development processes are divided into several parallel streams that are tightly interconnected.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170530\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170530\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-170530 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003-900x506.jpeg\" alt=\"Parallel Hardware Development Tracks\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003-900x506.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003-260x146.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.003.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Parallel Hardware Development Tracks                                   <em>   </em></strong><em>Image Credit: notAnotherOne.com</em><strong><br /></strong></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As for device development, this is the housing, PCB, and the huge stack of software; both the internal and external features of the device.

The project team makes several non-functional prototypes called mockups. They are often printed on a 3D printer or sometimes cut out using machine tools. Requirements for mockups differ. Sometimes dimensional mockups are made at a 1:1 scale. Sometimes a prototype should look like the real thing, for example, with a real display.</p>\n<p>After testing the mockups and their ergonomics, the team selects one of the designs for further work on ID<br />\nID isn’t only a study of all the external elements of the hardware product, it is also the layout of all internal components. For example, in smart speakers, such elements are the speakers, a microphone matrix, and possibly a display or battery – everything that affects the size and shape of the device.</p>\n<p>In the ID phase, the concept undergoes many changes. As an example, we include a photo that illustrates the evolution of the design of the YotaPhone, the first dual-screen smartphone with an E-ink display.</p>\n<p>For this device, the product team carried out more than 30 iterations of industrial design to put all necessary components into the device.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170534\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170534\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-170534 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001-900x563.jpeg\" alt=\"YotaPhone Development process.\" width=\"900\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001-900x563.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001-256x160.jpeg 256w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001-1536x960.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YotaPhone.001.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>YotaPhone Development process.                             </strong><em> Image Credit: notAnotherOne</em><strong><br /></strong></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3><strong>MD (mechanical structure design)</strong></h3>\n<p>The final phase to complete the flow of industrial design is MD (mechanical design or mechanical structure design). This phase undergoes development simultaneously with the start of production.</p>\n<p>MD is a more detailed version of ID. Mechanical engineers finalize stiffening ribs, analyze mold-flow simulations, develop concepts for future product assembly, work on cooling circuits. Later, they create a 3D model to make a mold. This process is called DFM (design for manufacturing). DFM results in the creation of a parametric 3D model of the product, ready for production.</p>\n<p>The DFM process has many stages from the creation of the first CNC prototypes to the last tooling iteration.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170537\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170537\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-170537 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001-900x506.png\" alt=\"Mechanical Design\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001-900x506.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001-300x169.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001-260x146.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MD-png.001.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170537\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Mechanical Design                                                                                                 </strong>     <em>Image Credit: notAnotherOne</em><strong><br /></strong></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3><strong>Parts manufacturing methods</strong></h3>\n<p>To create body parts, there are three main processes: stamping, casting (using molds or tooling) and cutting.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170538\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170538\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-170538 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004-900x506.jpeg\" alt=\"CNC Tooling Stamping / Manufacturing methods for hardware products\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004-900x506.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004-260x146.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-create.004.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170538\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Manufacturing methods for hardware products.                                                                        </strong> <em>Image Credit: notAnotherOne</em><strong><br /></strong></figcaption></figure></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Stamping</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stamping is the low-cost method of transforming metal sheets into different shapes while under pressure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Casting (using molds or tooling)</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Casting is the process when molten plastic is injected into huge molds while under high pressure. After the plastic has taken shape, the parts get removed. The manufacturing of an industrial (solid) mold takes 30 to 50 days. On top of that, it is quite expensive. At the same time, the unit cost of the manufactured parts is low.</p>\n<h5><strong>What do molds look like? </strong></h5>\n<p>There are soft tooling and hard tooling molds.</p>\n<p>Silicone or soft metals, such as aluminum are the main materials for soft molding. You can use them for a small number of parts, for example, for a trial. The service life of an aluminum mold is from a few hundred to a thousand sets.</p>\n<p>Solid molds made of steel can achieve high dimensional accuracy of parts during casting. You can work with any type of plastic, as such molds can withstand high temperatures. By the way, this is the most popular method for manufacturing consumer devices.</p>\n<p>Here is some advice – don’t pay the full cost of the molds. The common practice is a 30 &#8211; 50% advance payment when ordering a mold. Then you can pay the remaining balance after accepting the finished form and carefully checking the details produced with it.</p>\n<p>It is better to sign a contract with a tooling house directly, rather than through a factory that will carry out mass production. This way you will retain ownership for tooling. In the future, this will allow you to change or duplicate the factory without changing the tooling manufacturer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Cutting</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cutting (CNC), in contrast, doesn&#8217;t require investment in the mold, but the cost of the part is very high. As a rule, cutting is used for small or very complex parts that are not amenable to the above production methods.</p>\n<h3><strong>PCBs</strong></h3>\n<p>To match the PCB layout with the mechanical design of the device, design engineers and electronics engineers work together</p>\n<p>Below you see a possible evolution of a circuit board. Often, the first prototypes are assembled utilizing development kits (demonstration kits). Therefore, such demo boards with extra wiring would not correspond to the dimensions of the housing you need. According to the MD requirements, an electrical engineer adjusts the size of the board to the dimensions of the housing and the location of internal elements, such as connectors and LEDs. This may take several iterations</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170584\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170584\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-170584 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008-900x394.jpg\" alt=\"Example of board evolution\" width=\"900\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008-900x394.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008-300x131.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008-260x114.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008-1536x672.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VC.008.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Example of board evolution.  </strong>                                                                                              Credit: notAnotherOne</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h2><strong>5.

well-known companies is quite a challenge. Yet, not for those who know the market rules and turn them into their advantage. If you’ve founded a startup and aren’t quite sure how to make a way among your renowned competitors, you’ve got to the right article. There’s something you can do. Let&#8217;s take a look at how startups can compete with big companies.</p>\n<h2>Create strong positioning</h2>\n<p>So why should customers choose your brand? Understand what you offer and who you offer it to. If you don’t see what is so special about you, believe me, your clients won’t see either.</p>\n<p>What you really need is a precise and catching positioning. It can be challenging for a small company, but here are some practical tips to start with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Study your clients.</b> Make short interviews with your clients. Outline your Ideal Customer Profile. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/a-startup-guide-to-creating-an-ideal-customer-profile/\">a simple guide</a> to help you move with it. You need to understand what made them choose you over the big guy. Gather all the answers into one pool and outline your strong sides.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Learn your competitors.</b> Conduct research of your 10-15 nearest competitors. Examine everything they offer: their services, USPs, clients’ reviews (don’t forget about negative ones, you can overrun them here). Think about your niche. It can be either wide or super narrow. Our reality creates new opportunities for new niches. You always can try to make the most of the situation. In the wake of Coronavirus, there are also new directions and niches to jump in. Just dig through some recent trends, statistics, or <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/12/new-niches-for-startups-created-by-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">articles</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Word your USP</b>. Having analyzed your competitors and clients, create a unique and most appealing product offer. It shouldn’t be written on 5 pages, rather short and precise.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Brainstorm ideas</b> with your team ― there is no need to invent a bicycle again, just find a new way to ride it. If you feel that you need external expertise, outsource a marketing expert or business analyst to help you create a strong positioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Use great storytelling</b></h2>\n<p>When you compete with big brands, good storytelling is essential. Tell stories that impress, charm, and win your customers. Stand out with creativity and a nice brand story. Here’s some inspiration from startups that have done it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s look at the <a href=\"https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/\">Dollar Shave Club</a> ― a company that delivers razors and other personal grooming products to customers by mail. They’ve used the power of storytelling to create an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI\">ad</a> that got over 26M views. The startup got more than 12,000 orders in the first 48 hours.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another case is the <a href=\"https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/\">Death Wish Coffee</a> company. It uses great storytelling on its website to stand out in a very busy coffee business niche. Just imagine, how can a startup distinguish itself in the coffee industry? But they did it.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/?SID=0d80db99c6adccd701b00ae48896a33e\">Saddleback Leather Co.</a> developed a great legend behind its brand with a 100-year warranty. Just look at their slogan ‘They fight for it when you are dead’. The company sells all sorts of leather goods, including a reusable toilet roll for $1,000,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be convincing. You have to be 100% in love with what you’re doing to make others love it, too. Tell your story with passion, advertise your products with enthusiasm, be proud of what you offer. It’s not only important to attract customers but also to engage investors in supporting your business. Although there are tons of various &#8220;investor hunting&#8221; guides (fulcrum dot rocks) useful and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/20/how-to-choose-a-startup-investment/\">explicit articles</a>, communication is still the most effective instrument.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173329 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718-900x593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718-900x593.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718-300x198.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718-243x160.jpg 243w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notebook-writing-pencil-start-45718.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Go mobile</h2>\n<p>Everybody is going mobile. It’s a fact. Small companies need to adopt newer technologies faster than the big guys. So, catch the trends. Develop a fault-tolerant, smart, new mobile or a web app. Make it as fun and interactive as you can. Don’t overthink it but use the popularity of mobile apps for your benefit. Think through the features your app needs to impress the clients, calculate approximate costs, start developing it.</p>\n<p>How can a startup compete with big companies through an app? Huh, in many ways. After all, it depends greatly on your niche. A really good app enables you to provide extraordinary customer service. It allows you to communicate with your clients and turn them into brand advocates. Finally, a popular app can always bring you additional money through advertising and cooperation models.</p>\n<p>Your app shouldn’t be generic. You can add crazy filters, animations, Easter eggs ― anything to make yourself stand out from the staid and boring big companies who are too scared to be creative. It’s a win-win solution.</p>\n<h2>Be an underdog. It’s cool</h2>\n<p>We watch movies about underdogs all the time. Everyone roots for little guys. For instance, Rudy, Forest Gump, and the Karate Kid have had us digging deep for the unexpected hero, the one who punches above their weight. In the modern world, underdogs rule.</p>\n<p>Thus, <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-consumer-appeal-of-underdog-branding\">Harvard Business School</a> even offers two key factors which help underdogs to win:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>A position that looks like you’re at a disadvantage.</b> As to the study, this seemingly disadvantaged position in the marketplace is critical for business growth ― people do want the underdog to succeed.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Showing your passion and determination.</b> Being more determined than others about your goals, not giving up, and hitting obstacles along the way gives people hope and shows that success is still possible in a challenging environment. That’s why they are more likely to choose an underdog over a big player who had it all way easier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What’s more, <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-consumer-appeal-of-underdog-branding\">Harvard Business School</a> has created a series of studies that have tested how effective an underdog biography can be for a business to increase purchase intention as well as brand loyalty. So, take a look and catch some inspiration from there.</p>\n<h2><b>Go extra mile</b><b> </b></h2>\n<p>Offer your clients extra in everything you do: your product, your customer service, etc. When clients feel that you care about them, they will not just return to you, they will recommend you to others.</p>\n<p>Here are some simple and quite obvious tips on how to compete with big brands through your service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always attend to your customers quickly. Set up a quick auto-response for the customers’ inquiries or make sure to hire a 24/7 customer support specialist.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make regular audits to check the quality of your products and services. You can use the help of your already existing clients. Make a short query asking them what they like and don’t like about your startup. By this, you will do both: find out your gaps and show the customers that you care.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet and exceed your promises. Set up high-quality service standards and define your added values. Added Value means something extra to add to your product or service. Study what your clients have to say ― what is the thing they like the most.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173330 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340-900x675.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340-900x675.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/turned-on-pendant-lamp-132340.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></h2>\n<h2>Establish a strong Content Marketing strategy</h2>\n<p>Whatever online strategy you use, your Content Marketing is going to have an impact on every other part of your plan. It’s possibly one of the most important pillars of your Marketing.</p>\n<p>Start building your strong content marketing strategy, make sure that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a well-planned SEO strategy to get high Google rankings for the customers you want. If your keywords are too competitive, try to use longer ones (LSI Keywords). Here’s a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy?_ga=2.74571604.759571702.1590518345-1568658794.1590518345\">9-step guide</a> to help you with building the right SEO strategy.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of the power of Google Ads to increase your audience. PPC (Pay per Click) campaigns are a good way to raise awareness about your startup as well as to attract potential customers.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t underestimate social media. Nowadays it’s a good tool to promote your business. So, harness your social media marketing to engage more customers and develop your brand awareness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having good content marketing can be a relatively cheap way to market your brand, but it’s essential for startups because it’s a way to show off your expertise and become an authoritative voice in your industry. In general, digital marketing should not be underestimated before. Not it is becoming one of the strongest sides of your overall marketing strategy. To understand why so, make sure to read this <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/what-is-digital-marketing-and-why-is-it-important-for-startups/\">brief yet informative piece</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Competing with big brands isn’t an easy task, but it makes the game all the more interesting! After all, famous brands don’t have your creativity, your bold ideas and courage.</p>\n<p>The success of your business is in your hands, not sitting in the clutches of your biggest competitors.</p>\n<p>So, here’s just one more reminder of things you need to get done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on strong positioning of your startup</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attract everyone’s attention with your storytelling</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in a fault-tolerant, mobile/web app</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go extra mile for your clients</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My best advice for you is this: Don’t second guess.

Since we no longer have the benefit of nudging the person sitting next to us and seeking help, we need to ensure that help is available when needed. Improving our documentation and making it discoverable is one of the best ways to make this happen. I encourage my teams to create new documentation as much as possible and update the existing ones. This has allowed us to ensure smooth onboarding of new hires, properly manage projects and project status, consistently document and update tribal knowledge, run efficient processes, and more without the luxury of nudging your neighbor.”<br />\n</span><b>– Himanshu Gahlot</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are many things that I take advantage of in order to stay up-to-date with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engineering trends. It’s about having a mindset of learning and constantly improving. I’ve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found that when you have that attitude, your brain automatically picks up </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">information when you least expect it. For example, when browsing LinkedIn for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potential candidates or scrolling through Twitter, I might come across an article on tech or process </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improvement or notice what the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people I follow are liking or retweeting.

To that effect, I have been collaborating with other engineering leaders in the company to organize virtual outings (e.g. GoGame virtual game), virtual happy hours, making meetings more fun and useful for the team by altering meeting agendas to include topics that interest the team, and so on. I think these are some of the most worthwhile investments I have made professionally, which are already showing positive outcomes in the form of improved team health and vibe as measured by regular team surveys and feedback.”<br />\n</span><b>– Himanshu Gahlot</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Home Partners is driven extensively by social interaction and networking between employees.  With social distancing and the complete work from home roll-out, our company took several steps to ensure continuity of such culture:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several virtual clubs were created on Microsoft Teams for people to share their off-work activities during quarantine.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, there&#8217;s a company-wide email sent out called &#8220;Daily Dose&#8221; with internet memes and other satirical pictures/videos on the current situation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of the company-wide all hands were canceled; all of them regularly happened virtually.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company continued to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other milestone events for employees once a month virtually.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individual groups organized virtual happy hours and social connecting events like game evenings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the absence of face-to-face connection, the number of meetings and stand-ups went up in order to over-communicate daily work activities.”<br />\n</span><b>– Anshul Agarwal</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a distributed team that’s spread out across the world, including Uruguay, Philippines, and Egypt, which comes with added challenges when not everyone has met each other in person. When we first started our virtual weekly coffee hour, the turn out wasn’t great. Then we assigned someone to plan a few questions and games for each session, which helped everyone to open up. Now people volunteer to help with any planning, and it’s something everyone looks forward to every week. The company can plan structured events first, and if employees enjoy it, they’ll want to keep it going themselves.”<br />\n</span><b>– Dan Zhou</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe that company culture is a set of beliefs and behaviors that we embody </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every single day. In that regard, nothing’s changed. However, we’re communicating </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and collaborating a lot more across the board to make sure that we’re upholding </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our values consistently. We host virtual happy hours within the company regularly. We’re also trying out virtual events via </span><a href=\"https://www.offsyte.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offsyte.co</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”<br />\n</span><b>– Nimish Parmar</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Although our company structure adopted remote working long before quarantine, we would usually have in-person team dinners, outings and gatherings to bring everyone together and allow human connection. During quarantine, Biscuit &#38; Chai is maintaining this by having the occasional team lunch delivered to everyone with a zoom meetup where we all take a break and just talk about fun things, creating slack channels to share fun memes and/or just talk about hobbies, interests, ideas and support, and we are even planning a group virtual karaoke.”<br />\n</span><b>– Arjun Srivastava</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We try to have video chats to mimic face to face conversations very often, as well as doing group activities like physical exercises over a video call. The tech team is usually on group calls from morning to evening to mimic the environment of the office. This isn&#8217;t a must or only to discuss work but also to joke with each other and have random conversations like we usually would have in the office.”<br />\n</span><b>– Kushal Patel</b></p>\n<h2><b>Installing feedback loops for continuous improvement</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8220;As an engineering leader, it is very important for me to gather feedback from my team on how they are feeling about their work, peers, manager, etc. With the transition to fully remote work, it has become a bit difficult for managers to understand the vibe in the team because you may not get to meet with your team members outside of explicit meetings. We no longer have hallway conversations and there are no morning greetings or team lunches or coffee breaks or one-off conversations. Chat/text based conversations are often not enough to understand the true feelings and may lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, a manager needs better ways to understand the general vibe in the team. I have started relying, now more than ever, on team surveys, feedback, and sprint retrospectives to understand my teams&#8217; health and take proactive actions on issues reported by the team. While team surveys and sprint retrospectives have always been part of my management strategy, my reliance on them have increased a lot more in this transition to fully remote work. I use </span><a href=\"http://officevibe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officevibe.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.retrospect.team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retrospect.team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for team surveys/feedback and sprint retrospectives, respectively.&#8221;<br />\n</span><b>– Himanshu Gahlot</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best investments I&#8217;ve made for my team during quarantine is to allow them more time for their personal and professional growth. I rolled out a growth plan program for my team where I conducted individual sessions with my reports to understand their growth needs, chart out a plan of activities they&#8217;d like to pursue, and plan how they could accelerate some of the growth items during quarantine with additional time available. My team, while delivering on the business requests and regular project work, is now also able to focus on skill development personally driven by them.”<br />\n</span><b>– Anshul Agarwal</b></p>\n<h2><b>Advice for developers looking for jobs during the pandemic</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the most important skills that companies seek in software engineering candidates is their algorithmic and coding ability. Job seekers should continue to refine this skill. This can be achieved in various ways, including but not limited to, enrolling in relevant online courses, sharpening their coding skills through </span><a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeetCode</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/</span><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-your-dream-job-with-amazon-sde-test-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GeekForGeeks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, learning skills which are most relevant for today&#8217;s job market by enrolling in online bootcamps like </span><a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lambda School</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, reading relevant books, and so on.”<br />\n</span><b>– Himanshu Gahlot</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the challenges about being furloughed is that you may be faced with the uncertainty of not knowing when your company will bring you back. Everyone’s situation is unique, and some people have immediate responsibilities and need to prioritize finding a new job. But if you have the financial runway, this could be the time to do something you’ve always wanted to do. I have friends and colleagues who are taking online classes with the goal of making a career transition, going back to school for a graduate degree, or even considering starting their own businesses. The opportunity cost has never been lower to try something new.”<br />\n</span><b>– Dan Zhou</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Jobs may not be as easy to come by, so keep yourself occupied and if a job does come your way, do not let the opportunity pass you by, especially if you need to keep yourself moving. Learn a new technology and keep yourself up to date with the latest trends. Also, do what you are passionate about and keep yourself busy, so that you don&#8217;t end up with more mental stress. It might also make sense to look for remote opportunities to keep yourself going.”<br />\n</span><b>– Kushal Patel</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no sugarcoating it. Getting let go, laid off or furloughed sucks. A lot! So I’m </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">going to stay away from cliches and keep it real. These are unprecedented times, but at the same time, if you’re an engineer, you have everything it takes to succeed. There might be many reasons for not being fully employed right now, but there’s a high probability that most of them have nothing to do with you or your capabilities. The whole world has been turned upside down. Companies and businesses have to rethink their entire business models. There are countless articles out there to help you prepare, but here are some practical tips from me:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start reaching out to your network immediately, if you haven’t done so already. Reach out to every single person you think could even remotely help you in any way possible. You might have helped others throughout your career, but this is the time to reach out and ask for help.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post on LinkedIn and other social media platforms if you’ve been furloughed. You’ll be surprised at how many people are willing to help you. Random strangers might pass along your profile to someone who might be able to help you in the most unexpected way. Don’t underestimate the network effect. People are a lot more willing to help these days, and every single view/comment/message helps.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice your interviewing skills. That means not just brushing up on algorithms, data structures and other relevant technical topics, but being fully prepared for all aspects of a technical interview. As a hiring manager, I strongly value drive, hunger and passion for delivering results, a collaborative mindset, clear and concise communication skills and friendly personality. Non-technical skills matter more than you think. Technical skills might be easier to acquire, but acquiring soft skills might be much more difficult.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interview, interview and interview. The more interviews you do, the higher your chances of landing a new career that fits your criteria. Learn from each interview and improve. Put the classic Agile iterative process in action.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, have a positive mindset. Engineering skills are very much in demand. Hiring top notch talent is still challenging for companies and you can use that to your advantage.”<br />\n</span><b>– Nimish Parmar</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Predictions about the future of hiring</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since many companies are going fully remote and most others are planning to provide this as a recommended option going forward, software engineering processes need to adjust themselves to become better compliant with remote work. A few companies like Gitlab and Basecamp have been operating as fully remote companies. They have published extensive </span><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how working remotely can be made really efficient. I think, going forward, more companies will start adopting the best practices outlined by these companies. There is still a lot to be seen and learned in this new way of working which will be uncovered when different kinds of companies (e.g. differently sized, different kinds of products, mobile development and testing vs. simple web based products, etc.) start figuring out best practices of remote work that suit them. Fortunately, software engineering is one of the most suitable jobs for remote work, so it would be interesting to see how it tries to achieve the same or better level of productivity as the pre-remote era.”<br />\n</span><b>– Himanshu Gahlot</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic has proved that technology can keep businesses going even if people are not physically present in their place of work; also, that many sectors and verticals can adopt technology to progress. Thus, the demand for software engineering is going to skyrocket, and remote working will definitely become a more prominent practice. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face-to-face interviews have been replaced with assessment tools leading the process, followed by a video chat to formalize the process. The need for assessment and psychometric tests have become even more important now and are in high demand.”<br />\n</span><b>– Kushal Patel</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The biggest change will obviously be in how teams collaborate. Humans have a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tremendous ability to adapt. I wasn’t a huge fan of working from home pre-COVID, but after being </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pretty much forced into working remotely, I feel like we at Friendbuy have adapted </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quite well. Besides the Zoom fatigue towards the end of the day, it’s been quite </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effective.

Lately, however, it’s a new labor model that has been drawing jealous stares from other sectors. </p>\n<p>Upending how manufacturers get work done are platforms like <a href=\"http://myworkchoice.com\">MyWorkChoice</a>, an hourly workforce management platform. MyWorkChoice uses smart matching technology to build custom communities, onboarded according to each client’s specifications. </p>\n<p>By letting workers choose their shifts, MyWorkChoice cuts manufacturers’ absenteeism rates from around 35 percent to just 3 percent. For plant output, managers’ stress levels, and company culture, that’s a night-and-day difference. </p>\n<p>The question: Could MyWorkChoice’s model work for other industries? Maybe so — but only if they can fit two puzzle pieces that, frustratingly, never seem to go together: flexibility and dependability.</p>\n<h2><strong>Engineered for Flexibility</strong></h2>\n<p>For years, many white-collar workers have enjoyed the flexibility to work when and where they want. Until recently, however, blue-collar sectors like manufacturing have pigeonholed workers into 40-hour-per-week arrangements. </p>\n<p>Understandably, blue-collar workers want those same freedoms. What broke the dam, according to MyWorkChoice CEO Tana Greene, is the coronavirus pandemic. </p>\n<p>“The traditional staffing agency model is dead,” <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/myworkchoice-connects-essential-supply-chain-companies-to-healthy-workers-amid-covid-19-pandemic-301041075.html?tc=eml_cleartime\">explains Greene</a>. “Prior to the pandemic, flexibility was supporting both workers and companies who needed to scale their workforce at any given time; today it’s a critical piece of the puzzle to keep our supply chain moving and put healthy people to work.”</p>\n<p>Instead of requiring a rigid schedule, MyWorkChoice lets the company’s regular workforce sign up for four-hour blocks on the days they choose. Many opt to work a full 40 hours per week, producing a dependable primary workforce. </p>\n<p>Workers understand that MyWorkChoice isn’t just another day-labor app, nor is it a split-shift system. They stick with it because of its flexibility, enabling the companies they serve to build tenured hourly teams.</p>\n<p>Could sectors outside of manufacturing make that model work? Sure, Greene says: MyWorkChoice has applied it to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/402762105/6072969eed\">call centers</a>, distribution centers, and more. But before they make the leap, they need to solve for the second part of the equation: dependability. </p>\n<h2><strong>Solved with Scale</strong></h2>\n<p>Shorter shifts are a big reason why MyWorkChoice delivers workers reliably. But there’s a second factor that, for industries looking to follow the manufacturing sector’s lead, may be more difficult to replicate: scale.</p>\n<p>Largely because of the flexibility it offers workers, MyWorkChoice is the largest recruiter in most markets it operates in. That ensures it has the bench strength to make the model work, covering gaps in a company’s regular workforce. Access to a larger, scalable workforce creates a secondary line of defense while eliminating the need for overtime.</p>\n<p>A larger labor pool, combined with shorter shifts, lets employers accommodate all sorts of life situations. The result is MyWorkChoice’s third talent stream: nontraditional workforce segments, such as seniors and college students, who wouldn’t otherwise look for manufacturing work. </p>\n<p>Many of these MyWorkChoice workers have responsibilities outside the platform that would make it tough to work longer shifts. Its model makes tough-to-fill times less onerous. For example, the second shift is typically the most difficult to fill, but when flexible four-hour slots are made available, stay-at-home parents and second incomers flock to this shift, making it one of the most coveted on the platform.   </p>\n<p>In the industries MyWorkChoice operates in — manufacturing, call centers, and warehousing — that three-pronged approach proves flexibility works. In more niche ones, it may not.</p>\n<p>Take surveying. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/surveyors.htm\">fewer than 50,000 surveyors</a> in the entire U.S. Because it’s a specialized field, no amount of flexibility could help employers build secondary and tertiary teams. In all but the largest of labor markets, there simply aren’t enough surveyors to go around.</p>\n<h2><strong>Making Flexible Work Work</strong></h2>\n<p>Plenty of industries struggle to fill open positions, despite the economic downturn. Plenty of workers in them want flexibility. So what can employers in other sectors do to marry the two?</p>\n<p>One option is to transition hourly workers to an employer-of-record model. Because MyWorkChoice is the employer of record, it handles worker’s compensation, unemployment claims, and other back-office matters that employers otherwise have to deal with. </p>\n<p>The other option is to bring new demographic groups into the fold. Look for ways to increase flexibility: If possible in your industry, consider making work-from-home options permanent. If not, perhaps you could give workers more choice over their hours. </p>\n<p>The final ingredient? Client service. MyWorkChoice provides regional managers to its clients, ensuring that workers are happy, safe, and getting the job done. </p>\n<p>Without someone on the ground who knows the rules, no amount of software can make workforce management a hands-off process in industries like manufacturing. Technology can make matches, but it takes a human being to make sure those matches actually work out. </p>\n<p>Great client service exists in every industry, as do flexibility and reliable workforces. In manufacturing, what MyWorkChoice has done is put them together in a lasting, harmonious way. Whether that can be done in every industry, however, is a challenge waiting to be conquered.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/15/can-other-industries-replicate-myworkchoices-manufacturing-overhaul/\">Can Other Industries Replicate MyWorkChoice’s Manufacturing Overhaul?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 14:01:03 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-10.09.02-AM-266x300.png","linkMd5":"c2733ca40397dda7730da449ec15f7fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn51@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-07-809_53f48a0fe5e4ed08.webp","destWidth":266,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":134054,"destBytes":17516,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-10.09.02-AM-266x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn51@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-07-809_53f48a0fe5e4ed08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874872},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"The New Customer Buying Experience in a Post-COVID-19 World","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173688","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/13/the-new-customer-buying-experience-in-a-post-covid-19-world/\" title=\"The New Customer Buying Experience in a Post-COVID-19 World\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"customer buying post covid\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>COVID-19 has accelerated the move to digital, and forced buyers’ hands to fully embrace and adopt e-commerce.</p>\n<p>Research from Adobe’s latest Digital Economy Index shows that <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/online-shopping-during-covid-19-exceeds-2019-holiday-season-levels/\">online shopping during COVID-19</a> has exceeded 2019 holiday season levels and online spend for April and May is $52 billion more than what retailers typically see during those months.</p>\n<h3>E-commerce has just aged three years in the span of three months.</h3>\n<p>The substantial increase in e-commerce transactions has put unprecedented strains and pressures on retail operations and systems. And things aren’t going to go back to “the way they were” either.  In fact, most Americans are still skittish about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/mall-shoppers-are-scared-to-return-when-u-s-stores-finally-open\">visiting stores and malls</a>, according to a First Insights survey.</p>\n<h4>Retailers</h4>\n<p>For retailers, this means strategy overhauls of how they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/brands-flock-to-voice-search-as-2020-goes-contactless/\">sell both online and, in their brick and mortar locations</a>. We’re already seeing merchants, both big and small, think out of the box as they digitize their customer interactions and become more experiential.</p>\n<p>There are companies that are ahead of the game, going all in on digital even before the pandemic. Below, we take a look at some of their shrewd ideas and how these may become industry standards post COVID-19.</p>\n<h4><strong>Rethinking Brick and Mortar</strong></h4>\n<p>Given current conditions, we will likely see many brands rethinking the purpose of their brick and mortar locations. There are already first movers in this space, where their storefront is more about telling the brand story, while the actual transactions take place online.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has taught people that in most cases, buying online can be better, faster, easier, more convenient, and safer. Retailers must make their in-store location worth the trip.</p>\n<h4>Tesla</h4>\n<p>Back in 2019 Tesla made the controversial decision to stop selling its vehicles in showrooms, moving all sales to an online-only model. Their showrooms are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnFvXwpm2To\">experience centers</a>, not sales centers.</p>\n<p>If you want to buy a Tesla in a showroom, you can, but it’s a DIY process. You have to pull out your mobile phone, pull up the Tesla website, and order the car. There’s no pushy sales staff who take your order for you.</p>\n<p>Instead, the staff are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/22/how-to-turn-your-buyers-into-brand-believers/\">brand ambassadors</a>, there to help you fall in love with the company and its cars.</p>\n<h4>Focus on direct-to-consumer&#8217;s</h4>\n<p>On a recent earnings call, Jonathan Sinclair, CFO of Canada Goose, explained that the company would be pivoting to focus more on its <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/paving-the-way-3-industries-ripe-for-post-pandemic-change/\">direct-to-consumer</a> (D2C) business, both through e-commerce and its own <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/04/canada-gooses-new-toronto-store-has-a-daily-snowstorm.html\">branded experience centers</a>.</p>\n<p>In its flagship Toronto store, there are no products for sale. Instead, consumers get a multi-sensory experience to “feel” why the company’s parkas are worth the hefty price-tag, which is often upwards of $1,000 for a coat.</p>\n<p>Canada Goose also intends to reduce its reliance on wholesale and retail distribution channels going forward.</p>\n<h3><strong>Online-Only Sales Model</strong></h3>\n<p>In some cases, expect companies to close their physical stores altogether and continue business solely online.</p>\n<p>Bose, which in January announced that it would be shutting all of its stores in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia, definitely saw the writing on the wall even before COVID-19 hit the United States.</p>\n<p>The retailer decided that it would continue its business online only, and when you think about it, no one really needs to try on noise canceling headphones or test speakers in a store.</p>\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/16/8-key-components-to-building-a-successful-business-online/\">consumers trust online reviews</a> and content more than they do a sales pitch from an associate. It was time for a radical new idea from Bose.</p>\n<h4>Microsoft</h4>\n<p>In a surprise move, Microsoft also just announced they will permanently close all of the 83 their retail stores and shift to a 100% digital retail model.</p>\n<p>The firm is not planning to furlough any of their associates, instead inviting them to take new roles helping customers on their website through video and chat experiences.</p>\n<h4>Zara</h4>\n<p>Looking at some of the recent earnings calls from big retailers, they have seen a seismic shift in their business model. E-commerce has been the survival pill during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>For example, online sales were up 50 percent year over year in Q2 for Zara, and in April alone, its e-commerce sales were up 95 percent. In response, Zara has now updated its online sales growth forecast.</p>\n<p>In 2019, just 14 percent of its revenue came from digital. By 2022, Zara expects e-commerce to account for 25 percent of all the revenues.</p>\n<h3><strong>A Focus on Building Community</strong></h3>\n<p>It’s no longer just about the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/how-to-turn-your-sales-to-absolutely-what-you-want/\">sales support</a> you get while you&#8217;re buying the product, or the service and help you get once you own it. It’s about the end-to-end customer experience.</p>\n<p>After more than three months of the pandemic, many companies are realizing continued success will be just as much about how people perceive and engage with the brand. The experience starts from that first engagement, continues through to purchase—and beyond.</p>\n<p>We’ll see a lot more <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/5-product-discovery-tips-for-building-solutions-customers-will-buy/\">brand-affinity</a> building from retailers, such as community initiatives that customers feel aligned to, and that may give them a voice.</p>\n<h4>Many examples of online communities</h4>\n<p>There’s no better example of this than what Calvin McDonald, the CEO of Lululemon, talked about in June during the company’s 2020 future earnings call.</p>\n<p>During the early days of the pandemic, Lululemon launched an online community where customers could congregate to share their stories, experiences, and continue to do yoga together in a virtual manner.</p>\n<p>Lululemon also built a new chat program, its digital educator service. Using FaceTime and Zoom, customers can book appointments with “store associates” for a virtual video chat about yoga wear that’s right for them.</p>\n<p>Lululemon has essentially taken what was happening in the physical store and digitalized it.</p>\n<h3><strong>It’s Not What’s Coming, It’s What’s Here in Buying<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>The future of digital in retail is actually here now.</p>\n<p>As it’s said, “necessity is the mother of all invention,” and this is what we’ve seen because of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we will see negative repercussions some businesses have faced in light of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>We will also see some really inspirational stories around resilience over the next couple of months, and how thinking outside of the box and digital-first, can future-proof a brand.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Adobe Stock</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/13/the-new-customer-buying-experience-in-a-post-covid-19-world/\">The New Customer Buying Experience in a Post-COVID-19 World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 21:01:01 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID.jpeg","linkMd5":"6c1cff5aadf167000719762fda84ced6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-26-135_9e3d9f57587253e6.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":46912,"destBytes":39228,"author":"Peter Sheldon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-New-Customer-Buying-Experience-in-a-Post-COVID-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-28-287_c55af2f0bdee1267.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195868619},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"PandaDoc Raises $30M to Lead a Paradigm Shift in eSignature Market","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175621","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/10/pandadoc-raises-30m-to-lead-a-paradigm-shift-in-esignature-market/\" title=\"PandaDoc Raises $30M to Lead a Paradigm Shift in eSignature Market\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PandaDoc-Raises-30M-to-Lead-a-Paradigm-Shift-in-eSignature-Market-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"PandaDoc Raises $30 Million\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PandaDoc-Raises-30M-to-Lead-a-Paradigm-Shift-in-eSignature-Market-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PandaDoc-Raises-30M-to-Lead-a-Paradigm-Shift-in-eSignature-Market-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PandaDoc-Raises-30M-to-Lead-a-Paradigm-Shift-in-eSignature-Market-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PandaDoc-Raises-30M-to-Lead-a-Paradigm-Shift-in-eSignature-Market.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The eSignature industry’s pioneers have been selling &#8211; more or less &#8211; the same product for almost 20 years. The basic functionality is the same across a growing number of vendors, and the service usually comes at a high cost for unlimited business use.</p>\n<p>Still, the industry has enjoyed continued growth as part of a more substantial shift toward digital transformation, making way for significant acquisitions and IPOs and further market saturation.</p>\n<p>As electronic signatures have increased in popularity, they’ve become the gold standard for getting a deal done. But, an urgency in today’s post-COVID world displays that a paradigm shift is well in order.</p>\n<h3><strong>The $25B+ electronic signature market is due for a shakeup</strong></h3>\n<p>As the pandemic continues to change our everyday lives and the way we conduct business, it’s becoming increasingly important to find all-in-one solutions that deliver on the workflow needs for remote teams, helping them continue working effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Adaptability and competence are in contrast to the limited capabilities provided by the traditional, singular use of eSignatures solution.</p>\n<p>The document automation solution company &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.pandadoc.com\">PandaDoc</a> &#8211; is working to change how businesses think about their eSignature solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong> eSignature Disruption</strong></h3>\n<p>Making this innovation possible, the company just received $30 million in a Series B extension led by new investors One Peak and participation from returning investors, Microsoft&#8217;s Venture Fund (M12), Savano Capital Partners, Rembrandt Venture Partners, and EBRD Venture Capital Investment Programme.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneur, investor, and former RingCentral COO, David Sipes, also participated as an investor in this round and will join the PandaDoc Board of Directors.</p>\n<h2><b>PandaDoc is all you need for document automation </b></h2>\n<p>PandaDoc has an all-in-one <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/01/25/startup-business-global-expansion/\">document automation software that streamlines the process</a> of creating, approving, and eSigning proposals, quotes, and contracts – and their eSign plan is <i>free</i>.</p>\n<p>“Electronic signatures are important &#8212; they are the final part of closing a deal and today, eSignatures are helping to keep businesses running while we all social distance. That’s why electronic signatures have always been a part of our DNA and why we felt strongly at the start of the pandemic that businesses needed a free solution,” said Mikita Mikado, PandaDoc CEO and Co-Founder.</p>\n<p>“But, eSigning is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you adopt eSignatures, you quickly realize it’s not enough &#8212; you need to automate the generation of these documents, you need to edit them, you need to streamline and track approval workflows, and more. These solutions are where PandaDoc shines.”</p>\n<h3><b> PandaDoc’s Free eSign plan</b></h3>\n<p>Launched in March, PandaDoc’s Free eSign plan is a forever free product that allows customers to upload, send, and collect signatures on an unlimited number of documents for an unlimited number of users. To date, the plan has seen new sign-ups in the tens of thousands and product usage at twice the average rate.</p>\n<p>As free eSign users become familiar with PandaDoc, they often discover a need for broader document automation capabilities, which is where the company’s paid plans fit. While adoption of their product has made them a leader in the eSignature market, it’s helped to propel PandaDoc beyond 20,000 paying customers.</p>\n<p>“Electronic signatures are now at the tipping point where it should be expected as part of a broader solution, and not a separate add on. A solution that supports a deal before, during, and after the signature with document workflows, insights, speed, and the end-user experience,” added Mikado. “We’re finding that the market agrees.

However, the company believes this shift in digital transformation, and the need for all-in-one workflow solutions has been a long time in the making and will continue long past the pandemic.</p>\n<p>“The pandemic has certainly accelerated the growth and adoption of document workflow management, but the future of business generally, and sales specifically, is headed in this direction.

A great CEO understands how a satisfied and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/13/how-connected-communities-can-bolster-your-business/\">loyal customer can accelerate business</a> expansion. They have transformed their companies into industry leaders by building loyal relationships with their customers and employees. They have used a magic metric the Net Promoter Score. To understand where their business is lagging and improved on it.</p>\n<p>A CEO creates a benchmark for its organization and makes sure the brand promise is delivered.</p>\n<h2>Net Promoter Score</h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score is a simple business metric that gauges how well you are meeting your customers’ expectations. It offers a powerful lens into what customers think about your business and reveals what is wrong.</p>\n<p>NPS is a robust and powerful solution to boost word-of-mouth marketing, increase customer satisfaction, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-customer-churn-rate/\">reduce customer churn</a>, and offer <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/21/a-better-customer-experience-why-little-things-matter/\">better customer experience</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Three Categories of the Customers</h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score survey aims to ask one question to all its audience. ‘On the scale 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to your friends and family?’ and based on its answers, it measures the customer loyalty of your business.</p>\n<p>Also, based on their scores, the customers are divided into three categories. That is, Promoters, Passives, and Detractors.</p>\n<p><strong>Promoters:</strong> They are the customers who gave a score of 9 or 10. They love your brand’s products and services and are the most loyal customers.<br />\n<strong>Passives:</strong> They are the customers who gave a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with your brand’s products or services but can switch to your competitor for a better offer.<br />\n<strong>Detractors:</strong> They are the customers who gave a score of 6 or below. They are not happy with your brand’s services and/or products and are most likely not willing to purchase from you again.</p>\n<h2>How do you calculate NPS?</h2>\n<p>Your company’s Net Promoter Score (surveysensum.com) can be calculated by simply subtracting the percentage of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/03/why-you-should-measure-net-promoter-score-nps/\">Detractors from the percentage of Promoters</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>NPS (Net Promoter Score) = % Promoters &#8211; % Detractors</strong></p>\n<h2>How can NPS Data help your Business?</h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score is an effective way to run a business. At the same time, many business leaders are skeptical about the effectiveness of NPS. Numerous studies have shown that high NPS can be directly linked to the growth of the company.</p>\n<p>Here are the 5 crucial points about NPS data with industry leaders’ case studies that any business owner must know.</p>\n<h3>Reduction in Support Costs</h3>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score helps in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/27/how-tech-can-help-your-business-do-more-with-less/\">reducing the business costs</a> by identifying the pain areas of the customers, enabling the Support team to serve the customers better.</p>\n<p>This results in a reduction in call times, improvement in satisfaction score, and an increase in the average number of calls handled at a time, which reduces the support costs of any business by a significant amount.</p>\n<p>Symantec provides cybersecurity software to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/the-biggest-cybersecurity-mistakes-businesses-are-still-making/\">protect infrastructure networks</a>, data, and communication. Along with security measures,</p>\n<p>they also address any compliance, availability or performance risks. After adopting NPS in 2004, there has been a <em>50% increase in their product lines, a 30% reduction</em> in support costs, and a significant increase in the number of positive reviews.</p>\n<h3>Increased interaction with Current and Prospective Customers</h3>\n<p>The NPS is a simple metric to track your position in the market. But what is significant is asking the right questions. Often small things have the most significant impact on the NPS, and it is by talking to your customers that you will understand the reasons behind brand loyalty.</p>\n<p>Slack is a business communication platform that brings the communication of all the teams of a business on a single platform. Slack Team used the NPS to answer one question ‘Why should people recommend or not recommend your brand?’</p>\n<p>They refined all the interaction with the current and prospective clients and tracked their progress with the Net Promoter Score, which resulted in a <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/01/22/slack-unicorn/\">$1 billion valuation</a> in one year through positive promotions tracked by NPS.</p>\n<h3>Work on the Detractors</h3>\n<p>After a Net Promoter Score survey, it is important to work on the Detractors of your business as their feedback offers an opportunity to improve your business and by analyzing their feedback with actionable insights.</p>\n<p>You can fix some of your problems quickly or take a required action to improve your services or products.</p>\n<p>Apple retail store managers, post their NPS survey, reached out to all of their detractors or dissatisfied customers within 24 hours and analyzed the purchase patterns of the detractors who spoke to store managers and who had not.</p>\n<p>This survey resulted in additional revenue of more than $1,000 or $25 million in a year.</p>\n<h3>Work towards profitability</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow\">In the Harvard Business Review,</a> it has been observed that the companies adopting the Net Promoter Score tend to grow twice the rate of their competitors than those who have not adopted NPS.</p>\n<p>It has been recognized that businesses working on their NPS analysis have sustainable, profitable growth, which begins with creating more promoters and fewer detractors.</p>\n<p>Philips Electronics used the NPS for a few of its accounts for some time and observed where the NPS increased. <em>The revenue grew by 69%,</em> where the NPS didn’t change, <em>the revenue grew by 6% only</em>, and where the NPS was not adopted, <em>the revenue decreased by 24%.</em></p>\n<h3>Reduce your Customer Churn</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.netpromotersystem.com/speaking-engagements/fred-reichheld.aspx\">Fred Reichheld created</a> the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure the customer’s brand loyalty. The NPS measures customer experience and the likelihood of repeat business. Also, it is the only metric that evaluates the customer churn that helps in working against the inevitable failure.</p>\n<p>Australian Based telecommunication company, Optus, posted a net profit of $227 million during the last quarter of 2013.</p>\n<p>According to the Australian Business Review, the Country Chief Officer Kevin Russell has said that after they adopted the NPS in 2013, there has been a six-point increase in their Net Promoter Score over the December quarter. That was a 50% decrease in the customer complaint,s which resulted in a 41% increase against the last quarter of 2012.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Net Promoter Score is the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/15/how-will-iot-improve-the-way-startups-do-business-in-2020/\">one number that you need to grow</a>. It is a simple, profound, and effective way to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-customer-churn-rate/\">reduce customer churn</a>, improve loyalty, and word-of-mouth marketing, which leads to great profits.</p>\n<p>Conducting a survey and gathering data is the first step. The companies that have grown their revenue with the NPS implementations have analyzed this data. And took actions to convert detractors to promoters while improving customer experience.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/11/a-ceos-perspective-on-net-promoter-score/\">A CEO&#8217;s Perspective on Net Promoter Score</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:01:06 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/A-CEOs-Perspective-on-Net-Promoter-Score.jpg","linkMd5":"2464b0146aca43856547135b33b0c480","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn64@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-826_9b788f4220b403cc.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/A-CEOs-Perspective-on-Net-Promoter-Score.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":30775,"destBytes":18578,"author":"Tanuj Diwan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/A-CEOs-Perspective-on-Net-Promoter-Score-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-11-495_fe60c97286e2120c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873189},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"How to Apply IoT in the Oil and Gas Industry","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=161573","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/23/how-to-apply-iot-in-the-oil-and-gas-industry/\" title=\"How to Apply IoT in the Oil and Gas Industry\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"iot in oil and gas\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Apply-IoT-in-the-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-1-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The Internet of Things has found its way into various industries: automotive, agriculture, green energy. One of the areas that IoT is about to conquer is the oil and gas world. Today, companies hire plant managers, machine operators, and field personnel to predict when machines need maintenance and upkeep. These managers monitor IoT to keep employees safe in the work environment and to improve production.</p>\n<h3>McKinsey Global Institute&#8217;s research indicates that IoT has the potential to attract $11.1T by 2025.</h3>\n<p>Mining and the oil and gas companies have a potential economic impact of $930B within the next decade. As such, it doesn&#8217;t surprise anyone that the Oil and Gas industry is interested in leveraging IoT?</p>\n<h2>Why use IoT in the oil and gas industry?</h2>\n<p>In the Oil and Gas industry, the advantages of oil and gas IoT applications lie in creating value through an integrated deployment strategy. IoT will allow the industry to digitize, optimize, and automate processes that were previously unconnected to save time, money, and increase safety.</p>\n<p>IoT is the technology that allows devices, machinery, and other equipment to communicate with each other. It lets oil and gas companies manage and store data, create applications, and set security protocols.</p>\n<h3>Preventive Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Companies hire plant managers, machine operators to predict when machinery needs maintenance. With IoT, you can accurately predict when maintenance has to be done, and you can keep your employees safe while improving production.</p>\n<p>For oil and gas companies, IoT run software tells the manager when to repair the machinery, and alerts them when something is likely to break. It is essential in the Oil and Gas industry to protect all equipment &#8212; including watching out of any leaks and even minor breaks. IoT can handle all alerts. Just lean back and let the Internet of Things do its thing.</p>\n<h3>Remote Services</h3>\n<p>Oil and Gas are generally found in the remote areas of the globe that are hard to reach areas. The isolated terrain leads to problems with the upkeep of equipment, and any extraction needs from the sites in remote locations cause increased risks. IoT helps with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safety needs of both the employees and the equipment.</li>\n<li>High prices for maintaining equipment.</li>\n<li>Saves on the high expenses for the workers.</li>\n<li>It provides less chance of human error.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What IoT allows for is that oil and gas companies are being able to remotely manage everything on their plants at any time. IoT can help manage and provide alerts for issues from minor leaks to system breakdowns. Companies can set the monitoring devices on their machines to take care of everything.</p>\n<h3>The biggest threat to all industries.</h3>\n<p>The most significant threat to all industries &#8212; one that makes companies lose billions of dollars every year, is Non-Productive time (NPT).</p>\n<p>When workers and employees are not required to be on-site observing equipment and monitoring issues it saves vast amounts of time and money. That&#8217;s what IoT has done for the Oil and Gas industry.</p>\n<h3>Safety</h3>\n<p>Oil and gas sites are generally dangerous for workers’ well being and safety. Included with the oil and gas industries is water. Another high-cost area of service. Some reservoirs are up to 3,000 meters deep and many are far offshore. Dangerous circumstances are always involved in the water industry, as well as in oil and gas.</p>\n<p>Using IoT in these areas at remote sites can prevent health issues, injuries, or even save lives.</p>\n<h2>Case study: Applying IoT in the oil, gas, and water industries.</h2>\n<p>The digitalization of IoT in the oil, gas, and water industries. IoT has saved a lot of money and provided greater protection for remote workers and employees who have to remain far from civilization without support.</p>\n<h3>Before IoT &#8212; there was only the desktop app.</h3>\n<p>Of course, desktop apps are still a thing, but not as much for remote maintenance cases. Desktop solutions work for in-house needs, where either security matters, or that involve end-to-end tasks.</p>\n<p>The businesses of the client revolved around RFScada units. These data delivery devices work great for industrial areas. RFScada units comprise the desktop app and phone apps that took over 16 years to develop. These devices are used for tracking and gathering data.</p>\n<p>The first desktop app contains a whole lot of functionality and was super detailed, and too complex. The computer with the app had to be connected to the monitored gateway at all times. The portal, online, could be connected to a number of machines.</p>\n<p>However, to see the data and track if anything was outside the expected ranges &#8212; a person would have to look on the screen and watch the tracking. This process was not very convenient. Remote locations, nighttime, and problems when monitoring moving cargo &#8212; all were issues that had difficulties to solve.</p>\n<p>Finally, the request was made to turn the entire system into a web platform that brings the best of IoT to oil, gas, water, and other industrial areas.</p>\n<h3>Turning the constraints into advantages.</h3>\n<p>From a business standpoint, RFSCADA is a great system for enterprises, but it had a hard start in development. The solution took some considerable constraint and workarounds but came out with a legacy system with a mix of cutting-edge IoT offerings.</p>\n<h4>The beginning challenges.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Design scalable and easy maintainable architecture for the platform.</li>\n<li>Simplify the flows for different user roles yet maintain in-company and in-system security.</li>\n<li>Developed a user-friendly way for updating firmware via UI.</li>\n<li>Wrote a compatibility script on Lua that generates configuration updates for firmware based on changes a user makes.</li>\n<li>Found a reliable gateway to process data and relay that data to and from the needed devices.</li>\n<li>The RFScada gateway system also works with cellular traffic.</li>\n<li>Able to analyze what is needed and cut all unneeded data.</li>\n<li>Data has been prioritized for the simplicity of the users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With limited time, this system went through the MVP approach. All functionality was sorted, and the main component was selected for the main components that would be used for future platforms. The primary purpose has always been to make this IoT system adoption as easy as possible to work with.</p>\n<h3>IoT web platform for monitoring and managing plants remotely</h3>\n<p>With a minimalist design concept, one of the main perks of using IoT in oil, gas, or any other industry lies with minimum effort for the user. In the system, you configure everything once, and you&#8217;re done &#8212; you&#8217;ll get notifications when needed. You only need to return when making configuration updates, and most of these are simple, time-saving, and automated.</p>\n<h4>The new digitized IoT system includes:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Registered number of users with individual access rights</li>\n<li>Ability for the lead engineers and plant owners to configure the needed monitoring.</li>\n<li>Regular workers have the ability, if given access, to track the plants they’re assigned to.</li>\n<li>Configuring sensors attached for each unit.</li>\n<li>Specific parameters (including hierarchy, measuring frequency, and type) and conversions in common measurement units.</li>\n<li>Text message and call alarms.</li>\n<li>Users receive a timely alert in case of spikes on any sensor. The user acknowledges the receipt of the warning so the system can shut down if needed.</li>\n<li>All data and events are logged, as well as the complementary configurations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each sensor, the user can configure the acceptable, risk, and danger range and also set up impressions for tracking. This variety leaves parameters created in the flexible dashboard and allows differing widget types.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>IoT handles a lot of routine scenarios for everything. That’s why we love applying it to simplify work and leisure &#8212; making time for more intellectual pursuits.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.

These beds mold to the curves of the body for a weightless sleep that allows your muscles time to repair and rebuild properly. Here are some thoughts about &#8212; are foam mattresses safe?</p>\n<p><strong>When resting on the right foam mattress, you will experience little to no pressure points, better posture, and fewer aches and pains in the morning.</strong></p>\n<p>Because of extreme comfort and less pain, foam beds are often recommended by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists for those who suffer from chronic pain.</p>\n<h2><strong>But, are these mattresses safe?</strong></h2>\n<p>The question is one many people have when considering a foam bed &#8212; and it&#8217;s an important thought to address. The truth is &#8212; most high-quality foam mattresses are safe. In the US and Europe, several third-party certifications test these mattresses to ensure they&#8217;re healthy for us, and for the planet.</p>\n<p>However, cheaper foam mattresses rely on poor quality foam, and some companies don&#8217;t always obtain certifications &#8212; leaving you to guess what type of materials were used during construction. Low-quality mattresses may contain hidden chemicals that could cause respiratory and skin irritations once they&#8217;re indoors.</p>\n<p><strong>To take the guesswork out of purchasing a foam mattress, we put together this guide so you can quickly identify a safe, non-toxic foam mattress from one that could compromise your health. </strong></p>\n<h2>Different Types of Foam Mattresses</h2>\n<p>As you shop, you will find most mattresses feature either poly-foam, memory foam, or latex foam. Most beds on the market today contain some percentage of foam in their comfort layer.</p>\n<p>An all-foam mattress will contain several different types of foam &#8212; each ranging in firmness to give you a combination of comfort and support. A hybrid mattress has a base of wrapped spring coils but also features at least 2 inches of foam in the top layer.</p>\n<p>Some innerspring mattresses also feature a small amount of foam; however, it is usually only about one-inch thick. To help you recognize the difference between each type of foam, here is the breakdown of the construction and materials of each type below.</p>\n<h3><strong>Poly-Foam</strong></h3>\n<p>Poly-foam (polyurethane foam) is the cheapest and lowest quality foam on the market. This foam contains 100 percent petroleum-based chemicals that can irritate allergies and skin sensitivities. Poly-foam is often used in the comfort layer of innerspring beds, but because poly-foam collapses quickly under pressure, it does not offer the same contouring or targeted support as memory foam and latex foam.</p>\n<p>The density of poly-foam may vary depending on where it is used in the mattress. However, even high-density poly-foam lacks the durability of memory and latex foam. Some low-density poly-foam has been known to develop sagging and indentations after just one year of use.</p>\n<h3><strong>Memory Foam</strong></h3>\n<p>Memory foam (viscoelastic foam) was created for NASA to protect astronauts during flight. But since its invention in the 60s &#8212; memory foam has become much safer and more advanced.</p>\n<p>Although traditional memory foam relies on petroleum-based oils, there are now less toxic options available. By using eco-friendly manufacturing methods, many companies are creating memory foam that is cleaner and healthier for us to rest on but still offers the same pressure-relieving support.</p>\n<h4><strong>Memory foam, regardless of density, is also durable &#8212; lasting as long as ten years. </strong></h4>\n<p>Here are the various types of memory foam you may come across.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Traditional Memory Foam:</b> Traditional memory foam is made with 100 percent petroleum-based chemicals and infused with compounds that give it a slow spring back—making it the perfect material to hug and support joints. However, traditional memory foam relies on only petroleum-derived materials and also tends to trap heat.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Plant-Based Memory Foam:</b> To create a cleaner, less toxic sleep environment, some companies rely on plant-based memory foam. To create this foam, they replace a large portion of the petroleum-based chemicals with vegetable-derived oils (castor oil). This process results in eco-friendly material that is healthier for human contact. Plus, plant-based foams are more breathable and more responsive, so you never have to worry about overheating or sinking too far down when resting on plant-based memory foam.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Gel-Infused Memory Foam:</b> To combat heat retention, many companies incorporate cooling gels into their foam. These gels wick away body heat and push warm air out of the bed, keeping you cool and preventing heat retention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We should mention, all memory foam used in mattresses has an open-cell structure. During your search for a new bed, you may see foam advertised as being better or more advanced because it’s open-cell &#8212; all this is is a marketing gimmick. Some brands, however, will design their foam with an <i>advanced</i> open-cell structure, and this means their foam is more breathable and porous than other foams used in mattresses.</p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/18/best-memory-foam-mattress/\">best memory foam mattress</a>, look for one that features an advanced open-cell structure and plant-based foam. This is the combination you are looking for &#8212; offering the best of both worlds &#8212; less toxicity and more breathability.</p>\n<h3><strong>Latex Foam</strong></h3>\n<p>Latex is a durable and natural material derived from the sap of rubber trees. Once gathered, the latex sap is whipped into a foam and baked to create its shape. Latex is also eco-friendly and sustainable because rubber trees don&#8217;t have to be cut down during harvesting, only tapped.</p>\n<p>Latex mattresses are notably durable, with most of these mattresses lasting around 10 to 12 years. This foam provides a comfort level similar to memory foam but with a slight bounce.</p>\n<p>Most latex foam is entirely natural; however, some latex may be infused with toxic chemicals to increase responsiveness and breathability. Therefore, it is best to look for all-natural Dunlop or Talalay latex foam when shopping for a safer mattress.</p>\n<h2>Components of Poly-Foam and Memory Foam</h2>\n<p>When it comes to construction, each mattress company uses their own &#8220;recipe&#8221; and manufacturing process. Therefore, it&#8217;s essential to research the materials and construction process for each brand you consider.</p>\n<p>Reputable companies will be fully transparent in every detail of development. If you are unable to locate this information on the company&#8217;s website, it is best to look elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of materials frequently used in poly-foam and memory foam mattresses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Polyols:</b> Polyols are binding agents that also add bulk to the foam. These ingredients are usually derived from petroleum-based oils, but may also have a botanical source such as castor bean or soybean oils.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Diisocyanates:</b> Diisocycantes are organic isocyanates that react to polyols and blowing agents to increase the flexibility of the poly-foam. The three most commonly used diisocyanates are MDI (methylene diisocyanates), TDI (toluene diisocyanates), and HDI (hexamethylene diisocyanates). Of the three, MDI is considered the safest and least hazardous. When in their raw form, these ingredients can produce respiratory tract and skin irritation and are considered toxic. However, after manufacturing, they are not reactive and pose a lower health risk. If a mattress is made with one of these agents, they may give off an odor when brought indoors—this is called &#8220;off-gassing.&#8221; In some cases, off-gassing may produce breathing problems or headaches.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Blowing Agents:</b> These agents create the cellular structure of the foam. Traditionally, harmful CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were used for this process, but today many manufactures use water or HFC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially Dangerous Byproducts and Ingredients</h2>\n<p>Since poly-foams and traditional memory foams are derived from petroleum-based oils, they can contain chemicals and compounds that are unsafe. Many of the ingredients listed below have been banned or are now screened by third-party testing for safety.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Formaldehyde:</b> Although formaldehyde is not typically used in foam mattresses, it may be a byproduct of the chemical reaction. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogenic and is believed to cause leukemia and cancer of the nose, throat, and sinuses.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Methylene chloride:</b> This solvent is known to irritate the mucous membrane. Due to current pollution regulation, it is rarely used today.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Acetone:</b> Can be toxic when inhaling in large quantities, but shows little health risk in low amounts.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Dimethylformamide:</b> When exposed to this compound during manufacturing, it may cause organ damage.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Vinylidene chloride:</b> During manufacturing, this ingredient may irritate the eyes, respiratory tract, and internal organs.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Methylenedianiline/MDA:</b> This compound is often used in household products and shows little risk in low amounts. However, exposure during manufacturing could result in eye and skin irritation, as well as thyroid and liver damage.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>1,1,1,2 Tetrachloroethane:</b> This ingredient is known to cause organ damage after long-term exposure. It is now rarely used in the US or Europe.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):</b> This blowing agent is a harmful pollutant, and environmental regulations now restrict its use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Flame Resistance</h2>\n<p>In the US, every mattress sold must pass flame resistance testing—this means it must be able to withstand an open flame for 70 seconds. To pass these tests, many manufacturers rely on toxic materials. Therefore, something intended for safety ends up causing us harm.</p>\n<p>Petroleum products are naturally flammable, so these foams must be treated with a flame-resistant chemical, or they must contain a fire barrier. But because companies are not required to state how they provide flame protection, it is often difficult to find this information.</p>\n<p>Companies using safe methods of fire resistance are generally happy to disclose this information; however, those using toxic methods may choose not to.</p>\n<p>The following is a list of commonly used fire-resistant materials and chemicals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Brominated fire retardants and PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers):</b> This group of substances was commonly used for fire resistance, but was phased out of use in the U.S. for being a known carcinogenic.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Chlorinated tris (TDCPP):</b> Tris is a commonly used flame retardant chemical that has been shown to cause neurological damage and disruption to the endocrine system. It has recently become less popular due to its toxicity.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Treated Cotton:</b> On its own, cotton is not flame resistant, but it can be treated with boric acid to achieve fire protection. However, boric acid has been shown to cause organ damage.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Modacrylic fiber:</b> This manufactured synthetic fiber is known to be toxic due to the use of antimony oxide in its construction.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Melamine resin:</b> This resin contains formaldehyde and is, therefore, carcinogenic.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Alessandra fabric:</b> This fiberglass material may be safe on its own; however, it often contains modacrylic fiber and antimony oxide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Safe Fire Protection Materials: </strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Wool:</b> Wool is a natural material that can act as a fire retardant on its own. However, wool is not typically used in an all-foam mattress.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Kevlar:</b> This human-made fiber is strong, durable, and non-toxic.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Raylon treated with silica:</b> Both materials are non-toxic and safe for sleepers. Rayon is derived from bamboo, and silica is a naturally occurring compound found in sand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk of VOC Emissions</h2>\n<p>Most of the materials mentioned above pose little health risks once the manufacturing process is complete. However, some VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) may remain in the mattress and can leach into the air inside your home—causing breathing issues, headaches, and allergic reactions.</p>\n<p>The term for this action is, &#8220;off-gassing.&#8221; It&#8217;s often described as a &#8220;new&#8221; smell and accompanies many products containing polyurethane such as paint, furniture, clothing, and other household cleaners. These compounds are volatile because they break down gradually and at various temperatures—releasing an odor as they do so.</p>\n<p>Certain sources produce VOCs that are more harmful than others. Plants and humans release VOCs that are low risk. However, chemicals such as toluene, benzene, and formaldehyde have been shown to release VOCs that cause respiratory issues, throat irritation, dizziness, headaches. Prolonged exposure could also lead to allergic reactions or other sensitivities.</p>\n<p>Adhesives and fire-resistant chemicals can also create a strong, unpleasant smell. But by opting for a mattress made with a natural flame retardant and safer manufacturing methods, the mattress will have minimal off-gassing.</p>\n<p>To ensure your safety, you can also look for a third-party certification that tests the mattress for VOCs. A CertiPUR-US® certification will guarantee the bed is made with no ozone-depleting substances, toxic flame retardants (such as PBDEs, TDCPP, or TCEP), mercury, lead (and other heavy metals), formaldehyde, or any harmful phthalates. Plus, it will also ensure the mattress is low in VOCs.</p>\n<h2>Choosing a Safe Foam Mattress</h2>\n<p>To find the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/21/best-mattress/\">best mattress</a> for you, we have put together a checklist of mattress safety tips. These points will help you find a bed that is less toxic and safe to bring into your home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Look for third-party certifications such as CertiPur-US® and OEKO-TEX®</b>. These third-party organizations have set standards on VOC levels and product safety.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>When considering memory foam, opt for a plant-based foam</b>. These foams are more natural and will release little to no VOC emissions when brought indoors.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Find out the type of isocyanates (reactive) is used in the construction of the foam.</b> MDI is considered to be less toxic than TDI and HDI.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Consider the type of blowing agents used in the construction of the foam.</b> Gasses such as CFCs and HFCs contribute to air pollution and may cause excessive off-gassing.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Find out what type of materials or chemicals were used for flame resistance.</b> Rayon treated with natural silica and kevlar is the safest and least toxic option.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Consider the density of each foam layer.</b> Higher-density foams contain more polymers and may create more off-gassing.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Find out where the foam layers were manufactured.</b> The US and Europe both have regulations in place to ensure mattress safety.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eco-friendly brands go to great lengths to reduce their carbon footprint.</b> They often rely on healthier manufacturing methods, shipping processes, and are made in the U.S. In most cases, these mattresses are safer for you and the environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Foam mattresses can provide you with a healthy, non-toxic, comfortable, and supportive sleep space. However, purchasing a mattress is similar to buying a car &#8212; a little research will help you understand exactly what you&#8217;re getting. After all, you spend a third of your life in bed, so what you rest on each night can affect your health.</p>\n<p>Our guidelines above will make the process of purchasing a safer foam mattress less complicated, so you can find a better night’s sleep.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/are-foam-mattresses-safe/\">Are Foam Mattresses Safe?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:00:51 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Are-Foam-Mattresses-Safe.jpg","linkMd5":"6bfd04b8b1efb00793a3e88e9aeaf56b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-24-507_8b4e867d1e5223ae.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Are-Foam-Mattresses-Safe.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":37514,"destBytes":23002,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Are-Foam-Mattresses-Safe-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-22-854_ea11594fa23f9e5d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878642},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Eleven Personal Financial Apps to Keep Your Budget in Check","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168087","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/28/eleven-personal-financial-apps-to-keep-your-budget-in-check/\" title=\"Eleven Personal Financial Apps to Keep Your Budget in Check\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check-300x177.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"personal financial apps\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check-300x177.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check-900x530.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check-260x153.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check-1536x905.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eleven-Personal-Financial-Apps-to-Keep-Your-Budget-in-Check.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>From paychecks to automatic online transfers, finances have come a long way.

It includes making your employees feel included, giving recognition, and encouraging open discussions, among other things. </em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, many companies are slowly replacing them with other forms of performance assessment, such as regular </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/how-to-tactfully-communicate-tough-feedback-to-remote-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee feedback</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to The Washington Post, roughly 10% of Fortune 500 companies have abandoned annual performance reviews.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there&#8217;s one group of employees who don&#8217;t benefit from either annual performance reviews and regular feedback. They&#8217;re the gig workers or the independent contractors who work on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/02/do-apps-that-support-side-gigs-help-or-hurt-the-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">side gigs</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If once the term &#8220;gig&#8221; was associated with jazz musicians, today, that term is used to describe external professionals across all industries, such as software engineering, graphic design, SEO specialists, and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estimations tell that roughly 150 million workers in North America and Western Europe have quit their 9-to-5 lives to join the </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/02/the-gig-economy-and-how-to-leverage-it-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gig economy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tech giant Microsoft, for example, has </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/13/in-the-future-employees-wont-exist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two-thirds as many contractors as employees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Uber, the ride-hailing company, has 160,000 contractors but only 2,000 employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As gig workers are becoming the new normal, companies that employ this kind of talent often report having issues with improving engagement and productivity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re in the same situation and are looking for a solution, the answer is that what your gig employees need is on-point performance management.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s how you can implement it in your company: </span></p>\n<h2><b>Make Gig Workers Feel Included</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s something called &#8220;social pain&#8221; and neuroscientists think it&#8217;s crucial for people&#8217;s happiness to take care of their social pain. Social pain can be caused due to rejection or feeling excluded from social activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meaning, if your external <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/5-work-culture-trends-that-improve-employee-productivity-and-satisfaction/\">employees feel like they’re not part of your company</a>, their engagement and productivity might suffer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For that reason, it&#8217;s crucial that you make your gig workers feel included and as a relevant part of your workforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share with them all news and relevant information about the business. Whenever you have a big meeting, invite them to take part virtually. Apart from being present, make sure you give them a voice in meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treating them like you do everyone else will be a form of appreciation.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Encourage Open Discussion</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173671 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1.jpg\" alt=\"remote conference remote work\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1.jpg 512w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1-240x160.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open discussion is a powerful method for performance management, ensuring employees are expressing their ideas, views, and concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid dealing with issues only after they become serious, encourage your gig workers to communicate their views and concerns without fear of being punished or ignored. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If employees see that the company is open to hearing those concerns, they will feel comfortable speaking out loud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule regular one-on-one meetings, as well as team meetings, where everyone will get the chance to express themselves. Frequent check-ins also leave room for giving recognition and acknowledgment of what each employee is working on and how they&#8217;re contributing to the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain an environment with several channels of communication. Touching base with more than one platform will allow your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/securing-the-digital-workplace-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">external employees to communicate</a> with you in the best way for them, whether via Slack, email, or Zoom. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Maintain Effective Two-Way Feedback</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managers must remember that feedback is a two-way street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of only managers giving feedback to employees, there should be room for employees to provide feedback to their managers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few suggestions for avoiding one-way feedback scenarios:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask the gig workers what they did right this week. Let them give more details.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You, as the manager, give your own feedback about what you think the employee did right. Try to provide examples.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discuss what the employee can do differently next time.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You, as the manager, talk about what you can do differently next time. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask the employee what he thinks you can do differently next time. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of two-way feedback can help the employee build confidence and be challenged to try new and different ways of doing things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the manager, it helps them become more active listeners, be more receptive to constructive criticism, and be willing to adjust their supervisory style. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Have the Right Managers Supervising the Gig Workers</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company that employs an external talent must ensure that it has the right manager/supervisor to monitor the gig workers and their work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/08/7-tools-that-support-remote-team-collaboration-and-communication/\">what makes an effective supervisor</a>?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, the effective supervisor is someone:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees are comfortable taking to without fear or shame;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team trusts. Supervisors must stay true to their words and maintain a high level of transparency. Otherwise, the team might become lose respect and work without giving their 100%;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who invests in the development of every employee. They want to see each employee grow as an individual. They enhance a team&#8217;s strengths and improve upon their weaknesses;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who is held accountable for their actions, even when things go right and when they go wrong. When employees see this, they will be inspired to be more accountable and more mindful of their role on the team.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Give Recognition Where Is Due</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173672 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2.jpg\" alt=\"employee recognition\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2.jpg 512w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2-240x160.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team morale is an essential ingredient of every company culture. Regardless of whether you&#8217;re a small startup or an enterprise company, you have to show your employees their work is valued and appreciated to boost productivity and engagement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, employees who do not feel recognized are </span><a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236441/employee-recognition-low-cost-high-impact.aspx#:~:text=Workplace%20recognition%20motivates%2C%20provides%20a,company%2C%20leading%20to%20higher%20retention.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">twice as likely to say they&#8217;ll quit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When an employee feels that their work is valued, their satisfaction levels rise, and they become motivated to work towards improving their work quality even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee recognition is a low-cost performance management method but has a high impact. And if you thought that money is the only or the top form of recognition, you would be wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A small personal note, a public recognition via a Slack chat, or promotion are all fantastic forms of recognition that employees love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But apart from how the employee is recognized, another important part is who is doing the recognizing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Gallup workplace survey, employees were asked to say who gave them the most meaningful recognition. Around 28% said their most meaningful recognition came from a manager, 24% said it came from a high-level leader or CEO, 12% said it came from a manager&#8217;s manager, and 9% said it came from peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the next time one of your gig workers does an amazing job, make sure you let them know their work is valued and appreciated. Doing so can lead to many positive workplace outcomes.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Create Virtual Water Coolers</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173673 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3.jpg\" alt=\"remote worker working from home\" width=\"512\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3.jpg 512w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3-300x149.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3-260x129.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human beings crave relationships and close connections.

Contact tracing utilizing mobile technology is one promising but controversial solution that has been tested in some countries and proposed in the United States.</p>\n<p>The Washington Post reports that millions of people around the globe have already been placed under some form of surveillance in an effort to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/cellphone-monitoring-is-spreading-with-the-coronavirus-so-is-an-uneasy-tolerance-of-surveillance/2020/05/02/56f14466-7b55-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\">monitor people’s movements and attempt to trace the spread</a> of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Of particular note, at least 27 countries have already started using data from cell phones to track the movements of their citizens. While this approach has a great potential to benefit the public good, the implementation and adoption of such technology raise important questions about transparency, AI ethics, and data privacy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fighting the spread of COVID-19 with smart technology.</strong></h2>\n<p>Contact tracing can be one of the most effective ways to contain an outbreak. However, COVID-19 is not a typical outbreak. The virus is often transmitted by individuals who display no symptoms of the infection and may not even realize that they are carrying the virus.</p>\n<p>Standard contact tracing usually involves individuals who are symptomatic and are aware they are carrying the infection in question. Because of this, traditional contact tracing methods are challenging and problematic.</p>\n<p>The Big Data Institute at Oxford University has proposed a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/is-there-any-stopping-techs-big-four-from-monopolizing-user-data/\">solution for a mobile contact tracing application</a> that is much more agile, efficient, and scalable than traditional manual contact tracing methods. The team developed a <a href=\"https://045.medsci.ox.ac.uk/Epidemiology\">mathematical model</a> designed to stop the epidemic if implemented on mobile devices by a substantial portion of the population. It’s poised to reduce manual contact tracing from 72 hours to four hours. By replacing weeks worth of manual work performing contact tracing, the mobile application can slow the spread much more quickly than traditional methods.</p>\n<h3>For the proposed mobile tracing method to be effective, quite a few hurdles must be overcome.</h3>\n<p>First, the majority of the population – including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals – must voluntarily opt-in and adopt the application. The research team at Oxford estimates that about 60% of the population would have to utilize the application for mobile tracing to reach enough new virus cases to make an impact on the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>Another challenge lies in widespread and accessible COVID-19 testing. For the application to work, the majority of the population would need to have access to reliable testing in order for the application to properly and fully survey potential outbreaks.</p>\n<p>There is much evidence suggesting that the application of rigorous wide-scale testing coupled with the application of mobile technology can blunt COVID-19 infection and mortality rates.</p>\n<h3>Taiwan was able to contain the COVID-19 outbreak better. Why?</h3>\n<p>A recent Stanford <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762689\">report</a> demonstrates how Taiwan – a country just 130 km from the epicenter of the outbreak in China – was able to contain the outbreak without the draconian lockdown measures in place throughout many of the advanced economies.</p>\n<p>How did Taiwan manage to limit and contain the spread of the virus? The report highlights five interconnected factors: pandemic readiness, national electronic health records database, wide-scale testing, big data analytics, and the use of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/17/how-can-blockchain-help-secure-iot-data/\">mobile technology to track movements of individuals</a> who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Within 72 hours of the outbreak, a comprehensive case identification protocol was instituted based on travel histories. Individuals determined to be high risk were monitored through their mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Health authorities were then able to trace the movements of high-risk subjects and mitigate the risk of further transmission through targeted isolation measures.

Maybe your brand knows what it’s doing when it comes to your product.</p>\n<h4><strong>How is your email going to depict these facts in a way that will be relevant, timely, and appropriate?</strong></h4>\n<p>Go ahead and do your research. Sign up for your competitors’ newsletter campaigns and expect some cold emails from them as well. Then, start studying your findings.</p>\n<p>Studying your findings will help you determine what kind of needs your cold email campaign needs to cover. The findings will also help with project management. Your cold email campaign is a project in and of itself, that will help you out with other projects.</p>\n<p>However, researching the competition is not the only thing you’ll need to do in this case.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who is your ideal customer?</strong></h2>\n<p>To know who would love to hear from you &#8212; you’ll need to create your buyer personas.</p>\n<p>Buyer personas are depictions of what your ideal customer should be like. From their educational level, down to their location on the globe, buyer personas can provide a whole lot of insights and usually work like a charm:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_164987\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-164987\" style=\"width: 702px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-164987 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png\" alt=\"buyer persona\" width=\"702\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png 702w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10-300x201.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10-238x160.png 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-164987\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>Showing the buyer persona power for cold emails.</strong></em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(<a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/craft-your-persona-like-trump-daca6b44d770\">Source</a>)</p>\n<p>Buyer personas worked perfectly in generating leads and exceeding expectations.

It’s a very specific product that wouldn’t interest someone that’s not a marketer or a brand that is using growth strategies.</p>\n<h2><strong>Are subject lines important?</strong></h2>\n<p>In short, yes, the subject line is important. But why? And what do you need to do to make sure that you won’t fail?</p>\n<p>A subject line is the very first thing a prospect notices about your email. A failed subject line can do this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-164985 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png\" alt=\"cold emails subject line\" width=\"573\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png 573w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8-275x300.png 275w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8-147x160.png 147w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(<a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/email-subject-lines-statistics-and-trends/\">Source</a>)</p>\n<p>The last thing you need is someone hurting your deliverability rate and making you appear to be the “bad guy.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Here are some examples of subject lines to avoid at all costs:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t begin with questions.</strong> “Do you want to save your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/visual-merchandising-online-startups-cannot-afford-to-overlookvisual-merchandising-online-startups-cannot-afford-to-overlook/\">average order value</a> from plummeting?” Nah mate, I’d rather not, because the first thing that comes to my mind is that you want me to pay you for something. And asking for money through a cold email <b>screams</b> spam. You can find an alternative way of saying this, such as: “Your customer feedback strategy is on point, congrats [name]”</li>\n<li><strong>Grammar, punctuation</strong>, and the number of words and keywords are too important: Poor grammar <b>is</b> spam, and too many exclamation points make your subject line look like spam to Google-and look tacky. What is more, the number of words is something that can make or break your open rate.You’ll get the best response at an open rate if you’ve got a subject line that’s somewhere between 6-10 words. Lastly, <b>avoid too many keywords</b>. It looks robotic, feels rushed and guess what it can do for your cold email campaign. You’re right, nothing.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid using:</strong> “RE:,” “FWD:,” “URGENT,” and clickbait subject lines. Any of these beginnings will not resonate well with your recipients. Let me explain why: <strong>“RE:”</strong> shows that you’ve no idea who you’re emailing &#8212; or that you’re a bot. Either way, since the prospect never sent something for you to reply to &#8212; straight to the spam folder you go.“FWD:” seems more than a little unprofessional. Your prospect will consider that you didn’t take the time to erase the word “FWD” from the subject line. Imagine where your email will end up if your prospect thinks, “I never asked to be sent anything in the first place, and I don’t know that person.”\n<p>As for <strong>the “URGENT,”</strong> I think it’s more than obvious. Inconsistent, bullshit or misleading subject lines will lead your email to the spam folder and send your deliverability rate to a downward spiral.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Craft your subject line in a manner that won’t reveal too much information.</h3>\n<p>Opting for clickbait? Crafting your subject line will increase your open rate, sure, but that’s about it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m critical of the overly spammy subject line techniques that resurface every now and then. Don&#8217;t get anxiety; here is a thing or two about what makes a successful subject line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Let your prospects decide whether they’d like to open your email or not.</strong></h4>\n</li>\n<li>For them to be able to decide to click or not to click &#8212; you need to be clear on what your email is about.</li>\n<li>Being clear does <b>not</b> mean you need to give them any available information.</li>\n<li>Be clear but playful:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-164983 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png\" alt=\"sales email newsletter kat von d\" width=\"842\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png 842w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6-300x14.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6-260x12.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The above subject line comes from my personal inbox and is the perfect example of what I’m trying to say.</strong></p>\n<p>For example How many hours are left “a few hours?” I need to open the email to get the answer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write something opinionated. For example, “Video conferencing is the only way to hold conferences” or “Festive marketing is dead.”</li>\n<li><strong>Remember this truth:</strong> The truth is that an opinionated subject line may not attract all of the crowd, but it will attract the right crowd. The <strong>right crowd</strong> is who you&#8217;re looking for with cold email.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Utilize the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). You can create urgency:</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-164979 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2.png\" alt=\"fomo cold email\" width=\"514\" height=\"66\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2.png 514w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-300x39.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-260x33.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>With this FOMO &#8212; I fell into the trap, as expected.</li>\n<li>I saw something I couldn’t refuse &#8212; which was the offer.</li>\n<li>I also saw something that made me think that the offer’s gone.</li>\n<li>I <strong>had</strong> to click on the site and see what the offer was &#8212; and so will your customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The body copy of your email.</h2>\n<p>Let’s assume that the prospect loved your subject line and opened your email. That’s great; you managed to stand out in a full inbox. But how are you going to keep your prospects’ attention intact? One of your choices would be to use something other than words to attract just the right amount of attention without being overbearing.</p>\n<p>You can achieve this by adding pictures and GIFs to your email’s body copy.</p>\n<p>Let’s assume that you’re a band that has just released a new track. Instead of sending an email with the announcement, you can use video email marketing or send a <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a> type email with a picture of the album you’re referring to. Let your fans go about music streaming by just pressing a CTA button.</p>\n<h3>Have you studies your buyer persona?</h3>\n<p>Maybe your ideal customer likes text better because they’re old-fashioned like that? Your prospects are not reading your emails because they love reading. They’re reading your email because it provides a solution.</p>\n<p>As an example: Let’s say that you’ve got a blog post ready. The blog post talks about making money with affiliate marketing. Do you think that sending an announcement about your new blog post will make people want to read it?</p>\n<p>Of course not. But providing a snippet or a part of the solution you’re going to talk about, that will lead customers to the result they want.</p>\n<h3>If you want to make sure that you find an easy benefit that people will want, propose as a solution, something like starting an online business.</h3>\n<p>You can provide this solution by doing extensive research on your competitors’ <b>bad </b>reviews and then propose a solution already proposed by the consumers themselves. After all, buyers consider products that can turn them into the best version of themselves.</p>\n<p>If you apply the principle to business owners looking at a product, you&#8217;ll see that they are looking at the best version of their business and not a product itself.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’ve got a brick-and-mortar store, you’ll need to make your online presence known as well. 39% of customers visit a brand&#8217;s website before they purchase in a physical store. 9.6% of GenZ shoppers report buying items in a physical store, compared to Millennials.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>What could that mean, other than needing an eCommerce website builder? Something like that will be the optimal solution for your store, as well as a full eCommerce inventory guide.</p>\n<p>Best tip: Keep your message short and sweet. The readers won’t bother with lengthy text. If you need to showcase a demo of “the solution” you’re proposing, make it through a video.</p>\n<p>Your readers need to see the value of your cold email-and, by extension, the solution you’re trying to provide &#8212; upfront &#8212; don’t make them look for it. Usually, just a couple of sentences are more than enough.</p>\n<h2>Did you personalize at all?</h2>\n<p>Personalization goes way beyond just the first name on the subject line. You’ll need to compose tailor-made messages that will suit your prospects’ needs. And this is where segmentation comes into play.</p>\n<p>Let’s assume that you need to segment your list to the following categories: CEO, CFO, and employee.</p>\n<p>It’s easy enough to find with a little digging on the internet. Just make sure you’re using your data correctly. An employee that has just been promoted to CFO won’t appreciate the downgrade and, most likely, won’t go through with the email.</p>\n<h4>You need a different benefit of the product for all the different positions of your customers&#8217; persona.</h4>\n<p>If you’re about to talk to the Head of Sales of the company, you can provide a sales-y solution to making more money. Promote a digital customer loyalty program that will retain their recurring digital customers by offering sales and benefits, thus increasing their ARR.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, you’re about to talk to the CMO, make sure to let them know about the best SEO companies that can help them increase in growth for their marketing department’s SEO game. Of course, you can’t go ahead with that kind of hyper-personalization for every cold email campaign you’re going to be sending out &#8212; but you get the gist.</p>\n<p>If you’re dealing with very high-quality prospects, it’s worth the effort and the time, as it will look like you’re here to provide real solutions and that you’ve spent more than five minutes on research, rather than just wanting to score a quick sale.</p>\n<h2>Why should people trust you?</h2>\n<p>Are you looking here for answers to your questions &#8212; and not to answer someone else&#8217;s problems?</p>\n<h3>Answer these questions.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes you one-of-a-kind in your field?</li>\n<li>What makes you a person that people can trust or look up to?</li>\n<li>Why should people listen to you?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Capture your prospects’ attention by introducing yourself right from the beginning. Tell them why you are essential. Use a description that will build credibility. Your description could be a little sentence or a link to your social media profiles.</p>\n<p>If you’re an influencer, you can send a cold email that will be showcasing your tips. Can you show this customer how to be featured in social media influencers’ posts? Can you actually help people out?</p>\n<h4>With your tips and information, you will build credibility throughout the whole email.</h4>\n<p>The reason you need to build that credibility is straightforward: You need people to take the time and not just open your email, but actually read it. You want them to know that they can click on the links or CTA buttons, and they will achieve value. You help them achieve conversion rate optimization.</p>\n<p>The second reason you need to use your “trust badges,” would be to increase your engagement levels. Engagement levels mean that you are getting actual <b>responses </b>from your prospects.</p>\n<h2>Your CTA is essential.</h2>\n<p>Your CTA plays a <b>considerable</b> <b>part</b> in your success &#8212; from its look, down to the wording.</p>\n<p>The subject line and body copy should be precise, but just a little cryptic. Your CTA, on the other hand, needs to be super clear on the action your prospect needs to take. That way, you will reach your end goal.</p>\n<h4>No customer wants a hard sell.</h4>\n<p>While a customer may work in person or on the phone &#8212; it’s a lot easier to delete a cold email. Avoid selling &#8212; or even asking for a meeting &#8212; in your first email. <strong>Remember</strong>: you’re not going to sell on that first email &#8212; and perhaps not even on the second one.</p>\n<h4>Use the first email as an introduction or to build a relationship.</h4>\n<p>But be careful with what you’re trying to do.</p>\n<p>Instead of a sell, you could call your prospects to act on a straightforward step. “Check our guide,” or “Download our free eBook.”</p>\n<h4>Encourage your prospects to share your cold email with their friends or other employees.</h4>\n<p>If you include some referrals’ discount or exclusive benefit in your email, it would work like a charm and would reduce your <a href=\"https://www.profitwell.com/blog/saas-metrics-calculate-and-optimize-saas-mrr-churn\">MRR churn</a>, seeing as you’d always have new leads coming about without spending extra budget money to obtain them.</p>\n<p><b>Pro tip: </b>You can also go ahead and read all about the referral marketing definition and how it affects all businesses before trying it out on your own.</p>\n<p>Also, remember to use contrasting colors for your CTA buttons.</p>\n<h3>If there is no CTA button, <b>use bold letters</b>.</h3>\n<p>You should draw their attention, using contrasting colors. Make sure that they won’t miss your last message: What it is that they’re supposed to do.</p>\n<h2>Don’t forget to follow up</h2>\n<p>Your prospect took the time to read your email despite never having heard of you. They also took the time to see the value and, eventually, took the time to convert.</p>\n<p>You should at least send them a follow-up email to see how they enjoyed your product. This practice will lead your new (for now) leads further down the funnel and will eventually turn your customers into recurring customers.</p>\n<p>You can also follow-up if they haven’t responded to your email, thus earning yourself a second chance at engagement.</p>\n<p><b>Hint:</b> Most reply to those emails, so it would be a real shame not to utilize a follow-up.</p>\n<h3>One final thought</h3>\n<p>The last thing I’d like to share with you as a tip is something that you already know &#8212; but please do this.</p>\n<h4><b>Always</b> A/B test, my children, always A/B test.</h4>\n<p>Testing will lead to your best optimization, and will definitely, growth-hack your cold email game.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/14/how-to-send-the-warmest-cold-emails/\">How to Send the Warmest Cold Emails</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:53 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Send-the-Warmest-Cold-Emails.jpg","linkMd5":"5005215ff84cb48f666929fc4d9d6065","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-748_a512dcea1d6474c4.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Send-the-Warmest-Cold-Emails.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1260,"sourceBytes":551866,"destBytes":249604,"author":"Tea Liarokapi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Send-the-Warmest-Cold-Emails-300x197.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-14-420_520cf0a8c1b9855d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-14-549_b2ebd01b0604d6bc.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn67@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-11-240_e1c2c46fd30dec5d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image10.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-12-971_b85514fa6d591aed.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image8.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-11-940_5e3e12f6455f8cc2.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-13-382_375bef2c98c1f5b3.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-16-946_88158692bf35b9e7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195882940},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Social Media has had its Day","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166913","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/social-media-has-had-its-day/\" title=\"Social Media has had its Day\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"social media\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/24/where-does-social-media-think-its-going-now/\">Social media</a> was supposed to be the ultimate free speech platform, a place where the world would come together to swap information and share opinions. It would be the battleground of ideas. Someone would say something that looked sensible, face a challenge from someone with a different experience, and new facts, and the world would move forward with smarter and better thoughts. But the question is: has social media had its day?</p>\n<h2>Social Media hasn’t quite worked out the way we thought it would.</h2>\n<p>Twitter has become a playground for bots and trolls. Facebook is filled with misinformation, a place where foreign governments can set up groups to spread fake news.</p>\n<p>Saying something that isn’t in vogue won’t prompt someone else to say: “Huh, I never thought of it that way.” It’s more likely to produce a giant virtual pile-on that results in boycotts and ostracism. Who knew we were closed-minded? Who knew that no new opinioned could be offered or tried? &#8211;Zero&#8211; and</p>\n<p>The platforms themselves have struggled to cope, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/facebook-alex-jones-laura-loomer-ban/\">blocking some opinions</a> and taking flak from <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-right-wing-social-network/\">one side</a> or <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/facebook-audit-conservative-bias-amid-criticism-1469287\">the other</a>.</p>\n<h2>At the same time, users have retreated into their own bubbles.</h2>\n<p>Instead of coming to Facebook or Twitter to learn something new and obtain a fresh viewpoint, we listen to people who agree with our preconceptions, and misconceptions and who reinforce our prejudices.</p>\n<h2>Knowing we CAN&#8217;T STAND anything new &#8212; we GET nothing new.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3046111/why-scientists-are-upset-over-the-facebook-filter-bubble-study\">Algorithms</a> feed us more of the same. The constant reminders of why we’re right &#8212; seem to be satisfying to us. But always thinking the same way is not very educated &#8212; and having the same thoughts day in and day out won&#8217;t ever help to break down barriers or improve understanding.</p>\n<h3>Breaking down barriers was one of the big benefits that social media was supposed to deliver.</h3>\n<p>Sure, we can still keep in touch with old friends on Facebook and we can see what everyone is eating for breakfast on Instagram, but as information platforms, social media just isn’t working.</p>\n<h3>You think you are against censorship &#8212; well, you&#8217;re not &#8212; and you&#8217;ve proved it.</h3>\n<p>Brands have noticed that you want the same thing, too. According to one <a href=\"https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/2019-social-media-benchmark-report/\">study</a>, 2019 saw a fall in social media engagement of around 50 percent across a range of industries. People are turning off. We might still open an app and flick through a timeline but we’re less likely to stop and comment or like. Why? Because it&#8217;s the same old thing.</p>\n<h2>So what happens next? If social media has plateaued, what’s likely to replace it?</h2>\n<p>One clue lies in the rise of TikTok. A platform developed in China and subject, at least in part, to Chinese government censorship.</p>\n<p>Censorship might not look like the answer to social media’s free speech problem, but it avoids the issue altogether. It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve all been forcing on Social Media. Don&#8217;t have any free-thinking thoughts. Don&#8217;t say anything that might break down barriers and build understanding.</p>\n<h4>The content on the TikTok site is generally made up of young people dancing and lip-syncing.</h4>\n<p>Oh goodie! No sharing of dangerous views here where you&#8217;d be challenged. There’s just a sharing of fun and quirky clips that people want to watch and enjoy.</p>\n<p>Social networking as a whole might be under pressure but the media side of social media—the home-made videos spread between friends—that’s still working fine, and it’s likely to continue.</p>\n<h2>One way Social Media sharing will continue is in increased use of live video.</h2>\n<p>In 2018, about one in four Americans listened to at least one podcast every month. In 2019, that number had risen to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/media/podcast-growth.html\">one in three</a>. But podcasting is only audio and it only works in one direction.</p>\n<h4>Podcasters broadcast; listeners listen. Live video is also visual, and it’s interactive.</h4>\n<p>Viewers watch and listen, and they can also ask questions and engage with the speakers. Video might not be something you can use while jogging or driving to work, but it’s a lot more engaging than cable TV.</p>\n<h4>As brands find that their posts and pictures are ignored, expect more companies to turn to live engagement.</h4>\n<p>And as users find that they’re getting less back for the data they give, they’ll also be less willing to hand over that data. Why should they tell Facebook what they like, and who they are, and where they live, when Facebook won’t let them say what they think?</p>\n<p>Why give your data and information when it gives everyone a way to abuse you and gives a bash-fest-opening? How long will there be free-speech and free-thinking? &#8230;Not long.</p>\n<h4>We’re already seeing a <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">pushback</a> against data collection by nosy Web browsers.</h4>\n<p>If that giant pushback succeeds, it won’t be long before we start to see rival social media platforms that promise equal levels of privacy &#8212; even if it can’t deliver free-speech</p>\n<h2>These are strange times for social media.</h2>\n<p>On the one hand, the industry has succeeded and grown faster than just about any industry before it. On the other hand, despite being little more than <a href=\"http://sixdegrees.com/\">two decades old</a>, it’s already showing its cracks.</p>\n<p>A fantastic tool that has allowed so many people to talk to each other, entertain each other, and exchange news isn’t going to disappear. But its challenging environment and information bubble will mean that it’s about to evolve in a whole new direction.</p>\n<p>But, will we like it?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/social-media-has-had-its-day/\">Social Media has had its Day</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 16:00:42 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day.jpeg","linkMd5":"c55321cad2092cdaacdd20fb9848c3e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-731_aa4557a5a231b24e.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":43577,"destBytes":33200,"author":"Joel Comm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Social-Media-has-had-its-Day-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-13-044_e0dad251395c21de.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880903},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Best Mattress Brands of 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=165827","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/best-mattress/\" title=\"Best Mattress Brands of 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-300x167.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Best Mattresses of 2020\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-300x167.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-900x500.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-260x144.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-1536x854.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>It is no secret that sleep plays a significant role in our health and well-being. Recent <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449130/\">medical</a> reports show that healthy adults who suffer from short-term sleep issues experience increased stress response, pain, reduced quality of life, emotional distress, and mood disorders. Symptoms of long-term sleep disruption are even more alarming; these include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html\">1 in 3 US adults</a> getting less than adequate sleep, many mattress companies are working hard to provide sleepers with a solution.

It also comes in a Hybrid version.</i></p>\n<p>Amerisleep’s mattresses provide superior comfort and support. Amerisleep is a brand that understands individual needs vary and what works for one person may not work for another. To make shopping for a mattress as easy as possible, they have designed a line of 5 beds that vary in firmness.</p>\n<p>Based on your body type, preferred sleep position, and comfort needs, you can select <a href=\"https://amerisleep.com/mattresses.html\">one of their 5 mattresses</a>. The AS1 is their firmest mattress, while the AS2 is medium-firm and works well for back and stomach sleepers. Business Insider rates the AS2 “the best mattress for back pain.” The AS3 is their most popular mattress because of its medium firmness. Allure even calls Amerisleep’s AS3 one of the top mattresses to buy online. The firmness level of the AS3 makes it the perfect bed for combination, back, and side sleepers. The AS4 is a medium-soft mattress that features 4 inches of foam in the top layer. This layer makes it ideal for side sleepers who need extra cushioning around the hips and shoulders. Lastly, the AS5 is the softest option and is excellent for heavy sleepers.</p>\n<p>What makes Amerisleep mattresses so advanced? All of their beds feature an open-cell, Certi-PUR certified, plant-based memory foam that is eco-friendly, non-toxic, and breathable. Their covers feature FDA-determined Celliant technology, which is clinically proven to increase local blood flow and recovery. This unique material converts body heat into infrared light to encourage deeper sleep and faster healing. HIVE technology provides pressure-relieving support and spinal alignment. The unique construction offers a firmer feel and added comfort around the torso and hips. Around the areas where pressure points tend to develop, it allows for deeper compression and cushion.</p>\n<p>In addition to their state-of-the-art mattresses, they offer the <a href=\"https://amerisleep.com/adjustable-bed-gold-package.html\">Amerisleep Adjustable Bed</a>. This adjustable base allows you to change the angle of your head and feet through a wireless remote or in-app controls. In addition to head and foot articulation, the pillow tilting feature lets you angle your head so you can read or journal in bed. The controls come with Bluetooth compatibility so you can link to a smart home system too. Also, a preset button makes it easy to find your favorite position again and again. A “snore” button can help you quickly raise the upper portion of the bed to open up airways, and the “flat” button can take you from your preferred sleep position to a flat position with just the click of a button.</p>\n<p>This base features 8 USB ports so you can plug in your devices without the use of unsightly power strips, and the WallHugger technology means that you never have to stretch or strain to reach your nightstand. As the bed rises, the MicroHook retention system prevents the mattress from sliding or moving. A strip of tiny, gentle velcro located near the foot of the mattress keeps it firmly in place. Additionally, the adjustable legs that come with the Amerisleep foundation allow it to fit comfortably within most frames.</p>\n<p>While under bed lightly doesn’t necessarily enhance sleep, it can help those who frequently get up to use the restroom during the night. With a click of the “light” button on the remote, soft lighting under the bed will illuminate a pathway around the bed frame and to the bedroom door.</p>\n<p>To help you relax before sleep, this foundation comes with full-body massage capabilities. The massage feature has two main settings, regular and wave, and 3 different speeds, low, medium, and high. The gentle motion of the massage as you lay in a supportive mattress can be just what you need for a peaceful and relaxing sleep.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-165844\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress-900x562.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress-900x562.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress-300x187.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress-256x160.png 256w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress.png 1147w\" alt=\"Zoma Athletes Mattress\" width=\"900\" height=\"562\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://zomasleep.com\">Zoma Sleep</a></h3>\n<h4>Best Memory Foam Mattress: <a href=\"https://zomasleep.com/mattresses/zoma-mattress\">Zoma Sports Mattress </a></h4>\n<p><i>Looking for a supportive memory foam mattress? We recommend the Zoma Sports Mattress–it is engineered to help you sleep deeper and recover faster. </i></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://zomasleep.com/mattresses/zoma-mattress\">Zoma Sports Mattress</a> may seem like just another ordinary bed. But the makeup of the top and middle layers tell a different story. The Triangulex top layer features gel-infused memory foam, along with its specially engineered Triangulex. It’s a low-tech system featuring hundreds of precision-cut triangular segments that provide more cushion and as well as airflow directly under your body so you can sleep cool and comfortable.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the mattress, Zoma comes with its Reactiv layer which has latex-like properties. It bounces back fast and minimizes motion transfer and serves as a unique alternative to regular memory foam and latex foam.</p>\n<p>Although Zoma doesn’t offer any hi-tech accessories like an adjustable base or sleep sensors, it’s the materials, design, and foam layers incorporated directly into the mattress that make it an engineering marvel.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-167152\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-719x719.jpg\" alt=\"Vaya Memory Foam Mattress\" width=\"719\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-719x719.jpg 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-40x40.jpg 40w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-60x60.jpg 60w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VAYA-Foam-Mattress-King-Size-Hypoallergenic-Pure-Comfort-Mattress-Increased-CertiPUR-US/dp/B07ZK9SRMB/\">Vaya Mattress</a></h3>\n<h4>Best Mattress On Amazon: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VAYA-Foam-Mattress-King-Size-Hypoallergenic-Pure-Comfort-Mattress-Increased-CertiPUR-US/dp/B07ZK9SRMB/\">Vaya Mattress</a></h4>\n<p>The Vaya mattress is 12 inches tall and contains 3 inches of Vaya foam and 9 inches of base foam. The breathable polyester cover allows for more airflow, resulting in a soft, cool sleep surface.</p>\n<p>The latex-like feel of Vaya foam forms around the body, relieving pressure points. Vaya foam has a responsive bounce, which makes movement easier—sleepers will never feel “stuck” inside the mattress. It also encourages healthy spinal alignment by preventing unnatural sinkage.</p>\n<p>The base foam layer distributes body weight across the surface for even, consistent support without the risk of sagging. Plus, this base foam is durable enough to prevent wear and tear, ultimately helping to extend the life of the mattress.</p>\n<p>The Vaya mattress has a plush feel and is perfect for side and combination sleepers—the soft comfort of Vaya foam relieves pressure points, especially in the shoulders and hips, while providing even support for an overall better night’s sleep.</p>\n<p>The Vaya mattress comes with a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty, covering sagging greater than 0.75 inches.

The use of 100 percent organic materials makes this bed non-toxic and safe for allergy sufferers.</i></p>\n<p>Nest goes above and beyond to provide bedding that is organic, natural, and made in the USA. In addition to their child and pet line, they offer 6 different mattress types for adults. 3 of their mattresses feature latex foam technology. As we noted above, latex is one of the most sustainable materials available, so the use of latex makes these beds eco-friendly and non-toxic. The GOLS latex and GOTS organic cotton and wool in their <a href=\"https://www.nestbedding.com/products/certified-organic-mattress\">Hybrid Mattress</a> make this bed one of the most natural mattresses on the market. All of their hybrids use a pocketed coil system with reinforced edges to control motion transfer.</p>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-alexander-hybrid-signature-select-mattress\">Alexander Signature Hybrid</a> uses memory foam technology to provide a plush and supportive feel. To accommodate the heat-trapping issue that traditional memory foam tends to have, Nest uses a gel memory foam to absorb heat. The cover of the mattress features a thermic phase changing fabric to keep you at a comfortable temperature. This material absorbs heat when the temperature goes up. When the heat goes back down, the material slowly releases the heat.</p>\n<p>Nest also offers the <a href=\"https://www.nestbedding.com/products/nest-adjustable-base\">Reverie Adjustable Power Base</a>, which comes in 2 different models, the O300T and the R400. In addition to head and foot adjustability, the whisper-quiet lift system won’t wake you or your partner during the night. The controls feature an LED night light, a one-touch “flat” button for getting in and out of bed, and a preset zero gravity position button. For safety, an easy-click single-center retainer bar runs down the middle of the base and secures the mattress in place.</p>\n<p>The most significant difference between the O300T and the R400 is the inclusion of 3D-Wave massage technology in the R400. This technology has 3 wave modes and a full-body massage with a 1 to 10 intensity level. The R400 also features Bluetooth technology so you can make adjustments to the bed through your smart home system. Controls on the R400 also include the LED light button and 2 programmable preset positions. Plus, it includes a preset anti-snore, zero gravity, and flat positions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-165839\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1.jpg 768w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1-260x157.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1-825x500.jpg 825w\" alt=\"NordicTrack Mattress\" width=\"768\" height=\"465\" /></p>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.nordictrack.com/sleep\">NordicTrack Sleep</a></h3>\n<h4>Best Smart Mattress: <a href=\"https://www.nordictrack.com/sleep\">NordicTrack Mattress</a></h4>\n<p><i>For those considering a smart mattress, we recommend the NordicTrack Mattress. Thousands of sleep sensors track your sleep and provide you with valuable feedback.</i></p>\n<p>Although they are known for their high-caliber exercise equipment, NordicTrack has recently created a bed with sleep tracking abilities. Their mattress features 3 layers of foam: a dual-sided layer of CoolSupport and NovuGel technology, a layer of RightShape technology, and a layer of pocketed spring coils that are zoned to offer you support where you need it most.</p>\n<p>The RightShape technology is an advanced interlocking, dual-density foam with CoilFlex. CoilFlex uses pivoting microcoils that move left and right, up and down to absorb movement and reduce motion transfer. Certi-PUR and OEKO-TEX certification guarantee the materials are free of harmful chemicals.</p>\n<p>With this bed, you can also customize your firmness level. NordicTrack offers both a firm mattress or a plush option. According to its website, the plush option is a true medium on the firmness scale, while the firm is a firm to medium-firm.</p>\n<p>The NordicTrack mattress comes with superior sleep tracking technology that is powered by iFit. iFit is their interactive personal training software that is used in their exercise tools and on their app. Connected to a group of experts and trainers, it provides users with valuable health support. The iFit provides sleep coaching when connected to your NordicTrack Mattress. The sensors on the bed gather information on your heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep patterns and then sync these stats with your iFit app. The app then provides you with tips on how to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/20/expert-tips-10-ways-to-sleep-soundly-at-night/\">improve your sleep quality</a>. It can even connect you with a live sleep coach to discuss more complex issues.</p>\n<p>With the use of 2 different alarms, NordicTrack has taken care to ensure that your deep sleep state is never interrupted. Their FreshWake Alarm sounds when you are in the lightest part of your sleep cycle during your selected time frame. Their Continual Alarm will continue to sound until you get out of bed. If you get back into bed within 10 minutes, it will begin to sound again.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-165832\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-900x651.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-900x651.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-300x217.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-221x160.jpg 221w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-1536x1112.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress.jpg 1600w\" alt=\"Purple Mattress\" width=\"900\" height=\"651\" /></p>\n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://purple.com/\">Purple Mattress</a></h3>\n<h4>Most Responsive Mattress: <a href=\"https://purple.com/mattresses/purple-bed/buy-2\">Purple Mattress</a></h4>\n<p><i>When shopping with Purple, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/16/25-holiday-gifts-your-spouse-will-love/\">we recommend the Purple Hybrid Premier</a>. The 4 inches of the Purple Grid in this mattress provides no-pressure support and keeps you cool. </i></p>\n<p>Purple is a bed in a box brand that has recently gained popularity for its proprietary Purple Grid. The grid uses hyperelastic polymer molded into a grid pattern. It adapts to your body for an instant weightless feeling. The grid also encourages breathability through the use of open-air channels.</p>\n<p>All 3 of Purple’s mattresses feature their grid in various widths. Their original Purple mattress comes with 2 inches of the Purple Grid and a layer of CertiPUR-US certified foam for support. Next, the Purple Hybrid increases airflow through the mattress. This bed has 2 inches of the Purple Grid and a base made of patented Responsive Support Coils. The Purple Hybrid Premier is their most advanced mattress. It comes with the option of 3 or 4 inches of the Purple Grid on top of their standard coil system.</p>\n<p>A Purple mattress works best with the <a href=\"https://purple.com/adjustable-bed-frame\">Purple Power Base</a>. This foundation comes with head articulation and 3 adjustable height options for legs. The wireless remote offers a zero-gravity preset, 2 position presets, and under-bed lighting control.

Its state of the art technology allows you to preset the temperature of the mattress based on your preferences. </i></p>\n<p>Eight Sleep is known for innovation. Their two mattresses were some of the first to feature sensor technology that provides valuable feedback to sleepers. Eight currently offers two foam smart mattresses, each with various features.</p>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/product/smart-bed/\">Smart Bed</a>, is made of a Certi-PUR certified memory foam comfort layer and a polyfoam support layer that adds stability to the mattress. What makes this mattress “smart” is the inclusion of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/22/the-eight-sleep-tracker-a-smarter-way-to-get-quality-sleep/\">thousands of sensors</a> just under the comfort layer. These sensors track heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and sleep stages. You can track your sleep patterns from their smartphone app and even use it to adjust the temperature of the bed. Those who sleep with a partner can customize the temperature on their side of the bed. Smart alarms in the bed also detect the optimal point for waking, so you never have to worry about the disruption of critical sleep stages.</p>\n<p>Eight’s newest model is <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/product/pod/\">The Pod</a>. Like the Smart Bed, the Pod features a memory foam comfort layer and a polyfoam support layer. This mattress is a true medium on the firmness scale, making it suitable for most sleep positions.

We recommend the Kingsdown Sleep Smart Air mattress–a built-in layer of air helps you achieve the perfect firmness level.</i></p>\n<p>Kingsdown has been helping people find better sleep for over a decade. Using current sleep research, they have created a new mattress to accommodate a host of issues. Their <a href=\"https://kingsdown.com/collection/sleep-smart-air\">Sleep Smart Air</a> mattress is the latest addition to their line up of advanced beds. This mattress is a hybrid of foam layers and individually-wrapped innerspring coils reinforced to reduce motion transfer. The ventilated edge support improves air circulation through the use of Airflow channels around the perimeter of the bed.</p>\n<p>What makes this mattress so advanced is the use of IntelliMax, a customizable system with 3 support zones on each side of the bed. Each zone has its own wireless control. Once you lay down, their patented diagnostic system sends firmness recommendations based on your body type and sleep position straight to your phone. Using your suggestions, you can adjust the 3 support zones, including lumbar, head and neck, and knees, to your preferred firmness. This bed also has Bluetooth capabilities, so you can make adjustments from your smartphone or your smart home system.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Sleep Smart Air mattress, Kingdown’s <a href=\"https://kingsdown.com/collection/bodyperfect\">BodyPerfect</a> bed will also be released soon.

If you change to a new position as you sleep, the mattress will adjust the height and firmness levels to maintain proper alignment and provide support where you need it. This bed comes with an Android tablet loaded with the Kingsdown app to give you daily sleep statistics and feedback. The application also lets you set audio or visual alarms, preset your favorite firmness levels, and manage your sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>Both the Sleep Smart Air and the BodyPerfect mattress work well with the Kingsdown adjustable base.

The mattress options can feel endless but hopefully, this guide can help you order the right bed for your sleep requirements.</p>\n<h2>Innovative Trends In Mattress Technology</h2>\n<p>With trends coming and going so quickly, it is hard to know which mattress technology is worth your money. One of the recent phenomenons has been the explosion of bed-in-a-box companies. These brands send you a compact, vacuum-sealed mattress straight to your door–even if it’s a queen-size or king-size bed. Online mattress companies also offer <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/11/01/americas-sleep-problem-sponsored/\">different tech for a better night’s sleep</a>.</p>\n<p>Our list below outlines the most advanced tech being used in the top mattresses on the market.</p>\n<h3>Sleep Sensors</h3>\n<p>Some mattresses now feature sensors with sleep tracking abilities. These sensors measure your movements throughout the night to give a fuller picture of your sleep habits. Sensors can detect the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long it took you to fall asleep after climbing into bed</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many times you woke during the night</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of time you spent in each sleep stage</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time you spent in each sleep position</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How often you changed position during the night</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your heart rate, breathing cycle, and body temperature throughout the night</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some sensors can even monitor your environment to create a more serene sleep space. Based on the light and temperature in the room, they can suggest improvements to reduce sleep interruptions.</p>\n<p>Sensors synchronize with a smartphone application, so results are easy to access. This information can help sleepers improve their health, sleep habits, and environment.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>In addition to tracking your sleep, sensors can also adjust the lighting in your room. When getting out of bed during the night, sensors will trigger under-bed lighting so you don’t have to turn on additional lamps. When you get back into bed and relax, the lighting will slowly dim.</p>\n<h3>Temperature Control</h3>\n<p>Sleep sensor technology also allows a mattress to adjust the temperature on the surface of the bed automatically. For example, if you are prone to cold feet during the night, you can set this feature to warm the lower portion of the bed. If you tend to be a hot sleeper, you can set the surface of the bed at your preferred temperature so that it doesn’t increase or decrease as you sleep.</p>\n<h3>Adjustable Firmness</h3>\n<p>Air technology allows many companies to create mattresses with adjustable firmness. In fact, you can have both a firm side and a soft side to the bed if you like. Normally, sleepers use their smartphone app or wireless remote to inflate or deflate air pressure within the bed. Some mattresses even use sensors to adjust the firmness as you change sleeping positions through the night. Additionally, separate adjustments can also be made on each side of the bed, making this ideal for couples. That way, you get pressure-relieving support in all areas of your body.</p>\n<h3>Copper Infusion</h3>\n<p>Mattresses with copper infusion can pull heat away from your body. Copper is also antibacterial and antimicrobial to stop the build-up of harmful bacteria and allergens. Since evidence shows that copper can help control inflammation, it can also improve joint pain and stiffness.</p>\n<h3>Celliant</h3>\n<p>This material is FDA-determined to regulate body temperature and promotes circulation. Celliant contains 13 thermo-reactive minerals that turn body heat into infrared energy. When absorbed by the body, this energy can improve local circulation and recovery. This helps you wake with fewer aches and pains. Since some mattresses can trap heat, this technology works to keep you cool throughout the night.</p>\n<h3>Memory Foam Technologies</h3>\n<p>Many mattresses feature some type of foam; however, the quality of the foam varies greatly. Some brands now use technology to improve the feel and support that foam can provide. For example, memory foam is well-known for its ability to relieve pain by delivering weightless support. But plant-based memory foam is a relatively new feature.</p>\n<p>Plant-based memory foam uses the oils of soybeans and other vegetables. Traditional memory foam uses only petroleum-based chemicals for construction. The benefit of this technology is that it produces a cleaner, non-toxic, and eco-friendly sleep space. Unlike traditional memory foam, plant-based memory foam is breathable and keeps you cool. Certi-PUR plant-based foams are free of harmful chemicals like CFCs, formaldehyde, phthalates, PBDEs, and are low in VOCs. These mattresses are a good option for those who suffer from allergies.</p>\n<h3>Latex Foam Technologies</h3>\n<p>Although latex has been around for many years, its use in mattresses is relatively new. During latex production, rubber trees are tapped, not cut down. This process makes latex one of the most sustainable mattress materials available. Although latex is natural, some latex foams use synthetic chemicals. Therefore, it is essential to look for GOLS certified latex.</p>\n<p>What makes some latex foams more advanced is the addition of graphite and gel into the foam. Graphite, a well-known heat conductor, can quickly dissipate body heat when used in a mattress. Gel infusion allows the bed to absorb body heat and release it into the air.</p>\n<h3>Electronic Synchronization</h3>\n<p>Many beds can be synced with other electronics in your home by using a smartphone application and a wifi connection. For example, when you wake in the morning, sensors in your bed can signal your lights and your coffee maker to come on. As you climb into bed each night, synchronization can lower lights and adjust your thermostat.</p>\n<h3>Adjustable Foundations</h3>\n<p>In addition to advanced mattress technology, many sleep brands offer adjustable bed frames that add even more comfort to your bed.</p>\n<h4>Head and Foot Articulation</h4>\n<p>For many years, hospitals have been using adjustable foundations to promote healing. Although new technology is much more advanced, the science behind it is the same. When sleepers can adjust their head and legs, they can find a sleep position that is suited to their needs.</p>\n<p>Whether sitting, standing, or moving around, gravity pulls your body downward throughout the day. Sleeping with elevated legs can give the feet and legs a break so that blood can flow more freely throughout the body. Additionally, the increased blood flow to the heart and other major organs improves their function. Raising the knees at night can also decrease symptoms of back pain and sciatic nerve pain. This works by reducing the pressure that the lumbar discs put on the nerves and spine.</p>\n<p>Elevating the head at night has also been known to help with various medical conditions. With the head raised, there is less chance of post-nasal drip, and the nasal passages are more open. Since an elevated head improves breathing, it also reduces snoring and symptoms of sleep apnea. For heart-related concerns, an elevated head can improve breathing and promote healthy sleep.</p>\n<h4>Zero-Gravity Position</h4>\n<p>Some adjustable beds also feature a zero-gravity position. With this position, the head and legs rise to a level that evenly distributes body weight. This prevents the sleeper from feeling the push and pull of gravity. When this happens, the body feels weightless and wholly relaxed. Some adjustable beds come with a preset zero-gravity button. But you can also achieve this position by adjusting the head and foot of the bed.</p>\n<h4>Pillow Tilting</h4>\n<p>Along with leg and head adjustments, some foundations also have pillow tilting. This change enables you to alter the angle of the pillow independently from the other parts of the bed.</p>\n<h4>WallHugger Technology</h4>\n<p>As you raise the head of an adjustable foundation, the bed naturally moves forward, away from the wall. This forward movement also takes the sleeper away from their nightstand. WallHugger technology corrects this issue. WallHugger technology allows the bed to remain next to the wall as the head raises. This change allows you to reach your nightstand easily and safely.</p>\n<h4>Programmable Positions and Snore Buttons</h4>\n<p>Once you find the perfect position, some beds can save those specifications as a preset. Presets ensure that you can find the same comfort night after night.</p>\n<p>The snore button elevates the upper section of the bed to a 7-degree angle. This small change can open up restricted airways and reduce snoring. If you or your partner snore, a press of the snore button can allow for modification without waking.</p>\n<h4>Massage Function</h4>\n<p>Once you climb into bed, stress from the day can make it difficult for you to relax. To help sleepers release tension, some foundations now feature a gentle massage function. <a href=\"https://www.amtamassage.org/approved_position_statements/Massage-Therapy-Can-Help-Improve-Sleep.html\">Research</a> shows that massage can improve sleep and reduce symptoms of insomnia.</p>\n<h4>In-App Controls &#38; Bluetooth Capability</h4>\n<p>Many adjustable foundations come with a smartphone app to adjust the bed. The position of the bed, the lighting, and the massage features can be all changed right from your phone.</p>\n<p>By linking your phone through Bluetooth or wifi, adjustments can be voice-controlled. Some beds come with a control box or allow you to pair with an existing home system. With this feature, you can tell the bed what you would like it to do.</p>\n<h4>USB Ports</h4>\n<p>Many of us prefer to charge our phones overnight. But trying to position your bed near an outlet can often prove to be difficult. USB ports built into the foundation of the bed make it easy for you to change your device right from bed.</p>\n<h2>Sleep Trackers vs. Sleep Enhancers</h2>\n<p>Many of the above features can make your sleep routine easy and comfortable. It is important to remember that these features don’t necessarily improve sleep quality. The most important thing to consider is the support the bed can provide. If you tend to wake with back pain, you need a mattress with a firmness level that can support your body’s needs. To give your back more lumbar support, an adjustable foundation may do the trick. But above all, the bed has to fit your needs.</p>\n<p>Sensors that track our sleep habits can improve sleep quality. If it takes a while for you to fall asleep, you can improve this by doing reading or journaling before bed. If you often wake up hot, tracking information can help you adjust the temperature.</p>\n<p>But, it can be dangerous to focus too much on sleep tracking results. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/technology/personaltech/sleep-tracking-devices-apps.html\">Studies</a> show that sleepers often become obsessed with achieving the perfect night’s sleep. This pressure only adds to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/17/4-effective-ways-to-manage-work-stress/\">stress and anxiety</a>. This condition is called orthosomnia. It occurs when the desire for “good” sleep ends up preventing sleep.</p>\n<h2>Other Things to Consider Before Buying A New Mattress</h2>\n<p>With these 8 top mattress brands in mind, you may begin to wonder how they can accommodate your specific concerns. Chances are, you have more needs than whether it can track your sleep patterns. Your preferred sleep position, body type, and health are important to keep in mind as you shop for the perfect mattress. You will also want to consider whether you prefer a firmer or softer feeling bed. To help you along the way, we outlined a few tips below so you can find the right mattress.</p>\n<h3>How Long Does A Good Mattress Last?</h3>\n<p>Most good mattresses come with a 10-warranty, some can even go up to 20 years. But, it is important to remember that this number does not reflect the life of the mattress. Warranties usually cover manufacturing issues, not normal wear and tear. Innerspring mattresses last between 5 to 8 years and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/18/best-memory-foam-mattress/\">memory foam beds</a> will last about 10 years. Natural latex mattresses tend to have the longest life at around 12 to 15 years.</p>\n<h3>When Should You Buy A New Mattress?</h3>\n<p>If you are sleeping on an old mattress, you may be experiencing pain or a decrease in sleep quality. Rips, sagging, bunching, broken coils, or indents, are a sign that it is time to replace your mattress. Even if it’s flippable, you might still want to upgrade to a better bed since the bottom side might not last very long. As you start to shop for a new mattress, keep in mind the areas that you were unhappy about with your old one. This will ensure that you get these sleep needs met with your next bed.</p>\n<h3>What Are the Most Common Mattress Types?</h3>\n<p>The 7 best mattress brands above use technology to produce a higher quality bed. But each brand features a range of mattress types, including foam and hybrid. How do you know which type of mattress is best for you? Besides technology trends, you should keep in mind the 4 most common mattress options. Our guide will help you determine which type will suit your needs.</p>\n<h4>Memory Foam</h4>\n<p>Memory foam is a responsive, low-density foam used in the comfort layer of many mattresses. To support this layer, many beds use a high-density foam in the base layer. Flippable memory foam beds feature the support layer in the middle of the mattress. Since these mattresses don’t have a pillow top, you are able to flip them to decrease wear and tear. But, some don’t need flipping since their layers and materials are more durable.</p>\n<p>Memory foam contours to the body and provides pressure-free support. The pain-relieving abilities these mattresses provide has helped them gain popularity. The responsiveness of the foam keeps you supported as you change positions.</p>\n<p>A common complaint with memory foam is their tendency to trap heat. So, look for a mattress with a cooling feature such as Celliant or open-cell memory foam.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is you’ll want to make sure the layers of foam help you sleep cool and comfortable.</p>\n<h4>Latex Foam</h4>\n<p>As we mentioned above, latex mattresses are eco-friendly and produce fewer environmental pollutants. Latex has more elasticity than memory foam so sleepers may feel more lifted on these beds.</p>\n<p>Latex is also hypoallergenic and resistant to mold, dust mites, and bacteria. The natural bounce of latex also makes these beds durable; they often have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years.</p>\n<h4>Hybrid Mattress</h4>\n<p>Hybrid mattresses are a combination of memory or latex foam and an innerspring coil base. These beds have several inches of foam in the comfort layer and a coil system as its base support.</p>\n<p>A hybrid is also more breathable since air can flow through the innerspring system. Look for a hybrid with reinforced perimeters so that you don’t fall off the side during the night.</p>\n<h4>Innerspring Mattress</h4>\n<p>None of the 8 brands listed above fall into this mattress category. But because innerspring beds have been common for so many years, it is important to include them here. Due to their low price point, innerspring mattresses tend to be very popular. Yet, they also have the lowest customer satisfaction reviews. With more advanced mattress technology, innerspring beds are falling out of favor.</p>\n<p>Innerspring beds feature steel or Bonnell coils. Some innerspring mattresses have coils pocketed with fabric such as cotton or wool. Since these beds lack the contouring ability of foam, they do not offer as much support. Spring coils within the bed can become broken over time, causing them to stick up and poke you.</p>\n<p>Innerspring beds may also come with quilted tops or pillow tops so sleepers don’t feel the coils directly underneath.</p>\n<h3>How Do Sleeping Positions Determine A Good Mattress?</h3>\n<p>The position that you favor night after night can tell a lot about which mattress might work best for you. No matter how you prefer to sleep, there is a more advanced mattress suited to your needs. Below, we highlight the most common sleep positions and what to look for when shopping for a mattress.</p>\n<h4>Side Sleepers</h4>\n<p>Side sleeping is the most popular and healthiest way to sleep. Side sleepers experience reduced acid reflux, reduced snoring, and improved digestion.</p>\n<p>Side sleepers often run the risk of developing pressure points in the hip and shoulders. Because of this, they should shop for a mattress that provides extra cushion to these areas to avoid this. A medium to soft all-foam bed works great for this. Hybrid mattresses can also work well for side sleepers. But, they should avoid innerspring mattresses since they don’t provide adequate pressure relief.</p>\n<h4>Back Sleepers</h4>\n<p>Back sleeping is excellent for keeping the hips and the spine aligned. Those who prefer this position often experience fewer pressure points. This is due to the even weight distribution across the surface of the mattress.</p>\n<p>Back sleepers should look for a bed that offers an even surface and a firmer feel to prevent sinking. An all-foam or hybrid mattress that rates firm to medium-firm on the scale should fit the bill.</p>\n<h4>Stomach Sleepers</h4>\n<p>Stomach sleeping angles your head and neck in a way that makes it difficult for your spine to remain neutral. This position tends to strain the spine. So, stomach sleepers are more likely to experience back and neck pain. Therefore, it is best to avoid sleeping this way whenever possible.</p>\n<p>If it is difficult to change, stomach sleepers should rest on a mattress that is on the firm side. An all-foam or hybrid mattress that is firm to medium-firm will work best.</p>\n<h4>Combination Sleepers</h4>\n<p>It is not uncommon to prefer various sleep positions throughout the night. For this, you should opt for a mattress that is a true medium on the firmness scale. These beds are often suitable for most sleep positions. You’ll want to avoid a bed with a firm feel as it won’t offer the contouring comfort you need when you turn to your side.</p>\n<h3>What is the Ideal Mattress Price?</h3>\n<p>Mattresses with more advanced technology will cost more than traditional beds. Customers can expect to pay between $1,000 and $6,000 for a high-quality mattress. Adjustable foundations sold alone will cost between $1,800 and $4,000 for a queen size. Some brands sell adjustable beds and mattresses in a package for a more affordable price. You can even price-compare between a retailer’s pricing and Amazon’s pricing. Most of the time though, you’ll get the best sleep trials, warranty policies, and more by purchasing directly with the mattress manufacturer than through marketplaces like Amazon.</p>\n<h3>What Are Common Health Benefits Considerations?</h3>\n<p>Individuals with a medical condition that prevents sleep may find relief with a more advanced bed. Head and foot articulation can increase blood flow and improve breathing. This is beneficial for poor circulation, or when recovering from surgery or injury. A temperature control feature can help to reduce inflammation and prevent nighttime waking.</p>\n<h3>What If You Have An Active Lifestyle?</h3>\n<p>Those who live an active lifestyle will want a restorative and comfortable mattress. Celliant technology and supportive foam allow athletes to wake up refreshed and energized. Monitoring technology also helps athletes optimize their sleep schedules. Temperature control can reduce inflammation from strenuous workouts.</p>\n<h3>What Is A Good Sleep Trial?</h3>\n<p>Purchasing a mattress is an important decision, so you want to be sure that you are happy with your new bed. A sleep trial period can allow you to try out the mattress in the comfort of your home. It takes about 2 weeks to a month to become accustomed to a new mattress. So you will want to be sure that you have adequate time to test the bed. Be cautious of a trial period that is anything less than 30 days. Many online mattress brands now offer a 90-day sleep trial (or longer), so a good sleep trial is not hard to find.</p>\n<h3>What Are the Best Return Policies?</h3>\n<p>Be sure that the mattress comes with a return policy. If you decide to return or exchange your mattress, you want to verify that you have that option. Most companies will pick up the bed for donation and issue you a refund. This ensures that you end up with the right mattress for your personal sleep needs.</p>\n<p>In some cases, companies even offer mattress toppers for added comfort. This is a great option if you want to find a way to keep your bed and don’t want to return your mattress.</p>\n<h3>What Warranty Should I Expect From My Mattress Purchase?</h3>\n<p>The industry standard for a mattress is a 10-year warranty. In some cases, prorated coverage is available. Prorated coverage applies to any manufacturing defects after the initial warranty has lapsed. That way, customers later pay only a percentage of the repair. Most mattresses have a lifespan of 5 to 8 years. So a lifetime warranty is unnecessary and doesn’t add value to the mattress. If you still sleep on an old mattress, consider an upgrade. The technology available years ago may not be as advanced as what’s now offered among modern bed-in-a-box brands.</p>\n<p>Sensor technology may include a separate warranty to cover the electronic aspect. These warranties generally last between 1 to 5 years.</p>\n<h2>Final Takeaways</h2>\n<p>The best mattress doesn’t need to have high-tech additions to provide better rest. Sometimes low-tech sleep solutions deliver the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>But don’t settle for a plain bed without any features like those we listed above. There are hundreds of quality mattress options to choose from.</p>\n<p>Remember your mattress should be comfortable, supportive, and suited to your personal needs. The best mattress brands we highlighted feature new mattress technology to provide more restorative sleep. If you are suffering from sleep loss, do yourself a favor and upgrade to a more advanced mattress.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/best-mattress/\">Best Mattress Brands of 2020</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:00:18 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3.jpg","linkMd5":"196a45860e9b357bc6957b0436eac79b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-22-135_dc752d86a032a53d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1067,"sourceBytes":93186,"destBytes":71056,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/amerisleep-unboxing-as3-300x167.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-10-515_dabeba481468b755.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amerisleep-AS3-1-900x604.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-030_7a53db06a2a912c8.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Zoma-Athletes-Mattress-900x562.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-11-973_e4ffc0fa7f41b156.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vaya-Mattress-719x719.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-20-086_395fb5084b56f1fe.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Nest-Bedding-Mattress-900x401.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-11-904_196ee4fe748592a6.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NordicTrack-Mattress-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-10-642_c9d54013719765e6.jpg","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Purple-Mattress-900x651.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-28-272_fdb6a4ccb0bcc109.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EightSleep-Mattress-900x600.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-11-088_8a5d0f35f16922dd.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kingsdown-Sleep-Smart-Air-900x553.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-19-111_37f2ab74d65d01a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878339},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"7 Best Tools to Create a Highly Productive Work Environment","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173316","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/31/7-best-tools-to-create-a-highly-productive-work-environment/\" title=\"7 Best Tools to Create a Highly Productive Work Environment\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Best-Tools-to-Create-a-Highly-Productive-Work-Environment-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"tools productive work\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Best-Tools-to-Create-a-Highly-Productive-Work-Environment-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Best-Tools-to-Create-a-Highly-Productive-Work-Environment-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Best-Tools-to-Create-a-Highly-Productive-Work-Environment-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-Best-Tools-to-Create-a-Highly-Productive-Work-Environment.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Most businesses work on several projects and the work requirements keep on changing every now and then.

There are many efforts put in by all the governments to control these situations and make things easy for people. Most of the businesses are completely at a halt and have no way of earning revenue at this time. Students are stuck inside their homes, many of them have not even been given their exams. Here are the impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and technology.</p>\n<h3>It seems that everything is mismanaged and there are still things that are scaring everyone around the world.</h3>\n<p>Talking about sustainable resources we get to know that they are not being properly utilized and because of that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/rise-of-scams-after-coronavirus-outbreak/\">there will be negative impacts</a>. All the stations that generate energy will shut down way early as they will not be able to circulate the extra energy. There will be an accumulation of resources and that will create disbalance.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on the technology sector.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171144 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19.jpg\" alt=\"Impacts of COVID-19\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19.jpg 800w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19-260x146.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Impact of COVID-19 over Industry</h3>\n<p>Many people are thinking about how COVID is affecting all industries. If we <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/01/5-conversational-ai-companies-tackling-covid-19/\">look at the enterprises that deal with these resources</a> we will get to know the loss they are facing. No petroleum company is getting any revenue other than LPG. Transportation and Industries are at a halt and hence, electricity and fuel are not getting used &#8212; all of these happenings affect the sustainability of that industry.</p>\n<p>There is one thing that is still giving relief to organizations and people around the world “Technology.” Without technology, everything would have been ten times harder for all of us right now. Many enterprises are being able to continue work by working from home. People who can provide services digitally are working, schools and colleges are working.</p>\n<p>There are only a few <a href=\"https://www.theodysseyonline.com/impact-of-coronavirus-on-business\">types of enterprises that are at complete halt</a> otherwise most of them are working. Almost all enterprises can utilize this time for marketing as most people are using the internet. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/digital-marketing-coronavirus/\">Digital marketing</a> is at its rescue. There are so many things that technology has done for people in this hard time. It is providing ways to learn new things, entertainment as well as all the important news.</p>\n<h3><b>Technology and sustainability are being the part of well being of providing solutions of COVID-19</b></h3>\n<p>Technology can only be beneficial to the environment only if it goes hand in hand with sustainability. There are people who are confined to their houses and not able to leave. In this scenario, only technology is helping them to work and connect with each other.</p>\n<p>People all around the world are learning new and very different lifestyles. Such as the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/15/new-data-shows-covid-shifts-newly-remote-work-behavior/\">remote style of working</a> and its challenges, remote and online schooling of children, and a whole different lifestyle in general due to the crisis happening worldwide.</p>\n<p>Technology is greatly helping in coping up with stress and dealing with this new lifestyle. But when it comes to sustainability and climate change challenges, it is well-known that the virus has not spared political, geographical or religious boundaries. But like every cloud has a silver lining, this virus too has made some positive changes as per technology and sustainability perspective.</p>\n<h3><b>Role of technology in coronavirus crisis.</b></h3>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/03/share-other-health-data-in-real-time-like-its-a-pandemic/\">help of technology</a>, the world is running all of its businesses and other services. Advanced technology is helping to get reliable information about the happenings of the world. Other than that, people rely on technology to connect with their family, friends and loved ones.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, it has become the only source of entertainment as there are no ways to go out during nationwide lockdowns. People all around the world are learning new skills, getting updated, checking on to close people, and doing all that is necessary through technology only. Thus, it is being observed that it is providing extraordinary support to mitigate the negative effects of coronavirus in today’s scenario.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><b> Good health and well-being.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technology is helping people with treatment at home. There are many IoT applications that are allowing healthcare companies to check and provide treatment to people remotely. People can also order medicines and test kits to their home and get treatment for most of the things. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/thanks-covid-remote-work-is-now-mandatory/\">Remote treatment facilities have been improved</a> and this is all because of the innovation and advancement in technology during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Scientists and developers are still working hard to offer people and healthcare companies with solutions that can help to keep everyone healthy in these hard times. It would never have been possible without the collaboration of healthcare services and technology.</p>\n<p>There are many things that people have realized and there are many more to come. After this pandemic, most of the people will keep using these and there will be many benefits to both doctors and patients because of this. This will solve the problem of waiting for patients and crowded hospitals.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Quality education.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no denial about the fact that there are many bad effects of closing down the educational institutes. Not just because children are not getting the education they need but also because of other things. There are many schools and colleges that provide shelter and food to many poor students, these are the places where many refugees stay.</p>\n<p>All those people needed to vacate them and now they are struggling to stay alive, they do not have anything to survive on. But there are many positive impacts too and no one can ignore them. Colleges and schools have realized that they can teach no matter what happens.</p>\n<p>Online lectures and examinations are working and that is keeping the flow going. There are many institutes that have created interactive courses that students can study at their own time and at their own pace, just like online course websites did. Most of the people have realized the importance of online courses and certifications. It is very easy to study remotely, although it is no replacement to in-class study still, it is a way to keep things going in the hard times.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Responsible usage and production.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Responsible usage and production are some of the things that would not have been possible without this pandemic. There are so many retailers and traders who will have to re-plan their supply strategies.</p>\n<p>There are many products that they discard or don’t pay attention to as they go out of trend or are not as usable as they were in the past, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/14/iot-and-commerce-how-new-technology-is-shaping-the-way-we-shop/\">these products get wasted</a> and so does the resources and material used to make them. In this time all these products can be used.</p>\n<p>There are chances that in the times to come these products can be on the high demand lists. This will improve the reusability and the way people use things. There will be a balance in production activities too.</p>\n<p>More old material and products will be reused to make the new ones. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/how-blockchain-is-revolutionizing-the-supply-chain-industry/\">supply chain will also see a change</a> as there will be all the products that people didn’t buy in the past. This is now the time when people need things in any way possible.</p>\n<p>Producing new things will take time and also money and both of them are not available the way people want. This is a good opportunity to recover the losses and manage the way the sales activities take place in the future. The government is also paying attention to these types of options. It will help them in managing things and there will be no scarcity of resources.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Partnerships among enterprises.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is a very smart step taken by many enterprises already that they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/17/10-effective-marketing-tips-to-promote-your-product-on-instagram-in-2019/\">have collaborated with other</a> enterprises that helps them in working remotely. This is the time that provides people with so many partnership opportunities and it is all for the good.</p>\n<p>Both consumers and businesses will get benefits from these kinds of partnerships. There are companies that can create 3D and AI-based applications that can help their clients and consumers understand things in a better way. These solutions are empowering enterprises to grow exponentially.</p>\n<p>With each other’s help and constant hard work, enterprises in the world can reach the places that will help them a lot after all this ends. Many enterprises need solutions to deploy their services and products in the market. It is needed that they collaborate with some enterprise that can help.</p>\n<p>The way partnerships are being made and the opportunity that is still left is something that will make things better for everyone. The government is also asking for partnerships with enterprises that can help them and the country in this hard time.</p>\n<h3><b>Impact of COVID-19 on sustainability</b></h3>\n<p>Above mentioned are the positive results that coronavirus brought to humans. The virus has also created a fresh and unimaginable impact on the nature and sustainability of the resources. The only way to prevent the virus from spreading is physical distancing.</p>\n<p>For practicing physical distancing, countries have opted for lockdown in which only essential duties will be followed and the rest of the people will stay in quarantine and work remotely.</p>\n<p>Due to distancing, there has been a drastic change in the way of living. Though people are still adjusting to this new lifestyle, it has been a boon for mother nature. There has been a significant drop in the consumption of electricity, gas and oil. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/04/what-truckers-know-about-the-oil-price-trend-and-its-impact/\">Vehicles are being used less</a> which is why energy is being consumed less and the pollution levels are decreased at significant levels.</p>\n<h5><b>Conclusion</b></h5>\n<p>Sustainable development can only happen if there is a perfect balance between technology, sustainability, and consumption. One must understand that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/rise-of-scams-after-coronavirus-outbreak/\">even after this pandemic ends</a>, it is important to be cautious about saving the energy for future generations and using renewable resources as much as possible.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/06/the-impacts-of-covid-19-on-sustainability-and-technology/\">The Impacts of COVID-19 on Sustainability and Technology</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 06 Jun 2020 18:00:44 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Impacts-of-COVID-19-on-Sustainability-and-Technology.jpg","linkMd5":"234e51f5add4b3d0c9ce433816ecad36","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-25-574_aeabaee32379fbfd.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Impacts-of-COVID-19-on-Sustainability-and-Technology.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":76963,"destBytes":71060,"author":"Dharmendra Chahar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Impacts-of-COVID-19-on-Sustainability-and-Technology-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-11-329_9094d0aeb51b796e.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impacts-of-COVID-19.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-16-017_bbdcb9d8fe9cd5b2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876268},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"The Biggest Cybersecurity Mistakes Businesses Are Still Making","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172105","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/the-biggest-cybersecurity-mistakes-businesses-are-still-making/\" title=\"The Biggest Cybersecurity Mistakes Businesses Are Still Making\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biggest-Cybersecurity-Mistakes-300x149.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"The Biggest Cybersecurity Mistakes Businesses Are Still Making\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biggest-Cybersecurity-Mistakes-300x149.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biggest-Cybersecurity-Mistakes-260x129.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biggest-Cybersecurity-Mistakes.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Despite evidence of multi-billion-dollar cybersecurity vulnerabilities in some of the world’s most trusted organizations, businesses still aren’t taking cybersecurity seriously. Big corporations are finding reasons to skimp on their cybersecurity budgets, cutting costs rather than investing in their infrastructure, and small business owners are simply negligent of the threat that cybersecurity issues present.</p>\n<p>So why is cybersecurity still so underutilized and underappreciated, and what are the most common mistakes business owners are making?</p>\n<h3>Failing to Take Cybersecurity Seriously</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest issues here is that business owners continue to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/24/cybersecurity-best-practices-7-ways-to-secure-your-data-in-2020/\">not take cybersecurity seriously</a>—or at least not take it seriously enough. For big businesses, this is due to a combination of factors. For example, they may already be spending millions of dollars on IT teams and cybersecurity tools, and they may not have a barometer for whether or not this investment is “enough.” They may also struggle to see the results of their investments; after all, if your cybersecurity strategy is working, you won’t be the target of any major attacks or hacks.</p>\n<p>On top of this, big organizations often struggle with departmental silos. Cybersecurity experts find themselves isolated from the rest of the organization, unable to provide direction or advice or limited in their abilities to influence the organization. Accordingly, people in other departments don’t give cybersecurity much thought.</p>\n<p>For small businesses, the prevailing attitude is “we’re too small to be a target,” even though small businesses are some of the most common targets for cybercriminals. When faced with a steep bill for even the most basic cybersecurity measures, small businesses are disinclined to spend the money.</p>\n<p>In any case, if a business doesn’t treat cybersecurity as important, they aren’t going to do enough to protect themselves.</p>\n<h3>Treating Cybersecurity Reactively Instead of Proactively</h3>\n<p>For cybersecurity to be effective, it needs to be done proactively. You need to put in the work long before you suffer from a data breach or opportunistic attack; if you wait until you know for sure you’re a possible victim, it will already be too late.</p>\n<p>This is the difference between proactive and reactive cybersecurity. After suffering a data breach, companies are much more keen to invest in the infrastructure necessary to prevent another, similar attack in the future; but if they had done this in the first place, they could have saved millions, if not billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>It’s much better to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/30/how-to-create-an-effective-cybersecurity-routine/\">make cybersecurity a routine</a>—something you invest in and improve continuously, even when things seem quiet.</p>\n<h3>Establishing Cybersecurity as a Separate Department</h3>\n<p>It’s tempting to think of cybersecurity as its own department, or as a subsection of your IT department. This approach allows you to hire experts in the field, and funnel funding specifically toward this cause. While this isn’t necessarily a bad strategy, this can be misleading—and possibly leave you open to attacks in other areas.</p>\n<p>Instead, cybersecurity is something that’s best executed with teamwork and collaboration. For example, <a href=\"https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/3-devops-security-challenges-how-to-overcome-them\">teams employing DevOps practices</a> often work hard to ensure that security is incorporated into every stage of the development process—and isn’t simply shoehorned in at the end.</p>\n<p>The big problem you’re trying to solve is that security vulnerabilities exist everywhere, in every department of your organization and with every individual. Only by working together will you be able to reduce these vulnerabilities to a minimum.</p>\n<h3>Implementing Bad Password Practices</h3>\n<p>Speaking of individual vulnerabilities, too many modern organizations still suffer from bad password practices. The majority of cyberattacks and digital breaches aren’t because of an insanely skilled hacker, but instead are due to an individual (possibly an unskilled one) finding, guessing, or stealing a password. With the right login credentials, anyone can be considered a “hacker.”</p>\n<p>Password strategies can go wrong in many ways. Your people may choose weak or easy-to-guess passwords, like those that feature common words or predictable series of numbers. They may fail to update those passwords on a regular basis. Or they may have bad habits related to password storage; for example, they may keep a list of passwords written down on a sticky note by their desk.</p>\n<p>Some organizations also use organization-wide passwords, copying and pasting the same sequences for all people across all platforms. This leads to a massive vulnerability.</p>\n<h3>Choosing the Wrong Software</h3>\n<p>There’s also something to be said for choosing the “right” software for your organization. Most companies need a variety of different tools to operate effectively, including CRM platforms, project management platforms, and communication platforms. Each of these is going to represent a potential point of vulnerability; these apps store information related to your business, and if breached, could represent a real problem for you.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, you’ll need to think carefully about the tools you use. Pay attention to the reputation of the developers, and find out what kind of security measures are available; for example, some apps will employ features like <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/21/artificial-intelligence-a-tool-or-a-threat-to-cybersecurity/\">AI designed for cybersecurity</a>, or robust encryption standards.</p>\n<h3>Failing to Update Consistently</h3>\n<p>No matter how skilled a developer is, no software is perfectly coded. No matter what, there are going to be security vulnerabilities and issues with long-term integrity. If and when someone figures this out, they can take advantage of the flaw.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, most development teams and open source communities are constantly on the lookout for new potential threats—and when they find one, they implement a patch to fix it.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing—the patch only works if you download it. Yet, many organizations fail to update their software or devices consistently. The easiest approach here is to mandate automatic updates, but many businesses simply allow their employees to update as they see fit—which isn’t as often as it should be.</p>\n<h3>Pinning Hopes on a Single Solution</h3>\n<p>There are several products and services that can minimize your security vulnerabilities, including firewalls, antivirus software, and virtual private networks (VPNs). However, too many business owners pin all their hopes on a single solution. They believe that since they’re using a firewall, they’re practically bulletproof.</p>\n<p>However, complete data protection requires you to pay close attention to a number of potential threats, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/24/the-key-to-improving-global-cybersecurity-is-data-science/\">studying the landscape</a> and employing unique solutions to guard against them. If you’re only using one or two techniques, you’re probably leaving yourself open to attack in some other way.</p>\n<h3>Neglecting Personal Device Vulnerabilities</h3>\n<p>Most businesses these days have some variant of a bring your own device (BYOD) policy. This works well for both businesses, which can save money on purchasing employee devices, and employees, who can exercise more control over what type of devices they use and how they use them. However, personal devices brought onto your network can pose a major security risk if your employees aren’t managing their devices correctly.</p>\n<p>Additionally, employees may use their devices (with company accounts) or company devices on public Wi-Fi networks that are unsecured—a major risk for attacks.</p>\n<h3>Failing to Train Staff</h3>\n<p>One of the most common reasons for small business cyberattacks is simple employee mistakes. Most cybercriminals aren’t sophisticated hackers, but instead are opportunists—looking for ways to exploit basic ignorance or errors. For example, they may try to trick your employees into giving up their login credentials, or they may simply wait for an opportunity to conveniently learn more about your organization through social engineering. The better informed your staff members are, and the more trained they are in cybersecurity practices, the fewer vulnerabilities you’ll face. Unfortunately, most business owners neglect this.</p>\n<p>There’s no easy way to get business owners to take cybersecurity seriously, especially when there are already many examples of businesses losing billions of dollars because of lax security habits.

It would look very different from the internet we know and rely on today. Perhaps this alternate version would run on a pay-per-use model, or lack tools and services that have been developed over the years by independent contributors and scrappy startups. Here is why IoT needs an open ecosystem to succeed.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h2>The Open Internet</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, of a closed internet &#8212; we mostly enjoy an open internet. This is in part due to its origins: the internet was built to be fundamentally open, and this is what has allowed it to grow, change, and be adopted as quickly as it has been. In fact, the trend of an open approach propelling innovation is one that we see repeatedly for emerging technologies.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT), we’re at the precipice of a similar innovation boom as witnessed with the internet.</strong> </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IoT is slated for explosive growth: by 2021, Gartner expects that </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-11-07-gartner-identifies-top-10-strategic-iot-technologies-and-trends\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25 billion connected things will be in use</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, enabling our smart homes, factories, vehicles, and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more and more IoT devices come online, </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/zededa/why-iot-needs-edge-computing-to-realize-its-full-potential-3600de77b38f\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edge computing will become a necessity.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Edge computing enables data to be processed and analyzed in real-time for </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/how-ai-at-the-edge-other-iot-trends-are-transforming-every-industry/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business-critical use cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as self-driving cars, safety and security, and industrial automation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with the internet, we need an open, consistent infrastructure foundation for IoT and edge computing in order for these technologies to reach their full potential. While the challenges of building an open IoT are different than those we faced with building an open internet, this is an important problem for our industry to solve now, before we witness further fragmentation and vendor lock-in.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Where we are today with IoT<br />\n</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re currently in what I like to call the “AOL stage” of IoT—the phase of getting devices connected at scale, and working through the balance of proprietary vs. open approaches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the 1990s, America Online opened up <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/11/how-a-nearly-forgotten-rip-physicist-shaped-your-internet-access/\">access to the internet</a> to the masses with an easy-to-use CD; by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">popping it in</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, anyone could easily sign up and get connected. However, the tradeoff for this simplicity was getting locked into the AOL ecosystem as the conduit for communication and search. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, users became savvier, realizing they could connect to the internet directly through their ISPs and access more powerful search capabilities (Google, for example). As more people came online through their medium of choice, innovation picked up speed, giving birth to the internet boom and the ecosystem we know today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>IoT is inherently heterogeneous and diverse, made up of a wide variety of technologies and domain-specific use cases.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the market has created a dizzying landscape of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/09/12/when-youre-thinking-iot-expansion-think-horizontal/\">proprietary IoT platforms</a> to connect people and operations, each with wildly different methods for data collection, security, and management. It’s like having many different “AOLs” trying to connect devices to the internet—needless to say, this fragmentation has resulted in unnecessary complications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies beginning their IoT journeys are locked in with the vendor they start with, and will be subject to additional costs or integration issues when they look to scale deployments and take on new use cases.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, IoT’s diversity has become a hindrance to its own growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid going down this path, we must build an open ecosystem as our foundation for IoT and edge computing. It’s only when open standards are set that we can scale the commercialization of offerings and services, and focus on realizing ROI.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Open ecosystems facilitate scale</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would an open ecosystem for IoT look like? When creating an ecosystem, there’s a spectrum of approaches you can take, ranging from closed to open philosophies. Closed ecosystems are based on closely governed relationships, proprietary designs, and, in the case of software, proprietary </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/03/29/connected-things-pl2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APIs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tight control of closed ecosystems sometimes referred to as “</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/12/11/go-swift-hack-corporate-languages-new-lock-in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walled gardens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” can provide great customer experience, but come with a premium cost and less choice. Apple is a widely cited example of this approach.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>There are open approaches that offer APIs and tools that you can openly program.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The open approach tools enable an ecosystem of products and services where the value is derived from the sum of its parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open-source software like Android is an example; it’s a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/07/these-three-industries-are-about-to-be-hit-by-aiot/\">key driver of a truly open</a>, vendor-neutral ecosystem because of how it empowers developers. Having an open standard like Android’s operating system for developers to build upon not only promotes further innovation but also bolsters a network effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To fully grasp the business trade-offs of closed vs. open ecosystems, let’s compare Android and Apple’s iOS. While Apple provides a curated experience, Android device makers have less control over the overall experience through deep software/hardware integration, and therefore need to find other differentiators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, openness facilitates choice and scale—Android has </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 70 percent of the global mobile OS market share</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even with Android’s openness, providers like Samsung have still been able to carve out market share by investing in innovation and a broader device ecosystem strategy.</span></p>\n<h2><b>An open future for the IoT</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IoT can have as great of an impact as the internet has had, but generating hundreds of closed, siloed ecosystems dictated by vendor choice is not the path to scale. A </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/17/iot-in-2020-its-all-coming-together/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bright future for IoT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is dependent upon our ability to come together as an industry to build an open ecosystem as our foundation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across hardware, operating systems, connectivity, applications, and cloud, we must bridge key elements and unify, rather than reinvent, standards in order to empower developers to focus on value creation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial offerings built on top of that open foundation may very well take a more “closed” approach; however, starting development with an open foundation will always provide the most scalability, flexibility, and transparency to maximize options for the long term.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/15/top-25-slack-alternatives-for-team-communication-and-collaboration/\">Open-source collaboration</a> is an excellent accelerator for this open foundation. The Linux Foundation’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LF Edge</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Kubernetes IoT Edge Working Group</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the Eclipse Foundation’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IoT</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edge Native</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Working Groups are just a few of the initiatives exploring architectures and building frameworks to unite industry efforts and enable IoT and edge computing ecosystems to scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they say, the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts, and I look forward to seeing the immense potential of becoming a reality when we have a common foundation to innovate on.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/why-iot-needs-an-open-ecosystem-to-succeed/\">Why IoT Needs an Open Ecosystem to Succeed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:01:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-IoT-Needs-an-Open-Ecosystem-to-Succeed.jpg","linkMd5":"3495492a2e3f898819385305815f0bb6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-27-313_2ec2428a4f23fa01.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-IoT-Needs-an-Open-Ecosystem-to-Succeed.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":23489,"destBytes":19584,"author":"Jason Shepherd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-IoT-Needs-an-Open-Ecosystem-to-Succeed-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-14-654_6f09295065c1d081.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876386},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"Why Data Scientists are Becoming Future Marketers","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172346","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/why-data-scientists-are-becoming-future-marketers/\" title=\"Why Data Scientists are Becoming Future Marketers\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"data scientist marketers\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The law of success in business states: the quicker you accept and welcome innovations, the further behind you leave your competition.

The biggest challenge to data-driven marketing success is the lack of data quality and completeness.</p>\n<h3>Here is the bridge the knowledge gap between modern marketers and data scientists.</h3>\n<p>What type of data is actually useful and how do you use it? My goal is to make sure that after reading this article &#8212; you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand why the ability to use big data in the marketing sector is essential for business survival.</li>\n<li>Get a good grip on how to obtain the “right” high-quality information to craft an effective marketing strategy.</li>\n<li>Learn 4 ways how company giants are using data gathering right now to stay in leadership positions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Statistics predict the future of marketing</h2>\n<p>The value of using data science and analytics in marketing has been increasingly recognized. Currently, about <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3883171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 out of every 4 marketing leaders (76%)</a> base decisions on data analytics. Globally, the budgets for data-driven marketing has also been increasing rapidly.</p>\n<p>In 2019 reaching its <a href=\"https://cmosurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/02/The_CMO_Survey-Highlights-and_Insights_Report-Feb-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highest point in six years</a>. The overwhelming majority <a href=\"https://www.mediamath.com/blog/resource/the-global-review-data-driven-marketing-and-advertising/#sthash.YxrsCjSA.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(73%) of marketing associations agree</a> that this trend is expected to continue in the future.</p>\n<p>This trend has been echoed by executives and CEOs worldwide. They confirm that data-driven marketing is crucial to success in a hyper-competitive global economy, as Forbes Insights and Turn report reveal.</p>\n<h2>Lessons from the best of the best</h2>\n<p>What do Disney, Apple, Uber, and Amazon have in common?</p>\n<p>Apart from all being at the top of their game, these companies place customer experience as their top priority. Equally, findings from global market studies worldwide show that consumers are more likely to pay more for better customer experience. As a matter of fact, they even tend to prioritize trusting brand relationships over product quality.</p>\n<p>Following this tendency, most successful businesses move from communication to conversation. And to catch this wave, I will tell you exactly how data-driven marketing can help companies get there.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of data-driven marketing</h2>\n<p>For someone who has been working in the business of information for over a decade, it is evident that data analytics is the backbone of marketing automation.</p>\n<p>To develop any successful marketing strategy, there is a need for large amounts of information on the target audience. For example, their attitudes, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/11/how-to-use-behavioral-data-to-inform-marketing-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behavior</a> and experiences. Also, activities such as monitoring brand reputation, search engine ratings, and competitors’ behavior should be a part of marketing strategy development.</p>\n<p>All of these goals are simplified ten-fold by automated data gathering. There are few data extraction tools available, most of which rely on web-crawling. It automizes long hours of manual labor spent on researching information. Also, it drastically reduces labor costs and expenses, while at the same time increasing productivity, quality, and the process itself.</p>\n<h2>How does web crawling work?</h2>\n<p>Web crawling, also known as web scraping, is the process of retrieving data from a website. It revolutionizes mundane, mind-numbing tasks of manually extracting data. Instead, web scraping uses well-calculated automation processes to retrieve valuable data from the internet.</p>\n<p>Considering all the advantages that web-scraping offers, it comes as no surprise that this practice is growing in popularity. In fact, marketing is not the only department reaping the benefits. For instance, cyber-security, retail, and travel industries, among others, have been taking advantage of what data can offer.</p>\n<p>The fascinating aspect of web scraping is that it is continually evolving. Indeed, industry leaders continually come up with more and more ways to use big data to reach their business goals. I am certain that there are still unexplored ways of how web crawling can aid companies across the globe to automate their processes and gain valuable insights.</p>\n<h2>4 Fool-proof ways to use data collection</h2>\n<p>Real-time public data scraped from the web has multiple uses and goals to simplify the marketing strategy. Here is to name a few:</p>\n<h3>Make your clients happy</h3>\n<p>Listen, listen, listen. In general, the needs and desires of the customer are the guiding stars for every successful business. In truth, people are giving valuable feedback to companies everywhere on the web: social media, personal blogs, news articles, comment sections, or discussion boards.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most of this information never reaches the marketers’ eyes. Uninformed decisions then lead to the creation of products or services that people don’t really care about.</p>\n<p>By effectively tapping into a constant stream of publicly available information, businesses can continually <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shift their marketing strategy</a> responding to the latest industry trends. This gives a chance to adjust communications appropriately, offer products and services which clients genuinely want, and improve the overall customer experience.</p>\n<h3>Strengthen your brand</h3>\n<p>What are the highest valued companies in the market? The answer? The same companies carrying best-recognized brands in the world. I hope it is evident for everyone that it is no coincidence.</p>\n<p>Strong and well-regarded brands are the result of not only great promotional strategies but robust defense systems against such possible threats as counterfeiting or copyright infringement.</p>\n<h4>Brands suffering from counterfeiting globally.</h4>\n<p>In 2017 alone, the estimated losses the brands have suffered from counterfeiting globally have amounted to staggering 323 billion dollars. Sadly, this grim trend is rising, according to the Global Brand Counterfeiting Report.</p>\n<p>Data-driven marketing can support the<em> c</em>onstant brand vigilance efforts to diminish the damages. As a response to the situation, luxury brands are employing proxies to crawl e-commerce websites, auction sites, and relevant marketplaces to spot the fraudsters.</p>\n<p>Massive-scale web crawling also can support the prosecution process against these illegal activities by collecting all necessary data.</p>\n<h3>Know your competition</h3>\n<p>Being able to obtain and process large amounts of information about your market competition, gives an enormous competitive advantage. The traditional methods of doing market research, including the interviews, surveys, and focus groups, are quickly turning into a thing of the past, giving way for more time and cost-efficient web crawling.</p>\n<p>Automating the market research for such routine processes as tracking changes in pricing, auditing the product line, observing presence online, public engagement, and other promotional activity through various communication channels gives an opportunity to react quicker and more accurately.</p>\n<h3>Be searchable</h3>\n<p>Visibility online is everything. Sadly, statistics are cruel on this matter. According to Protofuse, less than 10% of people advance to page 2 on search engines. This means that even the best products or services available will never reach the eyes and ears of the potential client. The regrettable fact is that the majority of businesses are struggling in this regard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/01/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</a> is the process that allows improving the visibility of the website among the search engine results. Not surprisingly, the web crawling tool is essential for monitoring changes in these ratings. Getting hands-on real-time and location customized data can serve the company to come up with the most effective strategies for increasing exposure instantly.</p>\n<h2>As the game is changing rapidly</h2>\n<p>The use of big data has been in the marketing world for a while now, and it is not going anywhere anytime. On the contrary, the data-driven approaches will continue to shape marketing, along with other industries. To emphasize this point, the global demand for data analytics has been continually increasing and is expected to rise in the future, as pointed out in the Oxylabs 2020 Trend Report.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the market value has reached $49 billion. Concluding from the steady growth rate, it is expected to double in just seven years, reaching an impressive $103 billion by 2027.</p>\n<p>It is fair to say that future data scientists will contribute their skills and technical knowledge in more diverse business sectors.</p>\n<p>The trend is a serious signal for all market players to adapt and embrace the ongoing innovations. However, if they shy away from using the powerful insights from the big data, their competitors will outsmart them in every move, by betting on data-backed decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/why-data-scientists-are-becoming-future-marketers/\">Why Data Scientists are Becoming Future Marketers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 21:00:59 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers.jpg","linkMd5":"a8e1045b2685b34d59bd3a58707b0837","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-19-632_6c23148c615d4dee.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":43516,"destBytes":34236,"author":"Julius Cerniauskas","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-Data-Scientists-are-Becoming-Future-Marketers-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-13-838_3d31d7ff6a610886.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874143},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","title":"3 CAD Functions to Understand for Building Your Prototype","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173797","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/07/3-cad-functions-to-understand-for-building-your-prototype/\" title=\"3 CAD Functions to Understand for Building Your Prototype\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-CAD-Functions-to-Understand-for-Building-Your-Prototype-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"building your prototype\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-CAD-Functions-to-Understand-for-Building-Your-Prototype-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-CAD-Functions-to-Understand-for-Building-Your-Prototype-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-CAD-Functions-to-Understand-for-Building-Your-Prototype.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Understanding the basics of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) modeling was crucial in building my first working <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/08/death-by-prototype-why-just-getting-started-isnt-enough/\">prototype</a>. At this point, I&#8217;m close to filing a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/01/how-to-save-money-filing-patents/\">patent</a>. None of it would have been possible, though, without understanding three crucial functions present in a lot of the software available out there. Here are three CAD functions to understand for building your prototype.</p>\n<p>Once you understand the following 3 CAD modeling functions, your ideas will come to life sooner than you think.</p>\n<h3>Quick Insights On Prototyping with CAD</h3>\n<p>Using CAD for engineering has <a href=\"https://www.scan2cad.com/cad/cad-evolved-since-1982/\">been around</a> since the late 1950s. It wasn&#8217;t until the mid-1990s, though, that producing 3D models on a personal computer became widely available.</p>\n<p>The best alternative before doing it yourself was contracting with a design firm (unless you had access to the resources that they did). Well-known entrepreneurs like Joy Mangano spent small fortunes bringing their products to life back when they were starting out.</p>\n<p>In Mangano&#8217;s case &#8212; it was $100,000 for the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/11/nyregion/cleaning-up-in-business-with-a-mop.html\">development process</a> of the Miracle Mop &#8212; clear back in the early &#8217;90s.</p>\n<h3>Things Are Different Now</h3>\n<p>The good news is that now there are a ton of free open-source software options on the internet for CAD modeling.</p>\n<p>Some commercial-grade software even has a free option until you hit a certain revenue threshold with your product (like the one I use).</p>\n<p>These software options work great if you&#8217;re on a shoestring budget and need to build something yourself.</p>\n<p>Plus, this is a near risk-free approach compared to borrowing a bunch of money and having deadlines to pay people back.</p>\n<h3>Real-Life CAD Example</h3>\n<p>David Barnett, the inventor of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/28/25-gifts-with-mom-in-mind-a-mothers-day-gift-guide/\">PopSockets</a>, leveraged a partial DIY strategy in the early days of his company. After working through 60 prototypes by himself, he eventually saw the product take-off (not without a few ups and downs along the way, though).</p>\n<p>Barnett used a design firm for a phone case that was part of an early Kickstarter campaign.</p>\n<p>That cost him a little over $100,000. However, he perfected the PopSocket accordion mechanism (the backbone of the product) by himself with the CAD program Solidworks.</p>\n<p>Today, Barnett&#8217;s company has seen years where revenues have reached as much as $200 million (2018). In this <a href=\"https://mixergy.com/interviews/popsockets-with-david-barnett/\">interview with Mixergy</a>, he briefly touched on how simple it was to draw out a sketch and get started.</p>\n<h3>Sketch</h3>\n<p>A sketch lays the groundwork for your CAD models. If you want to build something similar to the many widely available consumer products on the market, start with a sketch. Plus, you probably already have a few doodles in your notebook of what <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/06/20-exciting-business-ideas-that-you-can-start-for-10k-or-less/\">your ideas</a> are.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just a matter of drawing them out on-screen and deciding the specific measurements. Don&#8217;t worry if you aren&#8217;t great at math. I personally struggled through geometry until the last painful final exam in my sophomore year of high school.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_173800\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-173800\" style=\"width: 473px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-173800\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1-300x156.png\" alt=\"CAD Toothbrush Head Sketch\" width=\"473\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1-300x156.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1-900x468.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1-260x135.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToothbrushheadSketch-1024x532-1.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-173800\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Toothbrush Head Sketch I Started To Make In Fusion 360</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Creativity Finds A Way</h3>\n<p>It may sound funny or weird, but, if you have the idea clear enough in your head, your brain will probably figure out how to navigate most CAD software.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are plenty of available tutorials on the internet. The sketching just involves clicking and dragging, anyway. Use a 12-inch ruler with millimeters on it to figure out the current dimensions of the sketches in your notebook.</p>\n<p>Using your ruler will make drawing your designs out on the screen a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Once you have a digital sketch that looks like what you need, you can start experimenting with making that sketch three dimensional.</p>\n<h3>Extruding A CAD Model</h3>\n<p>When you create a virtual 3D object out of a sketch, you are &#8220;extruding&#8221; it.</p>\n<p>There might be other words for the same action in different software toolbars, like &#8220;press pull&#8221; or &#8220;push-pull,&#8221; for example.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Extrude&#8221; means &#8220;to force or push something out of something,&#8221; according to <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/extrude\">Oxford Learner&#8217;s Dictionary</a>. The nice thing about everything being virtual is that you can extrude shapes from your sketches at whatever distance you want and make changes immediately if things don&#8217;t look the way you thought they would.</p>\n<p>Any shape can be extruded, as long as the sketch is drawn appropriately. Multi-faceted objects will require a more complex sketch to create, though.</p>\n<h3>Sketch In, Sketch Out</h3>\n<p>You can draw sketches within other ones (for those complex objects) and choose to extrude very specific tiny parts if needed.</p>\n<p>For example, if you were designing a toothbrush head, there would likely be a large oval sketch with many tiny circle sketches inside of it for the bristle holes. After extruding the main brush head whichever distance makes sense, you can decide the depth for extruding each hole.</p>\n<p>My thoughts for the drawing are to extrude the same amount of depth for each hole all at once. Here&#8217;s what that would look like:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_173802\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-173802\" style=\"width: 404px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-173802\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1-300x173.png\" alt=\"CAD Toothbrush Head 3D Object\" width=\"404\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1-300x173.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1-900x520.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1-260x150.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CAD-Extruding-Toothbrush-Head-Holes-1024x592-1.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-173802\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Extruding my main sketch and then the small holes for bristles.</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>After you arrive at a design that you think works to 3D-print and play around with, it&#8217;s time for the last step.</p>\n<h3>Save the CAD As &#8220;.STL&#8221;</h3>\n<p>If you have a 3D-printer or know where to send your object (like a printing service) you will need to save it in the &#8220;.STL&#8221; format and send it there.</p>\n<p>Some CAD software may have a menu option that says you can print directly, but, I&#8217;ve found it easier to just save the file.</p>\n<p>The .STL file format stands for &#8220;Stereolithography&#8221; and is the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000504.shtml\">standard format</a> for desktop 3D printing. The file will need to be opened in the software that controls your 3D-printer.</p>\n<h3>There are a lot of free options out there for that, too.</h3>\n<p>The printer software will convert the STL file to G-code so your printer can understand it. G-code is the <a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/G-code\">standard language</a> used by 3D-printers.</p>\n<p>Since each CAD modeling software and 3D printing software will be a little different, each will have its own unique parts to navigate. The 3D printers menus should be pretty straightforward, though, and it will probably be quick and easy getting your design sent to a printer. I usually ask someone who has done this before to help me set up. </p>\n<p>Depending on the complexity of your design, I can&#8217;t promise the printing of the object itself will be a quick process. Even reasonably simple designs take time to print in those 3D printing beasts &#8212; but it is so fun and rewarding to see the finished product.</p>\n<h3>Sacrificing Time For Money</h3>\n<p>Even if it takes a long time to print (8+ hours is long to me), 3D printing is still by far the best way to build a prototype without <a href=\"https://www.thiscollegelife.com/finance/make-money/67-places-to-make-money-online/\">much money</a>.</p>\n<p>Contracting with a professional firm could cost anywhere from $10,000 and up, as past entrepreneurs have experienced.

Smart cities, micro-drones, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/demystifying-8-core-myths-that-surround-the-internet-of-things/\">Internet of Things</a>, connected logistics, artificial intelligence, etc. have put us on a platform where pride comes naturally. We can talk about the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/11/5-digital-health-technologies-helping-to-stop-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">coronavirus pandemic</a> and lockdowns all we want. However, we shouldn’t forget one thing. Technology has empowered us with numerous advantages to fight this crisis.</p>\n<p>We are in this together. It’s not just a statement, it’s a fact. Let’s pause for a minute and evaluate the ‘tomorrow’ beyond the current pandemic. When we do get through this tunnel, we should endeavor to build a better and more connected world together.</p>\n<p>In this article, we would talk about: why this is important; what we can improve; and how we should go about doing it.</p>\n<h2><strong>How global cities measure up during this pandemic.</strong></h2>\n<p>We kept speaking about <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/how-6-tech-giants-are-giving-smbs-a-hand-in-the-pandemic/\">disruption and innovation</a> for years. The starting point for both was ‘need identification’. Where are the gaps, and why aren’t they being filled? Let’s look at some of these points.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Information overload with minimal applications.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The world has been consuming information and data at an extravagant rate. Hence, the current slowdown (in all news other than the pandemic) has pushed people into consuming coronavirus updates like candy. This, inevitably, pushes us towards information overload.</p>\n<p>This has led to misinterpretations, misinformation, and misrepresentations. In short, there’s too much information that doesn’t lead anywhere. It doesn’t have any application or doesn’t solve anything. It’s just noise.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Multiple</strong><strong> labor and logistics bottlenecks.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lockdown and travel restrictions have prioritized essential services (medical, food supply, utilities, etc.) over all other goods or people&#8217;s movement. This sounds good on paper. However, there have been problems with getting the right people and the right supplies to where it’s most needed.</p>\n<p>Some cities and states have shut down their borders. Shutting down borders further hinders the smooth logistics movement. There are (understandably) multiple checks and balances. Checks and balances, also delay the delivery and availability of essential goods and services.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Longer reaction times due to inertia.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above points (and many intermediate ones) culminate into longer reaction times. The authorities get stuck with firefighting and decision inertia. These decisions, in turn, lead to food and supply insecurities among the masses, especially the poor. Another point of worry with decision inertia is the inadequate or delayed testing, reporting, and isolation of possible infections.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Smart City Approach: What it means and how it can help</strong></h2>\n<p>Let us now develop a scientific approach towards the crisis management. What are the facts and how do we proceed? The underlying, and inherent benefits of smart cities, here, turn into essential tools.</p>\n<p>The ‘Smart City Approach’ is when authorities within the city leverage real-time insights and updates. With this, they streamline their crisis response, plan for process improvements, and ensure <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/19/break-the-mold-with-real-world-logistics-ai-and-iot/\">seamless logistics</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Detection and reporting: Fast and decisive action.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We need better ways to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/securing-the-digital-workplace-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">detect and report possible Covid-19 cases</a>. Moreover, we also need better reporting for other emergencies relating to the operations and governance of major cities. Cities like New York, London, Singapore, and Mumbai have been global travel hubs for decades. These globally-connected cities need faster case (or emergency) detection and reporting.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>A collaborative approach from cities, states, and nations.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cities and countries need to be on the same page with the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/big-data-as-a-double-edged-sword-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/\">fight against this unprecedented crisis</a>. We have discovered common threads of empathy and compassion that have connected us all, across demographics. We want this to continue beyond the pandemic. The connectivity and collaboration will help us recover, as companies and cities, faster.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Stakeholder mapping and planning.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The crisis has thrown many curveballs. It seems like when cities solve one issue, another rears its head. There are migrant workers and homeless people who stand to be worst affected by the lockdowns. The people on the frontline of the crisis: the doctors, nurses, police, utility, and sanitation personnel, etc. need more attention. They need to be protected with the timely <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/08/what-are-the-benefits-of-gps-tracking-in-the-supply-chain/\">deliveries of necessary equipment</a> and supplies.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Real-time tracking and information.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, the cities need to function as one. Each development, each shortage, each victory needs to be tracked, recorded, and utilized. Smart cities cover all these aspects with aplomb. These cities have the power to handle live information and turn them into key insights.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Application: How smart cities can be better equipped.</strong></h2>\n<p>We have talked about improving the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/iot-and-home-automation-is-it-the-future/\">connectivity and conditions</a> of our cities by turning them into truly ‘smart cities’. The current crisis is unprecedented in every way. We are at a point where we need to minimize the damage, protect the assets (people and economies), and revitalize our operations (in cities).</p>\n<p>We must learn and adapt using the intrinsic smart city concepts to better equip all cities.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/what-the-drones-of-future-can-do/\">Drones</a> as a catalyst for better visibility.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many cities in China, the United States, India, etc. are either planning to use small or micro-drones or are already using them. These drones primarily help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gather intel with regular lockdown surveillance (spotting suspicious activities or simply supervising local operations);</li>\n<li>spray disinfectant in areas with active Covid-19 cases (reported);</li>\n<li>detect elevated body temperatures of random people on the streets (used in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2NyU0bHujiU\">Hunan, China</a>);</li>\n<li>deliver essential medical supplies (especially masks or sanitizers), etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drones can help local city authorities build situational awareness. The mayor or emergency service officials can view live video updates of sensitive (quarantined) zones without putting on-ground forces in harm’s way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/cybersecurity-ensuring-sanity-in-smart-cities/\">All information is encrypted</a> and transmitted back to a central repository for current or future use. The drones also ease the pressure on the overworked essential forces within the city.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Connected logistics and contactless deliveries.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>People under different levels of lockdowns depend on their local stores for their groceries and essentials. Hopefully, we are past the initial frenzy and panic buying. Now, the essential goods and equipment must move seamlessly within and outside the cities.</p>\n<p>Many retailers and e-commerce players within major cities have, previously, reaped the benefits of a real-time package and shipment tracking. They used route-planning software to identify <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-iot-will-play-an-important-role-in-traffic-management-for-smart-cities/\">short and ideal travel routes</a>. This gave them the cumulative benefits of speed, cost, and end-customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>We need to extend this AI-enabled route planning and live shipment tracking to ensure that all essentials are evenly distributed across districts. Retailers and foodservice providers, along with the local authorities, should engage with this technology as equal collaborators. We will cover more on this in the next point.</p>\n<p>People have been confined to their homes and have become more and more dependent on hyperlocal deliveries of food and groceries. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/10/customer-experience-vs-customer-service/\">Delivery service companies</a> have stepped up their response with contactless deliveries where prepaid orders can be left at the doorstep.</p>\n<p>The entire ‘proof of delivery’ is conducted in-app. The delivery person sends the receiver a photo of the package (at the receiver’s doorstep). The receiver, then, confirms the delivery. The network interconnectivity within smart cities is the linchpin for such sharp adaptability within delivery companies.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Centralized city info-system for essential services.</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Local and central governments are keeping a close eye on all relevant developments within cities (and the nation as a whole). Smart cities have been historically more adept at collating and pushing actionable insights. These insights have been critical in effective decision making.</p>\n<p>The authorities, now, must scale and interconnect all related services in the city into one central info-system. It will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>give the exact cluster map of active and suspect Covid-19 cases (with live health and status updates)</li>\n<li>show live drone-surveillance through key-areas giving real-time intel about select or sensitive areas</li>\n<li>enable retailers and suppliers to update their stock-levels as they depreciate in real-time\n<ul>\n<li>This will trigger automated delivery requests.</li>\n<li>The authorities can track delivery trucks in real-time, through in-vehicle trackers, and direct them to the shops with lower supplies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>help plan and execute structured disinfecting of different areas in the city</li>\n<li>ensure proper law and sanitation upkeep through automated and regular drone-surveillance</li>\n<li>ensure on-time food packet deliveries to the elderly, homeless, and needy (this can be enabled through interconnected community-based reporting)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A connected and centralized info-system ensures effortless smart city management. This leaves the authorities with enough insights (as they study cluster patterns) to tackle and overcome the pandemic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Beyond the crisis: Recovery and rebuilding.</strong></h2>\n<p>According to sources, we are in the midst of a recession. We will understand the full extent of the economic backlash once we emerge from the current crisis. However, we have our work cut out for us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/17/what-the-interconnected-inside-sales-landscape-will-look-like-in-5-years/\">Technology and connectivity </a>have helped us fight this pandemic. Smart cities with emerging and innovative tech applications have witnessed faster and effective testing and reporting. These cities have set the benchmarks for adaptability and recovery. We must embolden more cities with smart and connected technology. This will strengthen us and hasten the rebuilding phase for our communities.</p>\n<p>Future generations would read about this pandemic in their history books. Let’s turn our response to it, as a global community, into something that would motivate them for years.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Gerd Altmann; Pixabay</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/how-smart-cities-can-help-build-a-better-post-pandemic-world/\">How Smart Cities Can Help Build a Better Post-Pandemic World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 22 May 2020 15:00:32 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-Smart-Cities-Can-Help-Build-a-Better-Post-Pandemic-World.jpg","linkMd5":"b897116ed96e977050a22dcdd7f0a0ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-26-509_5639c029dcf3bc3b.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-Smart-Cities-Can-Help-Build-a-Better-Post-Pandemic-World.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":98056,"destBytes":99550,"author":"Faiz Shaikh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-Smart-Cities-Can-Help-Build-a-Better-Post-Pandemic-World-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-23-404_778568d0cb7b25ea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877364},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Know Your Customer Regulations in Crypto Exchanges","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168093","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/know-your-customer-regulations-in-crypto-exchanges/\" title=\"Know Your Customer Regulations in Crypto Exchanges\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Know-Your-Customer-Regulations-in-Crypto-Exchanges-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"regulations in crypto exchanges\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Know-Your-Customer-Regulations-in-Crypto-Exchanges-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Know-Your-Customer-Regulations-in-Crypto-Exchanges-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Know-Your-Customer-Regulations-in-Crypto-Exchanges.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Over the past few years, buying top digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether is common in off-exchange trading. The utilization of digital assets at a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/16/10-crypto-gurus-you-have-to-follow/\">corporate level is quite promising</a>. The cash management is revolutionizing, which is revamping the conventional payment flows using blockchain. Here is how to know the &#8220;know your customer&#8221; regulations in the crypto exchanges.</p>\n<h3>Corporate banking entities use a distributed ledger where all the transactional information is stored.</h3>\n<p>An end-to-end process pledges a level of assurance to all the parties that have participated in the fund pool and their security. Digital currency services have eliminated the intermediaries and reduced the cost of all the payment transfer infrastructure for transaction records and security.</p>\n<p>Before diving deep, let’s look into the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/15/top-25-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-speakers/\">types of exchanges active today in the crypto market:</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/crypto-banking-traditional-bankings-competition-or-ally/\">Crypto exchanges</a> are divided into two major groups: “fiat-to-crypto” and “crypto-to-crypto” exchanges.</p>\n<h3><b>Fiat-to-Crypto Exchanges </b></h3>\n<p>The exchanges perform ‘due diligence measures’ as they deal with the fiat money. The exchanges are required to conduct business with financial institutions.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s therefore required to perform stringent KYC procedures to ensure a clean customer base before doing business with the entities. In fiat-to-crypto exchanges, fiat money enters into the market of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>The exchanges allow exchanging the fiat currency with the supported digital assets. For exampl,e dollars for ether.</p>\n<h3><b>Crypto-to-Crypto Exchanges</b></h3>\n<p>The crypto-to-crypto exchanges allow the users to exchange one cryptocurrency for the other. These are online platforms like stock/currency exchange. Here, buyers and sellers trade are performed based on the current price in the cryptocurrency market.</p>\n<p>Exchanges play as a middle-man. One cryptocurrency is exchanged with another type of cryptocurrency to get profit.</p>\n<p>Other than the Bitcoin and Ether, there are other altcoins, and to buy them, people will need a crypto exchange. The exchanges are an important component of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/14/transparency-in-the-cryptocurrency-ecosystem-with-james-giancotti/\">the whole crypto market</a>. The investments, buying, and selling take place through a crypto exchange as an intermediary.</p>\n<p>Investors and stakeholders are facilitated through exchanges. Now, most of the time unknowingly, bad actors participate in the crypto network and perform financial crimes such as money laundering and other malevolent activities.</p>\n<p>The global regulatory scrutiny has pinpointed the crypto exchanges to undergo stringent ‘customer due diligence’ measures to deter the risk of financial frauds.</p>\n<p>The fifth Anti Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) has clearly declared the need for identity verification measures of each customer opt to participate in the crypto exchanges. AMLD5 obligations include Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, Anti Money Laundering (AML), and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchanges across the globe are required to verify each onboarding customer against the identity verification parameters to make sure that no bad actor is facilitated. Such critical concerns make KYC and AML compliance mandatory for the crypto exchanges that ensure a filtered clean customer base.</p>\n<h2><b>Components of Know Your Customer</b></h2>\n<p>KYC refers to a set of processes and procedures adopted by businesses to identify and verify the identity of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/13/digital-onboarding-the-first-step-of-your-banks-digitalization/\">onboarding customers</a> to deter the risk of fraud and final crimes. KYC fundamentally incorporates four elements: identification procedures, acceptance policy, risk management, and transaction monitoring.</p>\n<p>The concern of the KYC verification process in cryptocurrency is as a result of money laundering. Through stringent identity verification procedure, crypto exchanges can fight against the acts of terrorism and money laundering. KYC verification includes verification of an individual against the collected information such as name, address, date of birth, etc.</p>\n<h3><b>How crypto exchanges approach regulatory obligations?</b></h3>\n<p>As per regulatory compliance, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/05/kyb-and-aml-screening-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-significant-for-business/\">KYC verification</a> needs to be done throughout the customer lifecycle. A distributed ledger or blockchain is a complex infrastructure that holds the record of all transactions.</p>\n<p>Using strong cryptography, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/08/detecting-and-protecting-against-ransomware-best-practice-for-2020/\">the blocks are encrypted</a> to make it hard for an unauthorized entity to access it or temper it. There are a total of four levels in which KYC verification is divided. These are:</p>\n<p><b>Customer Acceptance Policy (CAP):</b> In this stage, a company makes a document containing the details on the basis of which customer is allowed to make a relationship with its customers. The company selects a customer only if their identity is credible and is found appropriate after assigning a risk rating in the process of customer due diligence.</p>\n<p><b>Customer Identification Program (CIP):</b> This is a stage in which customer identification is done to ensure that a company can <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/does-artificial-intelligence-help-fight-financial-fraud/\">continue financial transactions</a> with a customer.</p>\n<p><b>Risk Management: </b>Customer identification is done and a rating is given to the profile as per the risk associated with the customer.</p>\n<p><b>Continuous Transaction Monitoring:</b> Throughout the customer lifecycle, transactions should be monitored continuously to identify suspicious transactions if any.</p>\n<h2><b>The current state of regulatory compliance in Crypto Exchanges</b></h2>\n<p>With respect to compliance, the current situation in crypto exchanges is not that satisfactory or we can say it is not according to the obligations of regulators. It is studied that two-third of crypto exchanges fail to strongly comply with the regulations. They have a vague understanding regarding molding the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/11/online-id-verification-a-primer-for-fintech-businesses/\">operations according to the requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchanges ask for name, email address, and contact number, nothing else, which is not enough information for customer verification. This is the reason that banks and financial institutions prefer not to work with crypto exchanges.</p>\n<p>After the evaluation, it is found that some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/01/is-blockchain-winning-or-losing-4-stages-of-blockchain-evolution/\">crypto exchanges now ask primary documents</a> from the customers such as a photograph, passport, and a written certificate. However, these pieces of information might not be enough to conduct a proper KYC procedure.</p>\n<p>Some exchanges perform low-level compliance, for example a crypto exchange, Binance asks its customers to provide a passport at the time of sign-up. With this, security concerns about user <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/19/4-things-spotify-can-teach-you-about-data-sharing/\">personal data collection are raised</a>. However, some exchanges do not even ask for this information.</p>\n<h2><b>Reasons why crypto exchanges overlook compliance procedures</b></h2>\n<p>Regulatory scrutiny has shown a lack of adoption of regulatory demands in cryptocurrency exchanges. Following are the reasons why crypto exchanges do not take into account regulators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The crypto market is in full swing.</strong> The competition between the pool of exchanges disregards the regulatory obligations. Ther customers find KYC procedures cumbersome due to which exchanges prefer not to include them in their operations.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>KYC compliance is a time taking process.</strong> It takes hours for crypto exchanges, just like commercial <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/05/kyb-and-aml-screening-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-significant-for-business/\">banks to perform customer due diligence</a> that increases customer drop-out rate.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The cost to undergo KYC procedures</strong> in an organization is too much. Banks are already spending millions of dollars every year <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/23/is-technology-artificially-engineering-panic/\">on ‘due diligence’ measures.</a> The similar norms to take into account as compliance costs for crypto exchanges can become critical.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>There are vague statements.</strong> Crypto exchanges find hard times in analyzing the requirements of KYC and AML regulations in the light of virtual assets. Whether the industry is supposed to undergo KYC compliance, exactly the banks do or there s some leverage.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Regulatory bodies such as FATF and AMLD5 enforce the adoption</strong> of KYC/AML/CFT compliance on virtual currency service providers that perform ‘customer due diligence’ measures.

It’s very likely that many of these experiences will remain as examples for us in the future.</p>\n<p>It’s a good time to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/cybersecurity-ensuring-sanity-in-smart-cities/\">revisit the topic of cybersecurity.</a> Specifically, we need to look at the current forecasts that say we will have 75 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things by 2025. The sheer numbers are beyond comprehension. We should work together <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/developing-a-secure-fintech-app-best-practice-for-2020/\">to seek better standards</a> with adequate certification schemes, including harmonized safety and security provisions to be designed directly into those devices <em>before </em>they arrive in markets.</p>\n<h4>Do the numbers understate the potential growth in the amount and, more importantly, the use of connected devices?</h4>\n<p>Devices that can sense, think, connect and act will enable a world to do many tasks that are anticipated.  Automation will be making everyday activities “smarter” in ways we can only now imagine. The plethora of devices will not only sense the world, but they also will physically act on the planet. Globally, we should all be safer, and all things more sustainable for individuals and businesses.</p>\n<p>Using our devices more often for more things could also make us more vulnerable as we depend on processing and zettabytes of data utilized through increased edge computing (locally, in those devices), along with a growing reliance on the cloud. We must, therefore, step up and assume increased security measures as a core function of these smart devices.</p>\n<p>We’ll only realize the full potential of smart, connected devices if we can trust and rely on them to be safe and secure. Here’s what it’ll take:</p>\n<h3><strong>Shared Standards</strong></h3>\n<p>Currently, services like payments and eGovernment rely on ecosystems that follow globally accepted and implemented security standards, which are supplemented by strong and continually updated commonly trusted certification schemes.</p>\n<p>IoT is still in its early stages where products do not interoperate easily, and such standards and certifications are missing, but we can learn from markets with high-security standards. Another brick in the wall that’s missing is standards that entail the appropriate combination of safety and security. IoT standardization has to learn from Healthcare, Automotive, Industrial, and Critical Infrastructure standards.</p>\n<p>The trust in future IoT is to be based on independent, economically acceptable assessments and applicable to any type of IoT vertical. NXP advocates here a certification standard called “Security Evaluation Scheme for IoT Platforms” (SESIP), grounded in the Common Criteria certification scheme for highly secure components but covering the full span of IoT devices from low-end low-resources ones to the powerful edge-computing gateways.</p>\n<p>In addition, IoT devices will have unmanaged lifetimes. Absolute security does not exist; this implies that we need standards defining ways to recover some baseline functionality in case a system is compromised: resilience is key, and this is where safety and security meet each other. If some level of control can be regained there, is less incentive for it to be attacked again.</p>\n<p>IoT devices will be part of large complex systems; this implies that not only devices but also system security requirements standards are to be defined as well, globally with a focus on local requirements. Mutual recognition of security standards is needed to ensure scalability in the industry.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, in addition to security and safety, a third pillar is to be considered: privacy. IoT devices are accumulating huge amounts of personal data that needs to be protected in a secure way.</p>\n<p>For all those reasons, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/18/what-can-we-expect-for-iot-in-2020/\">governments and industry</a> need to redouble their work to develop and embrace <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/wifi-range-hacks-2020/\">common security standards</a> and certification schemes for this next phase of IoT growth. One such mechanism for this collaboration is the Charter of Trust, which NXP co-founded with Siemens and other leading technology businesses. The Charter serves as a common ground for exploring the needs <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/03/tackling-the-challenge-of-iot-software-updates/\">for shared standards,</a> a way to collaboratively develop them, and a platform from which companies can adopt them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anticipatory Development </strong></h3>\n<p>In our era of rapid and continual change, it’s only smart to anticipate that devices will need to either accommodate <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/08/iot-and-healthcare-when-technology-comes-into-play-to-improve-lives/\">multiple security requirements</a> and adopt to new ones as they’re developed and deployed. This challenges businesses to consider how to make devices and entire solutions more addressable and flexible too, and by those changing needs.</p>\n<p>For instance, there are currently multiple standards for vehicle-to-infrastructure communications (or “V2X”), which is core to enabling smart cars to function as part of integrated, constantly learning, and real-time networks. Add access to all of the less mission-critical functions and services, such as entertainment content and shopping, and it’s vital that designs for new vehicles take into account the likelihood that multiple standards may apply now, and perhaps change in the near future.</p>\n<p>This means designing for multiple standards; think product labels in North America that often include descriptions in English, Spanish and French, so the same products can be marketed on shelves in different countries (and made accessible to different users). It also means focusing on the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/05/7-actionable-tips-to-secure-your-smart-home-and-iot-devices/\">secure connectivity of those devices</a>, not just their functional safety and security, so that devices can be updated (over-the-air, or “OTA”) when needed.</p>\n<p>Again, to stretch the language analogy a bit more, many countries use different algorithms to implement similar methodologies to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/11/ai-startups-need-data-and-the-government-needs-help/\">protect against the same sort of security risks</a> (i.e., attacks can be agnostically identified and ranked by likelihood, frequency, potential impact, etc.). Anticipatory development challenges developers to see these common or shared requirements and address them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Security by Default</strong></h3>\n<p>Ultimately, security is not only a functional attribute of a product or network but rather an aspect of the design itself; security is something that is inherent, “built-in” versus “added on.” Security and safety are holistic system properties. A key strategy to address the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/27/these-mistakes-can-derail-a-legacy-software-conversion/\">emergent security challenge</a> of 75 billion connected devices will be to continue to produce them with security by default</p>\n<p>One way to do this is to physically insert a small component into a device that provides an identifier key and a secure execution environment. Such hard-wiring of one end is what you could call “a secure handshake” (also known as a “root of trust”) makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to hack or trick the device (unless an evil-doer possessed the proper identifier). It’s not a software overlay.</p>\n<p>We possess potent tools to address the emergent <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">cybersecurity challenge</a> ahead of us: Pursuing shared standards, anticipating multiple requirements and changes, and building secure components into devices themselves can, when taken together, empower businesses and ultimately individuals and businesses to benefit from the immense productivity and quality of life advances that continued growth in smart, connected IoT devices will bring.</p>\n<p>And we have at least 75 billion reasons to build a safer IoT world.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/21/75-billion-reasons-to-talk-about-cybersecurity/\">75 Billion Reasons to Talk About Cybersecurity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 15:00:27 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/75-Billion-Reasons-to-Talk-About-Cybersecurity.jpg","linkMd5":"cfabbe8ce8f07c16a71a0f4799c46607","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-577_fcf7a94c31e2d2b1.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/75-Billion-Reasons-to-Talk-About-Cybersecurity.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1282,"sourceBytes":174666,"destBytes":111684,"author":"Lars Reger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/75-Billion-Reasons-to-Talk-About-Cybersecurity-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-591_f823ca5aa1f8570b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877731},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Refocusing Your Agency’s Media Operations During the Pandemic Will Lead to Long-Term Growth","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169186","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/refocusing-media-operations-during-pandemic-long-term-growth/\" title=\"Refocusing Your Agency’s Media Operations During the Pandemic Will Lead to Long-Term Growth\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM-300x198.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM-300x198.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM-242x160.png 242w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM.png 879w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, not many sectors of the economy are growing, including the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/30/invoking-emotional-advertising-to-engage-your-audience/\">advertising</a> industry. In fact, many advertising agencies are looking for ways to trim back as clients postpone projects or cut advertising dollars. This crisis has also caused agency owners to rethink their company structure and to find ways to trim expenses by outsourcing their media department.</p>\n<p>To help agency leaders capitalize on these outsourced cost savings, I sat down with Jack Miller. Miller is CEO of <a href=\"https://www.truemediaservices.com/\">True Media</a>, a media strategy and communications firm that helps corporate clients develop efficient, effective advertising plans. True Media specializes in traditional, digital, social, and mobile media throughout the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>Miller’s take? It’s the ideal time to bring in new resources through partnerships.</p>\n<h1><b>Crises Highlight Challenges</b></h1>\n<p>Crises like the coronavirus outbreak have a way of bringing existing issues to the forefront. The growing complexity of media is a great example.</p>\n<p>“As media has become more fragmented over the past several years and data has become a bigger piece of the puzzle, it has become harder for full-service agencies to do it all,” Miller says. “Agencies’ media teams are struggling to keep pace with staffing, software research, and analytics needs.”</p>\n<p>As agencies look to trim overhead, they’re having to make hard choices: Should they scale back on SEO experts, or should they instead make cuts to the creative department budget? Which media research subscriptions are worth keeping, and which can be done without?</p>\n<p>Larger cuts aren’t always better, Miller cautions. He brings up <a href=\"http://www.brethertonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Learning-To-Love-Recession.pdf\">McKinsey research</a> that shows companies that succeed in recessions aren’t those that tightened their belts the most; they’re the businesses that accept lower short-term profits for long-term gain.</p>\n<p>In other words, successful leaders refocus rather than merely react.</p>\n<h1><b>Refocusing Your Resources</b></h1>\n<p>To Miller, refocusing is a two-step process: “Slash expenses associated with research tools, subscriptions, platforms, and other technology. At the same time,” he recommends, “broaden access to resources and tools available by partnering with a media agency like True Media.”</p>\n<p>The data backs Miller up. A <a href=\"https://cmosurvey.org/who-outsources-marketing/\">CMO survey</a> found that companies that report the greatest increases in profit, sales, and customer acquisition also report the greatest boost to marketing outsourcing.</p>\n<p>Start with areas outside your specialty, Miller suggests. Most agencies were created and developed around their creative prowess and understanding of branding.  Very few were developed around media planning and buying. Agencies should use this time to double down on their core expertise and partner with other firms who have focused expertise in complimentary services.  “We’ve even created partnerships with agencies where we have embedded media personnel into their office so it feels like you still have an “in-house” media department,” Miller said.</p>\n<h1><b>Steering into the Curve</b></h1>\n<p>According to Miller, now is the time to steer into the curve: Identify the media channels that will drive business once the pandemic passes.</p>\n<p>News media is doing well, in particular. Visits to news sites spiked from 417 million in early February <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Media-Consumption-during-the-Coronavirus-Pandemic\">to 523 million</a> in mid-March of this year. Local network television viewership in the nation’s top 25 markets grew by a similar 11%.</p>\n<p>In addition to television and digital news media, Miller suggests social networks. “The time is now for your brand to make a splash on social media. People have come out of the woodwork on platforms like Twitter and Instagram.”</p>\n<p>Influencer marketing experts attribute <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/coronavirus-sparks-huge-jump-social-media-use-study-finds/1677276\">double-digit increases</a> in social media activity to the coronavirus. Between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020, Instagram campaign impressions rose by 22%, while TikTok engagement jumped by 27%.</p>\n<p>Mobile is also faring well during the pandemic. Compared to the same time last March, mobile phone data usage has grown by <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/In-Home-Data-Usage-Increases-During-Coronavirus-Pandemic\">more than 50%</a>. “Think of it this way: You’re going to get 50% more from the same mobile ad spend,” Miller explains.</p>\n<h1><b>The View From the Other Side</b></h1>\n<p>Refocusing your agency’s resources now may be painful. But if you do, you’ll be in a prime position once the economy rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Outsourcing helps agencies run more profitably,” Miller says. “It lets them provide their clients with deeper resources.”</p>\n<p>Those advantages don’t disappear once the crisis does. Larger profit margins leave more room to grow the team, chase leads, and invest in new technologies. A broader bank of resources lets agencies cater to a wider range of client needs.</p>\n<p>“In every economy, including this one,” Miller says, “the best policy is proactivity.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/refocusing-media-operations-during-pandemic-long-term-growth/\">Refocusing Your Agency’s Media Operations During the Pandemic Will Lead to Long-Term Growth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:00:44 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM.png","linkMd5":"d2effca4e2e586721de37c391f4c0b2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-635_410309e44ff87644.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM.png","destWidth":879,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":658687,"destBytes":33166,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-10.28.00-AM-300x198.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-426_a8a588cf7f6db37d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878736},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Best Competency With Artificial Intelligence is by Having Intelligent Experience","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173461","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/04/best-competency-with-artificial-intelligence-is-by-having-intelligent-experience/\" title=\"Best Competency With Artificial Intelligence is by Having Intelligent Experience\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"competency with AI\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>AI is changing the way customers interact with businesses. AI changes everything with how websites and bots will work &#8212; along with many other tools and integrated systems. Businesses protect and manage <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/11/evolving-relationship-between-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data/\">digital assets and data</a> of the company. There is a day-to-day struggle in businesses currently using artificial intelligence, which is made more difficult because of sequential technologies.</p>\n<p>Many businesses are intrigued by the idea of turning to artificial intelligence for help in the sales process. AI is certainly capable of finding your best-qualified sales leads. AI can give you efficient issue resolution, and systems that feed actual data back in for future process and product improvements. However, most enterprises do not know where or how to get started with their &#8220;new&#8221; company AI.</p>\n<p>Systems and data must connect to allow full use of capabilities as if all information were native to each. And also, edgeways to present information to end-users, though data is evolving on a constant basis. The environment requires specialized insight and know-how to ensure a smooth and continuous integration that&#8217;s both relevant and current.</p>\n<p>The intelligent experience is all about leveraging AI to derive predictive insights that can be embedded in the workflow. Companies seeking <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/15/marketing-targets-achieved-with-the-help-of-artificial-intelligence/\">competitive advantage</a> must find ways to make their business operations more intelligent.</p>\n<h2><b>It Starts With a Shift In Focus</b></h2>\n<p>AI functionality is poised to be a game-changer, exploring possibilities and opening up new roles and more business-central activities. However, it&#8217;s important to first understand how intelligent experience can help improve? It starts with a shift in focus.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is edging into business processes across organizations, however, when an organization interacts with the use of AI correctly, that shouldn’t be a sign AI is running the experience behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>AI has the power to make customers feel they are making their choices, but it&#8217;s the machine learning and the algorithms that are handling those decisions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most useful sense, when it comes to shifting in focus, is vision — keeping track of the ability to give suggestions on how to improve.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence is going beyond the senses and going straight to the source – the brain. The very reactive tactic, oftentimes, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/improving-customer-service-using-artificial-intelligence/\">companies are late, identifying customers</a> likely when it&#8217;s too late. This is because there is a major difference between predicting significant changes in the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-transforming-the-financial-markets/\">economy and a financial sign</a> that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence aims to heavily impact a number of industries worldwide — shaping online customer experience models. The AI technology will take hold across many industries over the coming decade, and businesses firmly need to decide how AI will help them to optimize conversions.</p>\n<p>Automating most internal processes, the operational effort involved in maintaining and controlling devices is reduced. However, simultaneously shifting focus, the marketplace, significantly allows configuration.</p>\n<p>More cost-efficiency is rising from artificial intelligence, so customers can focus on increasing the quality and operations of their processes with just an increase in resources.</p>\n<p>It is crucial to assess the landscape of the acquisition time period. This often is where perceptive relations start to form. Customers are going to be comparing their initial experience to the expectations entrepreneurs set during the sales process.</p>\n<h2><b>Examination; Plug Opportunity</b></h2>\n<p>Processes of Artificial Intelligence are making significant progress in reducing several walks of life problems. It also provides automation of not-get interpretation and grasping, restructure the information.</p>\n<p>With AI, as per the market, you can spur on processes, get value from data, and provide clients with a better experience. All those benefits can help drive sales and boost revenue.</p>\n<p>The application of the AI system may now be defined in considerable detail. As of a rule, the cost of Artificial Intelligence requires intelligence on the work being done for proactive development. The development work is usually split into several feasibility studies and set business and project objectives.</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, if Artificial intelligence claims to be a plug-and-play canned legacy, you need to be highly suspicious. You need to have someone trained to take care of this system. (source: coseer.com.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sufficient algorithm performance is a key cost-effective factor, as often a high-quality algorithm requires a round of tuning sessions. To decide between various algorithmic approaches towards businesses, one needs to understand how exactly inculcation takes place under the hood, and what can be done to obtain competency.</p>\n<p>If it is not clear up-front, one may end up in a situation of not-more-performing. AI is certainly exciting, but business owners cannot jump into it without first laying the foundation with basic analytics.</p>\n<h2><b>Odds Of Probability</b></h2>\n<p>With so many possibilities for applying AI across an organization, in all likelihood, deploying an AI system must be effective. AI is often considered solely from a technology perspective and little wonder since its capabilities rely on—and continually improve through—technical innovations.</p>\n<p>Deploy with quick-witted positioned skills and a variety of tools to create AI algorithms that can be inserted into enterprise applications. Quick wins bring an added bonus. Meaning that getting the most out of AI is about validating AI’s ability to spark value, keeping momentum and funding, and going for longer-term projects.</p>\n<p>AI doesn’t thrive in a vacuum. Businesses that generate value from AI deal with it as a major business transformation initiative that requires non-similar parts of the company to come together and work with probable expectations. AI is the <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9402-artificial-intelligence-business-trends.html\">future of business operations</a>.</p>\n<p>When contemplating an investment in AI, be sure you have pragmatic predictions and have a setup that will allow you to embed insights into the daily workflow of your organization. Through the power of AI, you can start blurring the lines between sales, service, and marketing.</p>\n<p>The power of artificial intelligence needs a hard edge at business processes and the majority of resources. From there, your company can use AI in a way that actually helps your business grow and ultimately boost your bottom line.</p>\n<p><em>Image Source: Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/04/best-competency-with-artificial-intelligence-is-by-having-intelligent-experience/\">Best Competency With Artificial Intelligence is by Having Intelligent Experience</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 17:31:36 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience.jpeg","linkMd5":"f3dc525b408279ad3e04e62891f37a1f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-09-701_a2992d2331669b9b.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":55178,"destBytes":46754,"author":"Adedeji Omotayo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Competency-With-Artificial-Intelligence-is-by-Having-Intelligent-Experience-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-16-183_c7ad87cad6c631af.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872544},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"!Important: When an App is a Literal Lifesaver","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174550","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/important-when-an-app-is-a-literal-lifesaver/\" title=\"!Important: When an App is a Literal Lifesaver\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-300x158.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Important\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-300x158.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-900x473.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-260x137.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-1536x807.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>As pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and the differently-abled know, sharing the road has inherent risks. Distracted drivers, car doors that suddenly swing open, vehicles making abrupt lane changes, and now automobiles and trucks with no drivers at all.; they all put us at risk. It doesn&#8217;t matter how vigilant a person is, every time you head out onto the streets, you&#8217;re putting your life in the hands of people and technology over which you have no control.</p>\n<p>But now, entrepreneur and inventor, Bastien Beauchamp, has set out on a mission to change this paradigm and potentially save a million lives over the next decade. His new app, !<a href=\"https://www.important.com/\">important</a>, is the first of its kind and could be a revolution in on-road safety if he achieves his objective of having the technology integrated into a significant number of vehicles.</p>\n<h3><strong>A Game Changer for Pedestrian, Bicyclist and Motor-Cycle Safety</strong></h3>\n<p>The app&#8217;s premise is smart but simple; notify drivers and autonomous vehicles that you&#8217;re in the vicinity. The !important app communicates the user&#8217;s location to nearby connected vehicles. The technology alerts drivers to your presence and can even trigger vehicles&#8217; brakes automatically to prevent a collision with an approaching person, bicyclist, or motorcyclist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until now,&#8221; says Bastien, the founder and CEO of !important, &#8220;aside from being vigilant, or using high-visibility clothing or accessories, there has been little non-vehicular travelers could do to protect themselves on the road. My app is a bit like a digital safety-belt. !important provides drivers with an early-warning system, alerting both human operators as well as AI-controlled vehicles to the presence and precise location of hard to see and less predictable travelers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today, whether you&#8217;re a driver interested in reducing the risk that you&#8217;ll be involved in a collision, or a pedestrian, cyclist, or motor-cycle enthusiast who believes in taking proactive steps to remain safe, !important&#8217;s new application can be a game-changer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Future Plans</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to announcing its free app release on both the App and Google Play stores, the company is taking its first steps towards integration into our transportation system.</p>\n<p>The company announced a pilot program starting in 2021; the technology will be implemented in vehicles on the roads of Reno, Nevada (USA) as part of the Intelligent Mobility (IM) initiative in collaboration with the Nevada Center for Applied Research (NCAR) at the University of Nevada in Reno.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Director of NCAR, Carlos G. Cardillo, remarked that <em>&#8220;The !important app will increase the safety of vulnerable road users and the acceptance of autonomous vehicle infrastructure by minimizing potential dangers.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>!important is also working with several automotive and truck manufacturers to integrate their technology into vehicles that have semi or fully-autonomous systems. Integrating !important&#8217;s technology into cars will allow vehicles to receive input directly from the app, alert them to pedestrians and other travelers, and where necessary, automatically applying the vehicle&#8217;s brakes when the systems sense a potential collision.</p>\n<p>Tara Andringa, Executive Director of Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE), summed it up well: <em>&#8220;… a key issue is how we will ensure pedestrian safety in an automated vehicle (AV) world. !important is tackling this problem of pedestrian safety, and their mobile app seeks to enhance road safety by improving communication between pedestrians and other road users.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>When asked what inspired the idea for this life-protecting product, CEO Bastian Beauchamp says, &#8220;When I heard about the <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2018/03/19/uber-autonomous-volvo-fatality/\">fatal accident</a> where the autonomous Uber vehicle hit a bicyclist, it woke me up. I kept thinking about the victim&#8217;s friends and family. Then I realized that there were hundreds of thousands of self-driving vehicles on the road within a few years. I thought that someone should do something, and then I decided that someone should be me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The !important app is free for download from the Google Play Store and the App Store or directly from <a href=\"https://www.important.com/application-download\">!important</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>About</strong>:</p>\n<p>!important was nominated by Alibaba Jumpstarter 2020 in the Top 30 Startups of Silicon Valley. !important is a company backed by groups of medical doctors and is part of the University of California Berkeley Skydeck and Ann Arbor SPARK accelerator programs. It collaborates with 12 universities.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/important-when-an-app-is-a-literal-lifesaver/\">!Important: When an App is a Literal Lifesaver</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 02:27:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important.png","linkMd5":"51ab78abecfaf2108c76c8b71d8ebd52","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-780_d682119f11671544.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important.png","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1009,"sourceBytes":2165685,"destBytes":145522,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Important-300x158.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-609_ae86abcb6b9c08d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873868},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"How Legal Tech Companies Are Re-Shaping the Legal World","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174790","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/23/how-legal-tech-companies-are-shaping-the-legal-world/\" title=\"How Legal Tech Companies Are Re-Shaping the Legal World\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"legal tech\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal tech includes software and other tools that help attorneys and their support staff to provide legal services to clients. Many new applications empower reputable firms to improve their efficiency and adapt to mobile working environments. Here&#8217;s how legal tech companies are re-shaping the legal world.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal tech also gives small firms and individual practitioners a chance to compete with larger competitors. It grants them access to powerful research tools. And, the right tech tools are essential for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/28/lawyers-land-more-clients-with-these-5-marketing-strategies/\">law firms</a> that want to stay competitive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding and embracing these </span><a href=\"https://www.lsc.gov/meetings-and-events/tech-conference\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">innovations in technology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be the key to success in today’s legal profession. </span></p>\n<h2><b>What are Companies Considered Legal Tech Companies?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are many legal tech companies in the world, what we are looking for is to be provided with technology that genuinely stands out in a crowded market. For instance, Relativity gives specific technology to lawyers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Relativity tech, lawyers can store and search for documents, automate contract reviews, and perform other regulatory work and due diligence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major U.S. law firms use the service. Some large firms and in-house corporate legal departments have hired experts from Relativity to help them set up eDiscovery departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other essential legal tech companies are Apttus, Everlaw, HighQ, and iManage. These companies produce software that simplifies the way companies manage their sales processes and contracts, collaborate on litigation, and handle important documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal technology allows lawyers to focus on their cases and reduce their time in document review and management. </span></p>\n<h2><b>How Have These Developments Affected the Legal Profession?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has caused a revolution in the legal profession that has reshaped its culture, composition, delivery, skill sets, and priorities. These developments have not only bolstered departments within law firms but have also improved their reputations. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Firms go global</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firms are now able to operate globally, collaborate with other lawyers, and improve service delivery. They are no longer stuck in the limited geographic markets established long ago by significant law firms. Now lawyers can provide services to clients on a more global scale, which benefits clients who conduct business internationally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expansion of law firms into global markets has also made legal services somewhat more uniform. Furthermore, clients can now review their lawyers online, forcing attorneys to perform at a consistently high level. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Customer satisfaction and AI move to the front.</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, this new technology has given </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawyers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and law firms new service models that are customer-centric and that meld human resources with tech to optimize performance. In these new models, profit flows from customer satisfaction rather than hours billed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawyers are no longer tasked with brute force labor. They can rely on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/07/the-automation-boom-is-coming-will-the-internet-be-ready/\">automation</a> to maximize their resources. Technology has replaced the repetitive tasks of a lawyer&#8217;s work with new software. This can make lawyers more efficient and save both clients and firms money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arrival of technology in the legal world is transforming the profession from a pedigree-centric, tradition-bound, labor-intensive field into something entirely different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech has made legal services more flexible and given lawyers access to effective automation. With new delivery models and methods, practices are shrinking while clientele is expanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is the promotion of efficiency, risk prediction, enhanced value, and cost reduction. With this expansion comes the availability of legal services to everyone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, technology makes both primary and secondary legal source materials easier to access. For example, </span><a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/free-the-law-will-provide-open-access-to-all/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Law School decided to digitize</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their collection of 40 million pages of case law and give everyone free online access to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the use of legal tech and software can automate many parts of a lawyer&#8217;s job. Many legal tech tools have begun incorporating artificial intelligence, cloud computing, legal research and automation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rise in automation has caused some lawyers to fear it&#8217;s only a matter of time before tech disrupts the delivery of legal services. Despite this worry, thus far, legal technology has not taken jobs from human attorneys. Instead, it has improved the work for those who are willing to accept it. </span></p>\n<h2><b>What Is a Legal Tech Incubator?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general tech incubator involves a larger business providing support and mentorship to small start-up tech companies. Legal tech incubators include well-established law firms creating space for the rapidly increasing number of start-ups providing legal tech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, global law firms such as Allen &#38; Overy, Clifford Chance, and Mischon de Reya have each created incubator programs for up and coming legal tech companies. These incubators help member businesses grow and succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that success requires more than just space and positive intentions. Successful incubators must focus on solving issues commonly faced by law firms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focusing on the issues is often accomplished by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/5-benefits-attracting-tech-talent-to-your-startup/\">providing human resources</a> and mentorship. In these programs, the host company regularly teaches smaller companies to face their problems. The teaching, training, and mentorship are accomplished through meticulous planning, organization skills, a technical focus, and consideration of consumer opinions. </span></p>\n<h2><b>What Are Some Legal Tech Start-Ups?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the established legal tech companies, there are many start-ups as well. Legal start-ups rose in popularity in recent years. Some examples include Luminance, Libryo, Lexoo, CrowdJustice, Alacrity, and Advokatguiden. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.luminance.com/\"><b>Luminance</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a relatively new company that provides artificial intelligence for the legal profession. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://libryo.com/\"><b>Libryo</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers software that helps individuals in any organization to understand applicable legal obligations. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.lexoo.com/\"><b>Lexoo</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an online platform that gives individuals access to international lawyers and is also used by companies to compare and recruit lawyers for their in-house legal departments. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/\"><b>CrowdJustice</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a crowdfunding platform for public interest litigation. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://alacritylaw.com/#section1\"><b>Alacrity</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a web-based platform that lets major corporations and law firms connect and improve their service delivery. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.advokatguiden.no/sted/oslo-advokat\"><b>Advokatguiden</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a Norwegian website that publishes client reviews of lawyers and firms. Advokatguiden.no has forced transparency onto the legal profession and gives individuals insight into a lawyer&#8217;s pricing, skills, and track record. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Embracing Legal Tech</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rising popularity of legal tech has contributed to the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/14/6-tech-trends-that-will-dominate-the-new-decade/\">globalization of legal practice</a>. The implementation of legal tech has also created new delivery models that focus on efficiency and the customer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal tech opened these services to a broader client base and led to the adoption of automation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some are concerned about this new technology, other firms are embracing it. Legal tech incubators now help startups provide new legal technology to the profession. </span></p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: August de Richelieu; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/23/how-legal-tech-companies-are-shaping-the-legal-world/\">How Legal Tech Companies Are Re-Shaping the Legal World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 15:01:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World.jpg","linkMd5":"62432b4b5b63bab5886f45b9713d584e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-675_abfb41eefc87fb75.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":854,"sourceBytes":176035,"destBytes":96452,"author":"John Boitnott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/How-Legal-Tech-Companies-Are-Re-Shaping-the-Legal-World-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-17-749_309cdc283908bfaf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873317},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Adding Cellular Connectivity to Your IoT Device","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166927","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/27/adding-cellular-connectivity-to-your-iot-device/\" title=\"Adding Cellular Connectivity to Your IoT Device\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"cellular connectivity\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In an increasingly connected world, data drives decision making within organizations, from the world’s most significant to the smallest. The Internet of Things (IoT) &#8211; <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/07/26/arm-iot-2035-dl1/\">an ever-expanding network of devices</a> &#8211; promises to offer business leaders even greater insight, but that means original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) must seize the opportunities and the challenges that are presented.</p>\n<h2>To realize the potential of the IoT, new technologies must be enabled by reliable wireless connectivity.</h2>\n<p>Cellular connectivity provides precisely that. Cellular devices can be deployed anywhere, seamlessly provisioned, and just work. WiFi devices require complicated configuration for the nearest hotspot.</p>\n<p>Cellular networks are established, trusted, and secure. They also require a subscriber identity module, or SIM, to authenticate a device so it can be connected to a mobile network, and to store and process sensitive subscriber information.</p>\n<h4>A SIM needs to be found and installed for each country or region a device ships to.</h4>\n<p>However, a traditional SIM card can create challenges for OEMs that are trying to meet the needs of data-hungry organizations and make their previously ‘dumb’ devices smart. A SIM needs to be procured and installed for each country or region a device ships to, which complicates manufacturing and logistics. For customers, who have to physically swap the SIM card when they want to switch providers to improve connectivity or control costs, it’s inconvenient and prohibitively expensive in the case of large-scale deployments.</p>\n<p>The embedded SIM (eSIM) or eUICC addresses all these concerns and enables seamless connectivity and invaluable data insights.</p>\n<h3><b>The Benefits of eSIM</b></h3>\n<p>The eSIM is still a physical SIM, but it’s not removable, it’s soldered into a device. The eUICC element, as outlined in the GSMA specifications, allows for the carrier provider to be changed remotely without any physical swapping of SIMs. As a result, it offers significant advantages over traditional cards:</p>\n<p><b>Smaller size:</b> the chip is approximately half the size of a nano-SIM. Also, the space that would have been allocated to a card tray and contacts is no longer needed, so the size of a device could be reduced. Additionally, connectivity could be added to smaller products, or space could be used for value-adding features such as a larger battery or more components.</p>\n<p><b>Remote management: </b>SIM profiles can now be updated digitally using <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/iot/embedded-sim/\">remote SIM provisioning</a> (RSP), which eliminates complex SIM sourcing and logistics for OEMs. It also means that device makers can offer enterprises IoT devices that can be deployed across businesses, cities, or countries with a more cost-effective way of managing them at scale.</p>\n<p><b>Lower costs:</b> the smaller form factor lowers costs, while the total cost of ownership can be reduced as a result of reduced complexity in the supply chain and in device management.</p>\n<p><b>Maintains security:</b> according to the GSMA, eSIM provides an equivalent level of security as the removable SIM card. You can’t damage it as easily, tamper with it or steal it, and it’s better able to withstand harsh environments.</p>\n<p><b>Faster deployment:</b> connectivity is built into the device from the outset so that IoT projects can get off the ground quicker. Cellular devices can be deployed ANYWHERE, seamlessly provisioned, and work. Wifi devices require complicated configuration for the nearest hotspot.</p>\n<p><b>Differentiation:</b> in a world where data are increasingly driving decision making, the seamless connectivity that eSIMs enable can be a point of differentiation for device makers (for example, versus WiFi counterparts), and will help us realize the potential of the IoT.</p>\n<h3><b>The Industry’s Response to eSIM</b></h3>\n<p>Recently, Arm <a href=\"https://community.arm.com/iot/b/internet-of-things/posts/what-oems-really-think-about-esim-and-isim\">asked a range of partners</a> from across the Arm ecosystem for their views on new SIM technology. Eighty-eight percent of OEMs said they were aware of eSIM and understood the potential benefits and the opportunities it offers. However, they also had concerns.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>More than two-thirds (68%) of people believed their more established stakeholders would be reluctant to move away from traditional SIM technology.</li>\n<li>Nearly half (44%) said the complexity of delivering eSIM projects worried them.</li>\n<li>And more than half of respondents (57%) said they were concerned about the cost of adoption.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Confidence in the technology will grow as more OEMs embrace it and an increase in the number of products with seamless connectivity will lead to lower manufacturing and implementation costs. The total cost of ownership for eSIM, as described earlier, is much lower than for the traditional SIM, and the savings will filter through the value chain as eSIM becomes more popular.</p>\n<p>For now, though, much of the awareness comes from within larger manufacturers involved in the automotive sector, or through organizations developing consumer connected devices such as smartphones, watches, or laptops. More support and information will need to be provided to OEMs, in particular, small- and medium-sized organizations if we want to boost confidence in the market and accelerate adoption.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we’ve produced a white paper to make building cellular connectivity into an IoT device simpler. It outlines the top seven considerations for every project. They are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><b> Selecting a Cellular Technology</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to the widely used 3G and 4G networks, and emerging 5G technology, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specifications compete for large-scale IoT deployment. The use case and other factors such as power, performance and mobility requirements should inform the choice of technology.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Finding the right SIM</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The eSIM has been developed to meet the needs of two distinct markets: machine-to-machine or IoT (e.g., smart meters) and consumers (e.g., mobile phones). Besides, the physical form can come in different grades, providing greater robustness for applications such as the automotive industry.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Choosing an Operating System</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The components that make up an operating system (OS) and connect a SIM to a network are defined in global standards. They enable a device to move seamlessly between networks and carriers. To select an OS, several essential criteria should be considered, including compliance, network support, and footprint.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Establishing Initial Connectivity</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An eSIM must be configured with a bootstrap profile so a device can connect to a network from the outset. The choice of profile will be determined by cost, and the coverage and flexibility required.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Personalization</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a SIM is created, it’s given a unique identity and loaded with the data that enables it to authenticate to a network. This process is called personalization. The business relationships, certification, and RSP platform used by the personalization partner should be considered before moving forward.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Deployment and Remote Management</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The GSMA’s standard structures and processes set out the requirements for the remote management of devices using RSP. To enable that functionality, module and device manufacturers must upload information about the eSIM to an RSP platform. Accreditation, ease of integration, and interoperability are all crucial factors to consider before an RSP partner is selected.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Standards and Certification</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Global specifications have been developed to ensure manufacturing, security, personalization, and RSP meet agreed standards. It further is agreed that devices operate effectively across networks, carriers, and vendors. OEMs should be familiar with these requirements.</p>\n<p>A number of eSIM solution providers exist to help OEMs realize the benefits of the IoT. Many will take manufacturers through all of the steps highlighted above, either in a consultancy capacity or by offering an end-to-end service. Arm provides <a href=\"https://www.arm.com/products/iot/kigen-sim/support\">flexible support</a> and is one of the few to suggest OEMs take advantage of a free trial period before making a longer-term commitment.</p>\n<p>In a recent blog, Arm outlined the extraordinary potential for growth in the <a href=\"https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/esim-trillion-device-opportunity\">cellular IoT technology</a> market, where <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cellular-internet-of-thing-iot-market\">revenue is estimated to reach almost £8 billion by 2025</a>. eSIM, and the emerging technology iSIM or <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/esim/blog-from-arm-unlocking-secure-iot-device-connectivity-with-isim/\">integrated eUICC</a>, which puts SIM functionality into the system-on-chip (SoC), enable us to reach more people, move into hard-to-access areas and cross borders while reducing the cost and complexity of IoT.</p>\n<p>For more information on building cellular connectivity into your next IoT design, please <a href=\"https://learn.arm.com/kigen-cellular-guide.html?utm_source=read-write&#38;utm_medium=sponsored-content&#38;utm_campaign=2020_ebg-kigen_mk01-2_na_na_arm&#38;utm_content=whitepaper\"><strong>download the white paper</strong></a> from the Arm website.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Image Credit &#8212; GettyImages #149081218</strong> </em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/27/adding-cellular-connectivity-to-your-iot-device/\">Adding Cellular Connectivity to Your IoT Device</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:34 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device.jpg","linkMd5":"98e009e207e65e0af7470f2c5e2989db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-23-389_02ced77b7a344cfe.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":46302,"destBytes":44190,"author":"Karsten Harlow","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Adding-Cellular-Connectivity-to-Your-IoT-Device-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-20-985_80df8fdf3ed1a783.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880443},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"How to Measure and Analyze Content Marketing Success","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171282","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/how-to-measure-and-analyze-content-marketing-success/\" title=\"How to Measure and Analyze Content Marketing Success\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"201\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-300x201.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-300x201.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-900x602.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-239x160.jpg 239w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By now, virtually every brand across any industry or niche is doing some form of content marketing. Many of these businesses have formal content marketing strategies with editorial guidelines, content calendars, and posting schedules. But very few take the time to carefully measure content marketing results. And unfortunately, this comprises the very integrity of these campaigns by limiting or suppressing optimum results. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this article, we’re going to explore precise ways you can measure your content marketing efforts to get a clearer picture of what’s happening both at a micro and macro level. By the end, you should have some clear action steps on how you can proceed in the coming days and weeks. </span></p>\n<p><b>Why Measure Content Marketing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before we dig into the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">how</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of measuring and analyzing content marketing, let’s explore the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In other words, why should you measure your content marketing in the first place?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though each individual brand will have its own unique list of reasons, there are ultimately three overarching purposes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Clarity. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s impossible to know how your content is being received if you don’t take the time to study the data and analyze the trends. Careful measurement and analysis pave the way for greater clarity. </span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Justification. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re investing in content marketing within a large organization or multi-layered business, you have to be prepared to justify the investment. Subjective statements and generalities will only go so far. Eventually, the people calling the shots will want to see objective data and numerical trends to offer their continued support.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Optimization. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/17/the-diminishing-returns-of-outsourcing-and-the-fallacy-of-automation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trends come and go</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Best practices evolve. New strategies emerge. A static content marketing strategy eventually crumbles into a heap of irrelevant ashes. The only way to optimize with any real strategy or direction is to measure what’s happening on the ground floor so that you can </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/how-to-successfully-automate-your-approach-to-guest-blogger-outreach/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">make the necessary changes and adjustments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> over time.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Measuring content marketing takes time. Analyzing the data and trends requires a hefty ongoing commitment. But when you understand the impact, it becomes much easier to stay committed and tuned in. When in doubt, return to these three purposes and let them guide your decision-making. </span></p>\n<p><b>How Often Should You Measure Your Content Marketing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This question of how often is ultimately one of personal preference. However, the real answer is that you should be measuring content marketing as often as you can. (Ideally it’s a continual process.)</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://databox.com/how-to-hit-smart-marketing-goals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to one industry survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, leading experts set goals and track KPIs for every piece of content they create. Approximately 37 percent of marketers monitor the success of their content marketing every week, while another 26 percent do so on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><b>How to Measure and Analyze for Optimal Clarity</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Okay, now that we’ve laid the groundwork and developed a common understanding of why content marketing needs continual measurement and analysis, let’s dig in and look at the action steps you can take to get clear and insightful takeaways that lead to growth and improvement.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Get Clear on Your Goals</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every good content marketing strategy starts with a definitive set of goals and desired results. Before you move any further in the process, it’s imperative that you get very clear on what these goals are in order that you can track against them. This includes both overarching goals, as well as content-specific objectives that apply to individual mediums and pieces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Begin with your overarching goal:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are you trying to increase your brand exposure to relevant members of your target audience?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is your primary objective to drive traffic to sales pages so that you can drum up conversions?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is your goal to educate people in order that you can cultivate an informed following?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then there are the content-specific goals, like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increasing blog readership</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gaining backlinks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Improving search rankings</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each of these goals requires a different approach on the analysis front. (And it’s possible that you’ll have a combination of overlapping goals.) By getting clear on what your goals are, you can select the right measurements to move forward with.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Track These Metrics</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Based on your goals, here are some powerful metrics you can analyze to measure content marketing efficacy:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Website traffic. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Track your website traffic data every single day and overlay it with your content posting schedule. Look for a correlation between when content is posted and how traffic fluctuates. Do you notice an uptick in traffic based certain types of content (quality) or the number of posts you publish (quantity)?</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subscriber growth. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Email marketing is obviously a huge component of content marketing. By tracking your subscriber growth and opt-ins, you can see how many new people you’re reaching over time. You should also track opt-outs and other engagement metrics, which tells you if people like what they’re getting. </span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Average time on page. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google analytics has a neat metric that allows you to track the average amount of time people are spending on each page of content you produce. Keep an eye on this data point, as it’ll give you a good idea of whether people are quickly scanning your content and bouncing, or if they’re actually taking the time to consume what you’re publishing. Over time, you’ll notice that certain types of content lead to a spike in the average time on page. </span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Click-through rate (CTR). <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your CTR tells you what percentage of a page’s visitors click through your content and go to other pages on your website. In other words, it tells you how well you’re doing at convincing people to continue the experience with your brand (versus leave for another website).</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Social shares. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Comments and likes on social media are one thing. But the true test of whether your content is resonating is how many shares it gets. You don’t need all of your content to go viral, but you should try to get a few shares per post. This increases the eyeballs/impressions and increases your likelihood of finding success.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This data can be pulled from a variety of sources, including website Analytics, email analytics, social media analytics, and a combination of standalone tools and trackers that you use. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Check Your Backlinks</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s one thing to share your content and pump it out across a variety of social channels, but if you want to double or triple the impact of your content, you need a </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">backlinking strategy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that encourages other websites and blogs to link back to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Use a </span><a href=\"https://seo.co/tools/backlink-checker/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">backlink checker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to identify all of the inbound links to your site and consistently measure for growth and attrition. Ideally, you should be picking up dozens (or hundreds) of backlinks a year. This not only leads to the increased potential of referral traffic back to your website, but it also strengthens your search rankings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you find one specific website or blog that regularly links back to your content, it might be worth sending them a quick thank you message for their support. (It would also be smart to link back to their site, when relevant and appropriate.)</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Study Search Ranking Trends</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the primary goals of content marketing is to amplify your website’s SEO and improve search rankings, which enhances discoverability and subsequently increases your chances of driving organic traffic back to your URLs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Study your search rankings over time &#8211; both on a domain-level and page-level. In other words, you should be tracking your website’s search ranking trends, as well as individual pieces of content and how they rank for particular keywords. This can all be done via a combination of tools like Google Analytics, Moz, Ahrefs, etc.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Look for Anecdotal Evidence of Engagement</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If search rankings and SEO represent the technical side of content marketing, engagement is associated with the softer side of things. But just because it’s more anecdotal doesn’t mean it lacks measurable metrics. In fact, studying content engagement is one of the keys to being successful. Here are some different elements to analyze:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Blog comments. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Comments on your blog posts &#8211; organic, not spammy &#8211; are a sign that your content is working. Don’t fret too much about whether these comments are positive or negative. The fact that you’re driving conversation is key.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Email replies. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are people replying to your email newsletters and blasts? This will tell you a lot about how effective the content is. (A lack of replies doesn’t necessarily indicate your emails are ineffective, but an abundance of them definitely shows you’re getting the job done.)</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Scrolling. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How far are people scrolling down on your blog posts and content? There are a variety of tools you can embed into your site to gather these insights. It’ll show you where people tend to drop off.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re doing well in these areas, your engagement is high. This is perhaps the clearest indicator that your content marketing is working. </span></p>\n<p><b>Adding it All Up</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don’t let the volume of data or the dozens of different KPIs and measurements overwhelm you. You don’t have to tackle everything at once. In fact, you probably shouldn&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The best approach is to start with one goal and to spend a week tracking it. Then add in another goal and measurement the next week. As you become more familiar with studying your content &#8211; and as you simultaneously add more analysis to your repertoire &#8211; you’ll gain even greater clarity into what’s happening and where you can improve.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/how-to-measure-and-analyze-content-marketing-success/\">How to Measure and Analyze Content Marketing Success</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:03:43 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics.jpg","linkMd5":"c54811b02f0f34eb52449dda709ca162","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-916_f4c95ca10c9d23ed.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1285,"sourceBytes":171471,"destBytes":119086,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/content-marketing-success-metrics-300x201.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-11-859_740c6029f0e97262.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877583},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"Avoid Chaos at Scale: How to Prevent Your Robots from Running Amok","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170969&preview=true&preview_id=170969","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/avoid-chaos-at-scale-how-to-prevent-your-robots-from-running-amok/\" title=\"Avoid Chaos at Scale: How to Prevent Your Robots from Running Amok\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok-300x224.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"prevent robots running amok\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok-300x224.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok-900x671.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok-215x160.jpg 215w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Although robotic process automation (RPA) is at the heart of many digital transformation efforts. RPA is all too common for organizations when rolling out their software robots in a piecemeal fashion. For example, finance deploys its own set of bots, while manufacturing rolls out another &#8212; without coordination between the departments. A decentralized approach presents a risk for your company &#8212; one that leads to problems later. Here is how to avoid chaos at scale and prevent your robots from running amok.</p>\n<h2>Automated processes often require robots to interact with each other.</h2>\n<p>You want your robots to access and disseminate data. What this means is that these robots are often dependent on related systems and policies. But what happens when one of those policies change or a system breaks down? Your robots stop working and processes come to a grinding halt.</p>\n<h4>There’s no shortage of situations in which your robot will stop working.</h4>\n<p>Think about it: Legacy systems and websites evolve; applications are updated; passwords expire; spreadsheets get modified and security patches get applied.</p>\n<p>Without some sort of standard or way of managing and maintaining your army of robots, when a policy is changed, the robots won’t know what to do – and they’ll run amok.</p>\n<h4>Organizations can prevent chaos by putting in a strong governance program.</h4>\n<p>A governance program becomes especially important as you scale your RPA initiatives. In fact, a lack of governance is one of the most common reasons that initial RPA projects fail, according to EY. Without a strong governance program and the right robot lifecycle management tools in place, organizations put their automation initiatives at risk.</p>\n<p>Robots need guidance, management, and maintenance to continue to work properly and deliver maximum value to the organization. The organizations need to put three essential components in place: a guiding framework, a Centre of Excellence, and robot lifecycle management and analytics tools to support the program.</p>\n<h2>Lay the Governance Groundwork</h2>\n<p>To maximize RPA benefits, chief operating officers (COOs) and chief information officers (CIOs) must collaborate. With effective collaboration, the COO and CIO will establish an optimal software robot deployment and operating model.</p>\n<p>In designing and implementing a guiding framework, they lay the governance groundwork for how their digital workforce will collaborate. This is very similar to the compliance policies that human talent sign when they start working for a company.</p>\n<h3>An effective robotics framework requires three elements.</h3>\n<p>An enterprise robotics council: This team spearheads the program, defines its scope, and sets targets for tracking execution efficiency and outcomes.</p>\n<h4>A business unit governance council.</h4>\n<p>This group is responsible for prioritizing RPA projects across departments and business units. An RPA technical council or Centre of Excellence (COE). The team designs standards, formulates working principles and guidelines and compiles best practices. Establish a Centre of Excellence</p>\n<p>The Centre of Excellence is a group of core resources and people responsible for guiding everything related to automation, including managing and maintaining standards and vendors. They establish the best practices &#8212; training and so much more.</p>\n<p>The Centre of Excellence members includes IT as well as subject matter experts from each business unit. With this collection of intelligence, the team is better equipped not only to make decisions on the right RPA tools to deploy. They also process prime candidates for automation.</p>\n<p><strong>There are three main CoE models, which differ according to how responsibilities are shared across the enterprise.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Centralized operating model</strong> &#8212; A single team is responsible for running and controlling all aspects of the program.<br />\n<strong>Decentralized &#8212;</strong> operating model: The responsibilities for running the automation program are replicated across separate business units within the organization.<br />\n<strong>Hybrid operating model &#8212;</strong> Some aspects of the automation program are run by a single, centralized team, while others are replicated across business units.</p>\n<p>Organizations should choose the model that makes the most sense given where they are today and adjust down the road as needed.</p>\n<h2>Invest in Robot Lifecycle Management Tools and Analytics</h2>\n<p>Governance is easy to accomplish when RPA tools include management and oversight capabilities like version control. More sophisticated capabilities, such as Robot Lifecycle Management, help teams manage enterprise RPA robot deployments from hundreds to thousands of RPA robots.</p>\n<p>For example, the tools help users keep track of changes, compare files and explore changes made. In addition, they also make it easy to store backup files so that if companies have to revert to a previous working version, they can do so effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>At scale, a strong governance and version control program becomes increasingly important.</h2>\n<p>When a robot breaks down, if you don’t have governance or digital workforce analytics, it’s almost impossible to track which one among hundreds or thousands is causing an issue or where one may have crashed into another and stopped a process in its tracks.</p>\n<p>By leveraging a Centre of Excellence along with sophisticated tools like Robot Lifecycle Management, organizations can take a more business-centric approach to RPA that goes far beyond simple task automation.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>A strong governance program is a key RPA success indicator. When it’s supported by Robot Lifecycle Management and digital workforce analytics, you reduce the risk your robots will run amok.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Elina Krima; Pexels -[my thoughts for pic are &#8220;crazy robots!&#8221; drr]</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/avoid-chaos-at-scale-how-to-prevent-your-robots-from-running-amok/\">Avoid Chaos at Scale: How to Prevent Your Robots from Running Amok</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:00:22 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok.jpg","linkMd5":"fbfb15fc32dc5deb4582172a3f64ed5b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-373_a0cc0f79b5eb1d1f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":954,"sourceBytes":149994,"destBytes":28698,"author":"Tyler Suss","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Prevent-Your-Robots-from-Running-Amok-300x224.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-10-853_526b19ef90e4a039.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873339},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"How 6 Tech Giants Are Giving SMBs a Hand in the Pandemic","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170079","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/how-6-tech-giants-are-giving-smbs-a-hand-in-the-pandemic/\" title=\"How 6 Tech Giants Are Giving SMBs a Hand in the Pandemic\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM-300x243.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM-300x243.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM-198x160.png 198w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM.png 732w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Success doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Never has that been clearer than during COVID-19, the pandemic currently roiling the world economy. </p>\n<p>Small- and medium-sized businesses compete with larger companies, but they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/28/3-predictions-for-corporate-innovation-in-2019/\">also depend</a> on them. Here’s how some of the biggest players in tech are making life easier for SMBs:</p>\n<h1><b>1. Microsoft</b></h1>\n<p>Microsoft was big tech before big tech existed. While most of the companies on this list got their start during the dot-com boom or after, Microsoft marked the new millennium by celebrating its 25th birthday. </p>\n<p>In the wake of COVID, Microsoft is leveraging its perspective to help leaders understand how the virus is affecting their community. Its <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/covid\">COVID-19 tracker</a> can zoom into specific counties, displaying related news in a sidebar. Those insights can help SMBs make better decisions about how great the risk is to employees, when to shut their doors, and where donations can do the most good. </p>\n<h1><b>2. Kabbage</b></h1>\n<p>Before Kabbage, the SMB lending process took ages. Kabbage’s cash flow management tools make it possible for companies to get cash in minutes, not weeks. </p>\n<p>Shortly after COVID reached U.S. shores, Kabbage unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.kabbage.com/helpsmallbusiness\">Help Small Business initiative</a>. Site visitors can purchase online gift certificates to local businesses, giving them another way to raise revenue when sales are likely dropping. Businesses that sign up for Help Small Business can access funds as soon as the next business day after a customer purchases a certificate. </p>\n<h1><b>3. Salesforce</b></h1>\n<p>A great CRM sets the foundation for sustainable growth. Salesforce, another company founded in the 20th century, introduced small businesses to the benefits of CRMs.</p>\n<p>Salesforce’s solutions integrate with lots of other tools, meaning SMBs don’t need to rebuild from the ground up to add services. Additional communication channels — such as email, chat, and social — empower SMBs to communicate with and track prospects across channels. </p>\n<p>For COVID, Salesforce has partnered with data visualization tool Tableau. Their <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources\">COVID-19 data hub</a> lets users look at coronavirus growth trajectories by country, helping them forecast the length and severity of business disruptions. </p>\n<h1><b>4. Cisco</b></h1>\n<p>Cisco knows that small and medium businesses compete with bigger players based on their agility and flexibility. It also knows that, during the pandemic, SMBs can’t afford enterprise-level remote work tools. </p>\n<p>While COVID rages, the network management company is offering <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/covid19.html#~offers-and-solutions\">free access</a> to its Webex virtual work environment platform. It’s also giving small businesses free access to its top three data security technologies: Cisco Umbrella, Duo, and Anyconnect. </p>\n<h1><b>5. Facebook</b></h1>\n<p>Facebook doesn’t just sell ads or solicit status updates. Built to be used by even the most tech-illiterate business owners, Facebook’s tools make it easy to research and grow an audience. </p>\n<p>To help SMBs maintain those audiences during tough times, Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants\">Small Business Grants program</a> is distributing $100 million in cash grants and ad credits. The program, which is available to small businesses in 30 countries, is intended to help recipients meet payroll, pay rent, connect with new customers, and keep their operations intact. </p>\n<h1><b>6. Google</b></h1>\n<p>What doesn’t Google do? Perhaps the tech giant that most affects the average person’s daily life, Google also offers a variety of useful tools for SMBs. Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Hangouts can replace paid versions of similar apps with little or no loss in quality.</p>\n<p>Google is helping small businesses affected by COVID in a couple of ways. For one, it’s encouraging them to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9773423?hl=en\">update their hours</a> and get the word out via their Google Business profile. Google also offers a <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/news/resources-for-smbs-impacted-by-coronavirus/#!/\">helpful guide</a> to help affected SMBs communicate with employees, create business continuity plans, and work remotely using the tools above. </p>\n<p>It couldn’t be clearer: Tech companies are stepping up in the face of COVID. And for the small- and medium-sized businesses that depend on them, their help could be the difference between thriving and throwing in the towel.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/how-6-tech-giants-are-giving-smbs-a-hand-in-the-pandemic/\">How 6 Tech Giants Are Giving SMBs a Hand in the Pandemic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:00:29 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM-300x243.png","linkMd5":"2b9559e2b0e4c4da9e75a3f22601f470","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-07-938_7e9cf96f6f22ee04.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":243,"sourceBytes":160013,"destBytes":15824,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-12.48.21-PM-300x243.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-07-938_7e9cf96f6f22ee04.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877747},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"How Robotic Process Automation Can Revolutionize How Startups Manage Data and Empower Employees","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173451","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/03/how-robotic-process-automation-can-revolutionize-how-startups-manage-data-and-empower-employees/\" title=\"How Robotic Process Automation Can Revolutionize How Startups Manage Data and Empower Employees\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"automation manage data\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Automation has evolved to become essential in the composition of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/12/new-niches-for-startups-created-by-the-covid-19-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">startups worldwide</a>.

Image: </i><a href=\"https://tractica.omdia.com/newsroom/press-releases/robotic-process-automation-market-to-reach-5-1-billion-by-2025/\"><i>Tractica</i></a><i>)</i></p>\n<p>The future is clearly bright for RPA technology and startups looking to manage large volumes of data without committing too much time and money to the challenge. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\">significance of automation</a> is that it can accelerate the growth of small businesses in a way that wasn’t possible before. Here’s a deeper look into the revolutionary influence that RPA is having over fledgling businesses:</p>\n<h2>Intelligent Data Processing</h2>\n<p>Many startups and project managers are capable of accessing large swathes of information but don’t possess the kind of technology that helps them to make real use of it. However, RPA helps users to access varied and extensive use cases from the data they obtain. RPA is a form of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/09/customer-data-management-a-crucial-step-to-increase-your-business/\">data management</a> that can ultimately prove essential in helping businesses to strategically grow from their formative months and years.</p>\n<p>Process mining can aid companies in gaining a stronger understanding of the processes involved in the actions that RPA undertakes. When something is automated using RPA, it’s possible to break it down into component parts and the various stages involved while finding areas in which to practice more efficiently and time management.</p>\n<h4>Process Simulations</h4>\n<p>Process simulations help users to supply information into a computer before letting it complete a prospective task. This form of hypothetical automation can allow you to calculate and re-calculate how best to approach tasks and see which method brings the most efficiency for your startup without having to focus time and effort on actually undertaking it.</p>\n<p>Process simulations are an excellent way for startups and project managers to figure out the most effective way of operating and possibly even change existing setups on the fly &#8211; should it be deemed necessary.</p>\n<h2>The Next Generation of Data Management</h2>\n<p>RPA is highly useful when it comes to the storing of data, and has the potential to bring efficiency to data cleansing, normalization, data wrangling, and the creation or updating of metadata.</p>\n<p>Many startups are required to indulge in some form of data entry throughout their respective lifespans. When data entry is conducted by human hands, the repetitive tasks carry a relatively high rate of error compared to automated alternatives.</p>\n<p>By utilizing RPA to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/21/prioritizing-revenue-capture-why-sales-order-management-needs-to-be-automated/\">manage data entry</a>, it’s possible to automatically screen for errors and irregularities within datasets, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/08/security-teams-need-to-be-prepared-with-an-incident-response-plan/\">move data between different storage systems </a>and eradicate duplicated metadata among other tasks.</p>\n<p>By utilizing RPA solutions, it’s possible to make your data go further. It’s also possible to simulate tasks in a way that can help you to effectively <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/03/04/3-affordable-ab-testing-tools-for-small-businesses/\">A/B test your processes</a> to keep ahead of your early competitors.</p>\n<h2>Easy Efficiency</h2>\n<p>Using RPA is an effective way of boosting productivity within your workplace. The beauty of RPA solutions is that they require very little technical understanding from users in order to utilize them effectively. Simply speaking, the software follows the instructions of the user and automates its given tasks. This makes it relatively straightforward to replicate the repetitive tasks involved in data entry and the addition of metadata for startups to focus employee energy on other vital tasks.</p>\n<p>It’s important for startups to respect the resources available to them and use them in an efficient manner. The implementation of RPA into a startup enables business owners to reallocate staff in order to tend to more pressing matters, due to their workloads being free from repetitive tasks.</p>\n<p>Reallocations also allow staff to take more time in their work, creating more creative solutions, and applying more care to the process of undertaking more complex business tasks.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how you decide to implement RPA, your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/15/top-25-slack-alternatives-for-team-communication-and-collaboration/\">team would need to be a big part of the process</a> involved. The reason behind this is that they will already possess a fundamental understanding of said processes and will likely be skilled in finding the most efficient ways in which RPA can undertake work.</p>\n<p>Once your RPA system is in place, it’s vital that you use your new resources to their full potential. For instance, you could use the technology to provide support to a section of your startup that’s understaffed, or forecast to require more output in order to support the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/19/how-technology-plays-a-vital-role-in-small-business-growth/\">business’ growth</a>.</p>\n<p>Here, it’s vital to remember that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/ai-customer-service-will-save-you-money-but-it-might-cost-you-customers/\">automation will only provide users with efficiency</a> and cost-effective processes by allocating the technology to the right areas of your organization.</p>\n<h2>Automation to Bring Employee Empowerment</h2>\n<p>The early life of a startup can be a delicate and tentative time for business owners. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://daglar-cizmeci.com/startup-funding-7-potential-funding-options-to-explore/\">ways to access funding</a> and prepare your endeavor for its entry onto the market. However, small businesses with fewer employees face a constant challenge in ensuring that all workers remain motivated and committed to the startup.</p>\n<p>While automation can help to make employees more efficient, some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/why-do-executives-hesitate-to-automate/\">business owners may be fearful of utilizing automation</a> in the workplace due to the level of disruption it may cause.</p>\n<p>However, studies from HR Technologist have shown that 92% of organizations have seen employments in employee satisfaction levels as a result of intelligent automation and robotic process initiatives.</p>\n<p>While some employees are perceived to be fearful of automation, reports suggest that the removal of manual and time-consuming workloads aids workers in focussing on more engaging activities.</p>\n<p>Increasing the time employees spend on more rewarding and engaging <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/5-work-culture-trends-that-improve-employee-productivity-and-satisfaction/\">workloads</a> also helps them to increase their motivation for tasks. This can be a key factor in ensuring workers communicate effectively with customers and optimize their own output in a way that helps startups to establish themselves faster during those tentative early months.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensuring that your approach to automation efforts keep your employees happy in their line of work is more important than a lot of business owners may know.</strong></p>\n<p>The most effective work will often come from contented employees, and it’s important to utilize RPA in a way that gets rid of the workloads that your employees are least engaged in. In doing this, it’s possible to have a positive effect on worker attitudes and your startup’s overall performance.</p>\n<p>Employees that approach their work in a positive mindset can help to reduce the costs of staff turnover and the impact of HR tasks associated with recruitment and training.</p>\n<p>The early days of a startup are the most important in its lifespan. By failing to optimize your operations, it could cost your business valuable working hours and damage the satisfaction levels of both your employees and customers.</p>\n<p>While embracing automation may cost money to set up, it can work wonders in saving money across various other departments &#8211; especially when it comes to recruitment and manual tasks. In a competitive landscape that often treats new businesses harshly, RPA can help startups to attain a fighting chance of survival where hope may otherwise be lost.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/03/how-robotic-process-automation-can-revolutionize-how-startups-manage-data-and-empower-employees/\">How Robotic Process Automation Can Revolutionize How Startups Manage Data and Empower Employees</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 18:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees.jpg","linkMd5":"22bc4fc8644cc11a27c5781f96762de6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-972_cbbdc44609a9b7a1.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":70354,"destBytes":67490,"author":"Daglar Cizmeci","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Automation-How-Startups-Manage-Data-and-Empower-Employees-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-15-282_4ac4fab5fa6bf8b6.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tractica.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-21-984_714c9380130d7d2a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195871625},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"3 Fast-Food IoT Technologies that Could Slow COVID-19","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172483","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/18/3-fast-food-iot-technologies-that-could-slow-covid-19/\" title=\"3 Fast-Food IoT Technologies that Could Slow COVID-19\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-Fast-Food-IoT-Technologies-that-Could-Slow-COVID-19-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"iot slow covid-19\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-Fast-Food-IoT-Technologies-that-Could-Slow-COVID-19-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-Fast-Food-IoT-Technologies-that-Could-Slow-COVID-19-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-Fast-Food-IoT-Technologies-that-Could-Slow-COVID-19.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Some of the fast-food IoT <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/24/how-iot-and-big-data-applications-will-revolutionize-our-smart-cities/\">technologies</a> I’m about to dig into were already catching wind leading up to our current pandemic. Due to social distancing measures, it seems natural for any technology to thrive if it can help <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/paving-the-way-3-industries-ripe-for-post-pandemic-change/\">businesses operate</a> with less person-to-person interaction in this climate. As our favorite places cautiously reopen, the following three technologies can help keep customers and employees healthy. Here are three fast-food IoT technologies that could slow COVID-19.</p>\n<h2><strong>Ordering Kiosks</strong></h2>\n<p>Being able to place an order for food indirectly has existed since the telephone. Right now, there&#8217;s a need for added layers of separation between people in fast-food restaurants. Using a kiosk to order has never been more helpful.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is an Ordering Kiosk?<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>Ordering kiosks are large, rectangular screens that you can place an order on. The technology itself has been around since the late 1970s, thanks to people like <a href=\"https://kioskindustry.org/evolution-kiosk-software/\">Dr. Murray Lappe</a> at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Major fast-food restaurants like Subway and McDonald’s began experimenting with these screens and ordering back in 2006.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/mcdonalds-to-add-self-order-kiosks-to-1000-stores-each-quarter.html\">interview</a>, then-McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook shared with CNBC that the company would be starting ambitious plans to equip 1000 restaurants every quarter with kiosks for eight to nine quarters. The alternative way of ordering would provide better customer experience and more revenue for the company.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to summer 2019 and the investment paid off. In a Q2 earnings call last year, Easterbrook went over how the company was seeing higher average checks from customers using the order kiosks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Not Everyone is a Fan of the Ordering Kiosk, Though.</strong></h3>\n<p>Former CEO of McDonald’s USA, Ed Rensi, voiced his concerns about the growing Kiosk use about two years ago in an <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/edrensi/2018/07/11/mcdonalds-says-goodbye-cashiers-hello-kiosks/#70dfbbd26f14\">article</a> with Forbes. His main problem with them was that automating these parts of the business would eliminate valuable opportunities for teens and college students who need an entry-level <a href=\"https://www.thiscollegelife.com/finance/finding-a-job/how-to-succeed-in-your-first-service-industry-job/\">service industry job</a>. Considering the valuable lessons from my own experience as a cashier back in college, I agree with the concerns.</p>\n<h3><strong>How They Help Slow COVID-19</strong></h3>\n<p>In our current environment, things like kiosks need to be cleaned almost constantly. McDonald’s has issued reopening instructions that any restaurant using the self-order kiosks <a href=\"https://cnycentral.com/news/local/mcdonalds-prepares-to-reopen-with-new-changes-to-the-restaurant\">must have them cleaned</a> after every use. The kiosks will help employees in terms of social distancing and the employees will help the kiosks to stay clean. For the time being, then, they will work together.</p>\n<p>The IoT kiosks are just one piece of the order, though. Customers who are still wary of using them (despite cleaning protocols) do have other options. By now, most major restaurant chains offer an iPhone or an Android app plus a website for placing online orders.</p>\n<p>Smartphone apps and online ordering, in general, will come in handy for this situation, plus, they all provide a massive amount of data on customers who opt-in. Pizza Hut (a pioneer of digital ordering) even developed an Xbox app a few years ago and saw <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-10-pizza-hut-xbox-360-app-made-over-1-million-in-first-four-months.html\">over a million in sales</a> within the first four months.</p>\n<h3><strong>More Connection than Ever</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, the beginning of an order is quick, clean, and engaging for customers. Restaurants are also beginning to focus on the end of patrons’ meals, too. If the last thing they do before leaving is have disgusted feeling about something &#8212; chances are they won’t want to come back. That’s why businesses are looking at their garbage &#8212; and IoT &#8212; to further connect with customers and end meals on a cleaner note.</p>\n<h2><strong>At-The-Source Trash Compactors</strong></h2>\n<p>Different businesses, schools, and city governments have gradually been adopting at-the-source trash compacting during the last 20 years. Similar to the kiosks, major food chains like Chick-Fil-A have been adding more trash compactors at an increased pace lately. Also, like kiosks, various ideas and household versions of trash compactors and additional refuse disposal sources have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8LkzSQonUU\">been around</a> since the 1970s.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for restaurants adopting trash compactors and more trash disposal cans &#8212; is the operational efficiency and sustainability. Quick and easy trash disposal comes with added customer experience benefits that will be helpful in a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/how-smart-cities-can-help-build-a-better-post-pandemic-world/\">post-pandemic</a> environment.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is an at-the-source trash compactor?<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>An at-the-source trash compactor is essentially a garbage can that smashes trash into a cube so the employees don’t need to go back and forth to the dumpsters as often. Fewer dumpster trips, in turn, uses fewer trash bags, reducing the plastic output in the environment. Many also have the IoT technology built-in for sending a text message or an email once the machine is full. This allows restaurants to focus on other things until the exact time one needs to be emptied.</p>\n<h3><strong>How They Help Slow COVID-19</strong></h3>\n<p>While you might see handles on outdoor machines &#8212; and of course, the much-needed garbage can foot pedals. A compactor that has been showing up in restaurants like Chick-Fil-A all has automatic doors on them that use a motion sensor to open. Automatic doors on the trash bins will help, since making garbage disposal as contact-less as possible these next few months will be crucial.</p>\n<p>Studies that are currently underway by the CDC suggest that the novel coronavirus can survive for 48 to 72 hours on <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tips-for-keeping-your-home-clean-in-the-time-of-covid-19/\">common surfaces</a> like plastic or stainless steel. The fewer surfaces there are to touch, the better.</p>\n<p>Outside of the direct customer experience, being able to indirectly monitor when machines are full will aid workers in social distancing measures. Instead of needing to periodically go and check garbage, they can look at a computer or smartphone to know whether a compactor is full.</p>\n<p>Many chains have plans in place for the beginning and end of meal safety, but what about while you eat? In an April press release, the McDonald’s Vice President of U.S. Communications &#38; Government relations <a href=\"https://mcdonaldscorporation.gcs-web.com/static-files/87c67454-fcc5-458a-ba3c-21926216c1c6\">included a list</a> of precautionary measures that the fast-food giant will be taking to prioritize safety in restaurants.</p>\n<p>Two main areas will remain closed for the time being. The beverage bars and play places will stay closed (imagine the germs in those ball pits!) but not every contact-heavy area can be locked up. Since bathrooms will need to remain open, IoT-enabled devices may be able to help the efforts at keeping things clean.</p>\n<h2><strong>The IoT Bathroom</strong></h2>\n<p>By now, practically everything in a bathroom can leverage some type of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/25/how-iot-fixtures-will-power-the-bathroom-of-the-future/\">IoT fixture</a>. Things like soap dispensers and toilet paper rolls can be monitored for how much is left, toilets can self-flush, and lights can even indicate whether a stall is in use or the door just looks closed. Enormous amounts of data can also be sent to facilities management and customer experience teams.</p>\n<h3><strong>How They Can Help Slow COVID-19</strong></h3>\n<p>Currently, the main adopters of smart bathroom technologies have been airports. One of the most useful benefits of the IoT-enabled bathrooms at places like the Atlanta International Airport and the Los Angeles International Airport are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6_FPazyzDg\">lights on the ceiling</a> that indicate whether a stall is in use or not. When one is done being used, the cleaning crew could make sure it gets properly sterilized. According to the LAX <a href=\"https://www.flylax.com/travelsafely\">COVID-19 plan</a>, they are currently cleaning the restrooms once per hour. The ATL’s website mentions “increased frequency of cleaning of public areas” for their plan.</p>\n<h3><strong>Keep It Simple</strong></h3>\n<p>The light systems being installed at airports sound simple enough to fit in fast food. A battery-powered door lock wirelessly communicates with the light above to indicate whether the stall’s being used or not. The lights in the ceiling do require some basic wiring though, according to the website for Tooshlights, the company that provides them. After that, the status and data can be monitored remotely from a computer like the compactors and kiosks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tying It All Together</strong></h3>\n<p>These next few months will undoubtedly be a tough time for everyone. In efforts to keep costs low and customer experience positive, various IoT systems may be an answer. Kiosks, compactors, and the bathroom will likely continue to be areas of focus for fast food chains to keep business running smoothly.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: I was an intern one summer about five years ago for Compaction Technologies, a company that makes trash compactors.

Because consumers appreciate convenience, a <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/23/coca-cola-will-continue-with-single-use-plastic-bottles-because-thats-what-people-want/\">spokesperson explained</a>, Coca-Cola will instead increase its use of recycled materials and aid in efforts to recycle the bottles.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups were quick <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51197463\">to criticize</a> Coca-Cola for offering a false solution to the problem while putting more responsibility on consumers. They pointed out that Coca-Cola is one of the largest plastic polluters in the world.</p>\n<p>In a sense, Coca-Cola is right: Consumer demand is the reason companies continue to use plastic bottles. But it’s also true that companies have stoked that demand with marketing campaigns promoting a throwaway culture.</p>\n<p>To make a real dent in the problem of plastic pollution, all sides must take responsibility. But it’s not behemoths like Coca-Cola leading that charge; it’s <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/13/3-ways-the-iot-can-offer-innovative-solutions-to-serious-environmental-problems/\">sustainability-minded</a> startups like <a href=\"https://pelacase.com/\">Pela</a>.</p>\n<h2><b>The Plastic Problem</b></h2>\n<p>According to Pela CEO Matt Bertulli, a throwaway society persists, in large part, because consumers don&#8217;t understand the far-reaching effects of plastic waste.</p>\n<p>“There is literally no place on Earth that isn’t polluted by plastics,” Bertulli explains. “From the peaks of the Himalaya to the deepest reaches of the ocean, you’ll find pieces of plastic.”</p>\n<p>Those plastics have built up over a relatively short period. Nylon was invented in 1935, but plastics didn&#8217;t <a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics\">become commonplace</a> until the World War II era. Governments worked to preserve natural resources, propelling the increased use of long-lasting synthetic materials.</p>\n<p>Since then, the plastic industry has exploded. But disposal practices have stayed relatively static: <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/07/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment/\">Less than 10 percent</a> of the plastic produced is recycled. The rest is incinerated or winds up in landfills or oceans.</p>\n<p>That last resting place is what inspired Pela. After returning from a family vacation in Hawaii, where he saw all sorts of plastics embedded in the beautiful beaches floating in pristine waters, founder Jeremy Lang began experimenting.</p>\n<p>He and Bertulli sought biodegradable plastic alternatives that could be used in everyday products. “We knew there were solutions out there,” Lang says. “What we didn’t know back then was just how well they’d work for phone cases.”</p>\n<h2><b>Device Case Waste</b></h2>\n<p>Why start with phone cases? Because there’s a smartphone in every pocket. Consumers change smartphones every few years, and many change phone cases more often than that.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, more than <a href=\"https://pelacase.com/pages/the-biodegradable-phone-case-vs-a-billion-dollar-industry\">a billion plastic phone cases </a>are thrown away every year, along with the packaging they come in. As the pace of technological change increases, that number is sure to grow.</p>\n<p>“Technology won’t slow down,” Bertulli points out, “and consumers use phone cases not just to protect their investment, but to express their personality.” Pela’s goal, he says, is to help them do so sustainably.</p>\n<p>All of Pela’s phone cases are 100 percent compostable and made from plants. They contain <a href=\"https://impakter.com/pela-case/\">flax shive</a>, a waste byproduct from agriculture flax harvesting. It acts as a binder, making the cases stronger and more durable.</p>\n<p>It also creates screen protectors that zero-waste. Although compostable plastics might not sound shiny and new, Pela’s cases are eye-catching.</p>\n<p>But Bertulli stresses that the goal wasn’t just to create a sleek phone case: “There are dozens of phone cases out there already. We wanted to get people talking not just about the cases themselves, but about the <a href=\"https://pelacase.com/pages/otterbox-casetify-casemate-sustainability-practices\">bigger picture of sustainability</a>.”</p>\n<p>More than 520,000 people — including Android, iOS, and Windows Phone users — have made the switch. The result? More than 290,000 pounds of plastic saved.</p>\n<h2><b>A Better Cycle</b></h2>\n<p>Pela doesn’t just sell eco-friendly phone cases. To go the extra mile in its sustainability mission, Pela encourages consumers to trade in their old phone cases through its <a href=\"https://pelacase.com/pages/pela-360\">Pela 360</a> initiative.</p>\n<p>Although Pela’s cases can be composted, not all consumers have access to composting facilities. And because most phone case manufacturers don&#8217;t accept trade-ins for recycling, Pela encourages consumers to send them <i>any</i> old phone case.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t go into this planning to do other companies’ dirty work,” Bertulli notes, “but it quickly became clear that people were just throwing their old cases away.”</p>\n<p>Pela donates 5 percent of its total sales to causes that work to keep plastic waste from entering the oceans in the first place. “It’s important to us to take an all-of-the-above approach,” Bertulli says. “Recycling, upcycling, supporting environmental causes — it’s all going toward the same effort.”</p>\n<p>Without enterprises like Coca-Cola on board, startups like Pela won’t change the world. But they just might be its spark, and that’s how every great movement starts.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/how-are-sustainable-startups-like-pela-fighting-plastic-waste/\">How Are Sustainable Startups Like Pela Fighting Plastic Waste?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:00:30 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-10.59.02-AM.png","linkMd5":"e43e7611af2b11b0963d802450c0a441","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-09-690_a85b927494b87da2.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-10.59.02-AM.png","destWidth":1122,"destHeight":678,"sourceBytes":1538733,"destBytes":113988,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-10.59.02-AM-300x181.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-15-281_2823a5adcb7eab7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879915},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Top 10 Best Help Desk Software for 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=164632","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/15/top-10-best-help-desk-software-for-2020/\" title=\"Top 10 Best Help Desk Software for 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"help desk software\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Top-10-Best-Help-Desk-Software-for-2020.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Customer service has become the game-changer in companies, and most businesses are investing a lot in it.

Elon Musk is interrupting your Zoom call.</p>\n<p>Sounds fake? It is.</p>\n<p>But it looks disturbingly real.</p>\n<p>See the end of the document for embed.</p>\n<p>The video above shows an application of Avatarify, a tool developed by a researcher to transform users into celebrities in real-time during Zoom or Skype calls. Its inventor, Ali Aliev, says that the program’s purpose was to have some fun during COVID-19 lockdown &#8212; by surprising friends during video conferences as Albert Einstein, Eminem, or the Mona Lisa.</p>\n<h4><strong>The technology behind donning someone else’s animated face like a mask is called deepfaking. </strong></h4>\n<p>Deepfakes are relatively new applications of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/10/why-multicultural-marketing-needs-machine-learning-and-facial-tracking/\">machine learning tools</a>. These tools generate realistic faces by analyzing thousands of videos and images of a target’s face and extracting patterns for common expressions and movements. Then, these patterns can be projected onto anyone, effectively morphing them into someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>You use the image of  Elon Musk. Or President Obama. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtEPE859w94\">deep fake video</a> of the former President calling his successor ‘a total and complete dips**t’ went viral back in 2018.</strong></p>\n<p>The implications of this technology for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/cybersecurity-ensuring-sanity-in-smart-cities/\">cybersecurity are wide-reaching </a>and potentially disastrous.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Because instead of trolling your friends, or insulting President Trump via someone famous deepfakes &#8212; you won&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s friends being comical &#8212; or the dangerous, video phishing.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What are the Dangers of Video Phishing? </strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/07/tech/deepfake-videos-increase/index.html\">CNN</a>, the majority of deepfake videos on the internet as of the end of 2019, were pornography. In total, 15,000 of such videos were counted. That might not sound like much, considering the vastness of the internet.</p>\n<p>The reason for these rather limited numbers has been that generating convincing deepfakes takes a fair amount of computational power. Avatarify, for example, takes a high-level gaming PC to run properly.</p>\n<p>But lower-quality applications have already been developed, such as a face-swapping app that got banned again fairly quickly.</p>\n<p>It is only a question of time before deepfake technology becomes widely available. And widely used for cybercrime.</p>\n<h3>Some of these scams have already been recorded and you can find them on YouTube.</h3>\n<p>In one case, hackers used similar technology to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402\">deepfake the voices of CEOs</a> and sent voicemail messages to executives. They succeeded in effecting a transfer of a mind-boggling $243,000.</p>\n<p>In another case, three men were arrested in Israel for swindling a businessman out of <strong>$8 million</strong> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/conmen-made-8m-by-impersonating-french-minister-israeli-police\">impersonating the French foreign minister. </a></p>\n<p>Experts are already warning against other possible applications of deepfake videos for frauds to generate funds. One scenario, for example, is extortion. Hackers could threaten the release of a video containing content that can be damaging to a person’s or business’ reputation. Such content could range from straight-out pornography to the CEO of a company endorsing racist views.</p>\n<p>As experiences have shown, that could be disastrous. For businesses, even the regular kind of ‘fake news’ can have catastrophic impacts on industry relationships, and even their <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/02/26/can-fake-news-impact-the-stock-market/#3088a85a2fac\">stock market values</a>.</p>\n<p>“Those kinds of things can put a company out of business through reputation damage,” Chris Kennedy of the AI cyber-security platform AttackIQ said in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynerash/2019/12/24/how-deep-fakes-can-hurt-your-business-and-what-to-do-about-it/:\">Forbes</a>. “We’re hitting the tipping point in which technology is taking advantage of the biggest human weakness, we’re over-trusting.”</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Defend Yourself against Deepfake Video Phishing</strong></h2>\n<p>Today, having a high <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\">cybersecurity standard</a> is more important than ever. With online life proliferating during the COVID-19 crisis, scams and phishing attacks have flourished as well.</p>\n<p>The good news in the case of phishing videos is that the technology, as of 2020, is still relatively new, and the case numbers relatively low. That means that individuals and businesses have time to prepare, and disseminate information to ward against such attacks.</p>\n<h4>Know the basic defense moves</h4>\n<p>As a most <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id\">basic form of defense</a>, extreme caution is advised if you receive an unsolicited video call, especially from someone famous or in a position of authority. Never trusting caller IDs, hanging up immediately, and not sharing any information on such calls is essential.</p>\n<p>If you receive video messages that might be authentic, but you are uncertain about it, you can use software to determine if what you are facing is a deep fake. For example, companies such as <strong>Deeptrace</strong> offers software with the capacity to recognize AI-generated video content.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, some low-tech solutions to protect against video phishing are having agreed-upon code words when <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/11/ai-startups-need-data-and-the-government-needs-help/\">communicating about sensitive information</a> via video messaging, using a second communication channel to confirm information, or asking security questions that your interlocutor can only answer if they are the real deal.</p>\n<p>Basically, pretend you’re in an old James Bond film. ‘In London, April&#8217;s a Spring month’ and all that.</p>\n<h5><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></h5>\n<p>Using AI to morph into someone else and extract sensitive information may still sound futuristic. But it is only a question of time until video phishing hits the mainstream.</p>\n<p>As technology advances and artificial intelligence and machine learning applications to copy the face and voice of people become widely available, the number of deepfake scams is set to go through the roof.</p>\n<p><strong>The best you can do, is to be aware, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/21/12-things-to-know-about-cybersecurity-now/\">keep informed</a>, and brace yourself.

Some of the biggest changes, however, are happening in the quietest areas of the market.</p>\n<p>One of those is medical imaging. Although it may not be as glamorous as autonomous vehicles, AI-driven imaging is doing something even more important: saving lives. Companies like <a href=\"https://curemetrix.com/\">CureMetrix</a> are turning image analysis from a guessing game into a data-driven process.</p>\n<p>The typical radiology patient doesn’t see doctors using CureMetrix’s technology. All they know is that their treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis.</p>\n<p>What’s going on behind the scenes, and what’s next for the medical imaging industry? To find out, we sat down with CureMetrix CEO Navid Alipour. It turns out the answer is every bit as exciting as those self-driving cars. And no, the robots aren’t taking over any time soon.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Revolution in Medical Imaging</strong></h2>\n<p>To grasp just how much <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/15/decoding-the-future-trajectory-of-healthcare-with-ai/\">AI is changing the world of medical imaging</a>, it’s important to understand what the low-tech process looks like.</p>\n<p>“Not that long ago, medical imaging was a lot like ‘Where’s Waldo?’” Alipour explains. “Basically, experts would scan images and then search for tiny irregularities that could signal things like cancerous lesions.”</p>\n<p>Despite all the training doctors and radiologists go through, they make mistakes. Studies suggest error rates of human-only analysis may be <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272263016_Radiologic_errors_past_present_and_future\">around 35 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>Think about that: Without the help of AI, a third of patients who undergo radiology are steered in the wrong direction. And for different reasons, errors in either direction are dangerous.</p>\n<p>If something is missed — a false negative — the patient doesn’t receive treatment, and the cancer continues to grow. Many conditions that require imaging are time-sensitive. Every day that a cancerous tumor goes unnoticed, it grows larger and the risk of metastasis increases.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a false positive — meaning the radiologist mistakes a benign feature for a medical issue — can expose patients to invasive procedures unnecessarily. Biopsies, for example, are painful and costly. On average, 70-80 percent of them come back negative in the search for breast cancer while placing emotional stress on the patient, as well as her family.</p>\n<p>How does CureMetrix minimize errors, and more importantly, what does that mean for patients?</p>\n<h2><strong>A Second Pair of Eyes</strong></h2>\n<p>Think of CureMetrix’s <a href=\"https://curemetrix.com/cm-triage/\">cmTriage</a> like a second set of eyes. The AI can’t supplant the person using the tool — the radiologist — but it can help him or her know which cases may be suspicious.</p>\n<p>Although AI won’t replace radiologists, those using AI will replace the ones who are not. Already, radiologists and mammography experts are in short supply, resulting in overwork, burnout, and costly errors — which can ultimately lead to lawsuits. CureMetrix empowers radiologists with data, serving as another arrow in their quiver in the fight against cancer.</p>\n<p>Cleared by the FDA as a triage tool for breast cancer screening, cmTriage provides a pre-read for the radiologist, helping to identify suspicious cases. The result is the potential for greater sensitivity, as well as fewer patient recalls.</p>\n<p>When it comes to detecting breast cancer, the average sensitivity of a radiologist is 84.4 percent, with 9.6 percent of cases requiring a second look. At 84.4 percent sensitivity, CureMetrix would have indicated that a total of 6.4 percent of the exams are suspicious. Even in default mode, the AI operates at higher specificity than radiologists.</p>\n<p>Even more powerful is the fact that cmTriage can operate at higher sensitivities. Its default setting is 93 percent, but it can be set as high as 99 percent.</p>\n<p>By combining deep learning and computer vision, cmTriage helps radiologists identify suspicious changes, enabling those with breast cancer to get treatment sooner. Just as importantly, it helps radiologists identify cases that are less suspicious or potentially normal, decreasing the chance that patients will be subjected to multiple visits or risky treatments.</p>\n<h2><strong>Beginning with Breast Cancer</strong></h2>\n<p>Currently, CureMetrix is available only for breast cancer detection. But why breast cancer, and what other conditions might it help with?</p>\n<p>When I asked Alipour, he pointed to two things: scale and the unique challenges of breast cancer — the most complex of all cancers to detect.</p>\n<p>Close to 300,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with breast cancer, comprising almost 30 percent of all cancer diagnoses in women. Secondly, an estimated <a href=\"https://curemetrix.com/wp-content/uploads/CureMetrixPoster.pdf\">$4 billion</a> is spent annually on mammography false positives. Biopsies, often the second step in detection, exhibit a stunning 75 percent false-positive rate.</p>\n<p>“We just couldn’t ignore numbers like that,” Alipour says. “There are a lot of different cancers out there, but few are as costly — in human or in monetary terms — as breast cancer.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for other cancer patients, mammography is only the start of AI’s medical imaging makeover. CureMetrix plans to expand its AI into other areas of medical imaging.</p>\n<h2><strong>A One-Size-Fits-All Detection Tool?</strong></h2>\n<p>Imaging is a critical tool in cancer detection, but it’s not the only one. Other methods, like methylation analysis, can also be augmented by deep learning tools.</p>\n<p>“One advantage of deep learning,” Alipour notes, “is that it can deal with unstructured data. If fed the right training data, such an algorithm could spot cancer in other ways, like looking at chemical signatures.”</p>\n<p>As an example, Alipour mentions <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00847-2\">a recent case</a> at New York University Langone Health. A young girl was diagnosed based on tissue pathology with recurrent medulloblastoma, one type of brain cancer.

Amid the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, that’s truer than ever. And the shipping and logistics industry </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/27/can-ai-save-the-supply-chain-from-its-own-destruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible for granting that access</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, a consumer can order a product from a warehouse thousands of miles away, and it will arrive at his doorstep in a matter of days. That’s all thanks to the warehouse workers, pilots, ship crews, delivery drivers, postal workers, and others who put in the work to deliver each package in good condition (and in record time).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also thanks to some critical advances in technology. New entrants in the shipping and logistics field are offering </span><a href=\"https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/core/documents/pdf/glo-core-trend-report-artificial-intelligence.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">applications of artificial intelligence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Internet of Things, and the cloud to help streamline the industry from the local level to the global market.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some leaders in the industry may be wary of adopting something new, such as a tracking app or AI software. If a series of spreadsheets gets the job done, why take the risk of buying a new program or product? It might be hard for a full team to adopt, or it could suddenly stop working for 12 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is twofold: Any tech offering worth its salt will include &#8217;round-the-clock support for implementation and maintenance. Worse, companies that don’t join the tech revolution will quickly find their competitors have left them in the dust.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Tech Tools in Action</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, technology played a crucial role in transforming shipping and logistics. These three types of tech are adding value across the industry:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>1. The Internet of Things</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if, instead of requiring micromanagement every step of the way, parts of the supply chain could monitor themselves? That’s what’s possible with the Internet of Things.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IoT-connected devices use sensors and programs to complete tasks, track progress, and alert supervisors if they need maintenance. They aren’t intended to fully replace human workers. They&#8217;re intended to augment and streamline the tasks in the supply chain best suited to automation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an example of the IoT in action, one needs look no further than Amazon. In 2012, the company </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/13/is-it-time-to-implement-iot-in-the-warehouse/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bought Kiva Systems</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a startup focused on robotics. Since, Amazon has added more than 30,000 automated picking robots to its distribution centers alongside employees. Other types of IoT-enabled automated vehicles, like pallet jacks, are streamlining warehouse operations.</span></p>\n<h3><b>2. Collaboration Software</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether a company operates on land, by air, by sea, or all three, a solid connection across the entire supply chain is critical. In the past, shipping and logistics businesses relied on simple </span><a href=\"https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/how-will-technology-shape-the-shipping-industry-in-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">paper-based systems</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made agility difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But thanks to the wider availability and reliability of internet-based programs, it’s much easier for companies to add digital platforms to keep everyone on the same page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaboration software Coolfire, for example, </span><a href=\"https://info.coolfiresolutions.com/hubfs/Sales%20+%20Marketing%20Assets/Use%20Cases/Coolfire-Last-Mile-Collaborative-Logistics.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enables situational awareness</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout a company’s supply chain by aggregating data from existing systems. It also gathers information from vehicles, IoT-connected devices, sensors, and worker input — whether on the field or in the offices. When a company can view all its data in one picture, it can take proactive measures to ensure smooth operations, rather than reactive ones.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>3. Artificial Intelligence</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shipping and logistics industry has always used data to drive decisions and operations, but the </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-penske/2018/09/04/how-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-are-revolutionizing-logistics-supply-chain-and-transportation/#b88d8158f5dc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application of artificial intelligence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has made it easier for decision makers to analyze that data, identify patterns and insights, and take action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI allows for </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/15/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-global-logistics-and-supply-chain-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stronger predictions and forecasts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using powerful data analysis. It facilitates faster planning and scheduling by factoring in constraints so humans don’t have to. It can even analyze things like traffic and driving patterns to help leaders make decisions that improve public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One company that’s effectively applying AI is TNX Logistics, which uses software to </span><a href=\"https://transmetrics.eu/blog/best-artificial-intelligence-logistics-startups/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">analyze a shipper’s available trucking loads</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and identify the most effective tendering strategy for those loads. Applying AI in this way helps companies reduce costs and increase efficiency throughout their supply chains.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to shipping and logistics, delivering a product to its final destination intact and on time will always be the primary goal. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each organization might have a different strategy in place to get from point A to point B, there’s no question that advances in technology will continue to streamline the process.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savvy businesses in shipping and logistics would do well to adopt these technologies if they want to remain competitive.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/07/how-the-tech-revolution-is-reshaping-shipping-and-logistics/\">How the Tech Revolution Is Reshaping Shipping and Logistics</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:06 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-4.04.23-PM.png","linkMd5":"8c9daa9833977676113a526908fb6f89","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-187_35e4c5b286da2285.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-4.04.23-PM.png","destWidth":889,"destHeight":589,"sourceBytes":1178375,"destBytes":108098,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-4.04.23-PM-300x199.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-11-799_57a59550c702e547.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877751},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Can Artificial Intelligence Replace the Role of Doctors?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166813","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/23/can-artificial-intelligence-replace-the-role-of-doctors/\" title=\"Can Artificial Intelligence Replace the Role of Doctors?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"AI replace doctor\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has increased rapidly. Not only does it play a role in the field of entertainment and communication, but the future traces of AI in the area of health and life begin to be seen. In some countries, AI is integrated into sophisticated analytical tools to help doctors in hospitals diagnose cancer and other diseases. But can artificial intelligence replace the role of doctors?</p>\n<h2>Can AI make a significant contribution and push development in the health sector?</h2>\n<p>Through the application, AI automatically helps patients diagnose disease complaints online before visiting the doctor. How you do it The AI algorithm has the function of understanding the disease pattern and deciphering the device data and then reporting the health problems to the patients and private doctors.</p>\n<p>It is expected that in the next five to seven years, the proliferation of new AI technology companies will become an essential element to help medical professionals save lives. AI may be present in the operating room, providing clinical laboratory services to detect sources of disease with a &#8220;force&#8221; that had never existed before.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the potential of AI in the sector of health worldwide?</strong></h2>\n<p>Global Market Insights research shows that AI market revenues in the US are expected. UU. In the field of medical care exceeding the US $ 4 billion in 2024, this figure has increased by 38% since 2016 to around $ 320 million.</p>\n<p>Research also shows that in the same period, the revenues of the AI market in Europe are projected to reach around $ 3.8 billion. The company&#8217;s global AI market revenue will also exceed $ 10 billion in 2024.</p>\n<h3>The use of AI-controlled robots does not completely replace the role of medical personnel.</h3>\n<p>AI-controlled robots can increase the role of doctors, surgeons, or nurses. In a Forbes report, Brian Kalis, managing director of digital health and innovation at Accenture, said AI would be widely used in US hospitals. Over the next five years. &#8220;AI reduces the complications and errors that can occur during surgery and makes the hospital stay shorter,&#8221; Kalis said.</p>\n<p>His company also estimates that the use of such robots will generate $ 40 billion annually for the US healthcare industry in 2026. &#8220;This will contribute a lot to the projected value,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, McKinsey&#8217;s research mentioned that integrating <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/improving-responses-to-medical-device-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">medical AI devices</a> into the patient care workflow would increase nurse productivity by 30% and 50%.</p>\n<h3>China&#8217;s health sector, including those that are quickly becoming fashionable and wish to adopt AI.</h3>\n<p>A recent Forrester investigation said that up to 20% of significant health industry organizations in China intend to adopt intelligent nursing technology, and 17% will adopt medical robots in the next three years.</p>\n<p>AI technology also contributes to the diagnosis and early detection of the disease. Artificial intelligence can help reveal details of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scanning machines. Researchers at the University of Lehigh in the state of Pennsylvania, USA.</p>\n<p>For example, recently developed AI-based disease detection techniques. These innovations offer greater accuracy and detection efficiency and can be used at a relatively low cost in developing countries with the highest risk of disease.</p>\n<h2><strong>Increased concerns about AI.<br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-166811 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry-300x147.png\" alt=\"Use of AI in Health Care Industry\" width=\"816\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry-300x147.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry-900x440.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry-260x127.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry.png 986w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px\" /></p>\n<p>The ability of AI to support various aspects of the health sector becomes a major leap that can produce prevention strategies and treatment approaches that are much more efficient and effective, including reducing the cost of medical care. Even so, some doctors believe that although AI can do a variety of things, AI cannot assume the role of human interaction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Health and medical care are too human for AI to be treated,&#8221; said Rasu Shrestha, head of the innovation section of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and head of the radiology and computer science division.</p>\n<p>According to him, radiology became a specialization that AI would be interrupted for the first time if it was really applied. Will the medical school stop training radiologists later? &#8220;AI algorithms may be diagnostic experts, but AI cannot replace the role of doctors in decision making.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another concern arises because most doctors do not realize that the use of AI used in clinics has an impact beyond research.</p>\n<h3>The health system needs to find ways to protect patient privacy and protect themselves from liability. What happens if AI is wrong?</h3>\n<p>In addition to the negative support or feeling, in reality, the application of technology in the health sector has not been able to completely replace the role of medical personnel. Hopefully, the development of AI in the health sector can help more people deal with various health problems.</p>\n<h2><strong>Utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Health Sector</strong></h2>\n<p>In the current era, the role of technology is very important. Technology plays a role and aims to make human work easier and more efficient.<br />\nEven in the health sector, technology plays an important role in minimizing errors caused by human negligence.</p>\n<p>For example, if technology does not play a role in surgical operations performed by doctors, the operation can be dangerous and prone to failure.<br />\nArtificial Intelligence can be interpreted as technology or machine that has intelligence like humans or, in other words, AI is a simulation of artificial intelligence on machines that are programmed to think like humans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/16/why-5g-technology-will-be-a-game-changer-for-healthcare/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artificial intelligence technology</a> that we often hear in smartphone camera technology to improve the results of our selfies. But, did we know that this technology is made and also used in many fields? From the fields of economics, education, defense/military, health, etc.</p>\n<h3>In the field of health, AI itself is used in many ways, which is undoubtedly minimizing the occurrence of errors and making things more efficient.</h3>\n<h4>1) Robotic surgery</h4>\n<p>Robots that have been equipped with artificial intelligence technology can analyze someone&#8217;s messy record data before performing the operation. The robot will guide and direct the surgeon during the operation process.</p>\n<p>The use of this robot can also produce new surgical techniques through data from previous operations to accelerate and simplify the operation process.</p>\n<h4>2) Virtual nurse</h4>\n<p>This virtual nurse has been developed by several companies and new companies. An example is Molly, developed by Sense. This virtual nurse serves to help nurses monitor and track the patient&#8217;s condition.</p>\n<h4>3) Creation of new drugs.</h4>\n<p>To develop a medication, you must go through clinical trials that sometimes take a long time and cost a lot. However, an AI-compatible program will make this process faster. AI is used to scan existing medications that can be redesigned to fight disease.<br />\nThe use of the AI program has only found two medications that can reduce Ebola infectivity in just one day.</p>\n<h4>4) Predict early cancer and Back Pain</h4>\n<p>The use of AI to predict cancer patients is to obtain information in a person&#8217;s DNA. AI will perform a body scan to detect cancers and diseases that someone may face based on their genetics.</p>\n<p>AI programmed computer use to deduct lower back pain or Sciatica pain issues and also suggest advice to the patient like usage of <a href=\"https://backpainchairslab.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best office chair for back pain</a>, take a massage, exercises and Yoga tips.</p>\n<h4>5) Health monitoring</h4>\n<p>Health monitoring with AI technology can be seen in the technology applied to Smartwatch, where this smartwatch can monitor the heart rate and activity level of the user. A smartwatch can record user habits information that can be a source of data for doctors if the user is sick.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/23/can-artificial-intelligence-replace-the-role-of-doctors/\">Can Artificial Intelligence Replace the Role of Doctors?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:00:18 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1.png","linkMd5":"621b63eeff7adeebaf484b3d35408986","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-09-659_de80820ea00bace7.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":602775,"destBytes":42084,"author":"Julia Smith","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Replace-the-Role-of-Doctors-1-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-11-706_e2f8cdc7f825a20d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Use-of-AI-in-Health-Care-Industry-300x147.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-09-570_153496c31f42b9e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880425},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"5 Healthcare Tech Trends Worth Keeping an Eye On","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170060","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/5-healthcare-tech-trends-worth-keeping-an-eye-on/\" title=\"5 Healthcare Tech Trends Worth Keeping an Eye On\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"5 Healthcare Tech Trends Worth Keeping an Eye On\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The healthcare industry is experiencing rapid shifts. Some of this is due to the current pandemic, but much of this evolution was happening even before the COVID-19 outbreak. Understanding and embracing the introduction of new technology into the market will be important for healthcare professionals and patients alike.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the trends worth keeping tabs on:</p>\n<h3>1. Telemedicine</h3>\n<p>If you want to talk about major evolution and change within the U.S. healthcare system, look no further than <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/29/3-ways-video-technology-can-improve-patient-safety-in-healthcare/\">telemedicine</a> (also known as telehealth).</p>\n<p>In a country as large and spread out as the U.S., telemedicine – or the practice of doctors meeting virtually with patients – is highly attractive and mutually beneficial. This is especially true from a cost perspective. Telemedicine lowers the cost of care for both patients and doctors by eliminating many of the physical barriers that take time and deplete resources. It’s also a much more efficient way of meeting – eliminating the commuting aspect and preventing wasted time in waiting rooms and lobbies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/telemedicine-market\">According to one recent report</a>, the global telemedicine market is expected to expand from its current size of $45 billion to $175.5 billion by as soon as 2026. That represents a robust compound annual growth rate of 19.3 percent. The growth drivers will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rising cases of COVID-19 and anticipation of similar future events</li>\n<li>Increased prevalence of chronic diseases in an aging population</li>\n<li>Growing number of smartphone users and internet-connected households</li>\n<li>Major technological advances in relation to mobile phones and internet (like 5G)</li>\n<li>Serious need for cost-savings in an expensive healthcare environment</li>\n<li>Long waiting times in hospitals for disease treatment</li>\n<li>Advantageous government initiatives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also some challenges and risk factors moving forward. In the United States, the biggest concern has to do with cyber security and privacy – particularly when it comes to sensitive patient data (which is carefully regulated under HIPAA rules).</p>\n<p>Regulatory issues and compliance requirements – both on a macro scale (government) and a micro scale (healthcare industry) – will create issues moving forward. But once the red tape is dealt with, growth and adoption will skyrocket.</p>\n<h3>2. The Internet of Medical Things</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Life-Sciences-Health-Care/gx-lshc-medtech-iomt-brochure.pdf\">According to Deloitte</a>, medical technology companies manufacture more than 500,000 different types of medical devices. This includes wearable external medical devices (like insulin pumps and skin patches), implanted devices (such as pacemakers), and stationary medical devices (like scanning machines). And almost every interaction a patient has with a healthcare provider or system involves the use of one of these devices or pieces of equipment.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the healthcare industry is becoming increasingly connected (in a digital sense). Cloud computing, big data, wireless technology, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are all working together to transmit, store, and interpret data.</p>\n<p>What happens when you combine telemedicine with the internet of things (IoT)? Well, you get the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/can-artificial-intelligence-humanize-patient-care/\">Internet of Medical Things</a> (IoMT), of course!</p>\n<p>“The IoMT brings together the digital and physical worlds to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatments, and monitor and modify patient behaviour and health status in real time,” Deloitte explains. “It also improves health care organizations’ operational productivity and effectiveness by streamlining clinical processes, information and work flows.”</p>\n<p>The IoMT market was valued at roughly $41.2 billion in 2017 and is expected to balloon to $158.1 billion by 2022. (The connected medical devices portion of the market – which is responsible for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating patients – will account for $52.2 billion of the market.)</p>\n<p>Most healthcare organizations in the United States are already using IoMT technology in some capacity. The growth will occur from increased use and greater reliance on these devices and platforms over the next 24 to 30 months.</p>\n<h3>3. Low-Level Light Therapy</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve addressed a couple of the major sweeping trends in the industry, let’s explore some of the smaller healthcare tech trends that are occurring within specific niches and industries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kiierr.com/how-it-works/\">Low-level light therapy (LLLT)</a> is the first micro trend we want to discuss. It’s one of the most promising developments in the premature hair loss space (which impacts tens of millions of men <em>and</em> women on an annual basis).</p>\n<p>LLLT, which is backed by years of research and several authoritative scientific studies, can be administered in a number of ways. One of the most common and convenient methods is through the use of a laser hair cap (which looks a lot like a standard baseball cap).</p>\n<p>LLLT caps work by improving cellular respiration and stimulating hair follicle growth through the use of safe low-level lasers that are known to produce thicker and healthier hair. Until recently, the technology could only be administered in a physician’s office. But with advances in safety and the practicality of new laser caps, people are now able to perform regular sessions (usually 30 minutes) from the comfort of their own homes.</p>\n<p>Considering that <a href=\"https://www.americanhairloss.org/men_hair_loss/introduction.html\">two-thirds of American men</a> will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 35 (and 85 percent by age 50), health-tech like LLLT is extremely important and relevant.</p>\n<h3>4. Wearable Health Devices</h3>\n<p>There’s a massive surge in the number of patients who want to be able to monitor their own health on a day-to-day basis. This swelling rise is coupled with an increased familiarity and willingness to use mobile devices and technology that track information and data. The result is rampant demand for wearable health devices, which health-tech companies are using as a license to innovate and manufacture new lines of products.</p>\n<p>The wearable health market has grown significantly over the last couple of years and is a welcome trend for patients, doctors, insurers, and everyone else in between. Common devices include wearable fitness trackers, smart health watches, wearable blood pressure monitors, wearable ECG monitors, and even biosensors.</p>\n<p>This latter product category is especially interesting. It includes things like the self-adhesive trackers – such as the Philips wearable biosensor.</p>\n<p>“Research from Augusta University Medical Center showed that this wearable device registered an 89% reduction in patient deterioration into preventable cardiac or respiratory arrest,” <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wearable-technology-healthcare-medical-devices\">BusinessInsider mentions</a>. “This demonstrates the ability wearables have to improve patient outcomes and possibly reduce staff workload.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/biosensors.asp\">According to one industry forecast</a>, the biosensor market is expected to grow from $21.2 billion in 2019 to $31.5 billion by 2024. That amounts to a compound annual growth rate of 8.3 percent.</p>\n<h3>5. Augmented Reality</h3>\n<p>Currently valued around $850 million, the global market for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in the healthcare space is expected to scale up to somewhere north of <a href=\"https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2019/09/how-augmented-reality-improving-patient-care\">$5.1 billion by as early as 2025</a>.</p>\n<p>While AR can be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/03/19/augmented-reality-technology-nuts-bolts/\">used in any number of ways</a>, one of the primary healthcare applications will occur in operating rooms and doctor training/education.</p>\n<p>Depth perception is something that’s very challenging in certain procedures, yet paramount to achieving successful outcomes. When blood vessels and nerves are in close proximity to one another, being able to have precise and accurate assessment of depth becomes critical. New technology is addressing this.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mbrc.umd.edu\">Maryland Blended Reality Center</a> is one of the leaders behind this charge. They’re currently in the development stages of an AR application that overlays computer images over the doctor’s view of the real world to help guide catheters into patients’ brains to relieve pressure after injuries. With the use of this technology, doctors can perform procedures like this within 0.5 millimeters of accuracy.</p>\n<p>As the underlying technology improves, healthcare experts anticipate seeing even more revolutionary technology emerge. The next two or three years will be incredibly important for innovation in this sector of the health-tech market.</p>\n<h3>A Brave New Medical World</h3>\n<p>The innovation that’s happening in and around the healthcare industry is both unprecedented and astonishing. While this is an industry that’s always been characterized by innovation, the speed of iteration is blistering. As a healthcare professional, techpreneur, or trendsetter, these are exciting times.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned in – as always, don’t be afraid to pivot, shift, or evolve along with the technology.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/5-healthcare-tech-trends-worth-keeping-an-eye-on/\">5 Healthcare Tech Trends Worth Keeping an Eye On</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 10:23:49 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends.jpg","linkMd5":"4c62d662c59903f0b1c641a9231be3df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-23-969_465c8c5c6b43bc76.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":54344,"destBytes":23420,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Healthcare-Tech-Trends-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-15-723_6b7324298fb1c02e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878266},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","title":"7 Tools That Support Remote Team Collaboration and Communication","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175637","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/08/7-tools-that-support-remote-team-collaboration-and-communication/\" title=\"7 Tools That Support Remote Team Collaboration and Communication\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"7 Tools That Support Remote Team Collaboration and Communication\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Collaborating with a remote team is challenging, but the right tools and strategies can streamline the communication process.</p>\n<p>The two main challenges facing remote teams are major time zone differences and lack of in-person collaboration. Online collaboration is effective, but time zone differences make it hard to connect in real-time.</p>\n<p>For instance, when a team member in India needs to connect with a team member in the United States, there’s a time difference of nearly 12 hours (give or take, depending on specific time zones). For these two team members to connect, one will need to get up extra early and the other will need to stay up late.</p>\n<p>The other big challenge with large differences in time zones is that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/how-to-ensure-high-productivity-of-your-remote-workers/\">productivity</a> will always lag behind by 12 to 24 hours. This lag time makes it difficult to meet strict client deadlines and can put projects behind schedule.</p>\n<p>If your organization has a remote team, whether your employees are spread out across the states or the world, the following tools will help you maintain efficient <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2009/04/15/the-online-collaboration-tools-guide/\">online collaboration and communication</a> to ensure you deliver on time.</p>\n<h3>1. A company intranet</h3>\n<p>A company intranet is like a private internet for your entire team that can only be accessed by your team members. It can be implemented locally in the office with your own set of servers and networking equipment, or it can be hosted in the cloud.</p>\n<p>With an intranet hosted in the cloud, your team can access it from anywhere and you avoid maintenance and upgrade fees. If your team is 100% remote and you don’t have an office, your intranet will need to be hosted in the cloud.</p>\n<p>According to Happeo, <a href=\"https://www.happeo.com/guide-for-managing-remote-teams-happeo\">cloud collaboration makes remote teams successful</a> through tools like video conferencing applications, intranets, and document repositories. A company intranet can provide easy access to all of a team’s collaboration tools.</p>\n<h3>Intranet security</h3>\n<p>The privacy and security of an intranet is unparalleled even by the most highly secured software application you can install on your company website. For instance, installing proprietary collaboration software on a subdomain on your company’s website isn’t as secure as you think. Even when your team members use secure login credentials, your web server could get hacked on the back-end, compromising your sensitive data.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a hosted intranet is separate from your company website. With a reputable service provider, the servers used to host your company intranet are locked down with the tightest security. When you intranet isn’t hosted on your website’s domain name, hackers won’t know where to look for it.</p>\n<h3>2. A navigable, online self-help portal</h3>\n<p>An online self-help portal will make your employees self-sufficient and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/3-ways-you-can-empower-your-remote-employees/\">empower your team</a> to find answers on their own. Usually, a self-help portal is hosted on a company intranet.</p>\n<h3>What information does a self-help portal contain?</h3>\n<p>A self-help portal can contain an infinite amount of knowledge regarding company policies and procedures, and even links to files. Essentially, any kind of information your employees might need, including answers to questions customers might ask, should be housed in a self-help portal.</p>\n<p>Employees can use a self-help portal to immediately look up answers to questions posed by clients, customers, and other team members. This accessibility reduces the amount of time it would take to contact a manager or supervisor to find the answer.</p>\n<p>A self-help portal can be created by using FAQ software or by hiring a development company to create a proprietary application just for your team. Either way, it works just like a website with a main menu, links for navigation, and a search function.</p>\n<p>The key to using an online self-help portal is to make it user-friendly and continually update and add to the information as processes change and your company evolves.</p>\n<h3>3. A well-designed training program</h3>\n<p>Every remote team is supported by a well-designed training program. How you onboard your remote employees matters, and how they’re trained will set the tone for how they’ll perform.</p>\n<p>Well-trained team members communicate and collaborate more efficiently than team members who work according to their own standards. It’s important to create a training program that can be implemented consistently by any and all of your trainers.</p>\n<p>With remote teams, it’s especially important to train your team over an extended period of time rather than give them a manual to read and call it a day. Training manuals serve a purpose, but they shouldn’t take the place of actual training.</p>\n<p>How you train your remote team depends on your industry. For instance, if you’re a marketing firm, your training program should include <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/how-to-tactfully-communicate-tough-feedback-to-remote-workers/\">providing constructive feedback</a> after each client interaction, after work is submitted, and throughout the entire process for at least one full project. This will give your team the feedback they need to align with company standards every step of the way.</p>\n<h3>4. A unified task management platform</h3>\n<p>Nothing disrupts remote teams like having tasks managed in multiple applications. This can be a tricky situation to get a grip on because all of your remote employees will probably have preferences for the software they like to use for managing tasks. To maintain good collaboration, you’ll need to require all team members to use the same application.</p>\n<p>You might have a task management application that you prefer, but stay open to using other platforms recommended by your team. They might know about a platform that is superior to what you’ve always used.</p>\n<h3>5. Communications training</h3>\n<p>Ongoing communications training is one of the best ways to keep a remote team on track and should be an irreplaceable part of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/29/how-to-prepare-for-a-future-of-remote-teams/\">your company’s communication strategy</a>. Everyone talks about great communication, but few can demonstrate what that looks like. For instance, communication is more than sharing information with another team member. Communication skills involve knowing how and when to deliver a message along with being able to have a productive dialogue with others, especially when there’s a disagreement.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, organizations have sent employees to weekend communications training programs, but today it’s easy to take those same courses online. Find an organization that specializes in teaching communication for team collaboration and start requiring your remote employees to complete the courses of your choice.</p>\n<h3>6. Top-of-the-line computers</h3>\n<p>It’s difficult to work in the tech industry on older computers running deprecated browser versions because the machine can’t handle an operating system upgrade. Sure, you can find laptops on eBay for a couple hundred bucks, but you’re not doing your company any favors that way.</p>\n<p>If your remote employees depend on current technology to get the job done, buy them the right equipment. You don’t need to spend $5,000 per person on new MacBook Pros, but you do need to consider a person’s work before buying them a machine.</p>\n<h3>7. World clock applications</h3>\n<p>The simplicity of a world clock application can’t be underestimated. Your remote team needs to know what time it is around the world where other team members and clients are located. This will help keep them on track to deliver tasks on time. For example, if someone from India sets a deadline for Tuesday, a team member in the U.S. can submit the task on Tuesday and yet it’s already Wednesday in India.</p>\n<p>World clocks with a little forethought will help team members across different time zones set and meet deadlines smoothly.</p>\n<h3>Remote collaboration can be exceptionally efficient</h3>\n<p>Despite team members living in different parts of the world, remote collaboration can be exceptionally efficient &#8211; even more efficient than an in-house team.</p>\n<p>The problem in-house teams face most is wasted time. It’s a drag having to get ready for work, commute to the office, and then sit at a desk all day. Remote teams are surprisingly more efficient because the freedom helps team members tailor their work to a schedule that works best for their lifestyle. Without the commute, they have more time and energy to devote to getting the job done.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/08/7-tools-that-support-remote-team-collaboration-and-communication/\">7 Tools That Support Remote Team Collaboration and Communication</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 13:14:31 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration.jpg","linkMd5":"6cca2e25cb4b8a425a82237f9ee05705","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-192_450372f0b1fae9ed.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":67465,"destBytes":34020,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tools-to-support-remote-team-collaboration-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-28-217_f21be61b7bc28891.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195870806},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"This Real Estate Brokerage is Changing Its Industry.

But as with other global crises throughout human history, coronavirus has also become a catalyst for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/good-news-coronavirus-is-causing-an-innovation-renaissance\">incredible innovation.</a> The innovations range from the simple (like a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reuters/status/1248191423288971265\">hook</a> for no-touch door opening,) to the high tech (like AI facial scans to quickly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-tap-ai-to-help-manage-coronavirus-outbreak-11584696601\">detect fevers</a> in hospital patients.)</p>\n<p>But innovation shines brightest when an <em>entire industry</em> has been disrupted. For example, the supermarket and <a href=\"https://www.foodlogistics.com/transportation/press-release/21125307/online-grocery-shopping-surges-to-record-levels-in-us-during-covid19-crisis\">grocery store</a> industry is turning to online sales and delivery apps. The <a href=\"https://www.industryweek.com/talent/media-gallery/21126580/manufacturing-stepping-up-to-help-during-covid19\">manufacturing</a> industry is refocusing its priorities and creating products to assist the coronavirus battle. And the shift from working at an office to working from home (WFH) is throwing the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/7/21209605/solow-paradox-coronavirus-technology\">tech</a> industry into a new spotlight.</p>\n<p>As many industries around the world are boldly adapting right before our eyes, another industry has been advancing behind the scenes. I’m talking about the <em>real-estate brokerage </em>industry, and China is leading the innovation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Introducing the Concept of New Living</strong></h3>\n<p>The last industry you’d expect to thrive during the current pandemic is Housing and Real Estate. But the Chinese startup called <a href=\"https://bj.ke.com/\">Beike</a>, a new generation real estate broker marketplace, is changing how real-estate brokerage is done.</p>\n<p>The concept of New Living is the phenomenon of completing the entire home-buying process online – from “virtual touring” of the property, to signing all necessary documentation. No one needs to meet in person. Not the property owner, the buyer, or the real estate agent.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lesson – </em></strong><em>Can you think of new ways to meaningfully connect different parties (i.e., your offline network,) while eliminating the need for them to meet in-person?</em></p>\n<h2><strong>The Entire Operation Process Completed Online</strong></h2>\n<p>Here’s Beike’s process for innovating the industry shift into New Living:</p>\n<p><strong>Virtual Property Tours:</strong> Beike uses <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-04-27/coronavirus-vr-virtual-reality-games-art-theater\">VR technology</a> to capture any of their properties in 3D and let home buyers tour the property using their smartphone. In fact, Beike has currently made a staggering 4 million homes available to tour via VR.</p>\n<p>How does a VR tour work? A potential homebuyer can virtually tour a property at any time, and the property’s broker can also be linked into the VR tour for real-time interaction with the buyer. This VR experience is almost like being at the real-life location, but without traveling to the property or breaking a quarantine order.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lesson – </em></strong><em>In what ways are you effectively leveraging available technology like AI, VR or AR to provide value and disrupt your industry?<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sign House Renting Contracts Online: </strong>Tenants can use an app to sign rental contracts online. The contract’s terms are simplified and clearly understandable. These online contracts have the same legal force as a traditional paper contract, and the tenant’s legal rights are protected as always.</p>\n<p><strong>Sign Resold House Transactions Online: </strong>An online closed loop of resold house contract signing eliminates the need for all three parties to sign physical copies several times. Each party signs once and a significant amount of time is saved.</p>\n<p><strong>Sign Loan Contracts Online: </strong>The traditional face-to-face model of signing loan contracts is digitized. This includes the interview, information collection and filling, printing photocopies and material signing.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund Custody (or Third-Party Custody): </strong>Fund custody is the client’s house-purchase fund, which is deposited in a third-party fund. When the transaction is complete, the fund will be unfrozen to the owner’s account. If the transaction fails, the fund will be returned to the client. This process avoids risks such as selling a house to more than one buyer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Vast Real Estate Database Live</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Vast Real Estate Database:</strong> Beike was designed on the real-estate brokerage platform Lianjia. This is beneficial because throughout Lianjia’s many years of operation, the platform established a Real Estate Data Standard (REDS) of more than 219 million homes in over 330 cities. There are about 2.7 million housing resources currently in sale, and 13 thousand housing resources are added every day. All this data has established the foundation for Beike’s marketplace.</p>\n<p>Now that the Real Estate Data Standard is upgraded to the Real Estate Data Standard <em>Live,</em> China’s biggest real estate database is activated as a <em>dynamic</em> database.  Beike can now conduct real-time monitoring on how many housing resources are being searched, consulted, and visited by VR and offline as well. Real Estate Data Standard Live will also enable users to see the last transaction on a property, the last visit, how many times it has been visited, and whether or not it’s for sale.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lesson – </em></strong><em>In what ways are you leveraging big data to provide valuable insights to clients? If you can turn data into trustworthy information that’s easy to use and understand, you’ll gain a competitive edge.</em></p>\n<h2><strong>The Business Model That’s Making It All Possible</strong></h2>\n<p>No study of an industry disrupter would be complete without looking at its business model. Beike’s is complex yet innovative.</p>\n<p>With this matching functionality, the right home choices start to become clear to overwhelmed home buyers. Brokers are also provided with the right leads who are excellent matches for their properties. For such a platform to work effectively, trust must be created – trust in the information, and trust in the other parties using the platform. Beike has earned this trust.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lesson – </em></strong><em>Even if you have the right tech in place for your business or platform, have you built trust with your users? Trust takes time to build. Don’t rush, and don’t be discouraged.</em></p>\n<p><strong>An Open Platform: </strong>The platform consists of brokers, homeowners and buyers. Such an open ecosystem creates diversity and superior service.</p>\n<p><strong>Win-Win Cooperation: </strong>In a large network that connects every agent together, the agents are sure to find houses that fit the needs of all their customers. With all agents cooperating together and operating in a commission-sharing mechanism, a win-win situation is created.</p>\n<p><strong>A Final Lesson</strong></p>\n<p>One final lesson can be gleaned from Beike’s story of industry innovation. Don’t hold to the old belief that the best innovation is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/25/1000563/covid-19-has-killed-the-myth-of-silicon-valley-innovation/\">coming from Silicon Valley,</a> or even from the US. In many ways, Silicon Valley is dropping the ball of innovation.

Historically, however, the real estate industry has been among the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-real-estate-and-proptech-part-2-of-2/\">lowest</a> spenders by sector on technology. Despite being slow to adopt new technologies, real estate contributes <a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-are-the-biggest-industries-in-the-united-states.html\">13%</a> of US GDP, making it the country’s largest industry.</p>\n<p>Such a large sector represents a huge market ripe for technological disruption, especially in the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/05/real-estate-tech-that-will-endure-in-a-post-covid-world/\">post-Covid-19 world</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>How automation can improve the real estate process </strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/the-challenges-and-opportunities-for-automation-in-the-real-estate-industry/\">Automated real estate</a> transactions will soon be the norm. By digitizing documents and paper trails, technology improves information security for both consumers and agents. Processing payments digitally also increase transaction security and speed.</p>\n<p>Many automated tools help reduce busywork for agents, freeing up their time to focus on tasks that require a personal touch, like building client relationships.</p>\n<p>Automation can also help agents maintain consistent timelines and messaging. The expanded capacity to collect and analyze data allows agents to create informed strategies and concrete measures of success.</p>\n<p>As a whole, automation saves agents time and generates more opportunities by scaling their efforts. This, in turn, creates more opportunities and increases revenue.</p>\n<h3><strong>Over the last few years, the real estate industry has begun to prioritize technology.</strong></h3>\n<p>With the addition of technology &#8211;large real estate corporations have hired CIOs and created technology budgets, and most agents recognize the importance of tech for remaining competitive. The consumer research experience has already been transformed, and 44% (nar.realtor) of buyers now begin searching for homes online.</p>\n<p>The rest of the buying and selling process, however, can also be improved through technology that automates previously manual procedures.</p>\n<h3><strong>Marketing</strong></h3>\n<p>The automated marketing tools market was valued at $3.3 billion in 2019 and is expected to nearly double by 2024. While agents can use much of the automated marketing technology that already exists, there is also a demand for marketing technology specifically adapted to real estate needs.</p>\n<p>These real estate-focused tools help agents expand their reach and gain insight into their client base. For example, some real estate-focused tools generate targeted video and ad campaigns based on agency listings. Other marketing tools help agents create and manage social media campaigns across different platforms, automatically scheduling and publishing social media posts. Some even suggest existing relevant real estate content that agents can repost on their channels or use as inspiration.</p>\n<p>Data analytic tools also help agents track content views and types of engagement. Based on that data, the software compares content performance, helping agents determine what marketing tactics are working best.</p>\n<h3><strong>Lead Generation</strong></h3>\n<p>Automation tools can also help agents generate more high-quality leads. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/21/prodigious-customer-service-live-chat-vs-chatbots/\">Chatbots,</a> for example, allow agents to engage with potential clients through their website at any time of day. The chatbots provide information that moves the lead down the pipeline, so they are better informed when they speak with the agent.</p>\n<p>CRMs designed for agents sync with real estate search platforms and agency social media profiles to gather leads across channels. Then, activity tracking tools monitor and sync potential client activity.</p>\n<p>Using this information, agents can adjust their outreach strategy for those potential clients. For some, an automated follow-up sequence triggered by specific activities can be activated. Meanwhile, other higher-quality leads might require more personal attention.</p>\n<p>Lead scoring tools help agents <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/a-startup-guide-to-creating-an-ideal-customer-profile/\">determine which leads they should prioritize </a>for personalized outreach. In tracking lead activity and source, these tools also show where the best quality leads are coming from, which helps inform marketing strategy.</p>\n<p>For agencies with multiple agents, lead routing software can automatically assign leads to agents based on geographic location. By streamlining and improving the lead generation process, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/06/where-will-ai-take-the-real-estate-market-in-10-years/\">these technologies</a> increase lead opportunities and reduce the time it takes to turn a lead into a customer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Agents&#8217; everyday workflows </strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to expanding the lead pipeline, automation can help agents manage their everyday workflow. Agents are constantly juggling many clients at <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/11/how-do-you-create-an-effective-journey-map-for-your-customers/\">different points in their customer journey</a>, and automatically generated task lists can help agents track and sync their activities for each client by stage. Tasks can be assigned deadlines with automatic reminders to keep agents on schedule.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://calendar.com\">Calendar automation simplifies scheduling</a> with clients, allowing agents to set windows for types of appointments and block off times for inspections and showings. Thanks to calendar updates in real-time, clients can find an available time that works with their schedule, avoiding the back and forth that manual scheduling entails.</p>\n<p>For agencies with multiple agents, automation tools sync any updated information or documents, keeping everyone on the same page, and increasing transparency. Agent activity can also be tracked and evaluated to determine performance across the team.</p>\n<h3><strong>Transaction process </strong></h3>\n<p>The transaction process to close deals with clients can also benefit from automation technology. For most agents, this process is currently complex, slow, and mostly analog. For the real estate sector alone, technology for managing the transaction process has been valued as a potentially <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliakarayaneva/2019/12/02/automation-in-real-estate-became-a-100-billion-opportunity-who-will-be-disrupted/#5b60388a1eb3\">$100 billion</a> opportunity. As a result, fintech solutions are on the rise, with the adoption of fintech <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/04/02/three-factors-driving-the-rise-of-fintech-and-what-the-banking-industry-can-learn-from-them/#3ea360f96d76\">quadrupling</a> from 2015 to 2019.</p>\n<h4>The transaction process involves many steps, each with the potential for improvement through automation. E-signature and e-notarization technology would speed up the signing procedures and increase process transparency. Digitized paperwork facilitates smart contracts, giving all the involved parties access to the most updated version of the agreement and prevents tampering.</h4>\n<h4><strong>Digital money transfers also offer a more secure option for agents and clients. </strong></h4>\n<p>After a money transfer is made, blockchain technology could automate the digital paperwork update for a faster and smoother ownership transfer. Using technology,<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/getting-high-returns-on-real-estate-investment/\"> agents can improve the customer experience</a> by providing an easier, quicker transaction process, which results both in satisfied customers and efficient agents.</p>\n<h2><strong>A turning point for the real estate industry</strong></h2>\n<p>Due to Covid-19, many agents have turned to new technology to continue working. This period will likely be a turning point, marking the start of large-scale adoption of real estate technology throughout the sector. With the market potential, and numerous opportunities to improve security, efficiency, and consistency, proptech will be an industry to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pixabay</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/10/the-untapped-opportunities-in-real-estate-automation/\">The Untapped Opportunities in Real Estate Automation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:53:13 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Untapped-Opportunities-in-Real-Estate-Automation.jpg","linkMd5":"b2ffa9ea99dcfa959aa430d74f1c65de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-27-090_c55f272b5a237461.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Untapped-Opportunities-in-Real-Estate-Automation.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":18955,"destBytes":10532,"author":"Adrian Fisher","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Untapped-Opportunities-in-Real-Estate-Automation-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn51@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-15-152_02d41325ad4f0bec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874075},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"26 Top Virtual Keynote Speakers","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169088","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/29/top-virtual-keynote-speakers/\" title=\"26 Top Virtual Keynote Speakers\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers-300x214.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Top Virtual Keynote Speakers\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers-300x214.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers-900x643.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers-224x160.jpg 224w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virtual-Keynote-Speakers.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>With the world on lockdown due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, conferences and workshops are being cancelled or postponed until further notice.

If your event focuses on industry trends, you will need to find speakers adept at that industry and understanding the forces that influences it.</p>\n<p>From there, determine what type of speaker personas can enhance the event. Do you want someone that is edgy, funny, or deeply personal? Think about your potential audience and the type of speakers they would enjoy. With this in mind, it&#8217;s also important to align the presentation style used by these prospective virtual speakers. The style should consider length, visual aids, and format.</p>\n<p>Also, know your budget first. Having a fee range in mind prior to your virtual speaker search can optimize the time spent for both you and the speakers you approach.</p>\n<h3>Other Considerations</h3>\n<p>After deciding on what you want, the next step is to conduct research and assess each of your virtual speaker prospects. Some considerations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will the virtual deliver targeted and unique content for my audience? You don&#8217;t want to go with a virtual speaker that just recycles their same presentation for each event. Your audience may have already seen them give that presentation and not see any value in what you offer them.</li>\n<li>Is the virtual speaker flexible and easy to work with? Look for a virtual speaker that is responsive, thorough, helpful, and friendly. If they look at working with you on your virtual event as a partnership, then you will want to bring them on. This positive interaction can go a long way toward a fun and successful event for everyone involved.</li>\n<li>Can they add extra value to your event through additional content? While taking the virtual stage is already delivering good value, you can raise the bar to exceptional value if your virtual speaker has books or other content where they can share more content for the audience to &#8220;take home.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Due Diligence</h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>While it may not be difficult to find your ideal virtual speakers because you can conduct online research or get referrals from your network, the challenging part may be how you approach and win over the targeted speaking prospects for your virtual conference. Here&#8217;s a strategy to approach this part of the process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get started on your virtual speaker hunt early. Even though conferences have moved online and are just ramping up, your virtual speaker may already be booked weeks or months in advance. Plan your search accordingly, based on your virtual conference dates. This will reduce the stress of getting your ideal virtual speakers on the agenda.</li>\n<li>Take the time to watch videos of your speaker prospects in action at past events. Even if you can&#8217;t do it live now that it&#8217;s not possible, sites like YouTube as well as the speaker bureau or speaker&#8217;s own website have recordings. It&#8217;s also possible to request a speaker reel directly from the speaker or their bureau. The real offers short presentation clips.</li>\n<li>Check speaker references and speak to those who have incorporated targeted speakers in past events. In doing so, you will learn more about what they are like. From there, you can shorten your list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Approaching Your Ideal Virtual Speakers</h3>\n<p>Once you have done these things, you should approach your ideal virtual speakers with clear information about your conference, what it involves and the role they would play. Be flexible because your ideal speakers may also want to share feedback on the panel topics or keynote focus. Their experience in doing past conferences can become a valuable resource for shaping the success of your event.</p>\n<p>Get everything in writing, including your expectations and that of each speaker. Having a formal agreement helps everyone feel comfortable and confident about working together. Once its on paper that each virtual speaker plans to be part of your event, get their feedback on how to include them in the pre- and post-marketing effort for your virtual event.</p>\n<p>Now that you have your virtual speakers in place, it&#8217;s time to plan and oversee a successful online event.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>How to Create a Successful Online Event</h2>\n<p>Having the right speaker or speaker lineup is just one of the many factors that go into hosting a successful online event or virtual industry conference. Here are some other critical components:</p>\n<h3>Focus on Video</h3>\n<p>A virtual conference needs video of the speakers and/or panel to engage your online audience. No one wants to just look at a screen share of a PowerPoint presentation. Instead, seeing the speaker&#8217;s body language and facial expressions personalizes the experience and adds to their message.</p>\n<p>Since webinar platforms support videoconferencing, having video should be fairly easy to showcase for your virtual event. Have your speakers practice using video conferencing tools prior to the event, especially if they are new to this technology.</p>\n<h3><b>Decide on Audio</b></h3>\n<p>Like video, the audio you use for your virtual conference can make or break your event. Your conference is live, so the audio must be flawless because there is no time to tweak it or address poor sound quality. Your audience doesn&#8217;t want to wait and watch you struggle with the speaker’s microphone, the audio platform, or the network you are using to transmit your event.</p>\n<p>Test out various audio options during the event preparation process. Look for services that deliver audio quality, including those recommended by other event hosts.</p>\n<h3><strong>Plan Unique Content and a Compelling Agenda</strong></h3>\n<p>Take the time to develop the content and agenda with your speakers. Their input and your understanding of the target audience can create a world-class virtual conference. If it goes well in terms of delivering a unique experience, then you will be more likely to attract a larger audience and parlay that into future events.</p>\n<h3><b>Focus on Interactive Features</b></h3>\n<p>To keep your audience engaged and enhance what the virtual speaker talent offers, look for ways to add interactive features to your online event. For example, have a Q&#38;A session where viewers can send in questions. You can also consider adding a poll during a specific session to get audience input on the speaker&#8217;s topic.</p>\n<h3>Conduct Virtual Session Run-throughs</h3>\n<p>Just like you would have done when hosting an in-person conference, your virtual conference should have a few run-throughs so that speakers can go over their presentations and panels can agree on how they will run their session.</p>\n<p>Also, this is the opportune time to test and re-test all audio and video equipment. Your audio/video quality, Internet connection, equipment, screen sharing, host-to-speaker private messaging, and interactive features must be flawless.</p>\n<h3><b>Have a Contingency Plan For Tech Issues</b></h3>\n<p>No matter how often you check and re-check, there are bound to be technical issues. Make sure your audio-visual technicians are ready to take on any tech issue that could possibly impact your virtual conference.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things to go wrong with an online conference is network connectivity. You need to be prepared for bandwidth and how many people may sign on to view your online conference. While you want the most people possible, you also don&#8217;t want the platform you are using to crash.</p>\n<p>Make sure your tech talent has contingency plans in place to address the loss of connectivity, audio or video glitches, or lost speaker presentation files. The larger your risk assessment and planning process, the more likely you are to minimize any technical issues from impacting your audience&#8217;s overall experience.</p>\n<h3><b>Implement a Marketing and Publicity Plan</b></h3>\n<p>You want to attract the most people to your online conference as possible, so that means creating a marketing and publicity strategy just for your virtual event. Explore your options for the channels and content that can reach your intended audience. For example, use sites like LinkedIn, YouTube, and Facebook to create events. You can also create an email blast and website landing page. Or, if possible, designate and develop an entire online event website with links for registration. Another option is to Develop and feature a blog post about the event.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t deliver all the news about your online event at once. Provide teasers that reveal some news leading up to the event, such as revealing a featured virtual speaker each week prior to the event date. This provides an opportunity to continue contacting your audience and reminding them about the event. The approach can also help generate more buzz around your virtual conference.</p>\n<h3>Decide on Takeaways and Post-Event Marketing Tactics</h3>\n<p>During and after your online event, you have more opportunities. While you can&#8217;t recreate the “experience” associated with in-person events like networking opportunities and dinners, you can do other things to enhance the experience and add value.  Ideas include an event summary download, a digital coupon for a virtual speaker&#8217;s book, or a discount for products and services featured at the online event.</p>\n<p>Find ways to get more marketing ROI through post-event tactics. For example, you could feature video excerpts on various social media channels or panel and keynote summaries. You can use these to generate online discussions and blog posts that repackage and expand on the ideas presented throughout your virtual conference or workshop.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to conduct a survey among online attendees to find out what they liked and what could have been better. Ask them what they would like to see from future virtual conferences so you can start planning for those.</p>\n<h2>Virtual Speakers and Planning Create Memorable Virtual Events</h2>\n<p>The world of virtual conferences is just getting started. Despite turning the conference and events industries into a tailspin, technology and innovative planning, combined with forward-thinking speaker talent, have the opportunity to shape and grow an entirely new channel for virtual conferences, trade shows, training courses, and workshops.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

This process, which is continually improved by data scientists and companies that heavily invest in big data, has allowed for dramatic changes to numerous industries. The benefits of using big <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/11/the-business-benefits-of-visualizing-your-data/\">data include improved processes</a>, data-driven business decisions, and better resource allocation. Here is the increasing need for hyperlocal data collection.</p>\n<h3><strong>While conversation often surrounds how to use big data, the use of hyperlocal data has also gained attention.</strong></h3>\n<p>Hyperlocal data refers to a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/18/how-to-use-quizzes-to-get-more-leads-for-your-business/\">more niche version</a> of local data. A zip code, for example, is an example of local data, but a street address is hyperlocal data. It’s more specific and tends to surround a very particular, defined geographic area. This <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/04/intelligent-virtualization-technologies-are-eliminating-data-silos-forever/\">data</a> is more difficult to collect, but its uses in business are growing.</p>\n<h2>Hyperlocal data benefits businesses</h2>\n<p>There are more obvious uses for hyperlocal data for businesses that rely on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/08/30/connected-devices-revolutionizing-mobile-field-services/\">Google Maps or location-based services</a>. A food delivery company, for example, would benefit from having more addresses and exact locations of restaurants in a particular area because they can then offer customers more unique choices, gaining an edge over their competition.</p>\n<p>Google Maps itself also benefits from this data because the company can offer more accurate, up-to-date information to users, including directions and nearby locations.</p>\n<p>Both marketers and advertisers use hyperlocal data to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/18/gabb-wireless-a-smartphone-for-kids-to-keep-them-safe-and-minimize-screen-time/\">hone in on local customers</a>. Near-me searches have risen in popularity, and marketers are capitalizing on these searches to get customers into local stores and restaurants.</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing on a potential customer that may come to the area later, these campaigns focus on customers that are already in the vicinity. Of course, marketers must also focus on strong Google My Business listings and SEO to beat out the competition fighting for the top spots on search engines.</p>\n<p>Hyperlocal data has a place in a traditional business or <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/11/20/smart-cities-need-banks-data-power-governments-cl4/\">finance setting as well</a>. A company applying for a loan may overstate its value. Hyperlocal data can capture accurate information such as credit cards accepted, hours of operation, number of employees, etc. All of this information is necessary for financial institutions that want an accurate portrayal of a business. However, there are far more uses for hyperlocal data than just this.</p>\n<h2>Hyperlocal data and Covid-19</h2>\n<p>With the world battling a pandemic, many have turned to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/how-smart-cities-can-help-build-a-better-post-pandemic-world/\">hyperlocal data to track</a> the spread of Covid-19. By mapping out global cases, experts have been attempting to take a worldwide view of how the virus has spread and its impact on businesses.</p>\n<p>More importantly, they want to look at areas that have begun to flatten the curve so that other affected areas can mimic their efforts. Of course, none of this is possible without hyperlocal data that tracks infected populations. This data will play a key role in both curbing the spread and creating lessons to draw from in the future.</p>\n<h2>Hyperlocal and IoT use cases</h2>\n<p>What is particularly interesting is how hyperlocal data can benefit the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/how-iot-reshapes-industry-4-0-and-the-effects-of-iot-on-smes/\">Internet of Things</a>. With improved mobile technology, people are constantly creating data. Now, more than ever, people are sharing this data for the benefit of others. Take traffic reports, for example. There are apps where users can report accidents, and delays, which helps others traveling in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>The report is given to a GPS application, which can then <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/best-business-intelligence-software-and-business-operating-system-options-for-2020/\">reroute drivers to avoid sitting in long delays</a>. It’s even expected that self-reporting will soon become unnecessary as AI will become sophisticated enough to collect hyperlocal data without user input.</p>\n<p>Connected cars have grown in popularity and will soon play a substantial role in hyperlocal data collection and distribution. Equipped with smart sensors, this type of car could report weather information to a cloud service, which could then alert others in the area.</p>\n<p>If there is a severe storm or ice on the road, other travelers would know about it, assuming they are in connected vehicles themselves. Hyperlocal data can power IoT simply by offering larger amounts of accurate data.</p>\n<h2>Hyperlocal data moving forward</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/how-to-ensure-data-privacy-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/\">challenge of data collection</a>, particularly in emerging markets, is one hindrance to this movement. While data is readily available in developed cities, data in underdeveloped locations is not as easily accessible. This data, however, is growing in its value as more global companies seek to enter these markets.</p>\n<p>There are solutions to this problem of gathering data in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/02/24/facebook-plans-internet-takeover-zuckerberg/\">underdeveloped markets</a>, and big brands are starting to vie for this data as it directly impacts expansion plans.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Anna Shvets; Pexels<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/the-increasing-need-for-hyperlocal-data-collection/\">The Increasing Need for Hyperlocal Data Collection</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 18:00:50 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Increasing-Need-for-Hyperlocal-Data-Collection.jpg","linkMd5":"80af6648b6edcbc26094c0da9edbb1ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-19-131_2d6f515521a49d33.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Increasing-Need-for-Hyperlocal-Data-Collection.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":853,"sourceBytes":296493,"destBytes":162704,"author":"Geoffrey Michener","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Increasing-Need-for-Hyperlocal-Data-Collection-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-28-512_5ee279ccf063a5a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875738},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","title":"Examples of Failure in Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175301","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/31/failure-in-artificial-intelligence/\" title=\"Examples of Failure in Artificial Intelligence\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><div id=\"contentsContainer\">\n<div id=\"contents\">\n<p id=\"E177\"><span id=\"E178\">Artificial intelligence is groundbreaking and, at times, still quite mind blowing. We’re constantly peppered with amazing stories of efficiency, automation, and intelligent prognostication. But </span><span id=\"E179\">AI isn’t</span><span id=\"E180\"> perfect. And for every story of success, there’s another tale of a mess up or mistake &#8211; a situation where something didn’t go as planned.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E183\"><span id=\"E184\">While I’m a huge </span><a id=\"E185\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/top-10-greatest-ai-trends-in-business-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"E186\">believer in AI</span></a><span id=\"E187\"> and have seen the power of it in my own businesses, sometimes it’s nice to see the other side of the coin, have a couple of laughs, and remember that we’re all just pushing for bigger and better things. But along that path, there will be friction and interruptions. It’s how we respond to these anomalies and shortcomings that ultimately defines where we go from here.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"E190\"><strong><span id=\"E191\">6 Examples of AI Failures</span></strong></h2>\n<p id=\"E194\"><span id=\"E195\">We don’t want AI to be perfect. At least not yet. The fact that AI can still experience failures and lead to unintended consequences is somewhat refreshing (when you’re a couple of steps removed from the failure). But even for those close to the fire, these mistakes serve as lessons in growth and improvement. And the more failure there is today, the </span><a id=\"E196\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/growth-opportunities-available-during-and-after-pandemic-times/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"E197\">more growth and improvement will occur</span></a><span id=\"E198\"> &#8211; ultimately leading the way to a more perfect and complete industry.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E201\"><span id=\"E202\">Okay, enough with the preamble. Let’s deliver the goods. Here are some of the top examples of AI failure over the past few years:</span></p>\n<p id=\"E205\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E206\">Microsoft AI Chatbot Learns Some Unbecoming Language</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E209\"><span id=\"E210\">AI chatbots have sort of become the norm on social media and other websites. Facebook has a really good one built into Messenger and it’s leveraged as a powerful business tool for providing customer service and jumpstarting conversations with prospects. But AI chatbots aren’t perfect, as exemplified by Microsoft’s AI chatbot, which briefly went by the name of “Tay.”</span></p>\n<p id=\"E213\"><span id=\"E214\">Released in March 2016 and deployed for Twitter users, Tay was programmed to have casual, natural conversations in the language of typical millennials. But it only lasted 24 hours. What happened? Well, a group of trolls on the site targeted its vulnerabilities and manipulated Tay into making very sexist and racist statements.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E217\"><span id=\"E218\">Peter Lee, the VP for AI and research at Microsoft, had to issue a public apology for not foreseeing this possibility ahead of time. </span></p>\n<p id=\"E221\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E222\">Athlete or Felon?</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"contentsContainer\">\n<div id=\"contents\">\n<p id=\"E225\"><span id=\"E226\">Amazon has a project they call Rekognition. It’s an AI-based facial recognition software that’s marketed to police agencies for use in investigations. It’s essentially supposed to cross analyze images and direct law enforcement officers to possible suspects. The problem is that it’s not very accurate.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E229\"><span id=\"E230\">In a study by the Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU, dozens of Boston-area athletes’ pictures were run through the system. At least 27 of these athletes &#8211; or roughly one-in-six &#8211; were falsely matched with mugshots. This included three-time Super Bowl champion Duron Harmon of the New England Patriots.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E233\"><span id=\"E234\">Can you say, not a good look?</span></p>\n<p id=\"E237\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E238\">Users Find Flaws in Apple’s Face ID</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E241\"><span id=\"E242\">Apple is always coming up with cutting edge technology. They’ve set the standards in the smartphone and mobile device industry for years. For the most part, they get things right. But sometimes they can be a bit too brash in their marketing. In other words, they like to flex their muscles. As you might expect, this invites haters, trolls, and skeptics to challenge their claims.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E245\"><span id=\"E246\">One recent example occurred with the release of the iPhone X. Leading up to the launch, Apple had invested a lot of time and marketing dollars into their front-facing facial recognition system that replaced the fingerprint reader as the primary method of accessing the phone. The claim was that the AI component was so smart readers could wear glasses, makeup, etc. without compromising functionality. And that’s essentially true. The problem is that Apple also clearly stated the Face ID technology can’t be spoofed by masks or other techniques.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E249\"><span id=\"E250\">One Vietnam-based security firm </span><a id=\"E251\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-say-broke-face-id-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"E252\">took this as a challenge</span></a><span id=\"E253\">. And with just $200, they made a mask out of stone powder, glued on some printed 2D “eyes,” and unlocked a phone. This is just a reminder that bold claims can sometimes come back to bite!</span></p>\n<p id=\"E256\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E257\">Robot Dog Meets Fatal Ending</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E260\"><span id=\"E261\">Who doesn’t love the idea of a robot puppy? You get a cute little machine without the barking, walking, pooping, eating, or expensive vet bills. But if you’re looking for a life partner, you might not want this robodog.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E264\"><span id=\"E265\">In 2019, a Boston Robotics’ </span><span id=\"E266\">robodog</span><span id=\"E267\"> named Spot met a dramatic and untimely onstage death while he was being demoed by the company CEO at a conference in Las Vegas. Tasked with walking, he slowly started to stumble and eventually collapsed to the floor as the audience uncomfortably gasped and chuckled. </span></p>\n<p id=\"E270\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E271\">Watson Is Not a Doctor</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"contentsContainer\">\n<div id=\"contents\">\n<p id=\"E274\"><span id=\"E275\">IBM’s Waston is a pretty amazing piece of technology. This smart supercomputer has many accomplishments under his belt, including defeating some of the world’s smartest people in a game of televised Jeopardy. But as much as Watson knows, he’s not to be trusted as a doctor &#8211; yet.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E278\"><span id=\"E279\">In 2018, IBM Watson attempted to launch a medical AI system to make suggestions for treating cancer patients. IBM’s objective was nothing less than to “eradicate cancer.” But it didn’t take long for hospitals and oncologists to see major flaws. At one point, Watson suggested putting a patient with excessive bleeding on a medication that would cause even more bleeding &#8211; possibly killing the patient in the process!</span></p>\n<p id=\"E282\"><span id=\"E283\">IBM has blamed its engineers, stating they programmed Watson with hypotheticals and fictional cases, rather than relying on actual patient data and historical medical charts. Either way, it’s not a good look for Watson. Perhaps he’ll stick to gameshows. </span></p>\n<p id=\"E286\" class=\"qowt-li-1_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E287\">Voice-Spoofing AI Software Cons CEO</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E290\"><span id=\"E291\">Deepfakes</span><span id=\"E292\"> are becoming a serious (and alarming) problem. Hackers have found ways to fake voices, pictures, and even video. And in certain cases, the effects are disastrous.</span></p>\n<p id=\"E295\"><span id=\"E296\">In March 2019, the CEO of a UK-based company got a phone call from his boss over at the German parent company. He was instructed to transfer the equivalent of $243,000 to a Hungarian supplier. The request was marked as urgent and the CEO was told to carry it out right away. The only problem with the request was that it wasn’t his boss on the other end of the line. It was an AI-based software made to mimic the boss’s voice. </span></p>\n<p id=\"E299\"><span id=\"E300\">While we’re calling this an AI failure, the reality is that the AI software won. It was the humans who got played to the tune of a quarter of a million dollars!</span></p>\n<p id=\"E303\"><strong><span id=\"E304\">AI: Challenges and Opportunities</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E307\"><span id=\"E308\">As we can clearly see, AI isn’t without its issues. As it pertains to business, AI implementation still faces several challenges. They include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"E311\" class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><strong><span id=\"E312\">Limited processing power. </span></strong><span id=\"E313\">While AI and ML have great potential, they utilize a ton of processing power. Most computing simply isn’t that advanced. As a result, it’s difficult to fully utilize these technologies outside of very specific environments.</span></li>\n<li id=\"E316\" class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><span id=\"E317\"><strong>Limited knowledge</strong>. </span><span id=\"E318\">Only a handful of people truly understand AI well enough to explain it to the marketplace. This has kept adoption rates from being where they should be and is slowing down growth.</span></li>\n<li id=\"E319\" class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><span id=\"E320\"><strong>Lack of trust</strong>. </span><span id=\"E321\">There will always be a degree of mistrust between people and computers. And while relations have improved over the past few years, failures like the ones </span>outlined in this article don’t help much.</li>\n<li class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><strong>Data security</strong>. <span id=\"E326\">In order for AI applications to work, these systems need access to millions of data points. This creates possible weak spots and vulnerabilities for hackers to target and compromise.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these challenges, the beauty of AI lies in its <a id=\"E331\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/important-when-an-app-is-a-literal-lifesaver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"E332\">intelligence and brilliance</span></a><span id=\"E333\">. Not only are many of the world’s greatest minds dedicating their lives to improving and refining technology, but when you couple it with machine learning (ML), you get a self-fueling cycle of growth where every problem and mistakes ultimately paves the way for greater efficiency, accuracy, and opportunity. Speaking of opportunities, here are some of the top ones I see moving forward:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><strong>Makes big data easy</strong>. <span id=\"E338\">One of the issues businesses have with big data is finding ways to make sense of it. With so much information to sort through, discovering how to interpret and apply findings is difficult. AI can streamline this and lead to better, more efficient processes.</span></li>\n<li class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><strong>Superior analysis</strong>. <span id=\"E343\">Certain AI systems can be used to monitor, detect, and analyze changes in various settings. Businesses can use it to keep an eye on competitors and understand things like price changes, PR activities, social engagement, etc.</span></li>\n<li class=\"qowt-li-3_0 qowt-list\"><strong>Smarter searches</strong>. <span id=\"E348\">The internet makes the world go around. In particular, search engines shape trends and control the flow of information. Search engine companies like Google are </span><a id=\"E349\" href=\"https://dev.co/ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span id=\"E350\">using AI and ML</span></a><span id=\"E351\"> to transform the industry and deliver more accurate and timely results to customer searches.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"contentsContainer\">\n<div id=\"contents\">\n<p id=\"E354\"><strong><span id=\"E355\">Looking Ahead</span></strong></p>\n<p id=\"E358\"><span id=\"E359\">Is AI perfect? As the tales in this article show, that would be a resounding no! But is it powerful and ever-improving? Yes on both. So as we look ahead to the next one, three, and five years, let’s remember that AI is a work in progress. And to get where we want to be, we have to deal with a bit of friction along the way. It comes with the territory.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/31/failure-in-artificial-intelligence/\">Examples of Failure in Artificial Intelligence</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 04:04:38 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure.jpg","linkMd5":"c2fab234d7f259b03622bd26fbefb96d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-09-730_dd9ad09d7e9100ed.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":131662,"destBytes":90034,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai-failure-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-13-782_14a23342ca3e3a20.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195869759},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","title":"The Top Work Operating Systems of 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167910","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\" title=\"The Top Work Operating Systems of 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"work operating systems\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>You’ve heard of computer operating systems (OS) before. They’re the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/19/software-pre-launch-checklist-6-things-you-have-to-do/\">software</a> that supports a computer’s most basic functions. Think of an OS as the command hub for your computer, the central node that allows you to run all other programs and applications. Without it, you’d have to use long lines of code to get anything done. Even if you can’t explain what an operating system does, you’ve probably used one to run Windows, MacOS, or Android platforms.</p>\n<p>In an exciting shift, work operating systems are carving out a significant niche across all teams focused on operating productively and efficiently. Just like a computer OS, a work OS is a centralized platform for your team’s efforts. It’s where projects are planned, processes are tracked, and tasks are assigned and managed. Those key functions may sound simple, but they yield incredibly valuable benefits.</p>\n<p>A work OS puts the whole team on the same page, increasing clarity, transparency, and accountability. It streamlines work and cuts down on duplicated efforts and wasted labor. It provides valuable data on organizational productivity, making workflow optimization easier. And thanks to advances in AI and machine learning algorithms, many of these time-saving tweaks can be automated.</p>\n<p>As more organizations adopt a work OS, they’re becoming global, with hundreds of thousands of users on each. Looking to supercharge your company’s productivity or manage projects more effectively? Read on.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/s/task-software?s=261&#38;c=60&#38;m=3000&#38;utm_source=capterra&#38;utm_medium=cpc&#38;utm_campaign=task+management&#38;csrc=capterra\">Smartsheet</a></strong></h3>\n<p>From Cisco to Netflix, Smartsheet counts more than 3 million users of its task management software across 83,000 brands and 190 countries.</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to appreciate the appeal of Smartsheet.

At a meeting or in a conversation with a boss or client, we get a project going. Maybe we jot down a note or two and move on. Going into the project, we have to check old emails and the staff wiki to recall a standard procedure or two. Then there’s the breakdown and delegation of tasks. When the project’s complete, we take a few minutes to document and analyze our efficiency.</p>\n<p>Notion puts all these functions — notes and docs, knowledge bases, task management, and spreadsheet documentation — in one place. By simplifying how we work, Notion makes it much easier to manage everything we have on our plates in one place. That’s making workspaces much less confusing and distracting.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Asana provides one of the longest-standing and most popular work OS programs on the market. Available via a number of subscriptions, it offers different capabilities to cater to the needs of various industries operating on all scales.</p>\n<p>The company built its reputation on no-nonsense structuring and tracking of workflows. Since its introduction, Asana has injected more engaging graphics into its once-staid system. Newer developments include improved analytics software and automated rules settings to cut down on remedial work.</p>\n<p>Given its size, influence, and power, Asana remains a competitive force in the task management space.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. <a href=\"https://trello.com/en-US\">Trello</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Before the advent of the work OS, there were yellow Post-it notes. They offered a simple but effective system (as long as the sticky notes kept their stickiness, that is).</p>\n<p>The designers at Trello have brought the user-friendliness of the Post-it into the Information Age. It’s a free application that takes just minutes to install and learn. You can type up individual “cards” or work from broader templates, mark tasks complete, and attach documents with ease.</p>\n<p>An application that works with the simplicity of notes on bulletin boards would be enough, but Trello also seamlessly integrates with existing communications programs like Slack. With Butler, users can automate some processes.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the best approach is the simplest. Trello is proof of that.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/projects/?src=zoho-home&#38;ireft=ohome\">Zoho Projects</a></strong></h3>\n<p>A SaaS innovator based in India, Zoho Projects is just one offering among a more extensive suite of programs for office management. As such, it was created to run in tandem with other programs, both those within the larger Zoho constellation and with applications like Slack and Google Docs. That focus on integration makes Zoho distinctive — and incredibly useful.</p>\n<p>Like most work OSes, Zoho offers scheduling, task assignment, and collaborative features. It’s also on the cutting edge of analytics, with Gantt charts built into the UX. Another great feature is its time-logging integration, which is vital for contractors and hourly employees.</p>\n<p>Not for nothing, then, does Zoho Projects see itself as the most effective project management software you can get.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to imagine using computers without an OS, and it’s becoming equally hard to imagine work life without a working OS. Adopting one of these platforms will help you see what companies from Google to Netflix already know: Working on one centralized platform will change the way you do business.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\">The Top Work Operating Systems of 2020</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Mar 2020 14:00:51 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020.png","linkMd5":"84a7d6ddca4e9662c8c3a90347770d20","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-27-293_2ffabb609b7adca1.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":628549,"destBytes":38936,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Work-Operating-Systems-of-2020-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-16-028_b433a71b94122bf2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195881455},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Real Estate vs Stocks: Which has a Better Return?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=165613","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/real-estate-vs-stocks-which-has-a-better-return/\" title=\"Real Estate vs Stocks: Which has a Better Return?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"stocks vs real estate\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The question about whether Real Estate or Stocks are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/08/6-user-interface-musts-for-personal-finance-apps/\">your best options for a return</a> on your investment may become a moot point shortly after the big toss the last couple of weeks. Here is real estate vs stocks and which has a better return.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Most people are clear nowadays that you need <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/11/blockchain-metrics-will-add-transparency-to-investing-and-better-inform-investors/\">to have an investment strategy</a> that fits your budget as well as your needs. You have to plan for your retirement &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t just happen on its own. Are you saving for a college fund? Do you want to earn residual income? These are essential life and lifestyle strategies and decisions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Investing in stock sounds like an easy option and it&#8217;s a common investment option. Another standard and lucrative investment option is investment real estate.</h3>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you have invested in the right circumstances, real estate investments can turn out to be a low-risk strategy, offering greater diversification and yielding equal, if not better returns.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many development companies can give you the right price for your investments. Let us have a look at both these investment options to see which one is the right option.</p>\n<h2>Investing in Real Estate</h2>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When it comes to buying <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/06/where-will-ai-take-the-real-estate-market-in-10-years/\">real estate</a>, you are investing in physical land or property. Some real-estate options cost you money each month until the property is paid off.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When purchasing or <a href=\"https://jboitnott.com/the-cost-of-home-ownership-and-where-youre-probably-overspending/\">investing in real estate property</a>, you&#8217;ll want to maintain the property in order to get a good resale value. As with any investment, you have to spend some money out of your pocket in order to maintain your property.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">That being said, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/getting-high-returns-on-real-estate-investment/\">many real estate properties</a> are cash-generating as well. If you invest with the right real estate company, you can find some properties which can generate some good chunks of profits for you.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you invest in an apartment or buy a shop in a commercial complex, you will receive monthly rent for that. You can pay the expenses and keep the difference as a profit.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Pros of Investing Real Estate:</h3>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let us discuss in brief the pros of investing in real estate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The majority of the people are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/19/3-ai-trends-every-real-estate-broker-should-know/\">familiar with investing in real estate</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The real estate investment is tangible, and you can use and keep this investment it for yourself if you want. Some people buy and hold land and property and use it for personal needs.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Real estate serves as an inflation hedge.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The risk of fraud is less when it comes to investing in real estate.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Debt or leverage is more secure with real estate when compared to stocks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Cons of Investing in Real Estate:</h3>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/the-challenges-and-opportunities-for-automation-in-the-real-estate-industry/\">Investing in real estate</a> has some cons as well along with pros. Let us take a look at them as well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Investing in real estate requires a lot of work when compared to investing in stocks.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Recurring costs may be incurred to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/15/how-iot-is-infiltrating-the-real-estate-market/\">maintain a real estate investment</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">There is often little or no scope for short term gains when it comes to investing in real estate. You&#8217;ll want to purchase your property and hang on to it for a time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Investing in Stocks</h2>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Investing in stocks means buying a piece of a company. The company can be in any industry. The investor is entitled to a share of profit for every share, which is owned by them.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You will likely not be able to merely look at a stock and be able to see its worth, and then purchase it. Investing in stocks needs a knowledge base of the &#8220;how-to.&#8221; Most often, stock traders have many years of school and experience.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Stock businesses have studied the trends in the market. Some feel there is a higher percentage of gambling or speculation in stocks. But any investment has some risks. Caution is required when it comes to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/12/07/how_social_media_is_changing_the_stock_market/\">investing in stocks</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Stocks are always subject to economic cycles, monetary policies, tax rules in each country, and state, as well as under the ruling of each government, which is currently in power.</p>\n<h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Pros of Investing in Stocks:</h3>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Here are the pros of investing in stocks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Investing in stocks means owning a part of the business without having to do the work.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">If the investment in the shares in a company which gives you regular dividends then this price increased every year.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Stock investments can be easily liquidated. For most stocks, you don’t need to wait for a long time to sell them.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Fewer formalities exist when starting to invest in stocks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Cons of Investing in Stocks:</h3>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let us have a look at the cons of investing in stocks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Volatile markets and thus no guaranteed returns.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Influenced by a lot of pre-existing factors.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Risk of fraud is more significant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">It seems clear that both options of stocks and real estate have their own pros and cons. All care should be taken when making a decision about either investment. Learn to understand the situation, the financial institution, and the business person you are dealing with.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you are keen on investing in real estate &#8212; every country in the world has wonders to behold. My favorite place in the world is Hyderabad, India (BBG India dot com). Beautiful people, city, university, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Any city and country in the world will have various projects per your budget requirements. Consider the beauties of my <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/24/will-artificial-intelligence-ai-replace-real-estate-agents/\">country and a place for investing in property,</a> or stocks, and for building business opportunities.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/real-estate-vs-stocks-which-has-a-better-return/\">Real Estate vs Stocks: Which has a Better Return?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 21:00:01 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return.jpg","linkMd5":"570c566a4aafb6f285b9ac01953656ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-293_c91a3695ce5d3e12.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":27084,"destBytes":22476,"author":"Vinod Janapala","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Real-Estate-vs-Stocks-Which-has-a-Better-Return-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-15-635_ad2d49ca0b83dfb9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880525},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"Finance Automation Strategies to Streamline Your Processes","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167917","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/finance-automation-strategies-to-streamline-your-processes/\" title=\"Finance Automation Strategies to Streamline Your Processes\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"finance automation\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>If you&#8217;re still doing everything manually, then it&#8217;s time to discover how you can carve out more time in your day with automation. Sure, it might <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/09/4-obstacles-to-automation-get-over-them-now/\">sound intimidating in the beginning</a>, but once you find the right automation software, you&#8217;ll wonder why you didn&#8217;t dive into the tech pool sooner. Here is concrete advice on finance automation strategies and how to streamline your processes.</p>\n<p>There are so many ways for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/11/outsource-or-automate-how-to-strategically-take-tasks-off-your-plate/\">businesses to automate nowadays</a> that it would be virtually impossible not to find a way to do it. Dispatchers can automate technician appointments, hospitals can automate patient check-ins, and finance departments can automate many of their most complicated tasks.</p>\n<h2>Automation is Key to Streamline Your Processes</h2>\n<p>Change can be hard, but it can also be necessary. In today&#8217;s world, it feels like we are always running on all cylinders. It&#8217;s no longer necessary to spend an entire day on a task that could take just a few minutes with automation. It&#8217;s becoming increasingly important to keep up <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/29/3-knowledge-management-solutions-to-skyrocket-productivity/\">productivity and free up employees</a> for vital tasks that cannot be done with automation.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more important than ever to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/why-you-need-a-data-driven-framework-to-guide-employee-experience/\">make employees feel like they matter</a>. You want them to know that they are seen, and they are appreciated. It&#8217;s challenging to offer those personal one-on-one interactions when you&#8217;re too busy with paperwork to even look up from your desk.</p>\n<p>Automation is not about replacing employees. It&#8217;s about making time for them. When you automate, there&#8217;s more time for brainstorming and team lunches. There&#8217;s more money for it, too. Automation can not only save time, but it can also save a lot of unnecessary expense.</p>\n<h2>The Evolution of Bookkeeping</h2>\n<p>The days of manually adding every instance of business revenue and each expenditure are over. Even if you&#8217;re an Excel spreadsheet master, it can be incredibly time-consuming to track each line item by hand. Fortunately, you no longer have to.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s now<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\"> dedicated software available</a> that makes bookkeeping more efficient than ever. Perhaps one of the highlights of software like <a href=\"https://www.xero.com/\">Xero</a> and <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/\">FreshBooks </a>is the fact that it&#8217;s so intuitive and simple to use. You can now automate many of your most complicated bookkeeping tasks, all on par with best practices and industry standards.</p>\n<p>For example, you may have a service business where your employees are in the field all day servicing customers. At the end of each day, they return to headquarters to submit their sales and expense paperwork.</p>\n<p>With tools like <strong>-ServiceTitan</strong> that integrate directly with Quickbooks- that entire process is automated. You&#8217;ll not only save time, but you&#8217;re more guaranteed to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/08/exploring-the-convergence-of-the-iot-and-patient-safety/\">have consistent records</a> and accurate information, as well.</p>\n<h2>Manual Billing is a Thief of Your Time</h2>\n<p>Gone are the days when you would have to track every single outstanding invoice or manually send out each new one. With <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-software-developer-interview/\">automation, you can use software</a> that will do these tasks for you, or at least help you track them. Just imagine being able to open a spreadsheet and have a daily update waiting for you.</p>\n<p>So, what does that daily update include? Things like which invoices are due that day, which ones are now considered late, and which ones are ready to be billed. Everything is carefully laid out in one place so that you don&#8217;t need to do any guesswork.</p>\n<h2>Payday is Easier Than Ever</h2>\n<p>Many accounting managers put <a href=\"https://www.chamberofcommerce.com/business-advice/business/best-online-payroll-services\">payroll at the top of their list</a> of tasks they dread. There are so many different elements that need to be accounted for. If an employee used up vacation days or sick days, or if there was a holiday during the pay period, it all needs to be accounted for.</p>\n<p>There are also <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/14/man-or-machine-for-better-customer-service-use-both/\">varying tax brackets</a> that require different percentages to be withheld from a paycheck. Not to mention social security and Medicaid. There is no one size fits all solution when it comes to employee paychecks and tax withholding. This is where automation software can be a lifesaver.</p>\n<p>Software such as -BambooHR- collects employee payroll data not just for a pay period, but for the entire lifetime of their employment. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/09/customer-data-management-a-crucial-step-to-increase-your-business/\">Retaining all the records</a> helps you track all of the important information you might need to refer back to one day. Best of all, it does this in an easy to use format that&#8217;s simple to navigate.</p>\n<p>Whatever f<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/theres-no-such-thing-as-time-management-only-self-management/\">inancial process you&#8217;re interested in automating</a>, you&#8217;re sure to find a software that does everything you need it to and more. You&#8217;ll wonder why you didn&#8217;t make the transition sooner.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Andrea Piacquadio; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/finance-automation-strategies-to-streamline-your-processes/\">Finance Automation Strategies to Streamline Your Processes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 15 May 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes.jpg","linkMd5":"9e4c6cbea0ead127c8943b55bcbd8801","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-375_4db92b5c22bd4c78.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":145918,"destBytes":101552,"author":"Matt Shealy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Finance-Automation-Strategies-to-Streamline-Your-Processes-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-342_9ec377ecbebdf395.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876984},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Heimplanet Backdoor Inflatable Tent","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174339","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/11/heimplanet-backdoor-inflatable-tent/\" title=\"Heimplanet Backdoor Inflatable Tent\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"inflatable tent\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-719x719.jpg 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent.jpg 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><div class=\"td-post-content\">\n<div id=\"td_uid_1_5f0887a6386b9\" class=\"tdc-row\">\n<div class=\"vc_row td_uid_13_5f0887a638709_rand wpb_row td-pb-row\">\n<div class=\"vc_column td_uid_14_5f0887a638e85_rand wpb_column vc_column_container tdc-column td-pb-span12\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper wpb_text_column td_block_wrap td_block_wrap vc_column_text td_uid_15_5f0887a639135_rand td-pb-border-top td_block_template_2\" data-td-block-uid=\"td_uid_15_5f0887a639135\">\n<div class=\"td-fix-index\">\n<p>Technology is part of every product and aspect of our lives. It has even changed how we go camping. The case in point is that the tents made by <a href=\"https://www.heimplanet.com/shop/Backdoor-cairo-camo-3-Season-Tent_1\">Heimplanet</a>. I recently purchased their Backdoor tent model to try out these inflatable, pole-less tents, which are so different from those that my family used when we would go on summer camping trips.</p>\n<h2>About the Backdoor Tent</h2>\n<p>The Backdoor is a four-person inflatable tent. It has a ventilation system and an inner tent with two layout options, making it suitable for summer and winter camping.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference is that this tent moves away from the pole and canvas style tents that have dominated nearly the whole history of the tent. This pole doesn&#8217;t require hard poles that are often difficult to work with. I remember how it took hours just to get the tents set up. Heimplanet&#8217;s tent sets up so quickly because it uses inflatable support pillars that still give it support and form but without the hassle.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174341 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-719x719.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-719x719.jpg 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"></figure>\n<p>The airframe for this tent is made of recycled material while the inner layer consists of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane and the flysheet is 66D 210T Ripstop with PU lamination.</p>\n<p>There is also a groundsheet made from 100% nylon taffeta 70D 210T also with PU lamination.</p>\n<p>The overall height of the tent is five feet while the inner tent section is just over four feet high. The inside of the tent measures about 97 square feet.</p>\n<h2>Other Notable Features</h2>\n<p><span class=\"a-list-item\">Setting up this tent involves connecting the airframe, inner tent, and outer tent once before the first time you use it. From then on, the tent can simply be rolled out like a sleeping bag, pumped up, and secured with pegs. When you are ready to pack up again, all you need to do is open one of the valves. The simple opening of a valve will deflate the airframe. After that, you simply roll up the tent and put it back in the pack-sack. </span></p>\n<p>The tent uses a one pump system. The frame&#8217;s<span class=\"a-list-item\"> air chambers are connected. That way, the entire tent can be pitched by only using one valve.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Heimplanet notes that the tent has been tested and has withstood wind speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. The ripstop nylon fabric also provides a way to keep the wind out and protect those inside the tent from the elements.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174342 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior-900x675.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior-900x675.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>There are many things to like about this innovative tent. Besides the year-round versatility, it has a wide entrance and spacious feel. There are numerous storage compartments that make organizing your camping gear easy.</p>\n<p>I particularly like the storage in the ceiling that has a place to store your valuables as well as mounts to attach lamps. Plus, there is a second entrance and exit at the rear of the tent.</p>\n<p>The biggest advantage &#8211; again &#8211; is technology and design. <em>This tent looks cool</em>. Although this tent can handle all types of weather conditions, it is lightweight and doesn&#8217;t weigh-a-ton like many traditional tents.</p>\n<p>While a lightweight tent is convenient for everyone, it is especially appreciated by those of us that like to hike and camp in more remote destinations. Carrying less weight on your back means an easier journey.</p>\n<p>Another plus is that the tent comes with a full four-year warranty, which is rare considering that tents can be put in some pretty harsh conditions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"td-pb-span4 td-main-sidebar\" role=\"complementary\">\n<div class=\"td-ss-main-sidebar\">\n<aside class=\"td_block_template_2 widget widget_sib_subscribe_form\">\n<div class=\"aawp-product__content\">\n<div class=\"aawp-product__description\">\n<p>The only con that I can find with this tent is the price. It retails for $989. For what it offers, it&#8217;s an excellent value, especially when it&#8217;s made to last and has such an exceptional warranty. It&#8217;s just a bit of a shock to convince yourself to pay that much money for a tent.</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>The tent comes with pegs, a repair kit, guy lines, packsack, gear loft, and pump adapter.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>You can purchase this tent through Amazon.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">Since the Heimplanet tent is on the expensive side, I would recommend this tent for the serious outdoor person who goes camping often. It&#8217;s also ideal for those more rugged trips of exploring into unchartered areas and during more extreme weather conditions.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">The once-in-awhile camper may want to consider a much lower cost basic tent investment &#8212; but then again, lower cost tents are usually too heavy to take along on a hike.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/11/heimplanet-backdoor-inflatable-tent/\">Heimplanet Backdoor Inflatable Tent</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 18:01:09 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-300x300.jpg","linkMd5":"3340bd36ab12b239ecdc69c94567307d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn61@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-797_a7f4049836668799.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":15434,"destBytes":16478,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoor4PersonTent-300x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn61@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-797_a7f4049836668799.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTent-719x719.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-16-744_5849cd44832ef129.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HeimplanetBackdoorTentInterior-900x675.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-28-535_81e7bdb46cf17886.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872203},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"How COVID-19 is Driving Us into a Cloud-Based Future","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172277","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/08/how-covid-19-is-driving-us-into-a-cloud-based-future/\" title=\"How COVID-19 is Driving Us into a Cloud-Based Future\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"cloud-based future\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>With the advent of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/how-smart-cities-can-help-build-a-better-post-pandemic-world/\">COVID-19 global pandemic</a>, many organizations have had to re-adjust the way they operate. Remote working is now a reality for large sections of the workforce. Remote collaboration through cloud-based platforms is an accepted part of most workdays. But the utility of cloud-based technology does not end there. Here is how COVID-19 is driving us into a cloud-based future.</p>\n<p>A recent report indicates that in the next two years <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/latest-accounting-trends-transforming-the-retail-industry/\">the cloud computing industry</a> will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5%. Already a strongly-emerging technology, cloud-based solutions are proving to be invaluable during a global health crisis where people can no longer work at a fixed site. The extent to which cloud-based technologies are driving us into the future are as follows:</p>\n<h2>Supporting Remote Work and the Freelance Economy</h2>\n<p>Continued productivity is vital as organizations <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">shift to remote models of working</a>. This is as important to corporate organizations as it is to schools and colleges. During COVID-19, many working and learning programs have continued with high levels of efficiency, thanks to highly-flexible, scalable, and efficient cloud-based solutions.</p>\n<p>The seamlessness with which business has continued means that every responsible organization should have a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/introducing-the-technologies-set-to-redefine-cloud-computing/\">cloud migration solution</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/the-modern-workplace-demands-better-visibility/\">Demand for collaboration tools</a> has seen unprecedented growth in platforms like Zoom and Slack. More entrenched office productivity tools such as Microsoft 365 also sees high demand. These tools are all cloud-based and their excellent conferencing, and productivity suites all enjoy the multiple benefits of the cloud.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic eventually subsides, people will have to go back to work. But an increasing number of workers will not. The freelance economy has seen continued growth in recent years, with over 60 million Americans doing freelance work of some sort. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/digital-twin-from-automation-to-autonomy/\">Cloud computing is an invaluable tool</a> that has allowed the freelance economy to take hold and thrive.</p>\n<h2>A boom in E-Commerce and the Fade of Brick and Mortar</h2>\n<p>As people have been stuck at home, the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/01/driving-cloud-transformation-through-iot-solutions/\">demand for e-commerce services</a> has risen sharply. Retailers were already migrating away from brick and mortar into the online space before the global pandemic arrived.</p>\n<p>Retail companies know that as e-commerce adoption rises, any cloud investment costs will be recouped through <strong>cloud cost reduction</strong>. This applies to cloud solutions also being responsible for overall reduced IT costs by obliterating the need for most traditional hardware such as servers.</p>\n<p>The ways in which <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/global-immigration-market-is-shaped-by-ai-tech-careers/\">global supply chains</a> have become embedded in e-commerce fulfillment points to an inevitable future internet of things. Service provider collaboration and integration happens at the level of the cloud between retailers and logistics service providers, resulting in a smooth and highly-efficient delivery system.</p>\n<p>Through the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/06/going-to-cloud-storage-practical-strategies-to-match-your-iot-business-needs/\">robust scalability of the cloud</a> and its forever switched-on nature, global supply chains can support the wants and whims of consumers everywhere. This has been shown during COVID-19, with online purchases spiking a staggering 146%, and supply chains barely breaking a sweat to deliver.</p>\n<h2>Growth of the Cloud in the Government Sector</h2>\n<p>Healthcare has come <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/iot-and-healthcare-technologies-converge-for-better-patient-care/\">to prominence during the pandemic</a>. It has benefited greatly from access to a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure. This has been necessary to manage patient information. With millions of people laid low by the virus, it has taken the need for efficient and accurate computing to a new level of importance.</p>\n<p>The prominence of the cloud during the pandemic goes beyond patient records. Collaboration between various private and governmental agencies has risen to unprecedented levels. Virus development projects are being shared by many countries and institutions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, virus contingency management information is being shared by nations across the world. All these efforts are underpinned by highly scalable and collaborative cloud-based tools.</p>\n<p>It is for moments like these that governments were already moving towards a cloud-based future at great speed. Until recently, almost half of all government agencies in the US were actively using cloud services.</p>\n<p>These agencies understand the power and versatility of private cloud networks, with benefits such as deep security and information sovereignty being crucial. Cloud adoption within government circles will only continue to rise.</p>\n<h2>Content Platforms Enjoying a Surge</h2>\n<p>Binge-consumption of TV and audio content has been a feature of the pandemic. Video-streaming services have reported a strong surge in new subscriptions since the enactment of lockdown orders in many countries.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, music services and many podcasts and audiobook services have also reported large jumps in membership. The gaming industry has also reported large spikes in usage times. Support services such as mobile networks and internet service providers have benefited from these enforced behavior changes.</p>\n<h2>Cloud-Dependent Industries on the Rise</h2>\n<p>The SaaS segment was already a growth area, and its <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/06/4-unique-growth-tactics-for-2020/\">continued importance and growth potential</a> has been revealed during COVID-19. Due to the many daily applications and tools driven by this service, the industry in its entirety is in the limelight.</p>\n<p>Service desks, accounting packages, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/19/create-symbiotic-relationships-with-ai-in-business/\">customer relationship management</a>, human resource management, and enterprise resource planning all rely on the SaaS model. Infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and desktop as a service are all part of the cloud family and are all showing continued growth.</p>\n<p>The new model of remote working depends on the streamlined continuation of business-critical services such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/08/ai-based-framework-for-agile-project-management/\">human resource management</a>. Cloud service providers have been able to remotely manage and secure underlying infrastructure, allowing organizations to continue to function within their constraints. This versatility has been perfect during the pandemic and will continue to be perfect for the business of the future.</p>\n<h2>Robust and Sustainable Is the Way of the Future</h2>\n<p>If anything, the virus has taught us the danger of having all your data tied to office sites and fixed hardware installations. There has always been the danger of data loss through disasters on site. Data loss has been mitigated by on-site security, but cloud services offer a better way.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/11/3-surprising-benefits-of-the-cloud-in-iot/\">better way of cloud services</a> is because hardware inevitably deteriorates, can be stolen, corrupted, or become obsolete. When your data is simply inaccessible, as it has been during the pandemic, a better solution must be found.</p>\n<p>There is also the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/18/3-strategies-chris-dyer-uses-to-overhaul-struggling-company-cultures/\">matter of sustainability</a>. Large organizations can collect vast amounts of hardware to house their information. It is the responsible thing to do to cut down your environmental footprint by putting everything in the cloud.</p>\n<p>There are also downstream issues like energy efficiency and reduced building usage. Other sustainability wins come with the reduced need for workers to commute to the place where the information is held. These wins have come into sharp focus during the virus as many measures have revealed a cleaner planet, even if just temporarily.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The global pandemic has revealed that cloud services will <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/the-cloud-is-the-future-of-software-delivery/\">continue to provide strategic flexibility</a> and scalability for a number of organizations. The virus response would likely have been a lot less effective in a time before cloud services.</p>\n<p>It is totally imaginable that habits like social distancing would have been impossible to achieve if people needed to be on-site to manage and control business-critical systems.</p>\n<p>At this moment in time, cloud services may heavily favor <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/from-polarization-to-open-learning-how-technology-can-help-us-beyond-covid-19/\">sectors which are useful during a pandemic</a>, but future prospects are robust across all sectors. There are also no geographical boundaries, with cloud services projected to increase in adoption across the world.</p>\n<p>New cloud technologies like cloud direct connect, where private networks can join the cloud, will allow more and more types of organizations and networks to take part. Cloud computing is truly taking center stage in driving us into the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/08/how-covid-19-is-driving-us-into-a-cloud-based-future/\">How COVID-19 is Driving Us into a Cloud-Based Future</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 15:00:23 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future.jpg","linkMd5":"ad31bde5508861e6ae13669586f09c0d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn100@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-24-747_72e094a87b4d8417.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":98056,"destBytes":99550,"author":"Paul Cooney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-COVID-19-is-Driving-Us-into-a-Cloud-Based-Future-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-18-534_2d8ec6d2506418f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876036},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"Price Intelligence for Startups: What Is It?

That’s why price intelligence exists: It can help retailers come up with the correct pricing strategy to beat the competition and build value for their products. Here is price intelligence for startups. What is price intelligence? Do you need it? How to get started with your price intelligence.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will take a look at this marketing approach and how you can develop a pricing intelligence system.</p>\n<h2>What is price intelligence?</h2>\n<p>Price intelligence is a marketing approach that includes gathering, tracking, and analyzing the prices of competitors to gain a better understanding of a current situation on the market and make data-based decisions on prices.</p>\n<p>It is also a crucial part of the startup’s overall <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-finances-for-your-startup/\">financial strategy</a>. As retailers often change prices on their products and services, monitoring and analysis of these prices become a constant activity.</p>\n<h2>Why do you need price intelligence?</h2>\n<p>If your competitor lowers the prices, it doesn’t mean you should follow this example. So what’s the point in monitoring this activity then? The answer is, to understand how to act. For example, you can create a special offer or implement temporary discounts to get your customers excited and, perhaps, entice some of your competitor’s customers to switch to your offers.</p>\n<p>So first of all, pricing intelligence will let you come up with a dynamic and efficient pricing strategy that will let you improve your reputation and attract more buyers. Wrong pricing has significant consequences.</p>\n<p>Wrong pricing means prices that are too low will make your clients underestimate the products you offer, and too high prices will scare everyone away. Therefore, it’s vital to find the sweet spot between the two extremes.</p>\n<p>Also, price intelligence will provide you with useful insights that will let you understand the plans of your competitors. Moreover, you will be able to predict certain trends as you begin noticing patterns.</p>\n<h2>How to create a sustainable price intelligence strategy</h2>\n<p>It’s not enough to just gather information about prices. You need to understand your goals, competitors, and target audience first. And only then you can start monitoring prices and making decisions based on the data you acquire.</p>\n<h3>Outline the goals</h3>\n<p>The aim of every business is self-evident — to make more money. However, it’s not as simple as it seems. This overall goal should consist of more feasible smaller sub-goals that will define your strategy. For instance, you can aim for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improving</strong> the cash flow,</li>\n<li><strong>Obtaining </strong>a larger market share,</li>\n<li><strong>Beating</strong> the competition,</li>\n<li><strong>Introducing</strong> a new product,</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing</strong> revenue per buyer,</li>\n<li><strong>Improving</strong> your market penetration,</li>\n<li><strong>Reaching</strong> a new segment, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By doing this, you will make bringing your retail business to success easier for yourself and your team. Once you have a clear picture, you can move to the next step.</p>\n<h3>Understand your target market</h3>\n<p>Obviously, to succeed in retail you need to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/29/5-reasons-why-you-should-absolutely-embrace-social-media-marketing/\">know your target market</a>. But when it comes to price intelligence, you also need to know how your customers will react to the change in prices &#8212; their price sensitivity. To figure it out, you need to research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability of your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\">clients to search for alternatives</a>. How easy it is for them to find another option and compare prices? And are there products similar to yours that are cheaper? If yes, will the customers switch to it?</li>\n<li>Is the buyer the one who will use the product? For example, you’re selling toys for kids. Even if a child likes the toy, parents might not buy it because of the price. Or some of your buyers resell your products.</li>\n<li>What’s the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/startup-essentials-stop-overcomplicating-your-processes/\">customers’ view of competition</a>? Do they only focus on the price, so they’ll buy from you simply because it’s cheaper? Or do they have some other criteria that make them choose you or your competitor? Perhaps, they value your fast delivery, for example, and they will buy from you even if your prices are higher than those of your competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who are your competitors?</h3>\n<p>Knowing your competitors is at the core of pricing intelligence: You can’t monitor the prices correctly if you aren’t aware of your rivals. Being an online retailer, you have both pros and cons of your position when it comes to studying your competitors.</p>\n<p>The advantage is that you can easily find all the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/05/6-strategies-for-ecommerce-stores-to-reduce-fraud/\">other online stores that sell the same product</a> as you — just search for this item on Google.</p>\n<p>However, there is a complication — the number of your rivals might be quite large as there are a lot of online retailers, and you should also consider offline stores. But it might be hard to gather the prices of brick-and-mortar stores if they don’t have a website.</p>\n<p>If you’re selling, for example, printed t-shirts, your rivals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other stores that sell printed t-shirts</li>\n<li>Stores that sell some other kinds of t-shirts</li>\n<li>Clothing stores</li>\n<li>Printing centers that offer printing on t-shirts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/how-to-turn-your-sales-to-absolutely-what-you-want/\">gather all the competitors you find</a>, you can proceed to the next step.</p>\n<h2>Automate the pricing intelligence process</h2>\n<p>When we were talking about competitors, you might have thought, “How am I supposed to gather prices from so many shops?” The answer lies in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/tag/automation/\">automation</a>. In this section, we will introduce you to web scraping and proxies that will become your reliable tools in building a sustainable price intelligence strategy.</p>\n<p>With automation, price intelligence becomes more advanced and can be considered a feat of the best <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/23/secrets-of-financial-applications-traits-of-fintech-apps/\">FinTech</a> products.</p>\n<h3>What is web scraping?</h3>\n<p>Web scraping (also known as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/tag/data-scraping/\">data scraping</a>) is a process of gathering data from the Internet. As this industry evolves, scrapers become simpler &#8212; and today you can find truly straightforward tools that will be easy for you to use even if you never had experience in data gathering. But, of course, it’s better to trust this process to professionals.</p>\n<p>A scraper will go through websites you provide it with and gather the price data. Then this tool will process, structurize, and return it to you in a convenient format. That’s how price intelligence is made easy &#8212; by automating the data gathering and processing.</p>\n<h3>What are proxies and why do you need them?</h3>\n<p>Proxies are remote servers or devices to which you can connect to reroute your traffic through them. As you do so, you pick up the IP address of a proxy masking your real one with it. Therefore, you can remain anonymous, pretend that you’re located in a different place, and avoid restrictions.</p>\n<p>You will need proxies for data gathering because e-commerce websites don’t want anyone to scrape their content. You can understand why: Their owners don’t want their competitors to easily access prices and other valuable information that can be used for gaining a competitive edge.</p>\n<p>That’s why they implement different anti-scraping techniques on their sites. Such protection can detect bot-like behavior and block the IP address where the bot-like traffic comes from.</p>\n<p>Scrapers gather data by sending requests to the website. And such activity looks very suspicious to the anti-scraping protection. By default, a scraper sends all the requests from the same IP address. But you’ll fool the anti-scraping system easily by applying proxies to your scraper.</p>\n<p>Residential proxies, (infatica dot io) are the best choice for scraping as they’re harder to detect, and you can rotate them to prevent getting blocked. Infatica offers flexible pricing plans so that you can get what you need without overpaying. You can also ask us to create a unique plan that fits your needs.</p>\n<h3>Create your pricing strategy</h3>\n<p>Now that you’ve acquired price data, you can begin building your pricing strategy. The pricing intelligence you’ve gathered will let you see the strategies of your competitors. As you will spot certain patterns and trends, it will be quite easy for you to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/01/how-can-a-startup-compete-with-big-companies/\">come up with the strategy</a> that will let you reach the goals you’ve determined in the first step.</p>\n<p>Remember to always stick to your unique aim — don’t just blindly copy the strategy of your competitors. Even if several e-commerce websites sell the same product, they’re still different when it comes to certain details. If you know your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/24/5-advantages-artificial-intelligence-can-give-your-sme/\">target audience well</a>, you’ll understand how to tailor the pricing strategy to its expectations and needs.</p>\n<p>Pricing intelligence became much easier with scrapers and proxies that allows retailers to automate this effort-demanding process. Although <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/04/best-competency-with-artificial-intelligence-is-by-having-intelligent-experience/\">the setup process</a> will require some time and energy, the payoff will be absolutely worth it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/05/price-intelligence-for-startups-what-is-it-why-do-you-need-it-how-to-get-started/\">Price Intelligence for Startups: What Is It?

In 2018, venture capital investments in Latin America doubled for the second consecutive year, according to LAVCA&#8217;s Annual Review of Tech Investment in Latin America. Looking at the major markets in Latin America in 2018, most show increases in VC investment in keeping with the regional average. These markets have brought us to 2020 &#8212; outpacing them all &#8212; is Colombia. Here&#8217;s a look at what&#8217;s fueling startup investments in Colombia.</p>\n<p>Colombia is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/how-to-avoid-being-part-of-90-of-failed-companies/\">not new to the startup scene</a>, but it is beginning to garner increased attention from foreign VCs. Here’s a look at three factors fueling investor interest in Colombia’s technology startups.</p>\n<h2>A growing, increasingly connected consumer base</h2>\n<p>Colombia is an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/09/how-latin-america-is-drawing-in-global-tech-giants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attractive market for technology companies</a>. In addition to the work done by both private and public entities to foster entrepreneurial development, Colombia has several unique characteristics that give it immense potential for growth and disruptive transformation.</p>\n<h4><b>Market size.</b></h4>\n<p>– Colombia is the 29th biggest country in the world with a population of nearly <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/colombia-population/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 million</a>. Since the early 2000s, the Colombian middle class has more than doubled, significantly increasing the consumer potential of the Colombian market.</p>\n<h4><b></b><b>Increased connectivity.</b></h4>\n<p>– Over <a href=\"https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/research/?file=26d3b58c5ef4fa27930c973feff2d9ff&#38;download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50%</a> of Colombians are already smartphone users. This number is predicted to reach 75% in the coming years, which, combined with a relatively fast and ubiquitous Internet connection, creates an increasingly large market for technology-based ventures.</p>\n<h4><b>Shift towards online consumption.</b></h4>\n<p>– In addition to a growing connected population, a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shift in consumer habits</a> is driving eCommerce. The eCommerce industry is growing steadily, with a 24% increase in the number of digital transactions from 2016 to 2017.</p>\n<h4><b>Industry gaps.</b></h4>\n<p>– Colombia has a few industries with massive potential for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/04/building-an-iot-ecosystem-that-fuels-business-transformation/\">disruptive transformation</a>, in particular, health and finance. Colombian public healthcare is decentralized with the lowest-earning tier of the population receiving free, government-subsidized services, and the rest of the population receiving health services administered by various private companies. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/21/3-ways-to-create-cross-functional-data-science-teams/\">data sharing gap</a> that exists between health providers begs for innovative solutions.</p>\n<p>On the financial side, banks are investing heavily in fintech services and pushing the transition toward digital banking. Money transfer services and online bill pay are already available, but, according to the World Bank, only <a href=\"https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">38%</a> of adults have bank accounts, making this a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/26/why-latin-america-is-ready-for-iot-growth/\">prime market for expansion</a>.</p>\n<h2>A solid foundation of government support</h2>\n<p>Colombia suffered decades of violence, instability, and corruption. However, the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-agreement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peace Deal with the FARC</a>, among other efforts, changed its international reputation, leading to a 300% increase in foreign visitors since 2006. As part of the national improvement efforts, and in anticipation of this shift in perception and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/25/top-outsourcing-destinations-in-latin-america-for-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increased foreign interest</a>, the Colombian government laid the groundwork for a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/19/the-evolution-of-startups-in-india-the-story-up-until-now/\">startup-friendly environment </a>years ago.</p>\n<p>Colombia&#8217;s second-largest city, Medellín, is probably best known for this accomplishment, with a reputation for supporting enterprise innovation and a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/08/standardizing-tribal-knowledge-its-time-for-your-company-to-grow-up/\">growing knowledge economy</a>. In 2002, the city established Medellín ACI at (Medillín ACI.org), is the Agency for Investment and Cooperation.</p>\n<h4>Companies promote international relations.</h4>\n<p>The company fosters development by promoting <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\">strategic international relations</a> and foreign investment in the city. Ruta N.com, a public-joint venture established in 2009, also helped the city earn significant attention by providing landing services, office space, and incubation for startups.</p>\n<h4>The government creates programs to help entrepreneurs.</h4>\n<p>In 2012, the national government created the programs iNNpulsa and apps.co, both <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/21/fintech-is-transforming-the-finance-industry/\">promote innovation</a>, business, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/14/iot-developments-and-its-effects-on-the-job-market/\">technological developments</a> in Colombia by providing funds and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/02/the-real-key-metrics-and-magic-numbers-behind-successful-b2b-sales-outreach/\">coaching programs</a> to promising entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Colombian government further demonstrated its <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/17/top-10-latin-american-iot-startups-to-watch/\">commitment to promoting and funding</a> innovative developments with the creation of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, (rcnradio.com).</p>\n<h4>Innovative incubators are being set up by companies and supported by government.</h4>\n<p>In addition to these government programs, there are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/13/nearshoring-basics-for-software-development/\">numerous incubators and accelerators</a> throughout Colombia. Parque del Emprendimiento, Cluster CreaTIC, ParqueSoft, Macondo Lab, Socialatom Group and Creame are a few of the more established organizations. New groups, such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/coding-boot-camps-produce-talent-but-leave-many-on-the-sidelines/\">technology boot camps</a>, and programs are regularly popping up.</p>\n<h2>Increased foreign investment</h2>\n<p>Recent foreign investment is helping to put Colombia in the spotlight. Colombia received <a href=\"https://lavca.org/industry-data/inside-another-record-breaking-year-lavcas-annual-review-of-tech-investment-in-latin-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$334M</a> of investment in 2018, a nearly 5x increase in venture capital from the year before. Most recently, Softbank Group Corp invested $1B in the Colombian unicorn, Rappi, founded by Felipe Villamarin, Sebastian Mejia, and Simon Borrero.</p>\n<p>With over $1.4B in disclosed funding, Rappi is now one of the highest-funded Latin American startups.</p>\n<h4><strong>The investment from Softbank Group Corp is the type of attention that creates a positive cycle.</strong></h4>\n<p>When international accelerators and VCs turn to Colombia, investment amounts increase, leading to more attention, then more funding, and creating a fertile environment for the creation of more startups and more investment opportunities for VCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Many Colombian Startups that have earned recent attention from foreign investors. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Included here are companies and the</strong><strong> individuals who have brought it all together. These companies and each individual listed here has a personal listing on Crunchbase.</strong></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://merqueo.com/bogota/domicilios-super-ahorro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Merqueo</b></a></h4>\n<p>– This online supermarket platform founded by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/miguel-mc-allister-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miguel Mc Allister</a> and<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sebastian-noguera-escallon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Sebastian Noguera Escallón</a> recently joined the Colombian eCommerce scene. They’ve raised $14M from US-based VCs Portland Private Equity and Endeavor.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.frubana.com/co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Frubana</b></a></h4>\n<p>– Founded by Rappi&#8217;s former Expansion Leader, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/fabian-gomez-gutierrez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabian Gomez Gutierrez</a>, Frubana simplifies the supply chain for the food industry, allowing restaurants to deal directly with producers. In two rounds, they raised $12M from several VC firms, including Y-Combinator and Kairos.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.kushkipagos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Kushki</b></a></h4>\n<p>– Founded by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aron-schwarzkopf#section-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aron Schwarzkopf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sebastin-castro#section-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sebastian Castro</a>, Kushki is improving payment systems in Latin America by facilitating currency conversions and international transfers across the region. Kushki recently raised a Series A round from dev labs and Magma Partners at the end of 2018.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.truora.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Truora</b></a></h4>\n<p>– Founded by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/cesar-pino-80c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cesar Pino</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-bilbao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Bilbao</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/maite-muniz-telleria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maite Muniz Telleria</a> in 2018, Truora is tackling identity theft and fraud in Latin America. Its platform supports over 10,000 checks per hour and was part of the Winter 2019 Y-Combinator class. Though still in early funding stages, Truora left Y-Combinator with regional investors Magma Partners and Kaszek Ventures, and foreign investors Y-Combinator and Accel.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.addi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>ADDI</b></a></h4>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/elmer-ortega\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elmer Ortega</a>’s Bogotá-based fintech company offers credit and digital financial services and raised $14M this year with lead investor Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://ayendarooms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Ayenda Rooms</b></a></h4>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/andr%C3%A9s-sarrazola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrés Sarrazola</a> founded Ayenda Rooms with the goal of becoming Colombia&#8217;s biggest hotel chain. Ayenda Rooms offers an online reservation platform with a growing number of franchised hotels. The startup recently received a $1.2M investment from SoftBank, and still undisclosed investments from GE32 Capital and Kairos.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://omnibnk.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Omnibnk</b></a></h4>\n<p>– Founded by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/diego-caicedo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diego Caicedo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-abumohor-8635361?originalSubdomain=cl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andres Abumohor,</a> Omnibnk is one of the first neobanks in Latin America to provide quick loans to SMEs of up to $1M &#8212; based on a company’s electronic invoices.

But we are seeing a massive reduction in the number of meetings held, the length of those meetings, and the number of participants included—and public attitudes about meetings are drastically changing. </span></p>\n<p><b>Meetings and Time Waste</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meetings waste time in almost every scenario, for one reason or another, and Americans are starting to wake up to this reality. </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/67percent-of-workers-say-spending-too-much-time-in-meetings-distracts-them.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More than two-thirds of American workers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> claim that too much time in meetings is distracting, preventing them from accomplishing their core responsibilities. And participants in meetings feel that as much as a </span><a href=\"http://attentiv.com/america-meets-a-lot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">third of all meeting time is a total waste</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, exacerbated by the fact that 63 percent of meetings are held without a pre-planned agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This problem of time waste is compounded by several factors. First, the sheer number of meetings held; there are more than 11 million meetings per day, and in many organizations, meetings are held for even the smallest matters. Each meeting includes multiple participants, multiplying the man-hours necessary to carry it out, and in many cases those participants are unnecessary. And of course, extra-long meetings multiply all these factors even further. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.readytalk.com/meeting-resources/infographics/true-cost-meetings-infographic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">See this math in action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; if your company has 100 employees making $60,000 per year with 60 meetings per month, the total cost of meetings per year is $2.25 million. Is that really worth the insights you glean from daily updates? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the last several years, executives have been waking up to this reality and curtailing their meeting habits, but an even more powerful force is influencing meeting norms. </span></p>\n<p><b>The Last Nail in the Coffin </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/digital-marketing-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> forced businesses all over the country to </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/25/remote-work-in-the-time-of-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rapidly deploy a remote work strategy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Initially, most of those businesses attempted to simply copy and paste their traditional work processes into a virtual environment, with minimal changes—for the sake of simplicity, speed, and adherence to tradition. However, this meant dealing with lag, interruptions, limited body language, and excessive participants in video chats. </span></p>\n<p>Furthermore, remote meetings tend to allow for a more lax atmosphere, allowing participants to multi-task (or worse, multi-lax) while other participants take the lead and drive the organization forward.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As more business owners and team leaders are realizing, traditional meetings are borderline untenable in these circumstances, reserved only for very specific types of discussions. And once they realize that meetings can be replaced with better alternatives, there may not be a reason to ever go back—even if they return to the traditional office. </span></p>\n<p><b>New Types of Meetings</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In some ways, meetings are evolving, rather than dying. Increasingly, they’re benefiting from strategies like: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Better proactive planning. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Team leaders must be organized and have a vision if they’re going to hold a successful meeting. That means starting each meeting with a clear agenda and a list of goals to accomplish. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Limited participation.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Adding more people to a meeting typically increases its complexity, and multiplies the amount of time it wastes. Accordingly, many teams are transitioning to include fewer participants. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Limited timing and frequency.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And in one of the most straightforward changes, meetings are beginning to grow shorter, less frequent and are ultimately becoming </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/23/future-of-custom-software-development/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">more customized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.  </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>What Could Replace Meetings? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meetings are at the core of successful companies. They have been around since time immemorial. And yet, many meetings remain inefficient and time-wasting. At best, meetings need improvement. Any meetings that can’t be truncated or improved must be replaced. But what could replace the interactive potential of a traditional meeting? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few potential models: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Trust and autonomy. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An easy way to eliminate many meetings is to give your employees more trust and autonomy. If they have the power to make their own decisions and accomplish their own goals, they won’t need to check in with a boss twice a day. In many cases, team huddle and daily check-in style meetings can easily be replaced with a <a href=\"https://seo.co/email-marketing/#subject\">simple email with a punchy subject</a> at the beginning (or pointed call to action at the end) of the day.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Chat channels. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thread-based and group-based instant messaging channels have many advantages over meetings; they’re recorded (so transcripts are permanent), they’re less urgent (and less distracting), and they can occur in the background throughout the day. Businesses are catching onto this; Slack, for example, has </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/652779/worldwide-slack-users-total-vs-paid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">more than 12 million daily active users</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Social/blogging hybrids.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Some companies are beginning to decrease their reliance on email, meetings, and other forms of traditional office communication in favor of social and </span><a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-6tkcq-8a7955c?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&#38;utm_medium=dlink&#38;utm_source=w_share\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blog-based communication channels</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For example, Automattic (the parent company of WordPress) is known for pioneering a system of communication that revolves around </span><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">signature blogs known as P2</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. These allow conversations to occur both publicly and privately, with real-time commentary from coworkers and an intuitive system of organization. </span></li>\n<li><strong>Keep it Short Stupid</strong>. Jeff Bezos of Amazon fame is known for his &#8220;one page&#8221; approach to meetings wherein the organizer or presenter in a meeting is not allowed to present in a slide deck, but must keep the meeting agenda on a single piece of paper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, the new work from home normal really only works when teams are made up of responsible adults who are able to work autonomously on their own. While this might be true for many workers, the Melissa Meyer approach to location-based working is really to police the shirkers, not just to attempt to create a better working relationship among various coworkers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the next several years, you’ll likely start enjoying the benefits of reduced meetings and more efficient forms of communication. And if you’re in charge of organizing meetings for your team, consider jumping on this trend. Now is the perfect time to overhaul your communication strategy, and take advantage of more efficient collaboration channels. </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/07/death-of-meetings-how-new-forms-of-collaboration-are-taking-over/\">The Death of Meetings: How New Forms of Collaboration Are Taking Over</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 15:37:23 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/death-of-meetings.jpg","linkMd5":"a9fcb7f84d87acd77e99d1119f399784","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-23-802_3dad3c564fffcebd.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/death-of-meetings.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":249281,"destBytes":191106,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/death-of-meetings-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-15-245_6565d01b4719ba7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195870466},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"Okaysou AirMax 8L Medical Grade Air Purifier: Powerful Air Cleaning System","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175650","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/13/okaysou-airmax-8l-medical-grade-air-purifier-powerful-air-cleaning-system/\" title=\"Okaysou AirMax 8L Medical Grade Air Purifier: Powerful Air Cleaning System\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Okaysou AirMax 8L Medical Grade Air Purifier\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier-900x676.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier.jpg 1489w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Air purifiers are becoming a hot commodity as more of us work from home and want to make sure we have the best working and living environment for ourselves and family. The latest one I picked up to try for my home was the Okaysou AirMax 8L medical grade air purifier because it noted it was efficient at eliminating pet hair.</p>\n<p>There are so many air filters out there with specific benefits or that fit certain room sizes. Here&#8217;s what I found when I put the Okaysou AirMax 8L to the test.</p>\n<h2>About the Okaysou AirMax 8L</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.okaysou.com/collections/home-amp-kitchen/products/okaysou-airmax8l-air-purifier\">Okaysou AirMax 8L</a> is an air purifier that includes a HEPA filter designed to capture and remove 99.97% of the air pollutants from the air around you. It uses two different filters, including the HEPA filter and a carbon filter.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-175652 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8LPurifier.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8LPurifier.jpg 201w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8LPurifier-128x160.jpg 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" /></p>\n<h2>Features and Specifications</h2>\n<p>The unit has three fan speeds, a sleep mode, and child-lock function. Other features include a timer function so you can run the unit for one hour, two hours, four hours, or even eight hours. There is an indicator light that also tells you when it&#8217;s time to replace the filters.</p>\n<p>The air purifier is designed to circulate air in a room or area that measures up to 800 square feet. It has a noise level of less than 59 dB.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>The pros include a thoughtful design, which includes a handle that makes it easy to move around. It&#8217;s also lightweight so I had no problem picking it up and moving it to a different part of the house.</p>\n<p>I also like how easy it is to get into the unit for filter replacement. The buttons are all easy to understand and use. There is a low-light display, which means it didn&#8217;t create a distraction at night by giving off too much light.</p>\n<p>Finally, it does a phenomenal job of filtering the air because it makes the air smell fresh.</p>\n<p>The cons were that this is the loudest air purifier I&#8217;ve owned. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s so loud it&#8217;s distracting, but I do notice it more. It does mean turning up the television louder if it&#8217;s in the same room. Other than that, it is an effective air purifier.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-175651 size-medium\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L-300x240.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L-900x719.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L-200x160.jpg 200w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>The AirMax 8L Air Purifier comes loaded with the two filters so you don&#8217;t have to install these. In the box, you&#8217;ll also find a user manual, product review card, and five-year warranty card. You can use this to register your unit and provide feedback on the air purifier.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>Priced at a reasonable $118, you can buy the air purifier from the Okaysou website. Other places you can purchase it include Amazon and Walmart.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Okaysou AirMax 8L did a great job in removing pet hair and dander from the air along with dust and other air pollutants. It is priced fairly for its ability to clean a larger area and does better than so many air purifiers that are at the same price point.</p>\n<p>I would recommend this air purifier but suggest that you keep it for areas where you may not be working or sleeping. For example, we used the air purifier in the bedroom before going to bed and then turned it off so the fan and light wouldn&#8217;t interrupt our sleep.</p>\n<p>But I want fresh air &#8212; so &#8212; I stuck on a slumber mask and opted to sleep in fresh, clean air.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/13/okaysou-airmax-8l-medical-grade-air-purifier-powerful-air-cleaning-system/\">Okaysou AirMax 8L Medical Grade Air Purifier: Powerful Air Cleaning System</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier.jpg","linkMd5":"2915d14f75643367faad7eee504b1452","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-25-441_3d974dffbf6bb099.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier.jpg","destWidth":1489,"destHeight":1119,"sourceBytes":190383,"destBytes":95488,"author":"Deanna Ritchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirPurifier-300x225.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-16-678_ccff51faa9adda12.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8LPurifier.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-862_131e7ba1f4047930.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OkaysouAirMax8L-300x240.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn92@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-14-584_60a39d7bb2495e22.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195871971},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"The Value of AI-Based Visual Inspection in 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170087","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/02/the-value-of-ai-based-visual-inspection-in-2020/\" title=\"The Value of AI-Based Visual Inspection in 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Value-of-AI-Based-Visual-Inspection-in-2020-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"ai visual inspection\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Value-of-AI-Based-Visual-Inspection-in-2020-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Value-of-AI-Based-Visual-Inspection-in-2020-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Value-of-AI-Based-Visual-Inspection-in-2020.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>For over a decade, manufacturers have turned to automated solutions to improve their bottom line. Automation and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/03/machine-vision-is-key-to-industry-4-0-and-iot/\">machine vision</a> are now being augmented and even replaced by AI. Here is the value of AI-based visual inspection in 2020.</p>\n<h2>Value of AI-Based visual inspection</h2>\n<p>Being replaced by AI is especially true when it comes to visual inspection. The use of AI-based visual inspection technology is transforming manufacturing’s ability to improve business operations.</p>\n<p>AI-based visual inspection relies on two of AI’s main strengths: <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/tag/computer-vision/\">computer vision</a> and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/04/3-areas-of-your-business-where-deep-learning-can-make-a-difference/\">deep learning</a>. Every AI system is built with the core capacity to perceive its environment (computer vision) and act on those perceptions (deep-learning).</p>\n<p>As a result of deep-learning, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/18/ai-is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-technology/\">AI adapts to a range of environments</a>, making it useful across a multitude of industries. It has unlimited potential and can be developed rapidly to meet a manufacturer&#8217;s needs.</p>\n<h2>Concept of AI-based visual inspection</h2>\n<p>Well-trained human eyes can detect defects. A well-trained AI-based vision system can do the same &#8212; but with greater efficiency. Like a human eye, AI-based vision systems capture an image and send it to a central “brain” for processing.</p>\n<h4>Like a human brain, an AI “brain” makes detailed meaning from the image by contrasting it against its existing knowledge.</h4>\n<p>AI-based vision systems are made of two integrated components. A sensing device acts as an “eye,” while a deep learning algorithm acts as a “brain.” The integrated system successfully mimics the human eye-brain ability to interpret images.</p>\n<p><strong>AI-based vision systems are more efficient than human eyes because the AI “brain” stores greater amounts of information.</strong></p>\n<p>Robust <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/29/computing-power-suppliers-are-shifting-gears-for-ai/\">computational power</a> can parse through available data at rapid speeds. The system can classify objects in both photos and videos and perform complex visual perception tasks.</p>\n<p>AI-based vision systems can search images and captions, detect objects, and classify multi-media.</p>\n<p>Thanks to deep learning-based visual processing, AI-based visual inspection systems can <a href=\"https://mobidev.biz/blog/ai-visual-inspection-deep-learning-computer-vision-defect-detection?utm_source=readwrite&#38;utm_medium=visual&#38;utm_campaign=visual\">perceive cosmetic flaws and detect defects</a> across general or conceptual surfaces (mobidev dot biz).</p>\n<h2>Benefits of AI-based visual inspection</h2>\n<h3>1. Fast Implementation</h3>\n<p>Decades-old automated systems depend on defect libraries, lists of exceptions and complicated filters. The time it takes to accrue this information, clean it for accuracy, and re-implement it decreases its efficacy. It also wastes labor.</p>\n<p>AI and deep learning do not require prolonged programming or tediously lengthy algorithms. AI-based visual inspection systems might be constructed by several quality engineers and a dataset of training images. The system learns rapidly and is integrated over several weeks.</p>\n<h3>2. Improved Analytics and Quality Control</h3>\n<p>Manufacturers can use AI to document inspection results and to assess product quality. Some overall process improvement initiative metrics that can be successfully tracked and correlated with concrete vision data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>process recipes</li>\n<li>equipment differences</li>\n<li>component suppliers</li>\n<li>factory location</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, inspection images and results can also be tracked and documented. These initiatives prevent future failure, which saves time and additional production costs. Applying deep learning-based machine vision across all initiatives and inspections helps manufacturers recognize and address defects early.</p>\n<h3>3. Labor Costs Reduction</h3>\n<p>AI solutions have higher rates of consistency than most expert human inspectors. Human inspectors must be trained and are only able to maintain a high degree of focus for 15-20 minutes at a time. Labor costs are incurred yearly and staff turn-over is an issue. For these reasons, AI-based vision inspections are more cost-effective than manual labor.</p>\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\n<p>AI is increasing the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/06/why-automation-is-the-only-path-forward-for-manufacturing/\">competitiveness of manufacturers across every industry</a>. Here are recent use cases from the aviation industry, semi-conductor manufacturing sector, and bio-science.</p>\n<p>Alibaba has risen to meet <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/13/ai-moving-into-healthcare-regulatory-challenges-await/\">healthcare challenges</a> created by the coronavirus. Alibaba’s deep-learning-based visual recognition system is capable of detecting the coronavirus in chest CT scans at a 96% accuracy rate. The system accessed 5,000 COVID-19 cases and can provide a diagnosis within 20 seconds. Moreover, the system can differentiate between images of viral pneumonia and images of coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Fujitsu Laboratories implemented an Image Recognition System at Fujitsu&#8217;s Oyama factory. The system ensures that parts are produced at optimal quality levels by supervising the assembly process. The system was so successful that Fujitsu implemented it across the entirety of the company’s production sites.</p>\n<p>Airbus introduced an automated, drone-based aircraft inspection system in 2018. The system has improved the quality of inspections and reduced aircraft downtime.</p>\n<p>GlobalFoundries is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. The company designed a visual inspection <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ai-and-machine-learning-improve-manufacturing-visual-inspection-process\">system</a> that detects defects in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The system detects defects in a wafer map which then helps to determine the semiconductor device’s performance.</p>\n<p>The use cases listed above reveal the extent to which <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/01/11-artificial-intelligence-trends-every-business-in-2019-must-know/\">AI is capable of automating</a> many aspects of our lives. Although AI vision will never replicate human vision, the technology continues to classify information and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/27/future-of-artificial-intelligence-for-2020/\">advance in ways human eyes and brains cannot</a>.

But is your business prepared? Here are the new privacy and security laws of the states explained and how to get your business ready.</p>\n<p><b>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>\n<p>It’s easy to see that federal legislation regarding issues such as security and privacy are always delayed. This time, many states are now pushing through some bills while waiting for federal level legislation.</p>\n<p>Currently sweeping the headlines happens to be the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA) of which its signing took place in June 2018.</p>\n<p>It is believed that its inspiration is gotten from the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and its objective is to ensure that consumers can regulate the way their data is retrieved and used by companies.</p>\n<p>The bill was set to be fully effective in January 2020.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take more look at some other moves by state legislation regarding issues of privacy and cybersecurity.</p>\n<p><b>Nevada Senate Bill 220 Online Privacy Law</b></p>\n<p>Even if most of the attention was directed towards the CCPA, the <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/NV/bill/SB220/2019\">online privacy regulations of Nevada state</a> signed in May 2019 seems to be harsher.</p>\n<p>This bill is an amendment to the already existing law in the state of Nevada, which stipulates that businesses must give its clients the opportunity to stop their personal data from being sold.</p>\n<p>The bill was set to be fully effective on October 1, 2019. There are no new notice stipulations on the part of web operators. However, they are required to release some privacy policy info to the public. Most of that has to do with the information collected and how that data is distributed or shared.</p>\n<p>Violating the regulations will see defaulters penalized as much as $5000 for every violation. There is also the possibility of injunctions being incurred.</p>\n<p><b>Maine Act to Protect the Privacy of Online Consumer Information</b></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0275&#38;item=1&#38;snum=129\">bill</a> was signed into law in June 2019 as a way of protecting consumer information in virtual space, and it was set to be fully effective in July 2020.</p>\n<p>Companies that provide broadband internet services are not allowed to use, disclose, sell, or allow the personal data of consumers to be accessed without the permission of the consumer.</p>\n<p>There are just a few exceptions. Providers of broadband internet are also not allowed to deny their services to customers or victimize customers by making them pay more simply because of a denied permission.</p>\n<p><b>Other Laws have been Enacted</b></p>\n<p>In the same vein, other laws that have to do with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/iot-can-put-your-data-at-risk-heres-how/\">cyber and data security</a> have been enacted across other States which include New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.</p>\n<p><b>What this Means for Your Business</b></p>\n<p>Although it seems like there is some time to spare pending the full activation of these regulations, they are coming! It would be wrong for you to wait until they are here before taking action.</p>\n<p>It is essential that you begin now to analyze your security levels, not only with respect to how you can respond to incidents or <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/03/tackling-the-challenge-of-iot-software-updates/\">how many patches you&#8217;ve got installed</a>. Businesses must carry out security analysis based on processes dedicated to ensuring that vulnerabilities with respect to privacy and cybersecurity are avoided.</p>\n<p>What this implies is that time will prove to be a vital element in keeping data secure. Measurements of security levels must be carried out by taking into consideration the amount of time dedicated to carrying out software tests, as well as the amount of time used in the maintenance of deployed software.</p>\n<p><b>How to Ensure that Your Business is Ready</b></p>\n<p>If your company is involved in the business of software creation or distribution, here are two key strategies that can help you prepare your business for the future &#8211;</p>\n<p><b>1. Concentrate effort on security processes</b></p>\n<p>When designing and deploying software, efforts should be concentrated on incorporating security processes early enough and regularly where possible.</p>\n<p>A wide range of techniques can be used to do this. So many software developers are already threading on this path through the insertion of security personnel once the process starts.</p>\n<p>If your business is involved in software buying, consistently monitor attack surfaces, and make sure that you&#8217;ve got a team that constantly probes your networks.</p>\n<p><b>2. Maintain a balance between available resources and data to be protected</b></p>\n<p>Companies must ensure that there is a connection between the resources invested in security and privacy, and how complex and voluminous the code to be protected is.</p>\n<p>With the growth in the code of software or with expansions in user bases, it is imperative that firms multiply every effort invested to ensure that their users are secured and that their privacy is protected.</p>\n<p><b>The Way Forward for Businesses</b></p>\n<p>Regardless of the processes you choose to adopt, your company needs to show that it is a proactive player when it comes to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/14/a-look-at-how-convenience-is-driving-connected-devices/\">controlling security and privacy</a>. It should be treated as a core necessity and not a process that comes up as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>This means that your company needs to carry out and ensure the <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/8-cybersecurity-kpis-track/\">tracking of valuable resources</a> as well as time expended in software tests and security processes.</p>\n<p>It’s important to secure the entire company network. Securing the company network can be done by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/07/30/a-review-of-browser-anti-phish/\">conducting regular security awareness</a> training for the employees and also by ensuring every <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/07/how-to-avoid-becoming-the-next-victim-of-a-data-breach/\">employee is well-equipped</a> with the best security tools. That way, you do not leave a footprint that can be traced back to you.</p>\n<p>As we invest more and more of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/24/cybersecurity-best-practices-7-ways-to-secure-your-data-in-2020/\">our time utilizing systems</a> that are based on software, we all must come together to promote the security of these systems.</p>\n<p>That way, there will be dedicated personnel investing time and valuable resources to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/its-time-to-truly-consider-the-privacy-implications-of-iot/\">keep software safe</a> at all times.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/27/new-privacy-and-security-laws-of-states-explained-how-to-get-your-business-ready/\">New Privacy and Security Laws of States Explained – How to Get Your Business Ready</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:00:25 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/w-Privacy-and-Security-Laws-of-States-Explained.jpg","linkMd5":"4e9542c43914780f47dbad31cbe90822","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-09-857_1e694ee254697343.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/w-Privacy-and-Security-Laws-of-States-Explained.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":38019,"destBytes":25420,"author":"Joseph Chukwube","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/w-Privacy-and-Security-Laws-of-States-Explained-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-11-338_415fa1aefb2c41fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879096},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"How Face AR Brings Confidence to Video Conferencing","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172261","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/16/how-face-ar-brings-confidence-to-video-conferencing/\" title=\"How Face AR Brings Confidence to Video Conferencing\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"face ar\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>We’re all different and we’re all human beings, individuals locked in a body. The only way we can understand each other is by communicating. If only it were that simple. It’s hard enough in real life, but even more difficult with digital communication, especially the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/03/8-tech-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019/\">near-ubiquitous video conferencing</a>. Face AR technology can help us.</p>\n<p>We struggle to work out whether we trust someone when we’ve met them a few minutes earlier on a screen. We wonder whether the person enthusiastically talking to the camera thousands of miles away is pitching an idea they know very well is utter rubbish. Whether their poor performance in a job interview is a result of nerves. Whether our view of them and what they say is clouded by our deep prejudices.</p>\n<p>There is fear and embarrassment when<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/09/5-post-pandemic-changes-to-expect-in-the-workplace/\"> we turn on video conferencing</a>. Trust and empathy are harder to achieve. What is true; what is a lie? These contradictions make video conferencing an awkward chore rather than a useful tool to do business and hire talent. Yet video is essential to modern business when companies are spread over the globe.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_172266\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-172266\" style=\"width: 714px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-172266\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-900x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Feeling Confident During Your Video Calls With Face AR Technology.\" width=\"714\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-900x600.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-240x160.jpeg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-172266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Feeling Confident During Your Video Calls With Face AR Technology. <em>Image source: pexels.com</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Pressure on time, budgets and the planet mean traveling is harder to justify. That means making decisions, planning strategy, pitching for business, and hiring staff has to be done remotely. And it is not working.</p>\n<p>That, I believe, is about to change. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/tag/augmented-reality/\">Augmented Reality</a> (AR) may well provide the answers. But beware. In the future, you will probably get hired through AR. You can also get fired by it.</p>\n<h2><b>Never ready for our close-up</b></h2>\n<p>With all the pressure described above, it’s hardly surprising that the seemingly innocuous sentence, “So shall we switch video conferencing on?” makes even the most hard-bitten executives wince.</p>\n<p>For all of us, bar the least self-aware and the most annoyingly attractive, audio-only seems the sensible solution for long-distance conferencing.</p>\n<p>But why are we coy about video calls? The answer is a bitter experience. First, the cameras present us in harsh, bright light, at unusual angles, blown up on a PC screen.</p>\n<p>Second, people can see the background &#8212; not good if you haven&#8217;t tidied your desk/home office/spare bedroom. Not to mention children, cats and dogs stumbling into view.</p>\n<p>We might have chuckled at the plight of Professor Robert Kelly, whose BBC interview was famously interrupted by an inquisitive toddler, but what made it car-crash viewing was knowing how easily a similar calamity could happen to us.</p>\n<p>Concerns about <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/23/live-long-and-prosper-tech-can-ensure-we-do/\">how we present ourselves</a> make us so nervous that we don&#8217;t articulate our thoughts as fluently and accurately as we might. It’s hard enough if you have a job with the company. What if this is your job interview? Multinationals hire around the world and applicants can expect to be interviewed by people in multiple international locations.</p>\n<h2><b>Looking good for the 9 am thanks to Face AR</b></h2>\n<p>Banuba labs, the company of which I am a Managing Director, has devoted much research to solving these problems. And they are eminently fixable. For most people, the key issue is controlled. If they can present themselves digitally in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/the-modern-workplace-demands-better-visibility/\">the way they want to be perceived</a>, rather than be a slave to the idiosyncrasies of the camera, they will be relaxed and engaging.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_172264\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-172264\" style=\"width: 714px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-172264\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-900x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera\" width=\"714\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-900x600.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-240x160.jpeg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-172264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Looking good in front of the camera. Image source: pexels.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Here is where Face AR, an augmented-reality technology that enables its users to finesse their image via a camera, can prove to be a lifesaver. Video Face Beautification technology can tweak video-conference participants’ images in sophisticated ways.</p>\n<p>On a basic level, this can be by adjusting the lighting and slight face enhancements. It is useful for everyone. From people who need to make video calls but don’t have the time to apply make-up, to those of us who just want a shinier, smarter version of ourselves.</p>\n<p>As for the background of your room – by using video background changer technology you can now easily hide it for privacy purposes or change it for entertainment.</p>\n<h2><b>Make it avatar to avatar with Face AR</b></h2>\n<p>If you are still not convinced, then how about replicating yourself in an avatar? You can talk to an avatar (who is a real person) and be an avatar yourself, and feel both comfortable and human.</p>\n<p>What about the customary handshakes that open and close<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/02/27/modern-day-sales/\"> all business conversations or interviews</a>? AR representations of people’s tracked hands could act as a personal way to make first impressions or end on a high after a lengthy discussion. Even if the technology isn’t quite there to feel someone’s touch via this type of software, it will surely function as a good icebreaker before commencing a conversation.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_172267\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-172267\" style=\"width: 271px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face_ar_avatar.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-172267\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face_ar_avatar-198x300.gif\" alt=\"Creating your own avatar with Face AR.\" width=\"271\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face_ar_avatar-198x300.gif 198w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face_ar_avatar-106x160.gif 106w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-172267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Creating your avatar with Face AR. Image source: banuba.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h2><b>Pity the poor job applicant</b></h2>\n<p>The fear and awkwardness engendered by the current generation of video conferencing are bad enough for staff, but it is much worse for job applicants. Even the greatest technology companies admit they have hiring problems.</p>\n<p>Google has made huge efforts to change its staff demographics, but the numbers remain steadfastly in favor of Caucasian men, with nearly 70 percent male and 53 percent white, according to its 2018 diversity report. One Google staffer notoriously claimed in an internal memo that the lack of female engineers was down to biological differences rather than discrimination.</p>\n<p>Google is not alone. If we are honest, we would all admit that we tend to hire in our image. We find it easier to empathize with people like us. We also tend to hire people who are outgoing, confident and speak well. Clever introverts miss out.</p>\n<p>Again, Face AR has a solution. And it is one that is not possible with face-to-face interviews. Face AR can remove or disguise all background information. That could include race, age, gender, voice, general facial expression and nervous ticks. It would truly be a blind interview.</p>\n<p>Only then would it be possible to hire purely based on talent, imagination, intelligence and character. It might sound an extreme approach, but it is clear that diversity policies are failing to change the demographics of our great companies.</p>\n<p>If brands are to be truly representative of their <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/16/8-best-digital-marketing-strategies-small-businesses-should-implement/\">global audiences</a>, then they must start again. Technology makes that possible.</p>\n<p>So you really can be hired by augmented reality. But get it wrong and you could be fired by augmented reality, too.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/16/how-face-ar-brings-confidence-to-video-conferencing/\">How Face AR Brings Confidence to Video Conferencing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 18:01:08 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1.jpeg","linkMd5":"60ed08339fe2b495954a6ce31a9c1048","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-19-514_52179433ca98b853.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":59574,"destBytes":50474,"author":"Vadim Nekhai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Face-AR-Brings-Confidence-to-Video-Conferencing-1-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-16-460_3f978437d306343d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pexels-photo-3762940-900x600.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-208_957d43e5ef9eecb2.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Looking_good_in_front_of_the_camera-900x600.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-891_eb8295ec9efa4994.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face_ar_avatar-198x300.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-17-278_13f48fdaf865f24c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872099},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Giftsuite Boxes: Curated Special Edition Box that Promotes Calmness","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173591","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/08/giftsuite-boxes-curated-special-edition-box-that-promotes-calmness/\" title=\"Giftsuite Boxes: Curated Special Edition Box that Promotes Calmness\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-12.12.35-PM-300x300.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-12.12.35-PM-300x300.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-12.12.35-PM-718x719.png 718w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-12.12.35-PM-160x160.png 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-12.12.35-PM.png 1052w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>There are so many gift companies that now make it easy to find something unique to thank a client or colleague as well as recognize a talented individual on your team.

That’s thanks to its compelling combination of intelligent cognition, edge computing, and autonomous capabilities. While IoT on its own is no doubt powerful, connected networks can only take things so far even when performing at peak. When AI is brought into the same picture, things get a serious upgrade.</p>\n<p>IoT is already well established and still set to grow, with more than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-report\">41 billion IoT devices</a> in use by 2027. What’s more, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ai-trends-for-enterprise-computing/\">Gartner predicts</a> that more than 80 percent of enterprise IoT projects will include an AI component by 2022. But just why is such widespread adoption on the cards?</p>\n<h3>Imagine if your IoT-powered infrastructure could run with the ability to self-repair.</h3>\n<p>Think, not only self-repair, but having the ability to apply predictive maintenance, and adjust to external variables automatically. AI promises to offer these gains due to its ability to analyze the vast amounts of real-time data gathered by IoT devices and make autonomous, intelligent decisions based on this data.</p>\n<p>AIoT holds the potential to drive productivity and efficiency for any enterprise that employs IoT technology. AIoT is also expected to be particularly transformative for manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and robotics. Let’s explore what happens to these industries when AI fuses with IoT.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Ahead of the Manufacturing Curve with AIoT</h2>\n<p>Smart factories and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/07/iot-ecosystem-creates-an-optimized-smart-warehouse/\">warehouses</a> were some of the earliest adopters of IoT technologies. The World Economic Forum already identified over 1000 smart factories in <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/07/scaling-intelligent-manufacturing-10-factories-leading-the-way-in-innovation/\">2018</a>. However, as more production plants and factories join the trend, the competitive edge they hold diminishes.</p>\n<p>AI is pegged to deliver the next competitive advantage for organizations that already have their IoT infrastructure in place. AIoT will further enhance the capabilities of factory devices such as remote sensors, smart meters, and production machines as they can process the vast amounts of data and allow devices to react to their environment intelligently. Such changes enable products to reach the market more quickly, production lines to automatically respond to external market demand and offer new business insights from the operational data.</p>\n<h4>Take the regular IoT setup &#8212; and add in AI.</h4>\n<p>With an IoT setup, machinery can send automatic service updates to the system so that maintenance repairs can be scheduled. With the addition of AI, this process becomes fully automated. The computer systems will place orders for the parts required and the scheduling set up.</p>\n<h4>Nokia production &#8211;Finland.</h4>\n<p>Nokia’s production site in Oulu, Finland saw productivity <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2019/07/03/nokias-digitalization-of-its-5g-oulu-factory-recognized-by-the-world-economic-forum-as-an-advanced-4th-industrial-revolution-lighthouse/\">increase by 30%</a> and they’re now able to bring products to market 50% more quickly. A whole-digital approach combined with cutting-edge technology such as digital twins and intelligent automation made this possible.</p>\n<h4>Farming specialists prime additions.</h4>\n<p>The German digital farming specialists <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190807005185/en/BASF-Ontera-Collaborate-Precision-Diagnostics-Support-Farmers\">BASF teamed forces with Ontera inc</a> to create an intelligent feedback system that adjusts directly in line with agricultural needs. The project uses computer vision to monitor crop and climate conditions which are fed back to the plant. If signs of pest damage or vitamin deficiency are detected, the plant will tailor the formula accordingly. The formula ensures the crops receive only the formulas they require at that point in time, reduces the production of unnecessary treatments, and helps to improve overall crop yield.</p>\n<h2>AIoT fuels the era of autonomy</h2>\n<p>Autonomy is another key deliverable promised to organizations that adopt IoT in their digital transformation strategies.</p>\n<p>Many public and private buildings have been keen to adopt the power of IoT to improve their operational systems and allow for real-time service adjustments. Smart heating systems are one example of how this trend is taking shape.</p>\n<p>AIoT helps to monitor variables such as weather, pollution levels, or the number of workers in specific locations and auto-adjust devices across the building. Knowing the exact occupancy numbers improves conditions for the users of the building, prevents unnecessary energy consumption, and lays the groundwork for predictive analytics.</p>\n<p>Toronto-based Ecobee uses a range of AI-powered smart thermostats that continually readjust based on incoming real-time data from occupancy and humidity sensors, exterior temperature readings, and predictions based on prior user behavior patterns. Ecobee&#8217;s latest feature even connects the system to time-in-use energy pricing that allows the AI model to prioritize energy usage when it&#8217;s cheapest.</p>\n<p>When talking about the future of AIoT, we touch on autonomous vehicles. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/disruptive-trends-that-will-transform-the-auto-industry\">McKinsey predicts</a> that up to 15% of all cars will be autonomous by 2030. AI provides data to the control system so that vehicles respond to objects, control speed, and change direction accurately.</p>\n<p>In the autonomous vehicles use case, pre-existing AI will fuse with new <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/23/for-self-driving-systems-infrastructure-and-industry-efficiency-are-everything/\">IoT infrastructures</a> to help cars stay up to date with traffic patterns, road closures and weather conditions in real time. The more connected devices that are built into traffic and municipal infrastructures, the stronger the benefits &#8211; such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-iot-will-play-an-important-role-in-traffic-management-for-smart-cities/\">reduced traffic</a> &#8211; are set to become a reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/internet-of-things/iot-platform/iot-ecosystem/partners/veoneer\">Ericsson and Veoneer</a> partnered to develop a connected vehicle cloud to support the widespread adoption of this technology. The partnership will deliver vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity to ensure every autonomous vehicle on the road has the latest real-time data. Cloud-technology processes this data with minimal latency.</p>\n<h2>How Robotics is Enhanced with AIoT</h2>\n<p>The robotic sector as a whole saw significant growth in 2019, with investments of <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/robotics-investments-recap-june-2019/\">$1.1 billion</a> in June alone. As with human intelligence, our external environment influences the decisions we make. Robots with real-time AIoT at their fingertips make smarter decisions and one step closer to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wiredinsider/2018/11/key-better-robotics-aiot/\">realistic intelligence</a>.</p>\n<p>Delivery robots like those made by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus\">Starship Technologies</a> are a familiar sight in many cities and help brands deliver consumer and commercial goods quickly and reliably. These robots already rely on the power of IoT to help them navigate and reach their destinations. Now, companies are exploring how AI could help these robots communicate with customers using natural language processing. As home delivery services continue to increase in popularity, robots are extremely likely to grow alongside this trend.</p>\n<p>AIoT is also poised to make <a href=\"https://www.robotics.org/blog-article.cfm/Robotic-Surgery-The-Role-of-AI-and-Collaborative-Robots/181\">surgical robots</a> even more helpful. Smart operating theatres are connected to medical devices, real-time imaging, and patient health data. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/15/decoding-the-future-trajectory-of-healthcare-with-ai/\">Surgical robots</a> can use this data to adjust decisions during delicate surgeries to improve patient outcomes.</p>\n<h2>The next level of productivity and precision</h2>\n<p>The power of AI is, at times, limited by the amount of readily available data for the algorithms to train, detect patterns and make predictions. As industries continue to adopt the benefits of IoT, and the number of connected devices grows, so too does the potential of AI.</p>\n<p>AIoT takes advantage of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/15/3-programming-languages-offering-better-support-for-iot-development/\">vast pools of data</a> that are available in these connected environments to make smarter autonomous decisions and more accurate predictive analysis. Overall this helps organizations increase their productivity, create more efficient processes and even improve overall customer experience.</p>\n<p>While industries more traditionally associated with hardware, such as manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, are early adopters of this technology, any industry that incorporates IoT in their processes could benefit from the same productivity boosts that AIoT promises.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/07/these-three-industries-are-about-to-be-hit-by-aiot/\">These Three Industries are About to be Hit by AIoT</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 07 Jun 2020 15:00:04 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/These-Three-Industries-are-About-to-be-Hit-by-AIoT.jpg","linkMd5":"ac0e6ee4450a719d470e70aa5acb2fd2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-20-511_e7c30d592f86a4ae.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/These-Three-Industries-are-About-to-be-Hit-by-AIoT.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":58664,"destBytes":54780,"author":"Przemek Lopaciuk","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/These-Three-Industries-are-About-to-be-Hit-by-AIoT-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-18-463_79ed09e8ff338c9e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876918},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"The Secret Behind Every Bestselling eBook","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173239","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/30/the-secret-behind-every-bestselling-ebook/\" title=\"The Secret Behind Every Bestselling eBook\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Secret-Behind-Every-Bestselling-eBook-300x210.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"bestselling ebook\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Secret-Behind-Every-Bestselling-eBook-300x210.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Secret-Behind-Every-Bestselling-eBook-900x629.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Secret-Behind-Every-Bestselling-eBook-229x160.jpg 229w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Secret-Behind-Every-Bestselling-eBook.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>With so many writers out there and books getting published left and right, it is only natural to believe that the competition for a book becoming a bestseller must be fierce. However, we’re here to tell you that if you follow the right guidelines and take the right steps, the road to getting that &#8220;bestseller&#8221; tag in front of your book on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/11/14/amazon-kindle-update-sharing-caring/\">Kindle</a> is still achievable.</p>\n<h3>Back in the day, publishing a book always used to be in publishers’ favor.</h3>\n<p>It was up to them what they want to publish, how they market, and which books they take towards the best-seller market. A lot of politics went into this, and a lot of money exchanged hands as well.</p>\n<p>Amazon eliminated that trend by giving YOU the power. Now, everything from writing to publishing to setting prices and becoming a bestseller is in your hands. Amazon also broke down the &#8220;bestseller&#8221; tag and assigned it to niches, i.e. bestselling fiction, bestselling autobiography, etc. thus <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/03/how-to-get-maximum-social-media-exposure-by-scheduling-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">giving writers a better chance at earning that tag</a>.</p>\n<p>The revenue of the eBook industry stands at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/213/100/ebooks/worldwide#market-users\">$15.7 billion in 2020</a>, rising by 6.2% each year. At the same time, there are over 1.02 billion readers worldwide growing at a whopping 8% per annum. Around 8 million readers every year.</p>\n<h3>How can you become a bestseller and stand out from the crowd?</h3>\n<p>Here, we’ll explain in detail how you can do that, all the way from writing an eBook or getting one written, editing it, publishing and marketing in a way as to enjoy the esteemed bestseller badge to the fullest. If you’re wondering, apart from satiating the ego, the tag really does make a difference in terms of sales.</p>\n<h2>The Secrets Behind Every Bestselling eBook</h2>\n<p>These eBooks don’t fall from the sky, nor is there a spirit guiding bestselling authors about what to write and what not to write about. Every bestselling author started right where you are; in front of a screen, contemplating whether their idea is worth it or not.</p>\n<p>Here is what you need to do to craft the perfect eBook.</p>\n<h2>Decide on Your Niche</h2>\n<p>Deciding where your niche is, is where you will decide which way you’ll lean in your writing, and what category of ‘bestsellers’ you will be recognized in.</p>\n<p>When you are deciding your niche, it&#8217;s as simple as choosing a class in a <a href=\"https://www.lemans.org/en/24-hours-of-le-mans\">24 Hours of Le Man’s race</a>. Choose the fastest, most competed for niche.   Think: prototypes in Le Man’s talk and Fantasy in eBooks, or the C class, slower cars where there is competition, but it’s not as fierce. These are autobiographies and children’s books.</p>\n<p>You can go all-in and try your luck in numerous or all categories if you’re really confident about your idea. Make a decision here and stick to it. Changing genres from fantasy horror to crime thriller mid-writing is one of the worst things you can do to your eBook.</p>\n<p>Remember, sticking to one niche means you’re not only competing with fewer authors &#8212; but you also get more authority. You get recognized for one niche, which is better. Would you rather be a jack of all or a master of one?</p>\n<h2>Cover the Bases – Lay Out Your Idea &#38; Start on a Draft</h2>\n<p>You have a perfect idea. From the flawless introduction to the storyline, climax and perhaps, the end. Or you might be missing out on a few parts? Whatever the case, you need to pen it down and see how it feels.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, an idea feels like the best one out there, but when you put it to paper, it’s not that magical. A lot of thought and strategy goes into making any idea become the best one, and the first step in doing so is fleshing the idea out.</p>\n<p>Right now, it’s not about making sure it’s well-written and error-free – It’s all about you and your idea.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you should do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>L</strong><strong>ist our ideas</strong>. Write at least three different variants of your book. Make a rough abstract, include a climax and an ending. The more passionate you are about a given idea, the easier it will be to churn out words and finish. Read through each one, or have a friend do it for you &#8211; friends, if possible. Plural. Follow the most popular one.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose one, and formulate an outline.</strong> Once you’ve finalized a candidate, make a detailed outline. Try to keep it as neat as possible. As if this is the final draft (it isn&#8217;t, but still). This will motivate you to make a draft that you will be able to follow later on – a &#8220;stencil&#8221; of sorts.</li>\n<li>Now, it’s just time to fill in the blanks. This is a long and gruesome task – and you’ll also get to meet one of our writers’ best friends; <strong>writers’ block</strong>. You can also choose to hire eBook writing services for that if you feel like you don’t have the time to write your book. Just make sure it’s a trustworthy writing service – not a freelance eBook writer where there is a chance of someone stealing your intellectual property.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, that “bestseller” banner only comes if you keep your readers happy and they leave good reviews. And even then, no matter your sales or the tag, it won’t save you negative reviews.</p>\n<h2>Edit Your eBook the Bestseller Way</h2>\n<p>It’s one thing to write the perfect eBook, it’s entirely another to edit it. Not as big a grind as writing, I’ll give you that &#8212; but it’s a beast to tackle in itself nonetheless. No, let me reiterate, it’s a <em>nightmare. </em></p>\n<p>If you look at some professional eBook writing services, you’ll see that they don’t expect writers to send perfect, error-free drafts every time. Instead, they have a team of editors who go through their work regularly.</p>\n<p>While there are numerous alternatives available out there for eBook publishing and marketing needs, editing is something that ends up being a major obstacle for many a writer. Seasoned editors usually have years of writing experience, thus know what exactly what to look for. Plus, the independent view also gives them an edge over first time eBook writers such as yourself – or even veteran writers at times.</p>\n<h3>You Can&#8217;t Edit Your Own Work</h3>\n<p>The prime reason behind why you can’t edit your own work is that you’re too close to your work. You editing your own work would be like a surgeon performing surgery on their family.</p>\n<p>Bestsellers usually leave editing to their agents or hire a third-party service to do that for them, or use online tools to root out grammatical mistakes. However, there are errors that go beyond what the eye can see.</p>\n<p>These include the story and semantic-related issues that online resources simply can’t cater to. Having said that, I would like to expand a little on my statement; editing your own eBook is <em>very </em>difficult; not an impossible feat.</p>\n<p>Here are some clever editing tricks to keep in mind when editing your own work. Doing so, you may be able to reduce the cost of an editor significantly if they’re charging you per edit. So, roll your sleeves up and let’s dive into your eBook together.</p>\n<h3>Take a Break</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes writers make (understandably) is to jump into editing right after they finish writing or the very next day. It is completely natural to want to publish your masterpiece the moment it’s done, but that is a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Your conscience might fight you over this, but wait a while after completion. Just set it aside, let it collect dust for at least a week. More, if possible. Just don’t let spiders make webs on it. Three weeks is more than enough.</p>\n<p>As you give it time, you start forgetting tiny details. If you start right away, these details are fresh in your mind and you unintentionally start skimming through the text, leaving behind a wide margin for error.</p>\n<p>As you start forgetting, you’ll look at the book with a <em>relatively </em>fresher set of eyes, thus highlighting mistakes even better. Remember, distance gives you perspective; and nothing is better at highlighting your mistakes than hindsight and perspective.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Try to Finish It in One Go</h3>\n<p>Even the most notable writer, Mark Twain, had his first book rejected by publishers and edited numerous times before getting published.</p>\n<p>Don’t be ashamed if there are edits. Go through your book slowly and take breaks every now and then to get a fresh perspective each time you come back.</p>\n<p>Remember, it’s an eBook, not an article. Grit to get over with editing and getting it published soon is one thing, leaving behind errors and typos is entirely another. Not only will it ruin your readers’ experience, but it will also be a major obstacle on your road to becoming a best-seller.</p>\n<p>Frankly, it’s embarrassing to have one of your readers point out a typo. A &#8220;friend&#8221; of mine learned that the hard way.</p>\n<p>I recommend going through your eBook at least <em>three</em> times, and taking your time each time if it’s your own. If it’s ghostwritten, reading it twice would be more than enough, highlighting any changes in your path. Put in comments and send the file back. Just remember not to overedit.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, cater to story elements. Look for any plot holes, misalignments, discontinuations, change in characters or genders, or other such problems. If you find any typos, fix them but don’t focus too much on them.</li>\n<li>In the second run, focus on grammar. This is where you fix every typo, put in every punctuation mark, cross every “t” and dot every “i.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Your third read will be just to finalize it. You’re simply preparing it for your editor now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even if you go through your book a hundred times, you will find mistakes each time you go over it. Only a third-person can tell you whether your book is bestseller material or not.</p>\n<h3>Use Online Tools</h3>\n<p>Online tools aren’t the best alternative to hiring a professional editor, but they do help reduce the cost significantly. Here are some online companions that you can use to help sort out grammatical errors from your book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/\">Grammarly</a>: By far one of the most popular online editing software out there, Grammarly takes the cake not just in popularity but in versatility, compatibility and ease-of usage as well. Correcting mistakes with Grammarly is just a matter of clicking on its suggestions. However, you can only get the most out of this app if you purchase the paid version. Otherwise, the edits are mostly grammatical.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\">Hemingway App</a>: The fiercest competitor Grammarly has as of yet, Hemmingway stands tall as the <em>free </em>editing tool that has been a friend of many a bestseller over the years. From grammatical mistakes to sentence structures and other mistakes, Hemingway is a great tool for all. The web version is free with more features than Grammarly’s free version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://paperfellows.com/college-paper-writers\">Paper Writers</a>: This is not an online tool, per se, but a ‘forum’ of sorts where you can share your manuscript with other aspiring writers and readers. You can ask them to go through your manuscript and make edits. They act as an extra pair of eyes, for those of you who need them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don’t Overedit – It’s the Bane of Many a Writer</h3>\n<p>Editing is for a manuscript what seasoning is for a meal. It can either make your eBook shine and leave your readers wanting more, or make it bland and tasteless. However, just as adding too much salt, sugar or spice can ruin a perfect dish, over-editing can do the same to your manuscript.</p>\n<p>Publishing without editing is a definite possibility, but let me ask you; when was the last time you heard about a best-seller that had typos in it? Or plot holes?</p>\n<p>Yes, these books sell, and sometimes they sell well too, but you can’t go as far as saying that they’re best sellers. The same goes for an overediting manuscript. And when editing your eBook yourself, this is one of the most common problems that you could face.</p>\n<p>As you go over your story, you are bound to see some errors and you’ll fix them too. However, in the next run, you might feel that it didn’t need to be changed in the first place, change it in the next read, revert it again and so on. That’s you overediting.</p>\n<p>This usually happens if you sit with your manuscript too long &#8211; you start seeing issues where there are none. You’ll even see plot holes where the story makes perfect sense! Remember, just as you see others’ pastures greener than yours, they are going to see your grass greener than theirs.</p>\n<p>Edit your book once, twice, or thrice at most and then leave it. If you still feel there are problems with it, give it to someone else. Accept that you can’t do it yourself. That’s the bestseller’s way of editing.</p>\n<h2>Marketing Your eBook, the Best-Seller Way</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve edited your eBook to the best of your ability, it’s time to give it to a professional. While they work their magic, the figurative rule of eBook thumbs dictates that you start marketing your eBook.</p>\n<p>As they say, make hay while the sun shines.</p>\n<p>While the book’s idea is fresh in your head, start writing social media posts, creating Facebook banners, YouTube videos, pamphlets to distribute, texts to send to friends and family, and more. Start showcasing your eBook and prepare material for once the book gets published.</p>\n<p>Remember, if your story idea is even the slightest bit different than what’s out there in the market, and you’ve got the book edited right, the only thing that stands in your way toward becoming a bestseller is marketing.</p>\n<p>Once your book is published, if it’s successful you won’t get the time to focus on writing promotional stuff. So create content not just for now but for the future as well.</p>\n<p>Now, focus on building anticipation. In the future, tell readers <em>why </em>they need to buy your book instead of telling them what they’re waiting for. Here are some tips to help you market your book the bestseller way before it’s even done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posting <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/12/using-nano-influencers-to-promote-your-brand-on-social-media/\">social media posts</a> about your book.\n<ul>\n<li>Include tips and tricks</li>\n<li>Tell them what they’ll get</li>\n<li>Give them some value</li>\n<li>Make them think that they’re learning something new from the promotional content, how good will the book be?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Post regular updates about the book’s progress – incorporate a countdown, if you can</li>\n<li>Make a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/28/4-video-lead-generation-strategies-for-more-engagement/\">&#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; video or blog post</a></li>\n<li>Tell your followers about the challenges you had to face when writing – no need to mention your freelance writers or the eBook writing services you hired if any</li>\n<li>Create an event on Google and social media</li>\n<li>Engage your audience with questions and giveaways</li>\n<li>Plan and schedule interviews</li>\n<li>Plan and schedule book signings. Use <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/l/print-on-demand\">Amazon’s Print of Demand Service</a> to your advantage. That’s a bestseller move that builds anticipation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Publishing Like Bestsellers – Print or eBook?</h2>\n<p>You’re not just publishing for the sake of publishing, you’re doing it to win. You’re looking to become a bestseller &#8212; so your marketing and publishing medium needs to reflect that. As you saw above, the marketing phase will be much more aggressive and writing will be more quality-intensive.</p>\n<p>Now comes the hard part; print or eBook?</p>\n<p>If your goal is to climb the New York Times bestseller list, you need to go with ‘print’ publishing. However, coming from NYT bestsellers, the tag is more hype and glamor than being actually more useful than Amazon’s bestseller tag.</p>\n<p>However, if making a passive income for yourself is what you’re really after, Amazon’s bestselling author tag is what you need. Plus, where you need to wait at least 6 to 12 months for the NYT bestseller tag, you only need a few weeks to become Amazon’s bestseller.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you choose to get your book printed, you will have to look for a publisher, sign a deal with them and give away a hefty share of your royalties as well. Though you do get to enjoy a <em>slightly </em>higher status, consider how hard it is to get accepted by these publishers.</p>\n<p>But if we come down to brass tacks, the process of getting a deal from one of the big publishers out there is unnecessarily complicated. Amazon has presented people with a good alternative, and sales aren’t any less for eBooks compared to physical books, especially in 2020.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you look at the total traffic volume on eBook selling platforms and sales during the first three months of COVID-19 lockdown, you’ll see that people are actually buying more eBooks than printed books! And we don’t mean digital copies of physical books, but actual, self-published eBooks.</p>\n<p>The following graph shows how the lockdown has increased the number of visits to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112583/covid-19-impact-books-e-commerce-site-traffic-global/\">1.51 billion</a> in March 2020, from January’s 1.34 billion. As visits have grown, so have the number of books sold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112583/covid-19-impact-books-e-commerce-site-traffic-global/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173241 \" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-3.png\" alt=\"Graph depicting the number of visits to eBook selling platforms due to the lockdowns\" width=\"614\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-3.png 1124w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-3-300x187.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-3-900x562.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-3-256x160.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Wear Your Sunglasses Because It’s Time to Become a Bestseller</h2>\n<p>Now that you’ve published your eBook on whatever medium you choose, wait. It’s just a matter of time before you get an email congratulating you on your success. However, just because you’ve clicked the publish button and money has started rolling in, it doesn’t mean you can stop marketing.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/refocusing-media-operations-during-pandemic-long-term-growth/\">that is what will drive sales</a> and get you past the finish line &#8212; and that is where most published authors stop putting in the effort.</p>\n<p>Don’t be like those writers. You set out to be a bestseller &#8212; don’t quit before that. Keep on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/how-to-tap-into-the-power-of-organic-marketing/\">posting promotional content</a>, keep on responding to reviews, and most importantly, be active on social media.</p>\n<p>You might be inclined to start working on your second book at that point, but that is not what bestsellers do unless they have a launch team driving sales as they continue working. If you’re cutting costs, just jot down your idea somewhere like you did for this book and put it aside.</p>\n<p>That book can wait – it hasn&#8217;t even crossed anyone’s mind yet. Focus on what’s out there. Put your efforts into marketing and you shall reap the rewards for it.</p>\n<p>Don’t get up every day and get depressed because someone else holds the Amazon bestseller tag. Remember Amazon doesn’t have just <em>one </em>bestseller, but quite a few at the same time. Just keep an eye on the market and current trends, and if a book similar to yours gets popular instead of your own, you’re in luck.</p>\n<p>Use what we in the business call &#8220;second-hand marketing.&#8221; Target people who read that book. You can find them in the review section of Amazon or perhaps on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/\">Goodreads</a>. Tell them via email or social media that since they liked that book, you think they’ll like this one too.</p>\n<p>Just try to be nice about it. If they’re not interested, don’t trust your book onto them. It’s a bit of a trial and error game, but you’ll get the hang of it eventually. If you’re nice about it, people will be inclined to leave a positive review as well. And word of mouth <em>sells</em>. Unlike any other form of marketing &#8212; sales by word of mouth is what you want.</p>\n<p>Here’s how many books you need to sell to become a bestseller:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New York Times</strong>: 9,000 copies</li>\n<li><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong>: 3,000 books</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Depends on books being sold in your category</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last category is why, if you’re publishing an eBook on Amazon, you need to be careful about what niche or category you’re choosing. Try to choose one with the least competition. But if you have written or gotten an exceptional eBook Ghostwritten from professionals or freelance eBook writers, the competition won’t even matter.</p>\n<p>If you have applied any of the tips we mentioned above, or perhaps all of them, congratulations. You’re on the right path towards becoming a bestseller. If you haven’t, we hope our guide was of some use to you.</p>\n<p>If you think we missed out on something or want to pitch in your two cents, get in touch with us down in the comments.

Even if you’ve never heard of SEO, you’ve likely conducted an identical search query on multiple occasions and gotten strangely different results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The goal of Google search (</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2010/04/07/search_engines_in_march_ask_continues_to_grow_-_bi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and other search engines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) is to provide you with the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/how-to-tap-into-the-power-of-organic-marketing/\">best possible results on the web</a> for a given query. So is it reasonable to think that the “best possible” website for your query changes on a regular basis?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe—but let’s take a deeper look at what makes search engine rankings so volatile.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Basics: How Search Rankings Are Calculated</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To understand why search rankings are volatile, you first have to understand how search rankings are calculated. Google works much like other search engines, and it’s the dominant competitor in the search engine market, so we’ll use it as our main example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google starts by putting together an index of websites and pages throughout the web. If the internet is every book ever written, the index is a kind of properly organized library, where the correct book and correct page can be found relatively easily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When a user inputs a query, Google attempts to bring that user the best possible results in its search engine results pages (SERPs). To do that, it needs to provide results that are both contextually relevant and trustworthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contextually relevant content is chosen based on</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/02/volumetric-video-is-becoming-a-key-content-for-vr/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the type of content it is</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and its relationship to the initial query. For example, if you search for something like “tech startups,” you’ll want to find actual tech startups or articles about them, rather than content about hot dog stands or water balloons. This seems obvious, but coding a machine to determine relevance is more complex than it first appears.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be trustworthy, a website needs to prove that it’s a reliable resource for others. The easiest way to do this is to <a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-t55tp-8bc1136\">earn many high-quality links</a> from other trusted publishers; the number and quality of links you have will directly increase your authority, helping you rank higher. This is why so many brands rely on an outside</span><a href=\"https://seo.co/link-building-services/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> link building service for SEO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to increase their authority and climb the ranks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With this understanding, why is it that search rankings change so frequently?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many explanations.</span></p>\n<p><b>Search Engine Algorithm Updates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, you have to think about search engine algorithm updates. Google’s ranking algorithm isn’t a stagnant swath of code; it’s something that evolves on a regular basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout Google’s first decade of existence, the algorithm went through some massive changes. Webmasters and content creators were quick to try and game the system, manipulating their content and spamming links as black hat tactics to improve their rankings. To combat this, Google refined its parameters for what it considered to be “quality” content. In the early 2010s, a series of major updates named after animals (Panda, Penguin, and Hummingbird, to be exact) helped establish better standards for content evaluation, link evaluation, and query interpretation, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since then, Google has introduced a high number of smaller, yet impactful updates. In fact, there were thousands of micro-updates in 2018 alone. Google is notoriously tight-lipped about these updates and how they function; in fact, sometimes it denies having issued an update at all. However, through data analysis, search optimizers can figure out the gist of the new update.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New updates can do a lot of things. They can refine how Google evaluates content; if your best content suddenly doesn’t look so impressive, you might fall in rankings. They can refine how Google evaluates links; if any of your inbound links are considered to have higher or lower authority, it can impact your site’s overall authority. They can also change how they analyze user queries, affecting your likelihood of being</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/08/customer-relationships-the-benefits-of-using-crm-software-for-startups/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">deemed “relevant” to your customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. They can even add new features, changing what an SERP looks like, or introducing new content entries that compete with yours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Almost any change, even a minor one, can affect the global landscape of search rankings. And because updates are so frequent, it’s only natural that search rankings get shaken up on a regular basis. Fortunately, most updates are small, and many of them only impact certain industries or types of sites, so it’s not a total free-for-all.</span></p>\n<p><b>Content Updates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Search rankings also change because the content on the web is changing. Remember, if you’re constantly updating your site with technical changes, new content, and new inbound links, there are likely thousands, if not millions of people like you doing the same things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The internet is a complex tapestry that’s constantly changing. Every time someone enters a new search query, Google is forced to consider a completely new set of circumstances. Did a link from a new, high-authority source finally push your competitor past you in terms of authority? Did you come out with a new blog post that’s more interesting or more relevant than the content that came before it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When combined with the sheer frequency of updates to Google’s search algorithm, it’s plain to see why there are so many disruptions in search rankings.</span></p>\n<p><b>Other Factors to Consider</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Updates and new content aren’t the only factors to consider when it comes to search engine volatility, of course. There’s also:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">         </span><b>Personalization. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google has increasingly dedicated attention to personalizing its search results, using factors like demographic information, location information, and previous searches to tailor its search results. Accordingly, if you conduct two identical searches at different times of day, or in different places, you might end up with surprisingly different results.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">         </span><b>Machine learning.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Some of Google’s latest updates, including RankBrain,</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/06/machine-learning-software-testing/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">have machine learning elements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that help them “learn” and automatically update on their own. RankBrain, for example, is constantly learning how people search, so it can better understand the context for long user queries. Google isn’t manually pushing updates here, so it’s only natural that it’s responsible for sudden and frequent changes—especially for long-tail keyword queries.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">         </span><b>New features.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Google’s updates sometimes introduce new features that change the layout of SERPs. For example, you might have noticed that Google often answers your queries directly with “rich answers,” helping you forgo the need to click a link to find the answer yourself.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">         </span><b>Index updates.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The index Google uses to rank queries is also frequently refreshing. New content isn’t instantly added to the index; it typically takes time to become available.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>How to Reduce Volatility</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re interested in ranking higher in search engines, you’ll likely be interested in reducing volatility. Is there a way to keep your rankings more consistent?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The short answer is no. It’s important to update your site regularly, adhering to new technological standards and introducing new content for your visitors, and those changes alone will impact how you rank. Even if you kept everything completely consistent, the sites you’re competing with would be adding new content and making changes daily, and Google would constantly be refining how it considers and ranks search results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That said, you can rest assured that Google’s motivations—to give users the best possible online experience—will remain consistent. As long as you’re making a genuine effort to make user experiences better, and provide them with the content they want to see, you should be capable of steadily increasing your rankings.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Future of Volatility in Search Rankings</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google has gone from introducing occasional, major overhauls to its search algorithm to releasing a constant stream of smaller tweaks as updates. Accordingly, we can assume Google is satisfied with the way its algorithm works, and the future will be mostly geared toward making small, gradual improvements.

Most people use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/22/evolution-of-speech-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">voice-recognition</a> on a regular basis, interacting with Siri, Alexa, or Cortana. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dti-conversational-commerce.pdf\">51%</a> of consumers are already using <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/25/how-voice-assistant-marketing-can-future-proof-your-brand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">voice-enabled virtual assistants</a> via a smartphone. Here is how voice technology is changing the financial industry.</p>\n<h2>Voice-enabled devices are to save time, to make things easier, and to be more efficient.</h2>\n<p>When on the road, for example, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/24/3-ways-tech-startups-are-using-ai-to-revolutionize-customer-experience/\">consumers need a hands-free option</a>. While consumers are perfectly comfortable asking Alexa to play a new song or for the weather forecast, they are a bit more wary of using voice recognition with banking.</p>\n<h3>Financial institutions, however, have seen a lot of advancements with AI-powered voice technology.</h3>\n<p>Many are now pushing internal projects or partnering with fintech in order to offer more robust voice-activation services. And while this industry has the added challenge of consumer trust, this technology is truly taking off in this space.</p>\n<h2>Customer service is key.</h2>\n<p>One reason why voice technology has taken off in the banking sector is to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/09/banking-is-the-next-personal-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">improve customer service</a>. Thanks to machine learning, this technology can understand accents, slang, dialects, intonation, emphasis, and more, making it easier to interact with and faster to get questions answered.</p>\n<p>Customers are increasingly <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/10/reimagining-the-employee-experience-in-an-age-of-ai/\">frustrated with outdated technology</a> that either sends them to the wrong place or places them in long wait times. Financial institutions cannot afford to annoy their customers since the rise of fintech has created serious competition in this space.</p>\n<h4>Voice-driven customer service, therefore, is one key to keeping customers happy.</h4>\n<p>This technology can answer questions quickly and also understand if there is a particularly angry or upset customer that might need human assistance fast.</p>\n<p>Powered by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/does-artificial-intelligence-help-fight-financial-fraud/\">artificial intelligence and machine learning</a>, voice-recognition software does not necessarily replace human employees either. Instead, it serves as an automated support staff that can categorize calls, answer questions, and direct customers to the right place.</p>\n<h2>Hands-free banking.</h2>\n<p>Voice payments are starting to pick up as more consumers become comfortable with this type of banking. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-voice-payments-report-2017-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business Insider</a> notes that the adoption of voice payments is set to grow from 8% to 31% of US adults by 2022. The report noted that the factors fueling this growth are “an explosion of voice-enabled devices, generational gains in AI, and a strong consumer value proposition for voice payments.”</p>\n<h4>Currently, touchless payments are typically only used for small e-commerce transactions.</h4>\n<p>But this will likely change &#8212; as consumers will become more reliant on virtual assistants and more comfortable with biometrics in banking.</p>\n<p>Those who currently use voice payments can send money to friends via platforms such as Venmo, Square Cash, or PayPal. These customers use Alexa to make a purchase and conduct bank transactions such as paying a credit card or making a transfer.</p>\n<h4>The potential for voice payments is enormous.</h4>\n<p>Once consumers adopt the technology &#8212; the world of e-commerce will impact how consumers find and buy products. Voice technology creates a new payment method for consumers to use that is even easier than the “one-tap purchase” option.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming security barriers.</h2>\n<p>Financial institutions are much more risk-averse than other companies and for good reason. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/06/small-business-cybersecurity-threats-and-how-to-fix-the-fox/\">Security breaches</a> have far-reaching impacts beyond just frustrating customers. Given that, while <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/25/how-voice-assistant-marketing-can-future-proof-your-brand/\">voice technology is quickly evolving</a>, banks are less likely to launch these tools until they are fully secure.</p>\n<h3>Aside from ensuring the technology is sound, these companies will also have to convince the consumer that they are trustworthy.</h3>\n<p>Again, this is a more difficult task in this industry, where consumers are less likely to risk personal information being breached. Furthermore, any security problems will make consumers extremely unlikely to use this technology in the future.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/07/what-the-rise-of-blockchain-can-teach-the-regulatory-environment/\">new regulatory compliance</a> mandates for global banks. The European Union’s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/its-time-to-truly-consider-the-privacy-implications-of-iot/\">requires strong customer authentication</a> (SCA), will also have effects on voice-activated payments.</p>\n<h3>Security obstacles are certainly daunting in fintech.</h3>\n<p>Those who are typically less risk-averse, are moving quickly on this technology, pushing innovation forward. Since voice-payments are still nascent and have yet to be widely adopted, first to market platforms will have a distinct advantage.</p>\n<p>While the security stakes are high, the consumer demand for personalization and fast-acting technology will push financial institutions forward in this endeavor.</p>\n<p>As with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/a-web-developers-new-best-friend-is-the-ai-waiting-to-be-utilized/\">AI-powered chatbots</a>, consumers began to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/24/e-commerce-failures-and-mistakes-why-do-so-many-startups-fail/\">trust and rely on these features</a>, which means we can likely expect the same from voice technology.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Image Credit: Unsplash</em></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/how-voice-technology-is-changing-the-financial-industry/\">How Voice Technology is Changing the Financial Industry </a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:00:20 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-Voice-Technology-is-Changing-the-Financial-Industry-.jpeg","linkMd5":"5c2d2df109a3a00873ff371f94cee0c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-24-647_5e04418dbde2ed8d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-Voice-Technology-is-Changing-the-Financial-Industry-.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":40319,"destBytes":34104,"author":"Andres Abumohor","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-Voice-Technology-is-Changing-the-Financial-Industry--300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn24@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-10-860_3f382a7a9fd0630c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880518},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"Papalook PA452 PRO: Webcam with Mic for Livestream, Recording, and Chat","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175659","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/12/papalook-pa452-pro-webcam-with-mic-for-livestream-recording-and-chat/\" title=\"Papalook PA452 PRO: Webcam with Mic for Livestream, Recording, and Chat\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamVideo-300x286.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"PapalookWebcamVideo Webcam\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamVideo-300x286.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamVideo-755x719.jpg 755w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamVideo-168x160.jpg 168w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamVideo.jpg 1249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Remote work has definitely impacted how much time we now spend on everything from a video conference to video chat.

I need to get them to just plug, play, and do what I need them to do, which is what this webcam does for me.</p>\n<p>The price, which averages about $70, is very fair for all the clarity in sound and picture that it delivers. This makes it a great value for the investment. It is ideal for adding a great-looking video to your blog posts or to creating reviews or how-to videos for YouTube.</p>\n<p>If there was anything that I might change, it would be to change the LEDs to show me if the camera is actually active or not.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-175661 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamwithMic-900x675.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamwithMic-900x675.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamwithMic-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamwithMic-213x160.jpeg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PapalookWebcamwithMic.jpeg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>You get the webcam and user manual.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>You can buy the Papalook webcam from the company&#8217;s website.

But the urgent need to contain the outbreak shouldn’t cloud thinking about big data’s potential to do more harm than good. Here is how big data analytics address COVID-19 concern in the healthcare industry.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/10/02/how-big-data-is-improving-healthcare/\">Big data’s</a> blind spots could lead public health authorities astray, diverting critical resources from proven containment methods such as aggressive testing.</h3>\n<p>They could also lead to draconian restrictions that disproportionately impact the rights of those under- or misrepresented by the data. In Israel, the government’s cell phone location-tracking program has caused complaints that the authorities are erroneously confining people to their homes based on inaccurate location data.</p>\n<p>While the capacity of big data to help curb the coronavirus outbreak is, at best, uncertain, its risks to privacy are immense. Governments and companies have cited the anonymization of personal data as a key privacy safeguard, but multiple studies show that this may only delay rather than prevent the person’s re-identification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/iot-can-put-your-data-at-risk-heres-how/\">Location data is particularly vulnerable</a> since it can be combined with public and private records to create an intricate and revealing map of a person’s movements, associations, and activities.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impact of Big Data Analytics in Healthcare on COVID-19 Outbreak</strong></h3>\n<p>COVID-19 has arrived with consequences that are grave and unsettling. Big Data lies at the heart of efforts to comprehend and forecast the impact that Coronavirus will have on all of us.</p>\n<p>The near real-time COVID-19 trackers that continuously pull data from sources around the world are helping healthcare workers, scientists, epidemiologists and policymakers aggregate and synthesize incident data on a global basis.</p>\n<p>There has been some interesting data resulting from GPS analyses of population movement by region, city, etc., which ultimately helps provide a view of the population’s compliance &#8212; or <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/13/accessibe/\">lack of compliance</a> &#8212; with social-distancing mandates.</p>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/08/10-examples-of-how-to-use-data-to-pitch-press-during-covid-19/\">opportunities</a> to make the use of Big Data more impactful in situations like these as a society and as an industry, though no one yet been able to effectively leverage the power of Big Data in search of a cure.</p>\n<p>Ideas such as creating large scale COVID-19 Real World Evidence (RWE) studies that pull data from a variety of real-world sources — including patients now be treated in the hospital setting &#8212; could help accelerate the development of treatments in a more patient-centric and patient-friendly way.</p>\n<h3><strong>Global Big Data Analytics in Healthcare Industry Landscape</strong></h3>\n<p>According to Goldstein Market Intelligence research, the market size of big data analytics in the healthcare industry was valued at USD 16.90 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach USD 68.20 billion by 2025 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 18.6% over the <a href=\"https://www.goldsteinresearch.com/report/big-data-analytics-healthcare-industry-discrete-market-report\">forecast period</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on types of analytics type, the descriptive analytics segment is anticipated to account for the largest share of the big data healthcare analytics market and continue to dominate the big data analytics in the healthcare industry during the forecast period.</p>\n<p>Based on geography, North America is expected to dominate the market followed by Europe during the forecast period, due to a rise in advancements in IoT and an increase in the demand for analytical models on patient information for better service delivery, government policies.</p>\n<h4><strong>Substantial Upsurge in Demand for Financial Analytics in Healthcare is Driving The Global Big Data Analytics in Healthcare Industry</strong></h4>\n<p>Every day, people working with various organizations around the world are generating a massive amount of data.

Content with the right content strategy helps you build your brand, make it visible to your audiences, boost customer trust, increase conversion rate, and even close sales. But does this ‘king’ bring everyone the same profits? Here is your content strategy not working? Here are six reasons why.</p>\n<p>Today, we see every one creating content, and over <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">70%</a> of the marketers are even actively investing to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/20/how-to-scale-your-content-marketing/\">scale content marketing</a>. But the sad truth is &#8212; not all of these marketers are happy with the results they see.</p>\n<p><strong>In the majority of the cases, it is not the content that is to be blamed. It is rather the content strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>Despite putting in all the efforts to make the content work, many still see their content lost somewhere in the deep dark digital abyss.</p>\n<p>With minimal views, zero interaction, no engagement, and certainly no conversion, the dream of dominating the world with your content could instantly turn into a nightmare. But there is a ray of hope that will pull you out from failing at your content strategy.</p>\n<p>Here is a blog that will tell you the main reasons why your content strategy is failing and how you can fix the strategy to succeed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Because You Are Writing for the Bots and Not Humans</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes that most of the companies make when following a content strategy is that they focus too much on making their content rank than making it interesting. Google bots have become super smart and would automatically rank your content if it is loved by the people.</p>\n<p><strong> If your target audiences are not able to connect with what you write &#8212; it will be of no value to your company.</strong></p>\n<p>You will never be serving your target audience if you stuff your content with keywords, key phrases, and links.</p>\n<p>Check for your content strategy.</p>\n<p>Is it totally backed by keyword analysis and nothing else? Are you just churning out new content every other day to make sure your keywords rank?</p>\n<p>If that’s the case, your content strategy is never going to work. Here are some mistakes in your content strategy that are taking you down.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing just enough (300 words) to fulfill Google guidelines without covering the complete topic.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unnecessary stuffing the content with long and short tail keywords that make no sense to the reader.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hyperlinking the content with just the service or product rather than linking it to informative pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><i>Quick Fixing Tip:</i></b></p>\n<p>While writing content, you need to ensure that it is written with humans in mind and only optimized for search engines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create content that is catering to the needs of your readers and is still <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/26/5-seo-writing-tools-for-optimizing-your-content/\">optimized for search engines</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure it has at least <a href=\"https://99firms.com/blog/google-search-statistics/\">1,890</a> words. This way, it covers the complete topic and also makes Google web crawlers happy.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keywords are important. Place them strategically. Primary keyword once in the first paragraph, title, and URL.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid keyword stuffing yet ranking for the same, use LSI keywords to make your content look more natural.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Link your content but make sure it is linking to both internal and external pages that provide value to your readers.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Images are important to keep your reader entertained. You can use these images to gain ranking as well by adding Alt Tags and ensuring it ranks on Google images. When <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/25/how-to-create-top-performing-content-on-google-according-to-science/\">creating top-performing content on Google</a>, you also need to add images with Alt Tags in it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Because You are Scared of Experimenting with Content Forms</strong></h2>\n<p>In an age when you are surrounded by content in all forms, limiting your content strategy to just blogs and articles is a sin. You might have a full-blown content strategy in place with a content calendar that ensures your writers churn out content pieces and post them on your website or external platforms. However, it is 2020 and your target audiences have gone far beyond consuming content through just one means.</p>\n<p>Each business starts its content strategy from ‘having a blog page.’ And it is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/21/how-can-publishers-grow-traffic-after-the-latest-google-update/\">great as over 60% </a>of the businesses that acquired more customers had a blogging channel in place. But thinking that that’s enough is where you start failing.</p>\n<p>You need to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/personalizing-your-customer-service-with-6-strategies/\">study your buyer persona</a> and the stage they are in the buyer journey to offer them the required kind of content for a successful inbound marketing initiative as well.</p>\n<p>For example, a buyer in the awareness stage would like to have blogs and ebooks or guides around the topic. Those in the consideration stage might look for whitepapers, blogs on ‘tips’ or ‘best ways’, etc. And those in the decision stage of their journey would rather look for case studies, videos, industry reports in the niche.</p>\n<p>The mistake you are doing is that you are offering all types of buyers in all stages of their buyer journey with the same content. Neither are you looking at the buyer demographics nor on the stage of their journey to create customized content.</p>\n<p>If your content strategy is failing even in the times when content is the king, know that it is the time to diversify.</p>\n<h3><b>Quick Fixing Tip:</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to diversify your content strategy is by repurposing your content. This way, you don’t have to increase your team size to create all types of content. You simply need to repurpose the content that’s already available with you. In fact, <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/38-content-marketing-stats-that-every-marketer-needs-to-know/\">60%</a> of marketers use their one piece of content in two to five ways.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn your content into <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/22/7-dos-and-donts-for-app-preview-videos-if-you-want-a-shot-at-going-viral/\">different forms like videos,</a> podcasts, ebooks, pdfs, infographics, etc., to ensure it reaches audiences in the way they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/09/how-to-expand-your-business-through-multi-channel-marketing/\">consume their content</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for content that is already working with the audiences and update in to make it brand new. Add new pointers, create images, and make it eye-catchy, provide new examples, improve the layout, and much more to ensure it keeps the visitors engaged.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create videos from your engaging blogs</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make social media graphics to build your community of readers there</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer downloadable content in the form of pdfs, guides, whitepapers, etc.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transform your long-form content into ebooks and send them across to your clients</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a buzz among your audience by creating a post that talks about the best round-up posts.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have some really good information-rich content, create webinars from them to build your authority in the niche</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Because Your Competitors Already Dominate the Niche</strong></h2>\n<p>Your content is good, you are producing all types of content, and even promoting it right. Yet, you are not able to succeed with your content marketing. Why?</p>\n<p>Maybe because your competitors are way too strong.</p>\n<p>Yes, one of the main reasons why a majority of the businesses see their content strategy failing is because they are up against industry giants. Many times, businesses are doing nothing wrong, it’s just that they are in an industry or market that is already dominated by big names. In such situations, it is only human to feel that it is not much you can do. But giving up should never be the case.</p>\n<p>Think you cannot fight the saturated or dominated market? You can.</p>\n<h3><b>Quick Fixing Tip:</b></h3>\n<p>If you are also in an industry where your competitors have left no scope for you and no matter what you do, your content is still not working, here is what you can do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer problem-solving content to ensure that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/how-to-turn-your-sales-to-absolutely-what-you-want/\">your target audience</a> can rely on you for solutions</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be consistent with your content delivery and never back down. Slowly and steadily, you will reach the top.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with building a small niche group of followers with your content and start expanding it.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try the skyscraper method of creating content where you find the best piece of your competitor’s content and generate something even better.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look where they are lacking through a thorough competitor analysis. There must be something they are missing out on and that’s where you need to hit with your content strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Because You Are Not Creating Valuable Content</strong></h2>\n<p>Producing content for content’s sake is not going to take you far. It should always provide some value to your audience. A very prominent reason why the majority of the companies do not succeed with their content is that they get too busy simply churning out content pieces one after the other without considering if it is working for their audiences or not.</p>\n<p>You are not thinking about your audience while creating content. It is only the numbers you are worried about. And the same thing has passed on to your writers as well. They aren’t worried about content quality or the value it would create with the readers, they are simply meeting the deadlines and targets of writing x number of words each day.</p>\n<h3><b>Quick Fixing Tip:</b></h3>\n<p>When it comes to writing valuable content for the audiences, there are many things you can do. Here are some of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a buyer persona and analyze the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/5-product-discovery-tips-for-building-solutions-customers-will-buy/\">characteristic of the audience</a> to know what kind of content they like. You need to find what clicks your audience and create content that engages them.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your content team should be experienced and know how to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/5-steps-for-creating-effective-pillar-content/\">create high-quality content</a>. You cannot expect them to create great content if you haven’t familiarized them with your target buyer personas. Make sure they have complete information about your company’s offering, working process, and the target audience so that they can create valuable content.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your content stand out by adding some unique qualities to them and offer value in one way or the other.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give a different angle or perspective to your content to ensure that it is creating more value for your audiences</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk to your sales or business development team to know the questions that the customers are actually asking and create content on that.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay attention to the content type that is not working with your target audience and either stop doing that in your strategy or try to improve them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Because Your Content Promotion is Not On Point</strong></h2>\n<p>Content marketing is not just about content. It’s second half talks about marketing and that is where most people fail. Many people have talented content writers who tell the company stories in a perfect manner while also offering value. But they lack in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/5-steps-for-creating-effective-pillar-content/\">promoting the content</a> on the right channels.</p>\n<p>Your content strategy would definitely not work if you are doing nothing about the content once it has gone live on your website.</p>\n<p>How do you expect your users to find the content? Do you expect them to type your blog URL to reach the page? No one would do that, of course.</p>\n<p>How will they reach your content? They will reach your content when you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/20/how-to-scale-your-content-marketing/\">know how to promote</a> it.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.robbierichards.com/seo/case-study-triple-traffic-in-30-days/\">Robbie Richards</a>, a professional that helps growth-stage SaaS companies with their SEO strategies. His page was just a month old with no backlinks or anything. Yet, he grew his traffic by 272% in just 30 days. How?</p>\n<p>Having a content strategy that emphasizes on creating great content and promoting it right. He used Buzzbundle tool, weekly round-ups, forum marketing, etc.</p>\n<h3><b>Quick Fixing Tip:</b></h3>\n<p>There are some simple and quick tips that can help you improve your content strategy through promotion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send out email newsletters to all your subscribers for your blog posts</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share each of your blog posts on social media platforms that best suit your business and audience in a very engaging manner. Don’t forget, over <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">74%</a> of your users are on social media. But make sure you target your content according to social media platforms. LinkedIn for business posts, Instagram for cultural posts, Pinterest for infographics, Twitter for mentioning industry experts, etc.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When sending out emails to your prospects, you can link your informative posts in the email to give them value and get more traffic on your site.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reshare your content on different reposting channels like Medium etc., with your original link as canonical to reach out to wider audiences.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Answer questions on Quora, Reddit, etc., while linking to your blog post to get interested readers from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Because You Aren’t Tracking Content or Wasting Your Data</strong></h2>\n<p>Data is imperative in today’s world and you need to make complete use of the data that you have to improve your content strategy. Basically, if you are not backing your content strategy with data, you are simply taking the guess-based approach. And that is not going to take you too far.</p>\n<p>It is important that you track each piece of content and know the numbers to not just formulate your content strategy but also improvise it accordingly.</p>\n<p>The data collected from tracking and analysis of content, marketing campaigns, and other similar things can be very useful in strengthening your content strategy and making it fool-proof.</p>\n<p><b><i>Quick Fixing Tip:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Analytics, Hubspot Analytics, SEMrush, and many more tools are available to help you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/how-to-measure-and-analyze-content-marketing-success/\">analyze your content performance</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks at the page views, bounce rates, average session, etc., to see how your content is performing</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See the referral traffic and make sure sharing content there becomes a routine</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a monthly report to see where the traffic arrives most and from where. Create content and promotion strategies accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>On an Ending Note</strong></h2>\n<p>Like having a correct inbound strategy is imperative for digital engagement, a correct and fail-proof content strategy is also crucial for your success. In fact, if done right, your content strategy can get you three times more leads than paid search advertising. All you need to do is find the reasons why it is failing and fix them to succeed.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we covered all the major reasons that lead to the failure of content strategy and how you can quickly fix them. You can perform <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/15/a-comprehensive-guide-to-a-content-audit/\">content audits</a> regularly and see ho everything is working out. Once done, implement the quick fixing tips and do not forget to include these implementations in your content documentation as, without it, your strategy would not stand.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make your content strategy work, make sure your content is written for humans and well-optimized for search engines.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating just one kind of content would bore your audience. Treat them with variety and serve them with a mix and match of video, blogs, podcasts, infographics, etc.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The content should always provide value to the readers and compel them to take some action.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not worry if your industry is already dominated. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/21/a-better-customer-experience-why-little-things-matter/\">Offering value consistently</a> would help you carve your niche.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just pushing down chunks of content on your website wouldn’t suffice. Promoting the content should take an important part of your content strategy.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also need to monitor all your content efforts. Otherwise, how would you know what’s working and what’s not? With proper tracking, you can create more value-driven content that will resonate with your customers’ requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/29/content-strategy-not-working-here-are-the-6-reasons-why/\">Content Strategy Not Working?

The BI and data is connecting all of their data and making it readable and accessible from a single place. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Not all data virtualization is created equal.</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data virtualization creates a software virtualization layer that integrates all of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/startup-essentials-stop-overcomplicating-your-processes/\">your data across the enterprise</a>. No matter what format the data is in, or which silos, servers or clouds the data resides in, it is translated into a common business language and accessible from a single portal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In theory, this empowers organizations with a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/12/remote-work-woes-are-a-boon-for-mobile-data-collection-apps/\">shared data intellect</a> where all the different business units and business users gain immediate access to the data they need—having fast access enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions for a shared purpose.   </span></p>\n<h3><strong>However, many data virtualization solutions fall short of this promised Eden of analytics. There are a few critical reasons for this.</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Proprietary formats.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many data virtualization providers consolidate and then translate all of an<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/06/top-5-areas-where-companies-want-iot-solutions/\"> organization’s data</a> into a proprietary format. While consolidation allows the data to be integrated into a single place for a single view, the vendor’s proprietary format often reduces the data to a lowest-common-denominator state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The common-denominator state can result in some data getting skewed, losing specialized functionality, or even getting lost in translation. Some data may also require the context of its original database to be reliable. Thus, your company may be drawing insights from faulty data and making counterproductive business decisions. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>BI tool incompatibility.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI tools are a considerable investment for organizations. Most enterprise-level companies already have several different types of BI tools across various departments. For example, one department might use Tableau, while another uses Microsoft Power BI or Excel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For big data analytics to work for enterprises, data has to be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/31/how-are-the-top-mncs-using-big-data-analytics-to-their-advantage/\">easily discoverable and universally accessible</a> to all users, no matter what tools they prefer to use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proprietary data formats that many vendors use may not be interoperable with the technologies your company has already invested in.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different tools use many different query languages and vary in the ways they display data. When data with incongruent definitions are integrated, costly errors in analysis can occur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to use the BI tool of choice is crucial to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/13/3-ways-the-iot-can-offer-innovative-solutions-to-serious-environmental-problems/\">minimizing business disruptions</a> and maximizing user productivity.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Query limitations.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more your data grows and evolves; the more complicated your queries will become &#8211; not ideal for analytics workloads and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/19/how-to-get-away-from-a-growth-mindset-and-start-to-scale/\">working with data at scale</a>. The more disparate data sources you have to manage, the more data engineering will be required to run fast, interactive queries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving large volumes of data at query time for distributed joins does not work for interactive queries. It puts unpredictable and unacceptable stress on enterprise infrastructure, and simplistic data caching is insufficient for a dynamic query environment and today’s data sizes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you add BI and AI workloads to the mix, performance degrades quickly, driving end-users to seek other direct paths to the data, which undermines the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/18/how-virtualization-transforms-software-testing/\">benefits of data virtualization</a>.</span></p>\n<h5><strong>In addition to these scaling pitfalls, traditional virtualization products do a poor job of addressing analytics use cases.</strong></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Scaling out big and complex data services requires an intimate understanding of the details: statistics on the data, the databases involved, the load on those shared resources, use cases and intent of the data consumers, security constraints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtualization solutions need to offer users a business-contextual view of their data that includes hierarchies, measures, dimensions, attributes, and time series.  </span></p>\n<h3><b>What data virtualization should provide.</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most data virtualization solutions have not evolved at the same pace as today’s datasets and data science practices and still rely on traditional data federation approaches and simple caching techniques. There is, however, a next-generation, more <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/02/advantages-and-risks-of-cloud-computing-regarding-security/\">intelligent type of data virtualization</a> designed for today’s complex and time-sensitive BI requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your data virtualization solution does not provide you with the following capabilities, it simply isn’t intelligent enough.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Autonomous data engineering.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human beings can never be perfect; luckily, computers can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human simply cannot manage the complexity of a modern data architecture—at least not at the speed that business now requires to stay competitive. That’s why your data virtualization solution needs to provide autonomous data engineering.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Autonomous data engineering can automatically deduce optimizations based on countless connections and calculations that a human brain wouldn’t be able to conceive of. Machine learning (ML) is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/21/is-business-intelligence-the-fastest-way-to-improve-customer-experience/\">leveraged to dissect all company data</a> and examine how it&#8217;s queried and integrated into data models being built by all users across the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automating, as many aspects of data engineering as possible save a significant amount of money and resources while freeing up data engineers to perform more complex tasks that are more valuable to the organization. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>Acceleration structures.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent data virtualization can also automatically <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/07/4-ways-to-prepare-for-the-next-wave-of-digital-transformation/\">place data into the specific database</a> where it will achieve optimal performance. </span></p>\n<h5><strong>There are many types of specialized data and different formats that are optimal for that data. </strong></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent data virtualization can automatically <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/open-applications-and-solving-the-future-of-platform-economics/\">decide on what platform to place data</a> based on where it will generate the best performance. Different data platforms have distinct advantages and strengths. For example, if your data model and query are working with time-series data, intelligent data virtualization will place an acceleration structure in a database that is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/22/the-boundaryless-era-the-time-for-distributed-teams/\">optimized for time series data</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatically knowing which database has which strength and then leveraging it will take a traditional liability—the variability of all your different database types—and turn it into an advantage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acceleration structures <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/11/3-surprising-benefits-of-the-cloud-in-iot/\">provide significant savings on cloud operating costs</a>. Depending on the platform you&#8217;re using, you may be charged for the storage size of your database, the number of queries you run, the data being moved in a query, the number of rows in a question, the complexity of the query, or several other variables. </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>With Google BigQuery, for example, the amount you’re charged is proportional to the size of your database, and the complexity of the queries.</strong> </span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you automatically use acceleration structures for both performance and cost optimization, you’re only charged for the query data you used in the acceleration aggregate, not the size of the entire database. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>Automatic data modeling.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of data virtualization doesn’t just translate and provide access to data; intelligent data virtualization can <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">automatically understand the capabilities</a> and limitations of each data platform. It automatically discovers what information is available and how it can be combined and integrated with other data when building models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent data virtualization can reverse engineer data models and queries used to create legacy reports, so you can continue using the same report without having to rebuild data models or queries. If, for example, you created a TPS report in your old system, you will still be able to retrieve it in your new system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Past queries may have been run on old data, but they can still be translated and run on the new system without any rewrites. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>Self-service enablement.</strong><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></i></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many aspects of IT have become “democratized” in recent years—that is, advances in technology (particularly cloud) have made them <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-intelligent-data-addresses-the-chasm-in-cloud/\">accessible to laypersons</a> without extensive technological acumen. While analytics and business intelligence have lagged in the democratization trend, BI tools are now increasingly becoming usable for the average worker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BI usage has resulted in the growth of a new “self-service” analytics culture, where business users can directly access and analyze data with their own preferred BI tools, and not have to rely on data engineers or data analysts. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Self-service analytics is fast becoming a necessity for optimizing big data analytics in an organization.</strong> </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s say, for example, the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/25/presentation-management-key-component-to-the-enterprise-sales-funnel/\">sales department has data</a> about the previous year’s spend but wants to augment it with data regarding customer behavior patterns in multiple areas. Or the marketing department needs to initiate an account-based marketing campaign that targets companies deemed most likely to switch vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With self-service analytics, the business users in the sales or marketing department can access this data, and use it themselves with their own tools. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/02/3-ways-tech-can-help-you-scale/\">self-serve analytics</a> is used rather than having to rely on trained data engineers to source the data for BI tools, and on data scientists to model and predict outcomes. </span></p>\n<h5><strong>With the self-service dynamic allows each department in an organization to apply their own experience and expertise to BI, achieving a whole new level of agility. </strong></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent data virtualization provides a business logic layer that virtually translates all of your data into a common business language that is both sources and tool-agnostic. With the logic layer, it means that business users can use any BI tool they prefer, and no users have to bend to a single standard for BI software. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All data will be accessible no matter what or how many tools you use, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/04/9-critical-questions-to-consider-when-assessing-a-conversational-ai-solution/\">all queries will return consistent answers</a>. The standard and logical explanations empower your organization with a shared data intellect and the self-service culture that&#8217;s growing increasingly necessary in today&#8217;s data-driven business landscape. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>No-hassle security.</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In your quest to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/18/what-can-we-expect-for-iot-in-2020/\">consumerize your data</a>, you cannot sacrifice security and compliance, no matter the agility and cost benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtualization layers have been known to pose security risks. However, with next-generation intelligent data virtualization, your data inherits all of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/06/data-legislation-is-coming-can-you-get-compliant/\">security and governance policies of the database</a> where it resides. The standard governing procedures mean that your permissions and policies remain unchanged. </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>All existing security and privacy information are preserved down to individual users by tracking the data’s lineage and user identities.</strong> </span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even when working with multiple databases with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/11/are-you-making-a-major-security-mistake-with-paas/\">different security policies,</a> the policies are seamlessly merged, and all global security and compliance protocols are automatically applied. There are no additional steps needed to ensure security and compliance after adopting intelligent data virtualization.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Your data virtualization must evolve with the rest of your IT.</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As important as it is to have enterprise-wide, consumerized data that is readable, accessible, and reliable, many companies today are simply overwhelmed by the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/24/to-prevent-fraud-healthcare-organizations-must-streamline-their-data-processes/\">enormous volume of data</a>. The increasingly distributed model with dynamic and diverse formats and use cases add to the data. When users can’t quickly locate and analyze the data they need and be confident that it’s accurate and up-to-date, BI quality decreases, resulting in suboptimal – or even worse – gut-based decisions. </span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Data virtualization, therefore, needs to evolve to meet these new challenges and complexities so it can genuinely work for big data analytics.</strong> </span></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/18/how-virtualization-transforms-software-testing/\">data virtualization solution</a> is not providing autonomous data engineering, acceleration structures, such as automatic data modeling, self-service analytics enablement, you have a problem. You need worry-free security, and compliance, or a multi-dimensional semantic layer that speaks the language of the platform. If you don&#8217;t have these processes &#8212; then your data virtualization solution &#8212; simply isn’t intelligent enough. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/04/intelligent-virtualization-technologies-are-eliminating-data-silos-forever/\">Intelligent Virtualization Technologies are Eliminating Data Silos Forever</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Mar 2020 21:00:36 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intelligent-Virtualization-Technologies-are-Eliminating-Data-Silos-Forever.jpg","linkMd5":"e3bd45562957e3bf7fdcb9395ca04838","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-25-721_84820e9357ac9277.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intelligent-Virtualization-Technologies-are-Eliminating-Data-Silos-Forever.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":42011,"destBytes":42996,"author":"Dave Mariani","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intelligent-Virtualization-Technologies-are-Eliminating-Data-Silos-Forever-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-17-660_217586eac8cd2b5a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879793},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"KitchenAid Cordless 7-Speed Hand Mixer: Taking the Traditional Appliance Into the Modern Age","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175655","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/10/kitchenaid-cordless-7-speed-hand-mixer-taking-the-traditional-appliance-into-the-modern-age/\" title=\"KitchenAid Cordless 7-Speed Hand Mixer: Taking the Traditional Appliance Into the Modern Age\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer-300x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"KitchenAidCordlessMixer\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The hand mixer has been a long treasured appliance in our house. It&#8217;s been through so many holiday meals not to mention all the recent baking we&#8217;ve found ourselves doing while stuck at home.</p>\n<p>Like everything else where we&#8217;ve cut the cord, the hand mixer has also gone cordless. KitchenAid has been our family&#8217;s go-to brand for mixers, so we thought it was as good a time as any to see what their cordless hand mixer could do.</p>\n<h2>About the Cordless 7-Speed Hand Mixer</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/hand-mixers/hand-mixer-products/p.cordless-7-speed-hand-mixer.khmb732bm.html\">KitchenAid cordless 7-speed hand mixer</a> just recently was released as part of its new cordless collection of small appliances. They also offer a cordless hand blender and cordless chopper. All use the same rechargeable lithium battery, making them compatible.</p>\n<h2>Colors and Features</h2>\n<p>Features include seven speeds that are similar to those on their hand mixer with a cord. These speeds let you mix, whip, and stir.The speeds make it ideal for all types of mixing needs, including egg whites, heavy cream, butter and sugar, mashed potatoes, and cookie dough.</p>\n<p>It includes a soft start feature, so the beaters come up gradually to the speed you&#8217;ve selected, reducing the risk of splatter.</p>\n<p>Other features include an ejector button and beater accessories. Its innovative design also allows it to stand on its own. A b<span class=\"a-list-item\">attery indicator light also lets you know when it is time to charge the battery. </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Color choices include our favorite, matte black. You can also select from numerous other colors, such as onyx black, passion red, matte charcoal gray, empire red, white, and blue velvet.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-175656 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"572\" height=\"1618\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer.png 572w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer-106x300.png 106w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer-254x719.png 254w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer-57x160.png 57w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer-543x1536.png 543w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" /></p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>This is a convenient small appliance that gets it done. I like that it only takes two hours to completely recharge. While I haven&#8217;t attempted to see if it would work long enough to make 200 cookies like its website claims, it does seem to hang in there for as long as we need it for. KitchenAid does make high-quality appliances that are built to last. I particularly like their color options in recent years to personalize it more for what we like.</p>\n<p>The one con is that it doesn&#8217;t feel as powerful as our hand mixer that plugs into the wall, and it&#8217;s a decade or so old. There is a little sluggishness on the tougher to mix items, but we just whip out the stand mixer for that (a KitchenAid that is still going strong 20 years on!).</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>The cordless mixer comes with a charger and two dishwasher-safe beater attachments.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>The KitchenAid website sells the cordless hand mixer for $99.99. You can also find it at Amazon, Bed Bath &#38; Beyond, Best Buy, QVC, and HSN.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>When it&#8217;s time to upgrade your hand mixer, I would recommend going with this cordless design even with its slightly less power output. You can get a cordless hand mixer for $50 or $60. But, this cordless hand mixer is not that much more in price but gives you the freedom to move around the kitchen without hunting down an outlet.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s even perfect for taking on the road in the RV. Plus, you can add more color to your kitchen.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/10/kitchenaid-cordless-7-speed-hand-mixer-taking-the-traditional-appliance-into-the-modern-age/\">KitchenAid Cordless 7-Speed Hand Mixer: Taking the Traditional Appliance Into the Modern Age</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:31:18 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer-300x300.jpg","linkMd5":"dea4af1542714152022d6379cd190e12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-815_f5b93afc4094ea44.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":6005,"destBytes":4168,"author":"Deanna Ritchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessMixer-300x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-815_f5b93afc4094ea44.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KitchenAidCordlessHandMixer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn96@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-22-440_e153a41d9eb4f8b0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195868060},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"10 Practical Strategies to Secure Your Digital Life","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174445","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/12/10-practical-strategies-to-secure-your-digital-life/\" title=\"10 Practical Strategies to Secure Your Digital Life\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"10 Practical Strategies to Secure Your Digital Life\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Is your cyber life secure? How do you know? Data security is critical more than ever before. If you’re not careful, you could end up victimized by any number of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/22/6-emerging-cyber-threats-to-lookout-for-in-2019/\">cyberattacks common in today’s world</a>. If other people use your network, not protecting your network puts their devices and data at risk.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 strategies to help you secure your digital life.</p>\n<h3>1. Implement a zero-trust architecture strategy for your business</h3>\n<p>Zero-trust is exactly what it sounds like. Rather than grant employees and contractors access to your entire network, a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/27/3-amazing-strategies-that-will-burst-cybercrimes-in-2020/\">zero-trust strategy</a> grants access to company data as needed. In other words, employees are given access only to the areas of the network necessary to do their job.</p>\n<h3>2. Implement strong network security strategies</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re running a small business or you’re a solopreneur, you need network security. High-tech network security protects your data from a plethora of breaches and attacks using hardware and software solutions.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/network-security/what-is-network-security/\">network security strategy</a> typically includes controlled network access, antivirus software, application security, endpoint security, firewalls, and strong analytics. With High-tech security, threats are detected and blocked in real-time. Strong network security will protect your network from common threats including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viruses</li>\n<li>Worms</li>\n<li>Trojans</li>\n<li>Spyware</li>\n<li>Adware</li>\n<li>Ransomware</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cyberattacks are constantly evolving and becoming more dangerous every minute. If you’re storing personal information from your customers, you need strong network protection to prevent that data from being stolen or manipulated.</p>\n<h3>3. Use a VPN on private and public Wi-Fi networks</h3>\n<p>Your data is vulnerable when you connect to public Wi-Fi networks. While a VPN won’t give you 100% protection, it’s the best way to mitigate most risks. However, it’s also wise to use a VPN on a private network.</p>\n<p>A VPN does two main things: protects your identity/location and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/08/30/6-technologies-secure-iot-network-dl1/\">encrypts</a> your internet traffic. This comes in handy whether you’re on a public or private network.</p>\n<p>Normally, your internet traffic is passed through your internet service provider’s server. This gives your ISP access to all of your browsing history, which means they can hand it over to law enforcement, advertisers, or another third party. When you’re on a public Wi-Fi network, it works the same way – the ISP receives your browsing history.</p>\n<p>When using a VPN, your browsing history is encrypted and therefore impossible to read.</p>\n<p>Since a VPN encrypts your internet traffic, you’ll be protected from the hackers that like to sit around at coffee shops and hijack other people’s browsing sessions. If a hacker gets access to your computer through a public network, they could install a keystroke logger and get access to your bank account and any other online account you have.</p>\n<h3>4. Limit the amount of personal information you publish online</h3>\n<p>Each time you post personal information online, you’re making yourself more vulnerable should you ever become the victim of a data breach. Cybercriminals use individual pieces of data to piece together a full profile of an individual and use that information to commit crimes. For example, a criminal who has your full name and address might search your Facebook account for answers to the security questions to gain access to your online banking account.</p>\n<p>Posting bits of information may not seem harmful as you post, but the cumulative effect of posting personal information over a long period of time literally hands criminals the information needed to steal your identity.</p>\n<p>Some criminals use identities to open credit cards while others make fake ID cards to obtain loans. Some criminals use stolen identities to rack up utility bills when their own account has been shut off. There are a host of reasons why people steal personal data and the less information you publish, the better.</p>\n<h3>5. Shred every piece of mail you recycle or throw away</h3>\n<p>Cybercriminals don’t just look for information online. Sometimes they get information in the physical world by breaking into mailboxes and stealing trash. Yes, cybercriminals resort to stealing trash – and sometimes entire recycle bins – in an attempt to obtain personal data.</p>\n<p>Even junk mail can contain personal information you don’t want cybercriminals to have. Sometimes all they need is a phone number or the last 4 digits of your credit card. The only way to ensure cybercriminals don’t get that information from discarded mail is to shred it before you toss it.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a paper shredder, take your mail to a mail store that provides shredding services or cut out your personal information and burn those pieces in a metal trash can. You can also get black permanent markers with a cross-hatch pattern to blackout data.</p>\n<h3>6. Stop saving your passwords in your browser</h3>\n<p>Most of the top browsers store your bookmarks and passwords in the cloud rather than on your local machine. This puts all of your login credentials at risk if your browser experiences a data breach.</p>\n<p>While you can use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2007/06/13/do_we_need_password_management_services/\">password management applications</a> that store your passwords using one main password, your login credentials aren’t entirely safe. If your password application is installed on your local machine it’s safer than in the cloud. However, if your device gets stolen and you haven’t logged out of your password manager, you’re extremely vulnerable.</p>\n<p>It’s convenient to save all of your passwords, especially when you use complex passwords on a mobile device, but it’s always safer to enter your password each time. If you don’t want to type in your password each time you log into your accounts, that’s understandable. At the very least, stop saving your password for online financial accounts or accounts where your credit card data is stored (like Amazon).</p>\n<h3>7. Immediately secure your smart devices</h3>\n<p>Smart devices usually come with either no password or a factor-generated password printed in your device’s manual. Change – or set – this password immediately before connecting to the internet. If you don’t plan on connecting the smart device to the internet (like a TV, for example), then disable the Wi-Fi entirely.</p>\n<p>You should also <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/05/7-actionable-tips-to-secure-your-smart-home-and-iot-devices/\">create a separate Wi-Fi network</a> just for your IoT devices. If someone manages to hack into your device-only network, they won’t have access to your computer or other devices.</p>\n<h3>8. Mac users: turn Air Drop on/off for each use</h3>\n<p>For Mac users, it’s a good idea to turn AirDrop on and off for each use. You can set AirDrop to accept file transfers only from trusted devices, but that could be a problem if someone has already compromised your Mac to trust their device.</p>\n<p>The safest way to protect your Mac is to manually turn AirDrop on and off for each file transfer you perform. Additionally, if you’re not using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, turn those features off until you need them.</p>\n<h3>9. Train contractors you employ, no matter how small their task</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you just need to hire someone to upload files you don’t have time to manage, or you need someone to perform ten minutes of work on your website. Small tasks can still place you at risk for a cyberattack if the person performing those tasks doesn’t take precautions.</p>\n<p>Always train any contractors (and friends) you hire to do quick work for you online. Make sure they aren’t performing the work from unsecured public Wi-Fi and if they must, then make sure they use a VPN.</p>\n<p>Be assertive and require their agreement to not store your passwords in their browser. Last, always create a unique account for each contractor and delete or disable the account the moment they’re done with the work.</p>\n<h3>10. Back up your data regularly using immutable storage</h3>\n<p>If you fall victim to a ransomware attack, you’ll be glad to have a backup of your data. Instead of paying a ransom and hoping the criminal decrypts your data (most of the time they don’t), you can simply restore your data from a healthy backup.</p>\n<p>However, backups are not immune to ransomware. That’s where immutable storage comes into play. Ransomware encrypts data by changing the storage blocks on a drive. Immutable storage allows you to prevent changes to storage blocks for any period of time and you can restore your data to specific recovery points you’ve created.</p>\n<p>No matter what kind of storage you use, make sure to create offline backups. Connect your backup device to the internet only long enough to perform the backup and then disconnect the device.</p>\n<h3>Cybersecurity is critical for 2020 and beyond</h3>\n<p>Your cybersecurity strategies will make or break your success whether you’re running a full-scale business or you’re just getting started on your own. If you’re not sure how to implement cybersecurity practices, hire an IT security professional to create a security solution best suited to your needs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/12/10-practical-strategies-to-secure-your-digital-life/\">10 Practical Strategies to Secure Your Digital Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 02:00:12 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life.jpg","linkMd5":"f3bd66881dceb27d21ae11bd3888eb24","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-27-030_85b9d151adee4488.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":65905,"destBytes":33796,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Secure-your-digital-life-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-24-080_0950b845535452e4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873921},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"Digital Collectibles Go Mainstream on the WAX Blockchain","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173599","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/30/digital-collectibles-go-mainstream-on-the-wax-blockchain/\" title=\"Digital Collectibles Go Mainstream on the WAX Blockchain\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"collectibles blockchain\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Collectors have always had a problem. The value of the items they collect depends on their rarity. If DaVinci had seen that people really liked his portrait of the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, for example, and knocked out a few thousand copies to cash in on the interest &#8212; the first buyer might have felt put out, and the picture in The Louvre would be worth a lot less.</p>\n<h2>Digital Collectibles are exciting as they go mainstream.</h2>\n<p>Da Vinci can’t do that now, but if you’re collecting baseball cards or other trading cards, you always face the risk that the manufacturer will churn out more of the product and lower the value of your holdings. As long as someone else has the freedom to print copies of your collectibles, those collectibles face a risk to their value.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to money. If the government prints more of it, the value of the dollar in your pocket will go down.</p>\n<h3><strong>The fact that the dollar will go down has always been a large part of the attraction of Bitcoin.</strong></h3>\n<p>A burst of quantitative easing can’t unexpectedly lower the value of your digital currency. The number of Bitcoins that can circulate is pre-programmed, and the structure of the blockchain ensures that no fake coins can circulate.</p>\n<p>The value of a Bitcoin, like the value of a work of art by a dead artist, is dependent entirely on the rise and fall of demand. The supply is fixed.</p>\n<h4><strong>Having the supply fixed makes the blockchain an ideal way to keep track of—and secure the value of—other collectibles through the use of non-fungible tokens.</strong></h4>\n<p>These tokens are digital items written into the blockchain that each represent a single unique object, such as a work of art. They function as a certificate of authenticity secured by the blockchain’s distributed ledgers.</p>\n<p>It’s already happening. In May, <a href=\"http://wax.io\">WAX</a>, a blockchain company, teamed up with collectible firm Topps to release a set of digital Garbage Pail Kids cards. All 12,000 packs, a total of 110,000 cards, <a href=\"https://wax.io/blog/sold-out-gpk-card-packs-on-wax-sold-out-in-just-28-hours\">sold out within 28 hours</a> and quickly made their way to secondary markets.</p>\n<h4><strong>WAX and Topps will soon release another set making use of licensed property related to Tiger King. </strong></h4>\n<p>William Shatner, the original captain of the Starship Enterprise, <a href=\"https://wax.io/blog/william-shatner-is-coming-to-the-wax-blockchain-get-digital-memorabilia-from-star-treks-captain-kirk-as-nfts-on-wax\">is releasing his collectible memorabilia on WAX’s blockchain</a>. Shatner has now joined the <a href=\"https://council.wax.io/#about\">WAX Advisory Council</a>.</p>\n<p>Considering the new functionality that the blockchain is bringing to the collectibles market, it’s not surprising that WAX is also working with the hosts of <a href=\"http://badcryptopodcast.com\">The Bad Crypto Podcast.</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Bad Crypto Podcast is set to produce a set of digital collectible trading cards featuring parodies of blockchain and cryptocurrency personalities</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bcheroes.com\">Blockchain Heroes</a> is shaping up to be another success as chatter on social channels would seem to indicate.</p>\n<p>What’s happening here is that the collectibles market is undergoing a revolution. It’s possible now for anyone to fake anything. While you can find anything you want to buy on sites like eBay, you can never be sure that what you’re buying is genuine.</p>\n<h4><strong>Blockchain technology is bringing that authenticity and certainty to the collectibles market.</strong></h4>\n<p>Blockchain technology has fraud-proof ledgers, and the use of non-fungible tokens ensures that you can always see the proof of ownership for an item you want to buy. You can even see the sales price so that you can track how the market is performing.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be confident that if someone tries to sell you a happier looking version of the <i>Mona Lisa &#8212; merely</i> ask to see the blockchain ledger!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/30/digital-collectibles-go-mainstream-on-the-wax-blockchain/\">Digital Collectibles Go Mainstream on the WAX Blockchain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:01:01 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain.jpg","linkMd5":"aeff7cfd89c01123b621f9aef4c5b577","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-26-675_3f3efb8da015b288.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":82071,"destBytes":77726,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Collectibles-Go-Mainstream-on-the-WAX-Blockchain-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-17-252_2ee370202e0be93f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875286},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"Gaming with Artificial Intelligence Technology in 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166830","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/29/gaming-with-artificial-intelligence-technology-in-2020/\" title=\"Gaming with Artificial Intelligence Technology in 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"gaming ai\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020-900x601.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gaming-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-2020.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Amazing team building activities can bring team members together by collaborating and encouraging teamwork.

Also, they only needed to estimate how many employees at one time were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video conferencing</li>\n<li>Downloading or uploading large files</li>\n<li>Checking and sending emails</li>\n<li>Using the web for research</li>\n<li>Streaming music or video</li>\n<li>Using VOIP</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Those activities are still crucial for bandwidth requirement purposes.</strong></p>\n<p>However, if you&#8217;re ending your focus there, you&#8217;re missing today’s bigger picture. Now, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/internet-of-things-makes-it-easier-to-steal-your-data/\">employees may have</a> smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, and a health monitoring device.</p>\n<p>Each employee likely has smart speakers or brings in a smart assistant. Consider that when each of these devices connects to the network, some questions must be asked.  How often are the devices sending and receiving data?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Are these device sending and receiving data in real-time? Is the transfer done in batches throughout the day? Whenever a request is made? How much bandwidth are employees’ personal devices using throughout the day?</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Without warning, an influx of personal tech can consume much of your WiFi and internet bandwidth. How is this consumption is affecting productivity in your company? How much of the usage is causing problems for your customers?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s common knowledge that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/29/how-iot-embraces-smart-communication/\">high consumption of internet bandwidth</a> can lead to slow load times for web pages, difficulty opening large files, or problems with video conferences, presentations, or VOIP calls.</p>\n<p>In general, you’ll be looking at complaints that the internet or the WiFi is slow. As a result, employee productivity will suffer. Productivity isn’t the only risk, either. Unsecured personal tech opens up a corporate network to a whole host of potential network vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>Security Holes</h3>\n<p>A system is only as secure as its weakest point. With personal IoT devices flooding a network, the number of possible weak points greatly increases.</p>\n<p>Frequently, these devices do not have the same security protocols as business devices, but we connect them to the same network &#8212; a network that houses sensitive, confidential data.</p>\n<h4>Confidential, secure data makes employee data an attractive target for hackers.</h4>\n<p>A personal device that&#8217;s hacked is bad news for employees and a lot worse news for companies. As these devices are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/cybersecurity-ensuring-sanity-in-smart-cities/\">connected to the corporate network</a> &#8212; without proper IoT cybersecurity &#8212; your network is vulnerable to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hackers gaining access to sensitive data, including the risk of someone hacking a device and using said device to take photographs or record video.</li>\n<li>Sabotage of company facilities, such as losing control of the HVAC, or being locked out of machinery.</li>\n<li>Botnets infecting devices and launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that bring down a network entirely.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These scenarios have happened and are already happening. Criminals <u><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/07/27/criminals-hacked-a-fish-tank-to-steal-data-from-a-casino/#4b0e977732b9\">hacked a smart thermometer</a></u> in a casino fish tank to steal data about the casino’s highest paying customers.</p>\n<p>Home thermostats have been used as a <u><a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hackers-leave-finnish-residents-cold-after-ddos-attack-knocks-out-heating-systems-1590639\">launch point for DDoS attacks</a></u> that have left residents freezing and locked out of their own central heating systems. The FDA proved that implantable <u><a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/technology/fda-st-jude-cardiac-hack/\">cardiac devices</a></u> can be hacked.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Corero Network Security reported that organizations experienced an average of<u><a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ddos-attacks-increased-91-in-2017-thanks-to-iot/\"> 237 DDoS attack attempts per month</a></u>. The examples go on and on. Take these security risks seriously. Design your network to keep hackers and criminals securely locked out.</p>\n<h3>How to Solve the Problems</h3>\n<h4><strong>Identify</strong></h4>\n<p>Before you can <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/27/3-amazing-strategies-that-will-burst-cybercrimes-in-2020/\">adequately protect your network</a> and optimize your bandwidth, you have to know what devices are on the network. Of those devices on the network, identify which are corporate devices and which are personal devices.</p>\n<h4>One way to verify this is through device discovery and device profiling.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Device discovery alerts you when new devices connect to your network.</li>\n<li>Device profiling identifies the device and sharing information such as device type, brand, and operating system.</li>\n<li>Profiling provides details down to the specific make and model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the right tools, this process takes only minutes. The identification provides companies with complete visibility into their wireless networks and lets them know precisely what the network is supporting and how the bandwidth is utilized.</p>\n<p>Your AP vendor might provide profiling. If not, there are other analytics tools you can turn to for the job.</p>\n<h4><strong>Protect</strong></h4>\n<p>Now that you know how many and what kind of IoT devices are on your network &#8212; how do you keep it all secure?</p>\n<p>Many IoT devices don’t have a user interface (UI) that would allow for the installation of additional software, like antivirus software. These employee devices might even be lacking the hardware capacity needed for such an installation.</p>\n<p>What enterprises need to do is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/09/feature-flags-will-be-the-great-enabler-of-the-connected-world/\">flag the devices</a> for anomalous activity, and put such devices on a network that is separate from your corporate network.</p>\n<p>Enterprises achieve differentiation when using different SSIDs, VLANs, and subnets, or a combination thereof. Then further designate device-specific access roles.</p>\n<h3>Anomalous Activity</h3>\n<p>After personal devices are identified, flag them, so you receive an alert if they act suspiciously.</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario where a device identified as a smartwatch suddenly starts downloading or uploading large amounts of data either to or from your network. This is an immediate red flag that the device is being used for malicious purposes.</p>\n<p>With real-time identification, IT can resolve the problem before the negative consequences are too severe.</p>\n<p>Make sure you continuously upgrade the criteria used for anomalous detection, allowing your business to keep pace with natural changes in device usage and behavior.</p>\n<h4>Three SSIDs</h4>\n<p>Acting proactively, IT can limit the information available to IoT devices by deploying two or three service set identifiers (SSIDs). The different SSIDs provide varying levels of network access to different users and devices. Generally, I recommend using three SSIDs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SSID 1 &#8212; </strong> is the most secure network with strong firewalls and a unique password or certificate for each device. Typically, configure SSID 1 as WPA2 &#8211; Enterprise. Limit your SSID 1 to employees and business devices only.</li>\n<li><strong>SSID 2</strong> &#8212; is the guest network. It can be open or password-protected (WPA2 &#8211; Personal), with or without a captive portal (web-browser based authentication). SSID 2 can require an agreement of terms and conditions from all users or some form of user login.</li>\n<li><strong>SSID 3 &#8212;</strong> if needed, you can use the SSID 3 as a catch-all network for any other devices. This designation includes personal IoT devices that may have limited band or security protocols support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a slightly different method, companies could also choose to put all IoT devices on the 2.4GHz network. Then, the company can reserve the 5GHz network exclusively for corporate devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Be very selective about which devices join which network.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, it might not seem worrisome if a hacker accesses a printer, but that criminal can now see everything that is printed or scanned in an office. Yikes!</p>\n<p>Ensure your employees understand the risks involved if they allow their personal devices to connect to a secure network. Enforce company policies that prohibit such connections.</p>\n<h3><strong>Shape</strong></h3>\n<p>Quality of service (QoS) technologies allow you to deliver optimal performance for different types of network traffic. The first thing you’ll want to do is classify your network traffic.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can be as broad or as specific as you like for your QoS technologies. Once you’ve determined what kind of traffic you have, there are different methods you can implement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A differentiated service model configures network hardware so that different traffic types have different priorities.</p>\n<p>If voice traffic is a higher priority than other traffic, the differentiated service model allocates more network resources for peak performance.</p>\n<p>You can use bandwidth shaping, also known as traffic shaping. Traffic shaping lets you reserve bandwidth for higher priority, business-related traffic. Using shaping, companies limit the bandwidth available to certain applications, or limit bandwidth based on the source and destination of packets.</p>\n<p>For example, it would be possible to reserve 60% of the bandwidth for corporate use and designate only 20% each for IoT devices and guests.</p>\n<p>If IoT devices start trying to use more than 20%, bandwidth shaping will usually hold traffic in a buffer and delay sending it until it can be transmitted without going over the configured speed &#8212; or drop it.</p>\n<p>To determine if bandwidth shaping is necessary for your company, use network tests and device profiling to determine bandwidth utilization over time. Are business applications running slowly because of an increase in users? Or is slow down because of an increase of personal or other IoT devices? Does the bandwidth need to be upgraded? Or, will bandwidth shaping resolve the issue?</p>\n<h3><strong>Keep it Visible, Keep it Safe</strong></h3>\n<p>With 100% network visibility, companies have a better understanding of their network. The company will know how their networks are growing. They know what devices they&#8217;re supporting, and what, if any, security vulnerabilities exist.</p>\n<p>As the number of IoT devices continues to grow, this practice will be more necessary than ever.</p>\n<p>Implement policies for identification, protection, and traffic shaping. Your goal is to keep your network secure and optimized, no matter how many devices enter the office.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/21/connected-devices-in-the-workplace-what-you-need-to-know/\">Connected Devices in the Workplace: What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Connected-Devices-in-the-Workplace-What-You-Need-to-Know.jpg","linkMd5":"e4e7fb5b7b8600867bb5babd000963d0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-27-005_7389030dd1369a2d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Connected-Devices-in-the-Workplace-What-You-Need-to-Know.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1440,"sourceBytes":249097,"destBytes":196956,"author":"Anil Gupta","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Connected-Devices-in-the-Workplace-What-You-Need-to-Know-300x225.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-15-392_cc69e91c2882408e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880481},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","title":"5 Reasons Your Own Website is Killing Your Sales","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174112","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/14/5-reasons-your-own-website-is-killing-your-sales/\" title=\"5 Reasons Your Own Website is Killing Your Sales\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-Reasons-Your-Own-Website-is-Killing-Your-Sales-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"website killing sales\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-Reasons-Your-Own-Website-is-Killing-Your-Sales-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-Reasons-Your-Own-Website-is-Killing-Your-Sales-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-Reasons-Your-Own-Website-is-Killing-Your-Sales.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>More people than ever are shopping online. In 2019, e-commerce retail sales equated to <a href=\"https://99firms.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics/#gref\">14.1% of global sales</a> and by 2040, 95% of purchases are expected to come from e-commerce. Here are five reasons your own website is killing your sales.</p>\n<h3>Clearly, there’s never been a better time to sell online.</h3>\n<p>However, there are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to actually making sales. Having <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/21/website-traffic-metric/\">a brand website is important</a>, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll have a successful business.</p>\n<p>Your website is potentially the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/09/amazon-ppc-campaign-to-increase-sales-during-pandemic/\">first impression consumers</a> have of your brand. It showcases your back story, your vision, and your overall product line. But, if your sales aren’t exactly setting the e-commerce industry on fire, it might be time to make a few changes.</p>\n<p>Not getting as many sales as you’d hoped? Here are 5 reasons why your website may be having a negative impact.</p>\n<h2><b>Your website isn’t mobile responsive</b></h2>\n<p>61.51% of the world’s <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/08/the-cloud-based-companys-4-step-guide-to-mobile-device-management/\">population own a mobile phone</a> &#8212; that’s around 4.78 billion people. By 2021, purchases made via mobile are predicted to be worth $3.56 trillion.</p>\n<p>With more consumers using their phone to research products, learn about businesses, and make purchases, your website needs to deliver it’s A-game, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/24/3-ways-tech-startups-are-using-ai-to-revolutionize-customer-experience/\">deliver a great user experience.</a></p>\n<p>Let’s say you’re interested in buying a set of golf clubs. You head to Google using your phone, find a store selling your perfect set, but the website doesn’t conform to mobile screens.</p>\n<p>What are you going to do? My best bet is that you’re going to click off pretty sharpish.</p>\n<p>To prevent losing potential customers, your website should be responsive to screen size, load quickly, and provide a good user experience.</p>\n<p>How to fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shift to a responsive design, based on a fluid/stackable grid pattern. This will ensure your content resizes no matter what screen size is used.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider image sizing in your CSS. Alternatively, if you’re using a different URL for mobile, upload smaller product images instead.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contemplate touch screen elements for tablet and smartphone devices.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Your website is too slow</b></h2>\n<p>Nobody likes to wait. In fact, 40% of people abandon a website if it takes 3 seconds or more to load.</p>\n<p>It’s not only customers a slow website can have an impact on. According to a <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/site-performance-page-speed-ecommerce\">speed study by Google</a>, your bounce rate declines for every second your website takes to load.</p>\n<p>Did you know that slow web pages affect your search ranking and the cost per click of your Google ads? So, how can you win over customers and search engines by improving your site speed?</p>\n<p>How to fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/11/08/4-mistakes-made-transitioning-cloud-hosting-pl4/\">fast hosting</a>. Quick, reliable hosting is imperative for any e-commerce site, especially if you’re experiencing high traffic or transactions. Look at limitations on bandwidth and memory when you choose a host.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimize HTTP requests. The more components a site has, like images and scripts, the more HTTP requests are made, making your website take longer to load.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combine your files. While CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files are important, minifying them to eliminate unnecessary code and whitespace will reduce their size to make your website faster.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Your SEO is lacking</b></h2>\n<p>Not <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/top-tips-to-increase-website-conversions/\">getting many people visiting your store</a>? Perhaps SEO is having an impact. Good SEO techniques put you further up in search engine results, sending more users to your website.</p>\n<p>SEO can take time to implement so don’t expect changes to happen overnight. However, with the correct techniques, you may need to rely less on paid advertising.</p>\n<p>How to fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/01/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo/\">Be clever with keywords</a>. Do your research to discover what potential customers are searching for. Remember, when <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/20/the-language-of-seo-identifying-and-implementing-central-keywords/\">implementing keywords</a> into content, avoid stuffing them into text.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target local SEO. If you’re a small business, local SEO is essential. Use local keywords and sign up for a Google My Business account.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use on-page SEO techniques. Take advantage of optimizing meta titles and headings with keywords. Optimize your URLs with your most important keywords.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Your site isn’t secure</b></h2>\n<p>Making <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/19/how-prepared-is-your-business-to-face-botnet-threats/\">sure your website is secure</a> increases trust and credibility as a reputable business. After all, you want your customers to keep coming back to you, and spread good reviews about you via word of mouth.</p>\n<p>What can you do if your store is lacking the security it needs?</p>\n<p>How to fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/07/an-ev-ssl-certificate-is-more-important-than-other-ssl-certification/\">SSL certificate.</a> An extended validation certificate (EV SSL) is the most effective type recommended for a high level of security, especially when you’re processing payments and obtaining sensitive data from customers. Make sure you monitor your certificate and not have it expire on you, letting your website exposed. You can use Sematext to track this for free.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State your refund policy to enhance trust. A clear refund policy not only encourages users to trust your company, but it can also improve sales by increasing customer confidence in your brand.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Display your contact information. You may not have a physical store, but customers still need to know how to contact you for inquiries or complaints. Make it easy for them by using a specific contact form, email address, or phone number.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Your site is hard to navigate</b></h2>\n<p>A visually pleasing design isn’t everything, but it does form the first impressions of your business and enhance user experience. It only takes 0.05 seconds for a user to decide if they’re going to stay on your website or not.</p>\n<p>If you want people to stick around on your website long enough to browse your products or services, then you have to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/14/what-these-7-brands-can-teach-you-about-ux/\">improve your user experience</a>.</p>\n<p>How to fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/25/ecommerce-how-to-survive-its-troughs/\">clear navigation with a search bar</a>. Avoid confusion by placing the most important links at the beginning and end of your navigation to make it easier for people to spot them. Organize your offerings in categories so users can easily find what they’re searching for.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use clear product images. Not only will you enhance trust, but you’ll increase conversions too!</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize your landing page. Consider where users are coming from and tailor it to them. For instance, if you’re running a Facebook ad with a 20% off coupon, make sure your landing page mentions the discount. It’s also important to regularly test your landing page to improve conversions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>Improve your conversions by continually analyzing your website</b></h3>\n<p>If you’re <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/06/the-impacts-of-covid-19-on-sustainability-and-technology/\">struggling to make sales</a>, don’t sit around waiting for things to change.</p>\n<p>Getting your e-commerce website to where you want it to takes time.

Instead of assuming what your customers want, use a customer satisfaction survey to receive their perspective on your business.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-172176\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/123Form-1-300x268.png\" alt=\"Customer survey form builder \" width=\"300\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/123Form-1-300x268.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/123Form-1-805x719.png 805w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/123Form-1-179x160.png 179w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/123Form-1.png 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>123FormBuilder</p>\n<p>This way, you can identify what your audience requires and provide customized solutions. These forms can be in the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/17/how-to-get-useful-customer-feedback-in-4-steps/\">feedback</a> request sent after the purchase is made, or after an interaction is completed with the customer. You can ask for ratings using Net Promoter Score Surveys (NPSS) or even a detailed form built for personalized browsing or checkout experience. The reports generated by these feedback forms can form the basis for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/personalizing-your-customer-service-with-6-strategies/\">personalized customer service</a> strategies.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss this chance of enhancing your products and improving the customer experience.</p>\n<h2><strong>#2. Know your average response time.<br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>Customers want fast solutions to their queries. <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/2018+Customer+Service+Trends+How+Operations+Become+Faster+Cheaper+And+Yet+More+Human/-/E-RES142291\">66%</a> of customers report that an important part of good customer service is the company valuing their time. Ace up your efficiency by developing a workflow that streamlines and co-ordinates with different support departments and functions. By reducing the average response time your website visitors and customers are less likely to get distracted or navigate away from your website.</p>\n<p>To speed up the average response rate, eliminate internal confusion to reduce the delays. To remove the confusion whether the reps replied to the customer query or not, use a shared inbox.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-172177\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kayako-300x241.png\" alt=\"Kayako's shared inbox\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kayako-300x241.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kayako-897x719.png 897w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kayako-200x160.png 200w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kayako.png 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Kayako’s shared inbox</p>\n<p>As communication is transparent and visible, everyone in the team is updated about the responses that are pending.

Customer support through SMS.</strong></h2>\n<p>A staggering <a href=\"https://www.eweek.com/networking/consumers-like-using-text-messages-to-solve-customer-service-issues\">52%</a> of customers prefer to text a customer support representative over other channels of communication. With over 5 billion people sending and receiving SMS messages globally, consider including SMS texting in your customer service arsenal, to communicate with the users.</p>\n<p>For small businesses whose marketing budgets are restrained, customer service over <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/01/how-to-enhance-your-omnichannel-strategy-with-sms-messaging/\">SMS</a> is a good option because it works on all phones, needs no separate app downloads, and is independent of the internet. It allows your customers to follow-up, respond to your text message instantly, and interact 1:1 with your support team.</p>\n<p><strong>Some etiquettes to remember, while sending SMS messages to your audience are these.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get written consent from the customers before reaching out to them over SMS.</li>\n<li>Collect their phone numbers through signup and contact forms while mentioning that you would reach out to them over text messaging for customer service updates.</li>\n<li>Consider messaging at the right time, preferably regular business hours.</li>\n<li>Avoid sharing sensitive information that the customers may not be comfortable discussing over text.</li>\n<li>Escalate to a phone call when the problem becomes too complex to handle over SMS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-172179\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Text-Magic-300x151.png\" alt=\"TextMagic's build SMS \" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Text-Magic-300x151.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Text-Magic-900x454.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Text-Magic-260x131.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Text-Magic.png 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>TextMagic</p>\n<p>Don’t shy away from publicizing that your customers can reach out to you by SMS, which shows your commitment to offering excellent customer service.</p>\n<h2><strong>#4. Use content to support your customer service.<br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>Along with generating leads, your content can also be used to increase customer happiness and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>The support team knows the most of what your customers require, complain and recommend about your business. It becomes all the more essential to connect your content creators with the support staff. The content that answers all the questions your audience has, can be used to deliver value to the leads and clients. The blog content that is filled with statistics and insights can be used by the support team to increase customer loyalty.</p>\n<p>Start by identifying the 10 most frequently asked questions your support team receives. Identify or create content to answer those questions in the form of easy to understand resources. Ensure that your support team understands the same content and uses it to answer the queries.</p>\n<p>Also, you can use email gated content to send people down the sales funnel. This could take the form of a previously recorded webinar, podcast, or an e-book. People who have contacted you are already interested in your offering. Instead of sending them through a boring and long demo, consider this soft sell.</p>\n<p>In cases where the questions are straightforward, you could direct the visitors to the FAQ page or knowledge base where they can find corresponding answers. For technical questions that are complex, take the help of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/18/7-types-of-video-that-will-make-a-massive-impact-on-your-website/\">videos</a>, case studies and how-to-posts to help them understand.</p>\n<p>You can do this yourself or hire a content writing agency to help you create content that retains customers and nurtures leads.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Delight your customers with a stellar customer service strategy.

Whether you are talking smartphones, speech-to-text software, Alexa, or your smart home’s IoT appliances… As the underlying tech continues to become more accurate and accessible, on-screen keyboards and button-filled panels might become a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>“<i>Think about it. Why would you ever grab your phone and type if you </i><b><i>knew</i></b><i>, with certainty, that you could just ask it to do something in conversation? Short of privacy and environment restrictions, there’s little reason to do so once accuracy becomes a non-issue</i>” Shared Sheetrit.</p>\n<p>But what are the key data points that seem to be heralding the rise of “<i>voice</i>” as the preferred input methodology for the near future?</p>\n<h2>Voice Search by the Numbers</h2>\n<p>“<i>It wasn’t so long ago that most people gasped when Google announced that mobile search had surpassed regular queries volumes” Asserted Sheetrit jokingly. “Even though we’ve been saying it was inevitable long before that. Guess what? It’s happening all over again. Voice search is the second preferred choice for mobile searches already.</i>” Guy added, and he seems to be right on the money.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, <a href=\"https://www.perficientdigital.com/insights/our-research/voice-usage-trends\">a research conducted</a> by Proficient Digital showed that people’s comfort with voice command usage was on the rise, and had become the number two choice for mobile searches. Adobe’s own study seemed to back this trend up, as they reported that <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/voice-assistant-statistics-trends-2019\">48% of consumers</a> are using voice for “<i>general web searches</i>” regularly.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as we continue to see growth in the widespread adoption of the tech, some companies are already shifting into finding actionable data. On its <a href=\"https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/2019-voice-report\">April 2019 report</a>, Microsoft made a point of finding out more about these search use cases.</p>\n<p>Most voice searches seem to be related to finding out a quick fact (68%), asking for directions (65%), or searching for a business (47%)</p>\n<p>“<i>…And it is those businesses that are already looking two or three moves ahead and optimizing right now for voice search that will see the most benefit in the near future once the floodgates blow open</i>&#8221; augured Guy.</p>\n<h2>Voice Searches, SEO, and the Impact on the Industry</h2>\n<p>Just as it happened with things like mobile accessibility, UX-centric design, and other paradigm-shifting developments of the past decade, one could imagine a similar outcome for voice-enabled tech. In fact, we are already starting to project the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/marketing-in-the-age-of-alexa\">possible implications</a> of gadgets like Alexa on the market.</p>\n<p>This is what Guy Sheetrit feels about the future: “<i>The impact of voice searches on the consumer side is rather predictable. As people grow accustomed to this tech, they’ll begin to expect it – and then demand it – on their apps and gadgets. On the businesses side, things are more complex.</i></p>\n<p><i>We are not just talking about bigger R&#38;D budgets to accommodate said expectation – Their marketing strategies will need to adapt to this new way in which audiences approach their content</i>.</p>\n<p><i>As good as the </i><a href=\"https://www.overthetopseo.com/semantic-google-search-optimization-all-you-need-to-know\"><i>new semantic algorithms</i></a><i> eventually get at figuring out searcher intent, there are important differences between spoken and written queries. Differences that will most likely make a difference in SERPs, and will have to be addressed to outplay the competition.”</i></p>\n<h2>Searches Are Probably Just Be the Start</h2>\n<p>I could sense we were starting to touch on something Guy is very passionate about as I noticed slightly stern notes in his voice.</p>\n<p>“<i>My focus is on searches because that’s my game, but don&#8217;t let that fool you” </i>he warned<i>. “Searches are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to voice-enabled tech.</i>”</p>\n<p>Guy’s sentiment resonated with a statement on the Adobe study as well, which stated that while voice usage was growing, it needed designers to reach everyday adoption.</p>\n<p>Well, it seems like designers are hearing the call and getting to work. Increasingly more apps and devices are delving deeper into voice command implementations, and some even seek to replace the touch interaction altogether!</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s Bing Search App version 6.48 was recently released, and on top of a visual revamp, <b>the app included direct site navigation via voice</b>. Once users navigate to a website, they are prompted to “K<i>eep using voice to search this site</i>.&#8221; They can then choose a page or a specific area of the site they&#8217;d like to go to.</p>\n<p>Implementations like these are not only a huge step forwards in terms of accessibility, but they also signal a wider-adoption opportunity for the technology.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>The new decade has barely started, and the stakes already seem pretty high when it comes to voice technology!</p>\n<p>Whether you are talking big-picture, with machine learning improving recognition accuracy by leaps and bounds, or granular implementations like effective speech-to-text solutions: <b><i>Voice-enabled tech is set to change the game</i></b>.</p>\n<p>As the whole thing continues to pick up steam, it’s bound to make big splashes in the news cycles and consumers’ collective habits – And it’ll be up to smart businesses and developers to keep an ear to the ground to anticipate, and capitalize on, these major shifts!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/28/the-potential-impact-of-voice-enabled-tech-in-2020/\">The Potential Impact of Voice-Enabled Tech in 2020</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 16:00:32 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Potential-Impact-of-Voice-Enabled-Tech-in-2020.jpg","linkMd5":"51e0e9dcc6ab195a99e2dff67e5a89c9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-23-154_68502e9df97b5d5a.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Potential-Impact-of-Voice-Enabled-Tech-in-2020.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":28691,"destBytes":20710,"author":"David Townsend","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Potential-Impact-of-Voice-Enabled-Tech-in-2020-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-27-680_4d489140a223e145.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880236},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"The Top Ways Apps are Stopping Bots and Fake Accounts","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168907","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/the-top-ways-apps-are-stopping-bots-and-fake-accounts/\" title=\"The Top Ways Apps are Stopping Bots and Fake Accounts\"><img width=\"264\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-264x300.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"bots\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-264x300.png 264w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-632x719.png 632w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-141x160.png 141w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts.png 649w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" /></a></div><p>Every year, we spend more and more time on the Internet. With the arrival of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/from-polarization-to-open-learning-how-technology-can-help-us-beyond-covid-19/\">COVID19</a>, millions of people are using it from home more than before. From work to online shopping, social media, and dating, apps integrate with our lives in new ways all the time. But as more users join these apps and websites, where we go to consume content and interact with people become hubs for online scams, bots, and fake accounts.</p>\n<p>Campaigns that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/rise-of-scams-after-coronavirus-outbreak/\">prey on the trust of people</a> are rampant online. It might be advertising campaigns that astroturf social media websites with bots or fake accounts to make it look like a specific product is extremely popular. It could be fake emails from your bank asking you to reset your password. Unfortunately, these campaigns are quite lucrative for the scammers running them. In fact, people reported more than <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/federal.trade.commission#!/vizhome/FraudReports/FraudFacts\">250,000 cases of online scams</a> last year in the U.S. alone, with more than $300 million in damages.</p>\n<p>Of course, apps don’t want fake users and scammers on their platforms either. There’s an ever-evolving battle between malicious actors and the developers behind these apps. Below are some of the unique approaches developers use to detect fake users and get them off their platforms quickly and effectively.</p>\n<h2><b>Multi-Step Authentication</b></h2>\n<p>People who create spam bot accounts generally try to make many hundreds of accounts at the same time. Usually, this is because app users are able to detect fake accounts with ease. That means these developers want a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/06/how-to-choose-top-ios-app-development-tools/\">simple account creation</a> process that can be easily automated. Similarly, scammers want easy verification steps to speed up the process or brute-force hack their way onto already-existing apps easily. One way that apps are stopping quick account creation is through captcha and multiple account verification steps.</p>\n<p>By asking users for a password, then <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/06/04/two-factor-authentication-security-business/\">sending a security code to a device</a> owned by the person who knows the password, users can verify their identity quickly and securely so they can gain access. Some of the first major companies to adopt two-factor authentication included Wells Fargo. Now, most software companies and social media apps use it to make sure that your account is truly yours.</p>\n<p>For slowing down automated threats, platforms like Twitter and massively multiplayer online games like League of Legends require users to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/winning-against-bots-how-gaming-apps-can-fight-back/\">link accounts to other pre-existing accounts</a>. When you create an account, the service uses these existing accounts to verify your online presence and act as a way to observe human actions like clicking and typing during all sign-up steps.</p>\n<h2><b>Manual Review</b></h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that tech-based solutions are useful for stopping the majority of bad bots. But, sometimes stopping human-like bots takes a simpler solution – manual review of accounts. For example, Twitter and Facebook use automated systems as their first line of defense, <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/fake-accounts/\">but then flag certain accounts</a> for actual humans to look at. Using metrics collected by the account creation and posting system, reviewers can look through an account’s history to determine whether it has a particular agenda that’s related to other bot activity on the platform.</p>\n<p>For example, a set of accounts may be created on a similar date and post regularly about innocuous content. But then, they suddenly transition their posting style to one that matches a particular agenda. These accounts won’t be flagged by automatic systems early on because they won’t match the traditional flagging metrics. But, their later posts might be reported by other platform users. Manual reviewers are then able to determine if it’s a group of real people or a set of bot accounts.</p>\n<h2><b>Real-Time Verification</b></h2>\n<p>Some apps try to create real-life situations where people can meet up and interact in person. For example, Pokémon Go requires users to band together in a physical location so they can take down powerful, legendary Pokémon. Other dating and friend-making apps entirely rely on users to interact in-person to establish relationships. These types of apps have a unique problem. They must ensure their users are entirely real, so others can trust the app to find them safe social situations.</p>\n<p>Many of these apps use a significant amount of manual reviews to find fake users. But others use extensive verification and new, unique technology to do the same. Dating apps like <a href=\"https://hily.com/\">Hily</a> (Hey, I Like You) capture new user information by linking to pre-existing Facebook accounts and comparing uploaded photos to Facebook photos to ensure that the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/hily-dating-app-uses-ai-and-identification-to-improve-safety-and-potential-matches/\">same person is using both accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>Other social apps are now introducing <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/tinder-takes-on-fraudsters-by-asking-for-real-time-photo-1.4154237\">real-time photo requirements</a>. A real-time photo obligation involves snapping a current picture to compare against uploaded images (pictures). The goal is to use built-in technology to make the account creation process more challenging to automate. By requiring multiple verification steps, apps can curb scam accounts and increase user safety.</p>\n<h2><b>A Problem that Isn’t Going Way</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jboitnott.com/how-to-reduce-credit-score-damage-if-youre-a-victim-of-identity-theft/\">Online scams</a> and malicious bots will likely continue to increase in number as we devote more time and trust to Internet-based technology. But app creators and developers realize this and are taking necessary steps to develop better security systems.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs are testing many approaches, from detecting fake accounts through machine learning and facial recognition to manually reviewing user-flagged accounts. And, as nefarious tactics evolve, we’re likely to see even better methods to stop these spammers from succeeding.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Polina Zimmerman; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/the-top-ways-apps-are-stopping-bots-and-fake-accounts/\">The Top Ways Apps are Stopping Bots and Fake Accounts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 15:00:25 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-264x300.png","linkMd5":"36de1938a10fb37b54cc74629e70cba6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-787_fc4469717fef5126.webp","destWidth":264,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":125806,"destBytes":9162,"author":"John Boitnott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Top-Ways-Apps-are-Stopping-Bots-and-Fake-Accounts-264x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-787_fc4469717fef5126.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878347},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"AI Won’t Fix Education, but it Can Help","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168904","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/14/ai-wont-fix-education-but-it-can-help/\" title=\"AI Won’t Fix Education, but it Can Help\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"ai in education\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Now more than ever, our teachers need help. Faced with an unprecedented crisis of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/from-polarization-to-open-learning-how-technology-can-help-us-beyond-covid-19/\">having to move all instruction online in a matter of weeks</a>, everyone is figuring out the new playbook for teaching in the 21st century. Here is artificial intelligence, and education &#8212; AI won&#8217;t fix education, but it can help.</p>\n<p>One of the topics discussed, alongside video chats, online quizzes, and remote attendance is artificial intelligence. Indeed, it’s time to take a closer look at how AI can be helpful to our instructors today. But, the problem is that very few people understand AI.</p>\n<h4>Do you understand AI?</h4>\n<p>I do not mean that very few people understand the computer languages and algorithms that drive artificial intelligence, although that’s true for many. I mean that very few people understand the pattern of what “artificial intelligence” means to human beings in a macro sense.</p>\n<p>Not having an understanding of something as crucial to the future as artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/04/a-megatrend-set-to-disrupt-the-business-world/\">has consequences.</a> Those consequences will cross all of the business sectors, investment, technology, media, and will primarily be apparent when those sectors converge in a hype cycle or are thrust into the unknown.</p>\n<h2>We think AI is a solid thing.</h2>\n<p>We tend to think AI is a solid thing like a concrete construction. We believe that things are either <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/how-ai-at-the-edge-other-iot-trends-are-transforming-every-industry/\">AI or they are not AI</a>. But history demonstrates that’s not how it works. Depending on where we are on any given day, artificial intelligence is a moving target.</p>\n<p>Just having passed the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, it’s helpful to remember that at that time, the best minds in the world were working on the space effort. We thought that machines doing the heavy trigonometry and calculus required for guiding rockets would have to be “artificially intelligent.”</p>\n<h4><strong>Collectively, we thought, “this math is hard, you have to be very intelligent to do it,” so we surmised that machines doing this work were intelligent, thinking machines. </strong></h4>\n<p>We stopped thinking of them as being artificially intelligent once computers did fancy math faster and better than humans. Humans decided that what computers did was just advanced number crunching, and we <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/07/21/how-computer-code-has-changed-since-apollo-11-landed-on-the-moon/\">moved the goal post</a>.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, many smart people believed a computer couldn&#8217;t master the strategic and creative thinking in chess. We used to believe that chess was the ultimate intelligent endeavor.</p>\n<p>A computer that understood chess <em>had</em> to be intelligent. In the 1990s, computers began regularly beating the planet’s best chess masters. We accepted the fact then that intelligence didn&#8217;t win chess games. Computers dominated chess because they could cycle through many more potential moves far faster than any human.</p>\n<h4><strong>Suddenly, a machine that could win at chess was a specialized algorithm, not artificially intelligent. </strong></h4>\n<p>Similarly, the complexity of human speech was potentially beyond the reach of machines before Siri, Alexa, and Google brought speech recognition into our phones and homes. The idea that someone could say, “Alexa, order pizza,” and pizza would come to your door had to be powered by artificially intelligent computers that could understand and obey.</p>\n<p>But now we see speech recognition as just translating from soundwaves to text, and then processing the text with some simple rules, and there’s no “thinking” anywhere in the process. And as we’ve come to accept that, we’ve discounted it and moved the AI target again.</p>\n<h2>Understanding AI as being fluid</h2>\n<p>The point is that AI isn’t an object with a solid beginning point. It’s the next thing on the horizon, and today, that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/27/future-of-artificial-intelligence-for-2020/\">horizon looks very different.</a> Once we understand this “object” and what it does, once we accept it and understand it, we won’t think of it as AI anymore, and we’ll move on to the next goal in smart machinery.</p>\n<h4><strong>If history has taught us anything, we may never get to a place where we say, “Alright, that’s AI.” </strong></h4>\n<p>We won&#8217;t be able to recognize what AI is until we have machines that mimic or surpass human intelligence and reasoning. We refer to that kind of depth and breadth as “Artificial General Intelligence.” While this scenario will almost certainly happen &#8212; it’s a long way off.</p>\n<p>That does not mean we won’t develop <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-will-it-shape-up-the-future-of-the-internet/\">compelling solutions to complex problems</a>. The innovative products that come from complex issues will generally make our lives better. We will have plenty of those, probably at an accelerated pace now. The area of AI where I work, in education, offers good examples.</p>\n<h4>AI software.</h4>\n<p>We are, right now, working on software that can sort responses and help instructors <a href=\"https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-assignment-types\">assign grades to written coursework </a>at high speed and in great quantities.</p>\n<p>We are constantly improving teaching, learning, and course work. AI, as a tool is helpful particularly when you can’t meet with students personally. Other companies have developed computer tutors that can answer questions about certain subjects. These computers can also suggest the most helpful learning resources.</p>\n<p>Answering questions is extremely helpful when students aren’t in physical classrooms. They can&#8217;t raise their hands or ask classmates if they aren&#8217;t sitting, physically, in a certain space.</p>\n<h4>AI products.</h4>\n<p>The AI products are fundamentally filling some of the human activities of teaching. However, they do things that people can do so we think of them as being artificial or driven by AI. But like their chess-playing ancestors, the AI-enabled tutors and auto-graders won’t actually be thinking as a human would.</p>\n<h4>AI tutors.</h4>\n<p>These AI tutors comb through data, looking for patterns and similarities, and acting accordingly. And one day, we will eventually view these AI-enabled tools as commonly acceptable technology activities. We’ll start thinking of <i>grading </i>AI the way we think of <i>chess </i>AI, a tool to help us get better at or do something more efficiently.</p>\n<h2>AI is a tool</h2>\n<p>Knowing that AI is a tool leads us to another hangup about AI. It&#8217;s a tool &#8212; not a decision-maker. “Smart” computers may calculate and track the path of a projectile faster and more accurately than a person. But, AI cannot decide whether we should go to the moon.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in education, AI won’t replace teachers, with their ability to connect, inspire, and guide students to become better people. Instead, AI will make many tasks easier and faster as it did for NASA flight engineers 50 years ago.</p>\n<h4>AI is here &#8212; and it&#8217;s perpetually just around the corner.</h4>\n<p>The point is that AI isn’t something we’re waiting for since it’s both <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/10/16/futurists-cheat-sheet-artificial-intelligence/\">here already and perpetually around the next corner.</a> We can, and should, expect bread-and-butter shortcuts and solutions to things we think are complex or difficult. But that’s technology, not AI.</p>\n<p>We get technology. Tech is something we see, experience – a thing we can make and invest in. We can call it AI if we want. We probably just won’t call it that for very long.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/14/ai-wont-fix-education-but-it-can-help/\">AI Won’t Fix Education, but it Can Help</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 14 May 2020 15:00:14 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help.jpg","linkMd5":"35c30ec1086696746d8c464b43506a8c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-25-806_afc4853fe8523aed.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":52478,"destBytes":46036,"author":"Sergey Karayev","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AI-Won%E2%80%99t-Fix-Education-but-it-Can-Help-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-28-202_f18f1f87ad99a070.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877082},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","title":"How AI Will Help Eradicate Spam Backlinks","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166729","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam/\" title=\"How AI Will Help Eradicate Spam Backlinks\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Whilst governments attempt massive crackdown on email spammers via laws like GDPR, some of the world’s largest tech behemoths are working hard to eliminate email and link building tactics that sit on the negative end of the bell curve. But instead of regulating with punitive legal measures, they regulate via training their algorithms to learn, adapt and improve how they read, interpret and act against some of the internet’s most prolific backlink spammers. In short, the bots are getting closer to reasoning as humans would when it comes to identification of poor online content or tactics that add little to increase the value to actual users.</p>\n<p>As the bots get smarter, eventually even the <a href=\"https://seo.co/link-building-strategies/\">best backlink strategies</a>, if they are done manually, will be more easily detected by smarter, always-learning webcrawlers. Avoiding manual link building altogether is ill-advised, but extreme care should be taken when doing so, to ensure the path of least resistance is not a shady shortcut.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Early Days of Link Building Are Dead </strong></h2>\n<p>In the early days of the internet, a wild west land grab was truly afoot. In those days, simple exact match domains (EMDs) could be purchased, a few low-quality links thrown their way and voila: you’re ranking for high volume search queries.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the earliest days, there were no algorithmic checks for site gestation (often referred to as the “<a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-sandbox/\">Google Sandbox</a>”) that would keep sites’ rankings muted for months or longer, to ensure they were not wielding some fly-by-night, flash-in-the-pan business model for selling shady products/services.</p>\n<p>No, in those days, you could rank easily with a basic knowledge of SEO.</p>\n<p>Contrast that to today. A more mature internet means billions of pages of indexed content, including that number to the Nth degree of legitimate backlinks. In fact, <a href=\"https://techjury.net/stats-about/blogs-published-per-day#gref\">it is estimated</a> that some 4.4 million blog articles are posted daily.</p>\n<p>A more established internet also means that some sites have backlink profiles that are decades old, including millions of relevant inbound links. These types of signals are extremely strong to search engine spiders, allowing the big to get bigger and the small to stagnate without a whole lot of hustle.</p>\n<p>This is one reason why, when it comes to online marketing in competitive industries, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/20/why-we-shouldnt-be-in-love-with-startups/\">startups are in a perpetual state of playing catch-up</a> with larger, more seasoned rivals. It’s at least one reason why startups should <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/startups-dont-need-to-be-revolutionary-they-need-to-be-different/\">seek to differentiate</a>, not revolutionize the world.</p>\n<p>As early as a decade ago, startups had a better chance at competing by creating low quality content from link wheels, link farms, private blog networks, sitewide links, web directories and other tools for automatic link generation.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the users, today’s algorithms are getting better at outsmarting spam.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Search Engines Interpret Link Spam </strong></h2>\n<p>A year ago we experienced algorithmic blocks on emails that were incorrectly attributed to spam. The experience is not only a great case study in how legit sites can also get it wrong, but also how algorithms are now created with their own checks and balances to weed out bad actors.</p>\n<p>In this case, we had established new emails under a brand-new domain name, but these emails were attached to an established business, so several of the accounts which were tied to existing email sequences for marketing. These sequences were accustomed to sending more than 200 emails a day from automated marketing chains.</p>\n<p>However, due to the newness of the accounts anything over 50 emails started causing an automated throttle-down to occur with the server. This began occurring daily until the account was considered properly seasoned, which tool over a month. In the interim, even the folks in support could not help us get away from what was manually included in the algorithm.</p>\n<p>The machines had interpreted the account as 100% new, assuming that, as a new business account, it would not be normal to have larger numbers of emails sent immediately. We were told it was one of many failsafe layers included in the email algorithm, in order to prevent large-scale spam emails.</p>\n<p>Much like the automated email spam blocks, automating how search engine algorithms interpret spam is very similar. The algorithms look for patterns inherent and common among those building links in a spammy fashion. Here are just a few.</p>\n<p><strong>Link Velocity</strong> – How quickly are links being acquired? Are massive numbers of similar links being pointed to specific pages all at once has the growth in inbound links occurred more naturally over a more extended period?</p>\n<p><strong>Anchor Text &#38; IP Variability</strong> – Is your website using the same term over and over to rank for “buy used cars online”? Are your links coming from different IP addresses? How varied are those IPs?</p>\n<p><strong>Link Variability</strong> – Are there more incoming site links to specific pages targeting highly-competitive keywords? When it comes to outbound links, are there a good mix of both internal and external links from the site in question? Does each article being written include outbound links to other sites using commercial terms or are the links natural and pointing to pages relevant to the user experience that answer actual user queries? This also applies to sitewide links, including those in the footer or on a blog sidebar.</p>\n<p><strong>Co-Citation &#38; Applicability</strong> – Are references in specific articles applicable to other links referenced in the same article? Are sites whose theme or business typically revolve around travel suddenly linking to sites talking about CBD or insurance in a way that looks outlandishly like <a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-xu4j2-97d8b84?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&#38;utm_medium=dlink&#38;utm_source=w_share\">link spam</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>Domain &#38; IP History</strong> – Has the domain been owned by the same person or entity since inception? If not, when the shift occurred was there a simultaneous shift in the theme, content and industry sector of the site itself? Was there a major shift in how frequently the site was posting? Has the way the outbound links looked varied heavily?</p>\n<p><strong>Redirects</strong> – Unless a company is doing a complete rebrand, links that were once ranking on one site should not regularly be funneled to another site to pass link equity. If redirects are occurring, it is more natural to have them occur sitewide.</p>\n<p><strong>TLD Extension</strong> – Certain TLD extensions are more frequently used for creating spam. Top Level Domain extensions like .info, .biz and even .co have been nefarious for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Site Legitimacy</strong> – Illegitimate websites typically exclude things like social accounts with legitimate followers in tow. In contrast, links from real websites</p>\n<p>In each of the areas listed above, robot algorithms are getting better at understanding the real from the fake. They also are getting better at looking for patterns in what constitutes a spam backlink. In cases where a telling number of violations occur from any of the above, bots may trigger a manual review which could jeopardize the amount of time you have spent building out your SEO.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Misnomer of Negative SEO</strong></h2>\n<p>Ten years ago, a strategy known as “Google Bowling” was effectively implemented by competitors looking to tank sites ranking higher than them in the SERPs. In doing so, competitors could hire cheap contractors from sites like Fiverr to quickly impact the link profile of specific pages on a website using spam sites and manipulated links using phrases that only spammers might use.</p>\n<p>Lucky for most legitimate businesses, the algorithms can almost bat a thousand when it comes to completely ignoring links from heinous attacks like this.</p>\n<p>While such attacks are obvious, knowing how they occur and how manipulating link building occurs are one in the same. If you find someone manipulating their profile, it will be that much easier to use them as their own case study and find the pattern that can help to identify others doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>Find the pattern and you can find the offenders.</p>\n<h2><strong>How the Future Looks for Spam Link Builders </strong></h2>\n<p>The human, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">manual elements of SEO are quickly disappearing</a>. Yes, human’s currently control the bots that are making the decisions and humans are creating the content that is being consumed, but what happens when the algorithm gets smart enough when they know the links they are seeing look manipulative, unnatural or down right shady?</p>\n<p>More importantly, as search algorithms improve, they continue to place less emphasis on hyperlink-based signals in general, instead opting for user dwell time, bounce rates and direct user feedback. Consequently, even those who play by the rules when it comes to manual link building are also most likely to be demoted compared to competitors if the user experience is not at least at par.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam/\">How AI Will Help Eradicate Spam Backlinks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 22:55:53 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam.jpg","linkMd5":"3dbadf75ee3f2823af7656594fb93210","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-26-687_1def59f95ed06b63.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":122125,"destBytes":89582,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-link-building-spam-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-18-520_d4697b2540e3bdc1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195881216},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"How Will Autonomous Cars Affect Insurance?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171084","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/how-will-autonomous-cars-affect-insurance/\" title=\"How Will Autonomous Cars Affect Insurance?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM-300x199.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM-300x199.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM-241x160.png 241w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM.png 890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Autonomous cars aren&#8217;t a new concept. Almost all the major automakers are developing autonomous cars of some sort. Some, like Tesla’s Autopilot and Google’s Waymo, are already in use, though they&#8217;re not fully autonomous yet. Tesla and Waymo, like so many other automakers in the autonomous car race, are still ironing out the kinks.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, one of the biggest debates surrounding driverless cars is how they&#8217;ll impact the insurance industry. Human error accounts for 94% of road accidents, according to the <a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812115\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>. If human error causes almost all car accidents, then in theory, self-driving cars are the solution. But if self-driving technology succeeds in preventing car accidents, how will this affect car insurance?</p>\n<h2>Will Auto Insurance Still Be Necessary?</h2>\n<p>If autonomous cars make driving safer, will we still need insurance? The short answer: yes. Insurance is still necessary, but it will need to adapt. Technology may eliminate human error in driving, but tech isn&#8217;t infallible. Tesla already has a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/26/21154502/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crashes\">record of fatal car crashes</a> with its autopilot function.</p>\n<p>Self-driving cars operate by using a system of cameras, radar, laser sensors (called lidar), and other technology to assess road conditions and adjust driving behavior. <a href=\"https://waymo.com/tech/\">Waymo</a>, for instance, has cameras that can see up to three football fields in all directions. Waymo cars also have software that can predict the movement of everything in close proximity to the vehicle, including bicyclists and pedestrians. If any of those systems fail, it can result in a crash.</p>\n<p>Autonomous vehicles are undoubtedly going to be a game changer for the insurance industry. Here are three likely scenarios that will play out as the industry adapts to driverless cars:</p>\n<h2>1. Insurance Rates Will Drop</h2>\n<p>As we slowly progress toward fully autonomous cars, car accidents should decrease. With fewer accidents, insurance rates should drop.</p>\n<p>Fully autonomous won’t take to the roads overnight. The path to autonomous vehicles is gradually taking place across <a href=\"https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/\">five levels of automation</a>. Most cars today feature levels 1 or 2 automation: cruise control, electronic stability control, forward-collision warning, automated emergency braking, and self-parking. The <a href=\"https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/on-autopilot-into-the-future-the-audi-vision-of-autonomous-driving-9305/the-new-audi-a8-conditional-automated-at-level-3-9307\">Audi 8</a> was the first production car to reach level-3 automation.</p>\n<p>If we&#8217;re indeed headed toward a world of level-5 autonomous vehicles, there will be a period in which both human-operated and self-driving cars share the roads. The risk to insurers will still be high. As self-driving cars become commonplace and lead to lower rates, insurance companies will have to change their business model to survive.</p>\n<h2>2. Auto Manufacturers Will Be Held Liable</h2>\n<p>With self-driving cars, one of the big questions is what happens to the liability portion of your insurance policy? <a href=\"https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/insurance-guide/liability-insurance/\">Liability car insurance</a> covers injury to the other driver or damage to the vehicle, should you be at fault.</p>\n<p>With autonomous cars, the experts foresee that the liability in a crash would shift from the driver to the product. That means manufacturers and suppliers will be liable for accidents caused by a product defect in the car. Personal liability insurance may become obsolete altogether.</p>\n<p>Up until now, personal auto insurance has brought in a large chunk of insurance companies&#8217; revenue. The U.S. auto insurance industry <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/patricklin/2016/04/25/self-driving-cars-wont-kill-insurance-industry/#263b9f19746f\">generates around $220 billion</a> in annual revenue. It’s predicted that this could fall by a massive 60% by 2040. Autonomous vehicles are sure to play a role in declining revenue for the insurance industry as auto insurance premiums are slashed.</p>\n<p>This by no means signals the death of auto insurance. If a product, rather than a human, is responsible for an accident, it makes sense that the manufacturer should be held responsible. Shifting from consumer liability to manufacturer liability will keep the insurance industry afloat. The <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-self-driving-cars-and-insurance\">Insurance Information Institute</a> suggests that even local municipalities may be called upon to take responsibility when accidents involving self-driving cars occur in their jurisdictions.</p>\n<h2>3. No-Fault Liability May Become Standard</h2>\n<p>There’s no reason to think collisions will never happen in a world of self-driving cars. No-fault liability may become standard practice across all states in the U.S. for these types of claims. Faulty technology can cause crashes or cause your car to misjudge distances and hit another car or object. Insurance will still be required to repair damaged vehicles. And these repairs will be costly when high-tech components need replacing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, car crashes may decrease with autonomous vehicles, but other risk factors remain. Car break-ins and theft will still occur. Inclement weather and other road hazards will still present dangers. Insurance will still be needed for these risks.</p>\n<p>Self-driving cars are going to be a part of our future, and they&#8217;ll disrupt the current insurance model. Precisely how the insurance industry will change is still unclear. It is, however, a talking point on most insurance companies’ agendas. At this point, no one can say for sure how risky autonomous driving is. Until more solid evidence exists on safety, the shift is likely to be gradual as the insurance industry assesses the risk posed by self-driving vehicles.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/how-will-autonomous-cars-affect-insurance/\">How Will Autonomous Cars Affect Insurance?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM.png","linkMd5":"00bbbc8dd8a53f1e6249949e94c16246","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn2@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-814_31b8e4ba567e9d35.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM.png","destWidth":890,"destHeight":590,"sourceBytes":761339,"destBytes":43866,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-9.13.18-AM-300x199.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-14-920_e241b095fdc0194d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877747},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Best Ways to Use Credit Cards to Increase Your Credit Score","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173268","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/31/best-ways-to-use-credit-cards-to-increase-your-credit-score/\" title=\"Best Ways to Use Credit Cards to Increase Your Credit Score\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"increase your credit score\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>A plethora of websites may suggest to you a hoopla of best ways to increase your credit score but how successful are these tips and tricks, ever wondered? Your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/15/is-a-tech-based-social-credit-score-a-good-idea/\"><strong>credit score</strong> </a>reflects how well you use your credit and is thus, immensely important during the requirement of any kind of loan. It is, thereby, important to be aware of the factors that may affect your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/12/10-ways-your-credit-score-will-impact-your-financial-future/\"><strong>credit score</strong></a> as well as the measures that may improve it. I have brought you the best and some do it yourself ways on how to improve your <b>credit score in UAE</b> using <strong><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/27/what-does-your-credit-card-company-know-about-you/\">your credit cards</a></strong>.</p>\n<h2><b>Ensure that you pay your credit card monthly bills on time</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A history of late payments and other delinquent behavior can have a strong negative effect on your credit scores for many years.</li>\n<li>To avoid missing your due date, set a reminder on your phone a few days beforehand or mark the date on your calendar. You can also adjust your online account settings to always automatically pay at least the minimum required amount each month.</li>\n<li>Or, better yet, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/20/how-ai-technologies-help-banks-and-fintech-startups/\">set up automatic payments</a> to pay the full new statement balance each month. To avoid heavy interest rates, you must pay the bill in full.</li>\n<li>This can help you both stay out of credit card debt and avoid interest completely with most cards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Keep your credit card utilization low</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit scoring models look at how much of your available credit you’re using on each credit card in UAE, and how much of your total credit limit is being used across all cards.</li>\n<li>They do this by calculating the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/03/increasing-business-credit-the-safe-and-smart-way/\">percentage of your credit limit</a> you’re using, as reflected on your credit reports. This percentage is called ‘credit utilization.’</li>\n<li>Using a high percentage of your credit limit is seen as very risky. It may indicate that you’re overextended financially and may have trouble paying your bills as a result.</li>\n<li>Generally, the lower your credit utilization, both overall and on each individual account, the better it is for your score.</li>\n<li>So, opening a new card or increasing the credit limits of cards you already have could potentially have a large positive impact on your credit scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Avoid applying for many credit cards in a short period of time</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Opening many new accounts in a short period of time can be seen as risky financial behavior because it looks like you’re in need of money and are acting recklessly.</li>\n<li>This ‘new credit’ factor considered in your credit scores is where the number of inquiries and length of time since your most recent inquiry comes into play. The length of time since you last opened an account can also be factored in here.</li>\n<li>While every new inquiry and every new account won’t automatically have a negative impact on your scores, there’s always a possibility that it could. Many hard inquiries can have a negative effect on your credit scores.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Increase the length of your credit card history</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The older your credit history, the better. If you established accounts a long time ago and have been able to manage them responsibly, that demonstrates to lenders that you’re less risky than someone who doesn’t have a very long credit history.</li>\n<li>If you take the length of time each of your accounts has been open and average them together, that’s the average length of your credit history. This average is considered in credit scores because you’re seen as less risky to lenders the longer your accounts have been open. The ages of your newest and oldest accounts are also considered.</li>\n<li>When you open a new credit card and already have some older credit cards, you’ll reduce the average age of your accounts. This could potentially have a negative effect on your scores.</li>\n<li>There are two potential ways to improve your credit scores within this category. First, you can wait for the accounts on your reports to age. You should be careful about adding new credit accounts because every time you do you’ll reduce the average age of your accounts.</li>\n<li>Second, you can ask a loved one to add you to an existing, older credit card account as an authorized user. If you’re added onto an older account with positive payment history, it might increase your average age of accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the <b>best credit card in UAE</b> (moneymall) has a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/04/25/examining_the_future_of_mobile_money_part_2/\">direct influence on the most important factors </a>that go into establishing your credit score. So getting a credit card and using it regularly and responsibly is one of the quickest and most effective ways to build or rebuild your credit score. We hope that you will follow these guidelines for the effective use of your credit card.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/31/best-ways-to-use-credit-cards-to-increase-your-credit-score/\">Best Ways to Use Credit Cards to Increase Your Credit Score</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 15:01:04 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score.jpg","linkMd5":"b41c99a7004f031a0bae554e58c06263","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-010_c38e56ab1733d369.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":36549,"destBytes":29358,"author":"Aashirvad Kumar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Best-Ways-to-Use-Credit-Cards-to-Increase-Your-Credit-Score-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn64@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-19-253_79a18ca287abd75a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872336},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"The Three Keys to Working from Home","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172058","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/04/the-three-keys-to-working-from-home/\" title=\"The Three Keys to Working from Home\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"keys working from home\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Three-Keys-to-Working-from-Home.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Companies across the globe are unexpectedly embracing <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/thanks-covid-remote-work-is-now-mandatory/\">working from home </a>out of necessity. In fact, according to a recent<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/306695/workers-discovering-affinity-remote-work.aspx\"> Gallup Poll, </a>62% of employed Americans currently say they have worked from home during the crisis.</p>\n<p>At Open Raven, we were founded and remain a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/07/remote-first-why-isnt-every-company-boundaryless/\">100% remote team</a>. There’s no shortage of great resources and tips available for working remotely, but in my experience, there are three big topics that determine team and personal success when working from home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Getting communication right.</li>\n<li>Understanding and neutralizing negativity bias.</li>\n<li>Structuring your day.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, other stuff matters. However, if you do these three things well, you and your business have a good chance of being successful even if you don’t nail everything else.</p>\n<h2><b>1. Getting Communications Right</b></h2>\n<p>If you were to rate the percentage of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/big-data-in-the-telecommunications-ecosystem/\">communication</a> that was the actual “content” (e.g., the words, slides, etc.), what would it be? Well, according to a famous study by <a href=\"https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/page/mehrab\"> Dr. Mehrabian</a>, less than 10% of communication is verbal.</p>\n<p>Think about it: If you’re talking on the phone, you can get your words across, at least, with your voice tone. What about facial expressions, gestures, or posture? Only having the verbal aspect of a conversation and no non-verbal signals means that you’re losing at least half of the intended meaning.</p>\n<p>Add <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/13/7-critical-time-management-skills-to-boost-your-productivity/\">multi-tasking</a> into the mix where people are distracted and not listening to verbal communication; it results in poor communication. Not to mention the absence of a personal connection between both parties.</p>\n<h3>To help communication in a remote work setting, we need to recognize that there are different types of meetings – “formal” meetings and “informal” meetings – and each meets different needs.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Formal Meetings – </b>are a small group of people focused on a predetermined topic. There is no magical solution to replace traditional formal meetings when everyone is remote, but <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/the-modern-workplace-demands-better-visibility/\">modern video conferencing</a> restores much of the fidelity lost when in-person contact isn’t possible. Notably, it brings back facial expressions, gestures, and posture.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Informal Meetings – </b>These are unscheduled conversations. Video conferencing can simulate an in-person meeting, but it does a poor job of replacing the impromptu conversations that are the mainstay of “ informal meetings. ” Since these are low-risk conversations, I find a simple phone call is fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make these better, I find it helpful to have a loose agenda that touches on how things are going, what the person you’re talking to is working on currently if they feel like they need anything they’re not getting at the moment, and so on. It’s also helpful to keep these to 15-20 minutes and try to do these calls walking outside or at least away from the distraction of your laptop screen.</p>\n<p>Further, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/3-ways-you-can-empower-your-remote-employees/\">virtual team lunches</a>, happy hours, or other unstructured time with each other can help offset the time you would have typically had in-person to help forge and maintain bonds with one another.</p>\n<h2><b>2. Understanding and Neutralizing Negativity Bias</b></h2>\n<p>As humans, we all have the subconscious tendency to exaggerate the negative and downplay the positive. If you are unfamiliar with it, this phenomenon is well documented as “<a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618\">the negativity bias</a>.”</p>\n<p>When you’re not face-to-face in an office, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/05/remote-working-culture-the-facts-business-owners-need-to-know/\">you&#8217;re working from home</a>, you’re relegated to lower fidelity conversations (e.g., Slack versus a watercooler conversation). Out of visual contact leaves you interpreting communications much more than you have to do in person. With negativity bias, instead of giving the other person the benefit of the doubt, your natural instinct is to assume the worst. Simply stated, the extra “white space” you have when working remote is far too easy to fill with negativity.</p>\n<h3>To offset negativity bias in a remote setting, I recommend you do the following:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Be clear about tone –</b> State your intent. Assume it won’t be clear otherwise. Leave less whitespace by exaggerating the positive and use emojis or whatever suits you to clarify statements.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Celebrate and savor the good moments –</b> Let them burn into your brain. Give yourself, others, and the whole team credit. Build a reservoir of positive thoughts to draw from.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Give the benefit of the doubt –</b> Our own internal narrative is more often the culprit of perceived negativity rather than the intent of the other person. So try to refrain from premature judgment.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Breathe – </b>Count to 10 deep breaths, use the Apple Breathe feature for a couple of minutes, or <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/decrease-stress-by-using-your-breath/art-20267197\">whatever works for you</a>. It will reduce the impact of stress-based reactions and diminish the exaggerated responses that come so easy today, given the mountain of extra stress we are all feeling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. <b>Structuring Your Day</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/15/new-data-shows-covid-shifts-newly-remote-work-behavior/\">Before</a>, when you would leave your home to go into an office, you had a clear cognitive signal of when the workday began and the same signal when you would leave work. Now, when you’re working from home instead of in a separate, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/03/how-tech-startups-succeed-with-a-fully-remote-model/\">designated workspace</a> like a company office, both the start and end signals are gone.</p>\n<p>Your regular morning routine and the drive for getting ready evaporates since you’re “just staying at home.” If you do nothing to create a structure for your day, the most natural outcome is haphazard attention to how you look and feel. When the start of your workday is signaled by when you first check your phone in the early morning and then drag on well through the evening with no clear end, it can cause fatigue or even burnout.</p>\n<p>On top of losing traditional start/stop signals that were previously tied to your external workplace, people can no longer meet ad hoc. As a result, everything turns into a scheduled meeting. Your calendar is now packed tight.</p>\n<h3>To help take back control of your daily schedule, I propose the following:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>No meetings longer than 45 minutes</b> – The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/03/connected-digital-assistants-will-change-the-way-we-work/\">15 minutes between meetings</a> will allow you to attend to biological realities and enable you to mentally shift gears between meetings. It also means that if one meeting runs a little over, you’re not always running late, trying to catch up for the remainder of the day.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Force empty space into your schedule</b> – The way I personally use this technique is by working in the early morning (my “priming time”) and then stopping to exercise, often by myself, with music playing on my headphones (no lyrics). I find this gives me optimal chances at solving thorny problems when I return to my work later in the morning.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Treat mental energy as a fixed resource</b> – The idea here is that you only have so much cognitive power each day, and once you use it, it’s gone. At some point, you’ve burned through all your high potency brainpower, and you’re then stuck with gut-level decision making where your biases are primarily in control of your thinking. So how can you make sure to use your best energy for your most significant opportunities or to tackle the most prominent problems? <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/8-reasons-to-implement-an-mft-strategy/\">Schedule it</a> early in the day and protect the time. Save the easy stuff (email, calendaring, expenses, etc.) for later when you know you’ll be working with less mental savvy.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Start using a shutdown sequence</b> – <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/\">Cal Newport </a>has a method he uses for turning off work for the day that can help reestablish your evening boundary.

You’re on a work trip to a new location. You’re starving.</p>\n<p>How do you find a place to eat?</p>\n<p>Your options include a physical map, and maybe if you’re lucky, you run into a stranger who can give you a recommendation.</p>\n<p>Now let’s fast forward a few decades and alas &#8212; the world gifts you the internet. But the world doesn&#8217;t stop there.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the world gives you the internet through a portable device &#8212; your mobile phone. How equipped are you now to find a place to eat?</p>\n<p>And if things couldn’t get any better. Now the world’s given you voice search.</p>\n<h2>What is a voice search?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/21/is-voice-search-the-next-big-travel-technology-trend/\">Voice search</a> is a convenient alternative to traditional text-based searches.</p>\n<p>Now, twiddling your thumbs for an answer is more convenient than figuring your way around a physical map. But let’s face it &#8212; We’re now in the 20th century and searching for answers through <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/a-web-developers-new-best-friend-is-the-ai-waiting-to-be-utilized/\">text-based queries</a> isn’t the most convenient thing.</p>\n<p>We needed a more natural search &#8212; because we are searching while we’re trying to exercise or do the dishes. What’s a step above text-based queries on the convenience scale? Well, something hands-free. And that&#8217;s where voice search comes in.</p>\n<p>Voice search became a thing, and now there are about one billion <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/28/the-potential-impact-of-voice-enabled-tech-in-2020/\">voice searches</a> done per month. We know voice search is growing at a super-fast rate because of the convenience factor. But how does this affect SEO rankings in 2020?</p>\n<h2>5 Ways to Optimize SEO Rankings with Voice Search</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Optimize for questions.</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Compared to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/a-web-developers-new-best-friend-is-the-ai-waiting-to-be-utilized/\">text-based queries</a>, voice queries are more likely to be in a question format. This not only means that you need the best answers, but it means you need to know the right questions. What are the right questions? The questions your audience is asking, of course.</p>\n<p>When looking for coffee, consider the query from a typical text searcher :</p>\n<p>“bar miami.”</p>\n<p>Now consider the query from a voice searcher:</p>\n<p>“What’s the best bar in Miami?”</p>\n<p>Make sure to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/top-tips-to-increase-website-conversions/\">optimize your website</a> and content to answer the more specific questions.</p>\n<p>If you need some help learning what your audience is asking, there is plenty of resources out there. One way to learn is by using tools like FAQFox, which allows you to see <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/9-ways-to-refresh-your-companys-image-without-spending-a-fortune/\">what your target audience</a> is asking just by answering a few questions yourself.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Optimize local SEO.</strong></h4>\n<p>Compared to a text-based search, voice search on mobile is 3x more likely to be local-based. On top of that, between 2018-2019, 58% of consumers found local businesses using voice search.</p>\n<p>You don’t need a degree in statistics to understand that it’s so crucial to optimizing local SEO in 2020. You can do this by learning it on your own or by looking for a local <a href=\"https://www.ambientetechnologies.com/effective-seo-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online SEO services agency</a> in your area. If you’re looking to do it on your own, a few quick things you can do is to make sure your business address is displaying correctly on search engines and to learn about structured data and schema mark-up.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Answer questions directly and conversationally.</strong></h4>\n<p>A shift to a more natural language has become evident with voice search. With voice search, people conversationally ask questions, as if talking to a friend. Conversational voice means the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/01/ultimate-guide-for-voice-search-optimization-in-2019/\">user wants and expects answers back</a> in the same way.</p>\n<p>Can you imagine you meet a lady who owns a yoga studio, and you ask her, “Hey, what are the health benefits of yoga?” and she replies, “Yoga has lots of health benefits. So many successful people do it. Here’s my business card. It has a link to my website where you can watch a 15-minute video on why you should do yoga.”</p>\n<p>Kind of annoying, right? You still don&#8217;t have an answer to your question.</p>\n<p>You have a million and one things competing for your attention, so you most likely will either stop caring about the answer to that question or look elsewhere for a quick response.</p>\n<p>In an analysis of 850,000 queries, it shows that Google served a direct answer <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/2919092/how-voice-search-and-google-direct-answers-are-changing-seo.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">19.5% of the time</a>, so there’s an apparent preference by Google for immediate responses. Don&#8217;t beat around the bush with the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/12/communication-re-imagined-with-emotion-ai/\">answers to the questions</a> your audience is asking.</p>\n<p>Don’t be a Yoga girl.</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Use long-tail keywords.</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s no secret that it’s harder and longer to type than it is to talk. So naturally, voice searches tend to be longer than text-based searches.</p>\n<p>Think about the past. If you were <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/25/how-voice-assistant-marketing-can-future-proof-your-brand/\">searching for coffee</a>, you’d put in a query similar to “coffee best.” Now since talking is easier, you’re more likely to put in a longer question such as “where’s the best coffee in Miami?”</p>\n<p>Use this to your advantage and make sure to include these longer tailed keywords in your site. This can be something simple like “We’ve been told that we’re the best coffee in Miami.”</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget, people expect answers quickly, so if you provide solutions by making them have to jump through hoops to find what they’re looking for, they won’t like you. And <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-search-in-2020/\">if your audience doesn’t like you,</a> Google will not like you. If Google doesn’t like you, you won’t rank favorably in the search pages.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Make your site secure.</strong></h4>\n<p>There are so many benefits for making your site secure (HTTP vs. HTTPS), but I’ll list only two of them as it appeals to SEO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 65% of the results from voice search are websites that are HTTPS.</li>\n<li>HTTPS makes your site faster, which is a super important factor in SEO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Need I say more?</p>\n<p>I believe not.</p>\n<h4><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h4>\n<p>It’s no secret that we love convenience. Trends prove this. Just think about Uber, Amazon, and Airbnb. What do they all have in common?</p>\n<p>They’ve <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/04/12/3-major-ways-tech-is-making-your-life-more-convenient/\">made things more convenient</a> for you and everyone with voice-search. Now, think of voice search as the Uber of the search industry. Voice search will revolutionize SEO in 2020 and moving forward.</p>\n<p>Now you know five ways to capitalize on the voice search movement. Don&#8217;t try to do all five right away; just pick one and get started today.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/07/impact-of-voice-search-on-seo-rankings-in-2020-5-tips-to-optimize/\">Impact of Voice Search on SEO rankings in 2020: 5 Tips to Optimize</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 07 Mar 2020 16:00:48 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Impact-of-Voice-Search-on-SEO-rankings-in-2020.png","linkMd5":"3757a46156f275e2211969dfd3236e9f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-25-886_b847c6bca768df7d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Impact-of-Voice-Search-on-SEO-rankings-in-2020.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":287773,"destBytes":16052,"author":"Harmanjit Kaur","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Impact-of-Voice-Search-on-SEO-rankings-in-2020-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-12-231_017b6e99319cf198.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880419},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"Is AI Contributing to Climate Change and Delaying People Coming out of Poverty?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172057","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/12/is-ai-contributing-to-climate-change-and-delaying-people-coming-out-of-poverty/\" title=\"Is AI Contributing to Climate Change and Delaying People Coming out of Poverty?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"AI delaying people in poverty\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>AI has become the buzzword of the world, and an integral part of almost every company’s digital transformation agenda.

In light of these assumptions, it&#8217;s no wonder that <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html\">PwC forecasts</a> that A.I. could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.</p>\n<p>While the whole world is optimistic about AI-led use cases and championing huge investments, one thing is probably getting far less attention than it ideally should: AI – induced climate change.</p>\n<h3>Artificial intelligence advancement needs two key ingredients (other than passion):</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tons of training data.</strong>\n<p>Machine learning models are nothing if there is no historical data to train them. Example, to train computer vision models to detect, identify and label objects that they see if a photo or a video, they need to be trained on corresponding, labeled and annotated data first for elongated periods of time, till they begin to use the learnings to then identify objects they might have seen before.</li>\n<li><strong>Correspondingly a lot of storage and computing power.\n<p></strong> Now, multiply this with millions of use cases companies are developing using computer vision to detect, identify, label, and then predict some, to get an idea of the amount of infrastructure being used.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At a very conservative level, there were more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/941054/number-of-ai-companies-worldwide-by-country/\">4000* companies around the world in 2018</a>, and growing, dedicated to developing one or more specific uses cases using AI to automate human work in one form or another<strong>.</strong></p>\n<h4>What these 2 ingredients mean is that humungous amounts of energy requirements to store, backup and feature engineer this training data.</h4>\n<p>To give you an idea, few brainy folks @ University of Massachusetts Amherst measured that an average car produces 126,000 pounds of Co2 over its lifetime. Training a single transformer model to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy with 1 GPU over a neural architecture requires energy that would produce 626,000 pounds of Co2.</p>\n<p>That amount of Co2 is approximately equal to about 5 cars running their engines altogether for 10 years. That stat is teaching us that merely to train a single transformer model for AI is 5 cars running for 10 years.</p>\n<p>Extrapolating this to model building and training showing that those 4000+ AI companies are doing 24/7, it’s mind-boggling to see equivalent Co2 production and also the energy diversion towards ML training.</p>\n<h2>3 obvious questions arise.</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>How ethical is this AI process &#8212; especially when more than 940 Mn people in the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/energy-access\">world do not have access to electricity</a>?</li>\n<li>When corporations say they support ‘green’ initiatives, how credible is that statement, when the same corps invest billions into AI? How is it possible to be still green when you invest in AI research? Google seems to be interesting– it uses 56% of its total power needs via renewable sources of energy. In comparison, Microsoft is at about 32% and Amazon at 17%. (Cook et al., 2017.)</li>\n<li>Is AI progression worth it, given the climate change impact due to such levels of Co2 production &#38; energy diversion away from the lower sections of society?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The counterargument that AI progression is creating more jobs.</h4>\n<p>So we have the counterargument that AI progression is creating more jobs and helping countries achieve a higher GDP and per capita rate. Is this a valid claim? Yes, but what remains to be examined closely is whether this is indeed new job creation or re-skilling existing manpower.</p>\n<p>The argument with every wave of technology, from the automatic weaving looms of the early industrial revolution to the computers of today, is that jobs are not destroyed, but rather an employment shifts from one place to another as entirely new categories of employment are created.</p>\n<p>The Luddites might have wrecked the mills as a protest against machine-enabled automation, but today, those same workers would be defending manufacturing against the disappearance of those jobs.</p>\n<h4>So are these additional jobs helping lift individuals out of poverty?</h4>\n<p>More importantly, are the additional jobs &#8212; if any. Are these supposed extra jobs actually lifting people out of poverty? Can someone work and finally have the money to finally get access to electricity? My thought is &#8212; is this the same electricity they could have had in the first place &#8212; had it not been diverted for purposes of advancing AI? Think about it.</p>\n<h3>Climate Change</h3>\n<p>Perhaps, the most fundamental of all is &#8212; What is it with AI that we can achieve that’s MORE important and precious than preserving our climate?</p>\n<p>Is investing in AI a really good bet for a socially responsible leadership? I don’t have an answer to this, but am often intrigued by this question.</p>\n<p><strong> I interestingly belong to that category of the society which has been propagating the cause of AI, and I am at my wit’s end to find balance against this question. Please weight in with your thoughts on this subject. I&#8217;d love to hear from you. </strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>These are personal views, and do not represent those of my current or previous employers.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Top Image Credit: Denniz Futalan; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/12/is-ai-contributing-to-climate-change-and-delaying-people-coming-out-of-poverty/\">Is AI Contributing to Climate Change and Delaying People Coming out of Poverty?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 18:00:01 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty.jpg","linkMd5":"5456c2ef73a01ffa82f0303ec823fe03","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-359_5d605138de4238df.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":853,"sourceBytes":200057,"destBytes":110802,"author":"Amit Arora","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Is-AI-Delaying-People-Coming-out-of-Poverty-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-16-818_d1a5486c6ea73873.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/global-electricity-access-map.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-877_d1ad4e19bb67a96d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873642},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"5 Ways Mobile Devices are the Biggest Threat to Cybersecurity","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=165752","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/5-ways-mobile-devices-are-the-biggest-threat-to-cybersecurity/\" title=\"5 Ways Mobile Devices are the Biggest Threat to Cybersecurity\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-Ways-Mobile-Devices-are-the-Biggest-Threat-to-Cybersecurity-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"mobile threat cybersecurity\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-Ways-Mobile-Devices-are-the-Biggest-Threat-to-Cybersecurity-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-Ways-Mobile-Devices-are-the-Biggest-Threat-to-Cybersecurity-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-Ways-Mobile-Devices-are-the-Biggest-Threat-to-Cybersecurity.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Over time, mobile devices have experienced rapid development.

However, malware attacks on smartphones are fast evolving; an example of this is seen with <a href=\"https://www.enigmasoftware.com/zitmo-zeus-in-the-mobile-trojan-attacks-android-blackberry-smartphones/\">ZitMo</a> “Zeus-in-the-Mobile.”</p>\n<p>ZitMo malware is targeted mainly on Android operator’s bank apps; it attempts to bypass the two-factor authentication of the bank application, steal credentials and gain access to bank accounts, which could ultimately be disastrous for the victims.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b> Social Networking and Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Applications</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Smartphones do numerous activities, like sending emails, storing contact information, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/06/small-business-cybersecurity-threats-and-how-to-fix-the-fox/\">passwords, and other vital data</a>. In addition to this, smartphones are devices of choice when it comes to social networking; thus, mobile applications for social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) are another breeding ground for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/27/3-amazing-strategies-that-will-burst-cybercrimes-in-2020/\">cyber attackers</a> to gain personal data from smartphone users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/12/todays-social-platforms-are-dangerous-can-mappen-build-a-safer-one/\">Social networking sites</a> are host to a surplus of personal data. That is why <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/02/15/juniper_mobile_malware_increased_155_in_2011/\">malicious applications </a>use social networking sites to steal data and yield severe consequences.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b> Smartphones Permissions</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Smartphones use permission mechanisms to determine what users are allowed to do in applications. The permissions are achieved through the &#8220;manifest permission&#8221; that grant these permissions to the applications independently. In turn, this process will allow an application to run independently from each other as well as from the operating system.</p>\n<p>However, the capability of allowing applications to seek permission outside of their sandbox capabilities could be harmful to smartphones because it creates an opportunity for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/12/is-your-vpn-masking-your-online-privacy-or-exploiting-your-data-6-ways-to-find-out/\">malware to exploit</a> the ability to access sensitive data on Android handsets and thus install malicious software.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b> Smart Mobile Web Browsers</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Web browsers are the most commonly used <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/27/the-significant-role-of-smartphones-in-human-lives/\">applications on smartphones</a>; they are used to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/08/detecting-and-protecting-against-ransomware-best-practice-for-2020/\">gain access to the internet</a>.

It powers our ever-present digital assistants; it helps recommend entertainment options and has even begun to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/15/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-global-logistics-and-supply-chain-management/\">reshape the way</a> businesses carry out their everyday operations. As AI moves further into healthcare, regulatory challenges await.</p>\n<p>The truth is, there isn&#8217;t a single major industry that isn&#8217;t being changed by the rapid development of AI-powered technology. There is one, though, that stands out among all others: healthcare.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/smart-cities-solving-todays-healthcare-challenges/\">global healthcare industry</a> arguably has more to gain from advances in AI than any other industry. It&#8217;s already being put to use in aiding diagnoses, monitoring patient health data to look for early warning signs of disease, and managing medication doses and prescriptions.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s even proven adept at <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/27/did-you-know-that-artificial-intelligence-could-predict-your-death/\">predicting patient mortality</a>. At the same time, however, the adoption of AI into healthcare carries some unique risks not found elsewhere – owing to the fact that any missteps can cost lives.</p>\n<p>That reality is rapidly setting up a conflict between the multitude of businesses that seek to develop healthcare-focused AI solutions. The regulators tasked with making sure the industry always puts the safety of patients first may have a problem.</p>\n<p>As an overview of what&#8217;s happening with AI and healthcare &#8212; here&#8217;s a look at the ways that healthcare AI solutions are pushing the regulatory envelope. The challenges it <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/internet-of-things-makes-it-easier-to-steal-your-data/\">creates for regulators to solve</a>.</p>\n<h2>Securing the Underlying Data</h2>\n<p>To begin with, AI solutions don&#8217;t work in a vacuum. They rely on complex infrastructures that bring together a variety of data sources from several disparate providers. When it comes to the healthcare industry that data may come from <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/improving-responses-to-medical-device-vulnerabilities/\">medical practices</a>, hospitals, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/10/myia-healths-partnership-with-mercy-virtual-window-into-continuous-care/\">drug makers</a>, insurers, and any number of other intermediaries.</p>\n<p>The first challenge is in designing medical data integrations that adhere to existing medical privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the <a href=\"https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/europes-gdpr-privacy-law-coming-heres-what-us-health-orgs-need-know\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) in the EU.</p>\n<p>The problem, as it relates to regulation, is the fact that there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all standardized platform to handle medical data. Most of what&#8217;s already in use or in development consists of custom database solutions that were never designed to be interoperable.</p>\n<p>That makes every link between such systems a<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/04/artificial-intelligence-forecasts-for-2020/\"> potential privacy nightmare</a>. That alone will require some time to remedy, and there&#8217;s no telling what the ultimate solution will be. In addition, when you add AI to this mix, things get even more muddled.</p>\n<p>For example, many of today&#8217;s medical AI systems have used real-world patient data to learn how to do their intended functions. That data is normally anonymized before being used for machine learning purposes, but studies have already confirmed that it&#8217;s often possible for such data <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2719130?resultClick=3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to be re-associated</a> with the people who generated it. That means there&#8217;s still a major data privacy concern even after current standards are applied to prevent one, and regulators are going to have to come up with entirely new guidelines for and oversight of new medical data sharing platforms and how they handle sensitive information.</p>\n<h2>Approving a Moving Target</h2>\n<p>Another regulatory challenge that current medical AI developments are creating is the fact that they&#8217;re distinctly different from all previous devices, medications, and technologies that have come before.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s because the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/01/4-high-potential-sectors-for-ai-and-ml-startup-success/\">latest AI solutions</a> in the medical field are being designed to learn as they gain exposure to new patient data in order to hone their ability to make diagnoses, assist doctors, or suggest treatments.</p>\n<p>That means the capabilities, safety, and efficacy of some of the newest medical AI solutions can&#8217;t be assessed a single time for regulators to grant approvals.</p>\n<p>Unlike medications and standard medical devices, applied <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/06/6-industries-blockchain-technology-will-revolutionize/\">AI in medicine is a moving target</a>. Whereas a non-AI device can undergo thorough testing and gain approval, an AI&#8217;s performance may be different the day after its undergone testing. What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s no telling if the performance differences will make it work better or worse.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why regulators like the US&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have thus far only started to approve locked-algorithm solutions <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-artificial-intelligence-based-device-detect-certain-diabetes-related-eye?utm_campaign=PR_FDA%20permits%20AI%20device%20for%20diabetes%20eye%20problems&#38;utm_medium=email&#38;utm_source=Elo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like IDX Technologies&#8217; IDx-DR eye scanner</a>.</p>\n<p>When medical AI has the ability to learn, however, all of the existing approval processes no longer suffice. To tackle the problem, the FDA has already proposed a <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2019/04/fda-proposes-regulations-ai-powered-medical-devices/156109/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whole new regulatory framework</a> to deal with AI in medical applications. It would include a preapproval process that would allow manufacturers some leeway in what changes (or how much machine learning) would be permissible without re-approval. In addition, it would require manufacturers to submit ongoing performance data to the agency so they can intervene if necessary. That, however, will require a drastic increase in manpower at the FDA – and nobody&#8217;s sure if they&#8217;ll get it.</p>\n<h2>Dealing with Black Boxes</h2>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_165890\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-165890\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-165890 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ai-healthcare-black-box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ai-healthcare-black-box.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ai-healthcare-black-box-300x167.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ai-healthcare-black-box-260x144.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-165890\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: taa22 / Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Just as it&#8217;s the case in the broader world of AI development, regulators of healthcare AI solutions are going to have to grapple with the prevalence of black-box AI software. AI seems to present a double-edged sword in healthcare. If we restrict developers from protecting their work too much, and innovation stops.</p>\n<p>However, let devs have free reign, and there won&#8217;t be any way to know if the approaches in use are what&#8217;s best for the patients that will rely on the technology.</p>\n<p>To solve that problem, regulators are going to have to strike a delicate balance that allows developers some means of protecting trade secrets while providing enough transparency to allow for thorough vetting of healthcare algorithms. That&#8217;s going to require regulators across a variety of agencies to bring high-level AI developers into the fold, as they&#8217;ll be the only ones qualified to figure out what the AI solutions are doing and why.</p>\n<p>Those developers will also need a medical or research background to be able to comprehend the medical aspects of the technology. That in itself is a problem because there aren&#8217;t too many people that can satisfy both requirements at present, and there&#8217;s no existing program designed to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/01/4-high-potential-sectors-for-ai-and-ml-startup-success/\">produce such experts</a>.</p>\n<h2>A World of Innovation Complications</h2>\n<p>Although it is certain that AI holds the power to revolutionize almost everything about the modern healthcare industry, the regulatory issues identified here must be solved if it&#8217;s to happen in a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/08/detecting-and-protecting-against-ransomware-best-practice-for-2020/\">safe and controlled manner</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/08/ways-enhanced-technology-has-changed-the-nature-of-business/\">Regulatory issues</a> will require something of a parallel revolution to take place within the relevant regulatory bodies that oversee the industry. It&#8217;s going to take new approaches, expanded oversight, and the development of a new generation of medical AI experts. Needless to say, paying for all of the regulations won&#8217;t be a trivial matter, either.</p>\n<p>For all of those reasons, it&#8217;s easy to foresee that the required changes are not going to happen overnight. There isn&#8217;t a roadmap for regulators or developers to follow, and that means they&#8217;ll have to blaze a trail together into healthcare&#8217;s AI-powered future.</p>\n<p>Blazing a trail means the need for all sides to be cautious and take the time to get things right on the first try may prove to be the ultimate limiting factor in AI&#8217;s spread into the industry. That, of course, is how it should be.</p>\n<p>After all, the consequences of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/11/outsource-or-automate-how-to-strategically-take-tasks-off-your-plate/\">failure to regulate</a> would be dire and irreversible &#8212; and in healthcare, there are real human lives that hang in the balance.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/13/ai-moving-into-healthcare-regulatory-challenges-await/\">AI Moving into Healthcare, Regulatory Challenges Await</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 18:00:28 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-Moving-into-Healthcare-Regulatory-Challenges-Await.jpg","linkMd5":"c1095f60295084218ac626738c785ac5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-23-202_22dc8c5544930089.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-Moving-into-Healthcare-Regulatory-Challenges-Await.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":39229,"destBytes":30892,"author":"Andrej Kovacevic","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-Moving-into-Healthcare-Regulatory-Challenges-Await-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-13-784_476d659e69c098bf.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ai-healthcare-black-box.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-707_1ff8a5c463fa44d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880530},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"5 Reasons Why You Should Absolutely Embrace Social Media Marketing","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173131","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/29/5-reasons-why-you-should-absolutely-embrace-social-media-marketing/\" title=\"5 Reasons Why You Should Absolutely Embrace Social Media Marketing\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Absolutely-Embrace-Social-Media-Marketing-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"social media marketing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Absolutely-Embrace-Social-Media-Marketing-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Absolutely-Embrace-Social-Media-Marketing-900x674.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Absolutely-Embrace-Social-Media-Marketing-214x160.jpg 214w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Absolutely-Embrace-Social-Media-Marketing.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Are you technologically challenged? In a world of rapid change where social media, online platforms, and virtual reality are transforming the very essence of civilization; any person or business falling short of the requirements to survive in the digital age is basically technologically challenged. But there is hope. Here are five reasons why you should absolutely embrace social media marketing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Be a notable landmark in the digital world</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2013, “selfie” was nominated by Oxford Dictionaries as the word of the year. What others perceived as the mere initiation of a technologically savvy term into the mainstream discourse soon became more than just a trend.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;selfie&#8221; set precedence to the modern world’s increasing dependence on the internet and the variety of tools to access its power.</p>\n<p>The simple selfie event is a milestone in the history of digital evolution and how it has revolutionized the very language of how we think, act and connect. The social media buzzword took center-stage in the lexicon of modern humanity. The selfie and what resulted from it relayed the impact of social media and the rising importance of technology in our day to day lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Few have been able to reap the benefits of this game-changer and many refuse to accept the law of the digital jungle. </strong></p>\n<p>Businesses delaying the integration of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/18/how-libra-will-change-social-media-marketing/\">social media marketing</a> to their present strategy are incurring huge losses. What’s more, the tendency to neglect upgrading existent business plans with the latest digital marketing trends can also impede your business success.</p>\n<p>The survival of any business in modern times is largely dependent on how they overcome old prejudices and attain healthy adaptability to technological change.</p>\n<p>If you find it hard to accept the changes in thinking and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/19/how-technology-plays-a-vital-role-in-small-business-growth/\">conducting business</a> that has been wrought by social media &#8212; then it is high time you modify your thinking and transform your business plans to achieve optimum benefits.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of 5 important reasons why you should definitely embrace social media marketing:</p>\n<h3><strong>1)    </strong><strong>Promote Your Brand</strong></h3>\n<p>Social media is the best place to grow your brand. Your main objective should be to put your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/05/7-content-marketing-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2020/\">brand out there and promote it</a> as well as you can.</p>\n<p>Start with a plan, research your market, and wisely put up your content on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.</p>\n<p>Your clients are spending quality time on the internet and social media, surfing for things they like or are interested in. Having your brand present in these spaces gives you valuable visibility.</p>\n<p>With the advent of modern technology, the masses have started relying on social media for more and more information. Today everything from what the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\">latest trends in fashion</a> are, to which café is nearest to your location can be found with a few clicks on your phone.</p>\n<p>Not having a social media presence can prove lethal for your brand value and push you to obscurity. When people are following you on social media and engaging with your content, it ultimately boosts your brand awareness and gives you the ability to focus on other aspects of your business.</p>\n<h3><strong>2)    </strong><strong>Enhance Lead Generation</strong></h3>\n<p>The main target of any business is to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/22/how-crm-software-generates-leads-which-converts/\">generate as many leads as possible</a>. Marketers have been proclaiming the importance of social media marketing for some time now and have actually ranked it as the most effective tactic used for improving lead generation.</p>\n<p>Social media is the apex method when it comes to interacting with brands and researching new products or services for those countless people who spend their time on the internet. The simple trick to get more leads is to establish a social media presence and then continue to nurture your marketing strategy with only a little effort.</p>\n<p>Do not forget to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/05/optimize-marketing-strategy-for-cross-channel-conversions/\">optimize your profile</a>, create user-friendly and personalized content and most importantly build great offers and incentives to convert those leads.</p>\n<p>Social media is one of the defining factors in how people purchase products.

Social distancing and shelter-at-home policies are in place in over 40 states, and businesses need to go digital to survive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As agents look to real estate tech to keep them in business during the pandemic, many are adjusting their processes and implementing new tools. Making changes such as this signifies a shift in the real estate industry towards the digital sphere that will remain even after Covid-19 is no longer a threat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a look at how real estate tech can help agents increase their sales now and post-COVID. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organize communications<br />\n</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to social distancing requirements, agents have been forced to rely exclusively on digital communication tools to connect with their clients. One great way to increase client touchpoints and help generate leads is to use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/21/prodigious-customer-service-live-chat-vs-chatbots/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chatbots.</a> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots are available 24/7, opening up communications with clients beyond the hours that an agent can work. They can answer straightforward questions and provide information like square footage or the number of bedrooms in a listed property. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When clients have this information ahead of time, agents can jump straight into more complex questions and nuanced requests, thus streamlining the buying process. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Many agents are also using tools to manage properties, consolidate client communications, schedule meetings, and share information.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools like BackAgent, for example, centralizes team communications into one place to help manage transactions and keep everyone on the same page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skyslope is a document management app that creates a digital log of all communications between agents and clients. All of these apps are a necessity now. But continuing to store, track, and analyze interactions using tools like these will help agents better inform clients and fast track their selling timeline after COVID. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automate homes to minimize social contact</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some places, in-person showings are still permitted, and many buyers want to see a property before purchasing it. For agents holding in-person walk-throughs, it is important to take safety precautions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to minimize social contact is to use a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/06/non-device-industries-that-are-going-to-be-ruled-by-iot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart lock system</a> to allow clients to see a property without an agent present. Companies like Sentrilock and Prempoint offer networked smart locks that can be opened using Bluetooth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using smart lock systems, agents can create one-day codes, track entries and exits, and define “open house” times to control access. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems can increase the number of possible showings and add value to the house, making them a worthwhile investment now and in the future. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtually show properties</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many agents are holding open houses and walkthroughs <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/07/this-real-estate-brokerage-is-changing-its-industry-heres-what-your-business-can-learn-from-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">virtually</a>, in compliance with local social distancing and shelter-at-home measures. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/24/will-artificial-intelligence-ai-replace-real-estate-agents/\">Virtual reality tools</a> like EyeSpy360 allows agents to create free virtual tours for a full understanding of the property. Using virtual reality, agents can even show properties that aren’t finished with construction yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SmarterListings platform offers an AI-powered guide that stands in for the agent, taking clients on a virtual tour of the property, pointing out key features, and recording questions and commentary. Using SmarterListings, agents can increase the number of showings and follow up with clients after the walkthrough for the next steps. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generate leads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many people stuck at home, time spent on social media has increased by </span><a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/people-are-spending-20-more-time-in-apps-during-the-covid-19-lockdowns-re/575403/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Marketing and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/4-technology-trends-shaping-property-portals/\">advertising tools</a> can help agents get in front of their target audience and generate more leads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRMs</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, gathers contact <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/08/the-connected-life-the-fabulous-and-fantastical-era-of-iot/\">information and track activity</a> to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/17/12-best-sales-engagement-solutions-for-2020/\">provide agents with lead insights</a>. By automating tasks like tracking and scheduling follow-ups, agents have more time to cultivate relationships with potential clients. Data insights also help agents understand the buyer journey and lead profiles so they can improve their processes and better serve their clients. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process deals online </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether working in person or online, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/27/new-privacy-and-security-laws-of-states-explained-how-to-get-your-business-ready/\">privacy is essential</a> when handling contracts and payments. It is vital that agents use tools with the appropriate encryption and security measures in place to handle contracts and payments digitally during COVID times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To control data and manage contracts, <a href=\"http://docusign.com\">DocuSign</a> is a popular digital option used in millions of real estate transactions. With DocuSign, agents send buyers a link to the contract, which they can open on any device. The client then follows the instructions provided to create an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/the-challenges-and-opportunities-for-automation-in-the-real-estate-industry/\">electronic signature and sign</a> the document. Once they’ve finished, the agent can also access the saved signed version. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To track the entire settlement process, tools like Qualia come in handy. This software lets buyers, agents, and lenders monitor closing status and investments, making the closing process more transparent, streamlined, and secure. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adapting to digital-first interactions</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has caused companies across industries to adapt quickly to a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/from-polarization-to-open-learning-how-technology-can-help-us-beyond-covid-19/\">new business environment</a>. In particular, this rapid shift has forced businesses to become more digital, and </span><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-going-back-to-work-from-home-commercial-real-estate-offices/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experts predict</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that post-COVID many will continue distributed operations on a large scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For real estate agents, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/21/best-data-visualization-tools-for-2020-reviewed/\">new technology is helping them stay afloat</a> in the short term as well as automate tasks, increase their output, and generate sales in the long term.</span></p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Francesca Tosolini on Unsplash</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/05/real-estate-tech-that-will-endure-in-a-post-covid-world/\">Real Estate Tech that Will Endure in a Post COVID World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 15:00:55 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Real-Estate-Tech-that-Will-Endure-in-a-Post-COVID-World.jpg","linkMd5":"539f2f23215fae44bce7918c7f8c3cfb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-25-888_a2b2083eab2a3b75.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Real-Estate-Tech-that-Will-Endure-in-a-Post-COVID-World.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":44789,"destBytes":37596,"author":"Adrian Fisher","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Real-Estate-Tech-that-Will-Endure-in-a-Post-COVID-World-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-15-759_0d6fc836cdf4c8ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875657},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Digital Thread: 5 Ways to Drive Value in Industrial Enterprise","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166854","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/13/digital-thread-5-ways-to-drive-value-in-industrial-enterprise/\" title=\"Digital Thread: 5 Ways to Drive Value in Industrial Enterprise\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digital-Thread-5-Ways-to-Drive-Value-in-Industrial-Enterprise-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"digital thread value industrial\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digital-Thread-5-Ways-to-Drive-Value-in-Industrial-Enterprise-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digital-Thread-5-Ways-to-Drive-Value-in-Industrial-Enterprise-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Digital-Thread-5-Ways-to-Drive-Value-in-Industrial-Enterprise.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In the industrial market place, the prevalence of connected devices through the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/09/a-deep-dive-inside-industrial-iot/\">Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)</a> is expanding the possibilities of the digital thread. Streamlining and democratizing this information to specific functions drives attainable value from engineering through <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/02/27/modern-day-sales/\">sales and marketing</a>.</p>\n<h3>What is a digital thread?</h3>\n<p>A digital thread is a single source of data truth, creating consistency, collaboration, and alignment across functions. It does this by enabling real-time data synchronization of related upstream and downstream derivative information.</p>\n<p>The scalable, common set of democratized data enables enterprise-wide accessibility and creates continuity across functions in the value chain.</p>\n<p>Below we dissect five ways the digital thread is driving value across the industrial enterprise.</p>\n<h3><b>1. </b><b>Designing with 360-view of product-lifecycle.</b></h3>\n<p>Much of the digital thread value recognized is derived from the democratization of the digital product definition and its derivative information. By bringing relevant product data downstream to manufacturing processes, business are able to develop higher-quality products and increase throughput.</p>\n<p>On the opposite end, engineering excellence can be achieved as an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/10/is-artificial-intelligence-the-ultimate-university-stimulus/\">input of other functional data</a>. By creating a closed feedback loop and enabling products with IoT, engineers equipped with real-world performance and usage data can replace assumptions with facts.</p>\n<p>Previously black-boxed data can do three things: inform engineers and product designers with design implications for future product iterations, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/06/successful-scaling-how-to-grow-without-tumbling-back-down/\">expedite time-to-market</a>, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/how-iot-reshapes-industry-4-0-and-the-effects-of-iot-on-smes/\">introduce new products faster</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Differentiating product and service with increased flexibility.</b></h3>\n<p>Creating and enhancing business models as well as differentiating product &#38; service offerings (25% of Forrester business decision-makers cite this as a DX driver) are sought-after outcomes of industrial digital transformation.</p>\n<p>Using the digital thread to synchronize product lifecycle information across processes enables mass customization &#8211; an increasingly important capability for manufacturers.</p>\n<p>For example, Volvo’s engines (<em>full disclosure: Volvo is a customer of my employer, PTC</em>) can have 4,500 different information variants to choose from within a single plant. When performing timely quality assurance, its definition data must be easily accessible by QA operators.</p>\n<p>By implementing a digital thread that connects two very different parts of the business, Volvo has been able to quickly adjust to shifting customer requirements and increase new product introduction (NPI) cycle times.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Driving manufacturing efficiency by connecting disparate systems.</b></h3>\n<p>Digitized and non-digitized information resides in manufacturing facilities, and both are critical to daily production. The digital thread provides the means to both connect disparate digitized information sources (including ERP systems and IoT-enabled machines). They <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/07/achieving-paperless-operations-and-document-automation-with-ai-and-ml/\">can deliver traditionally paper-based information</a> (such as work instructions) to relevant personnel.</p>\n<p>Real-time <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/04/why-you-need-to-consider-iot-in-improving-customer-experience/\">operational visibility</a> across production lines, assets, capacity, and other systems are required to drive operational efficiencies. 451 Research cites 53% of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/27/adding-cellular-connectivity-to-your-iot-device/\">manufacturing respondents</a> currently use or will use digital thread for faster access to cross plant instrumentation and status.</p>\n<p>Properly equipping this instrumentation through technologies and then streamlining it through the digital thread can drive these critical manufacturing KPIs.</p>\n<p>For delivering the digital thread, democratizing manufacturing data to various factory roles can improve worker productivity and efficiencies by offering previously hidden insights.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Identifying new ways to deliver service.</b></h3>\n<p>Service networks and lifecycles are increasingly complex, coinciding with the rise in product complexity. Customized products may benefit top-line revenue but become a cost center downstream if the service component is improperly managed.</p>\n<p>The digital thread alleviates this complexity by giving the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/big-data-in-the-telecommunications-ecosystem/\">service technician</a> the deployed assets definition data traditionally solely residing in the engineering department. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/13/augmented-reality-transforming-training-with-immersive-experiences/\">Augmented reality</a> is increasingly the emerging technology to link the digital thread to the physical world and improve <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/03/few-industries-will-not-be-transformed-by-ar-and-vr/\">technician effectiveness</a> and critical KPIs, including mean-time-to-repair and first-time-fix-rate.</p>\n<p>PTC customer Howden [Howden.com] is driving added-value to its customers through its connected field maintenance program, Uptime. This ‘self-service’ module gives service technicians step-by-step service instructions on a deployed asset almost immediately, circumventing product complexity challenges.</p>\n<h3><b>5. Enriching the sales and marketing experience.</b></h3>\n<p>Customer-facing personnel are constantly looking for new methods of engagement and ways to provide novel opportunities for new sales and upselling. The possibilities include both knowing the customer’s current usage of products and demonstrating the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/trends-that-will-characterize-the-ecommerce-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/\">potential use of future products</a>.

A recent City University study shows that battery life has a significant impact on people’s anxiety level and their behavior.</p>\n<p>A Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/diagnosing-and-dealing-with-your-low-battery-anxiety/\">article</a> summarizes this well: “when smartphones start dying, people get weird: they head home immediately, swipe cables from coworkers’ desks, demand chargers from random strangers or places of business.” Given how reliant we are on our devices, these types of responses come as no surprise.</p>\n<h2>People faced with a dying battery.</h2>\n<p>What do you do when you are faced with a dying battery? Many people will pop into a coffee shop, a restaurant or scour <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/11/will-uncertainty-in-us-5g-deployments-affect-iot-development/\">wherever they happen to be for an outlet</a>. Public spaces often have outlets or have installed charging solutions like USB outlets.</p>\n<p>Major chains like Starbucks and McDonald&#8217;s have made free Wi-Fi and the ability to charge an integral part of their customer experience. Yet, what’s currently available <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/wifi-range-hacks-2020/\">still leaves plenty of room for improvement</a>.</p>\n<h4>Traditional power outlets require charging cables.</h4>\n<p>To charge, you must be near an outlet and must remember to bring the right cable with you. This limits where people can sit. Some places simply don’t have easily accessible outlets, or the outlets that they have are not in desirable spots. Sometimes the shape of a charger can make it impossible to put two into a socket side-by-side.</p>\n<h3>Has the line to charge your devices been a simple numbers game?</h3>\n<p>In a crowded McDonald&#8217;s or airport, you must compete with everyone else for the available outlets. If you get one, it may leave you huddled uncomfortably close to a bunch of other people around a charging pod. In addition, using USB charging ports presents a potential risk.</p>\n<h4>USB doesn’t just transmit power.</h4>\n<p>A USB sends data &#8212; which means that a port could try to access your personal information or upload malware onto your device. These <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/166497/htg-explains-what-is-juice-jacking-and-how-worried-should-you-be/\">types of attacks</a> may not be widespread, but they can happen. Another charging solution is wireless contact pads.</p>\n<p>The most popular of these wireless contact pads are based on an inductive charging method referred to as Qi. Qi charging allows for wireless charging over very short distances, is supported by major players like Apple, Samsung and Google.</p>\n<h4>Who wants to put their phone on a dirty charging spot?</h4>\n<p>However, the pad itself still needs an electrical connection, and a consumer attitudes report by Zogby Analytics shows that many people are not sold on Qi charging. The report cites issues like charging speed, the need to align the device perfectly, and availability as key problems.</p>\n<p>A thick phone case could prevent the phone from charging, and Qi spots in public spaces are sometimes broken or dirty. Who wants to put their phone on a dirty charging spot?</p>\n<h4>Long-range wireless power.</h4>\n<p>Long-range wireless power &#8211; the ability to deliver power from a distance without wires or charging pads &#8211; solves these problems. Long-range <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/people-power-company-humanizing-the-internet-of-things/\">wireless power frees people</a> to sit where they like and not vie with others for a limited number of outlets.</p>\n<p>There are many approaches to long-range wireless charging such as Ultrasound and radio frequency, to name a few. These technologies vary in the amount of energy they can safely deliver as well as in their efficiency.</p>\n<p>A new and very promising approach is infrared light, which can safely and efficiently provide enough energy to charge a phone. From the user’s perspective, the benefit of having wireless charging in a variety of public venues is readily apparent. In addition, there are significant benefits that extend to the businesses themselves.</p>\n<h3><strong>Wireless charging for businesses.</strong></h3>\n<p>Wireless charging is a simple and inexpensive way for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/28/electronic-design-is-utilizing-ai-enabled-solutions-to-render-top-grade-service/\">business owners to elevate their customer experience.</a> It provides a way to differentiate themselves, to delight their customers and ultimately &#8212; to make their establishments a more comfortable place to spend time.</p>\n<h4>Aesthetic and renovation efforts for WiFi power in the office.</h4>\n<p>The alternative &#8211; providing power outlets near tables &#8211; can be a major renovation effort. It can be an aesthetic concern, as well. A cocktail bar in LA or a diner in NY may value the sleek appearance of their countertops. Having to accommodate outlets or Qi pads near every seat can be a blemish on an otherwise flawless decor.</p>\n<p>Another useful way to think about this is to consider the evolution of free Wi-Fi. In the early days, not everyone offered it, but those that did had an edge, offering their customers a little something extra, a reason to linger.</p>\n<h4>Forward-thinking business owners understand that small gestures like providing easy plugin access can go a long way.</h4>\n<p>For example, a few years ago, Domino&#8217;s debuted a service where people could order a pizza by simply texting an emoji. Thirty minutes later, pizza. Domino&#8217;s was letting people do what they already liked to do, text and use emojis.</p>\n<p>The result was a 10% boost in sales and 1.5 billion <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/26/10-facebook-conversion-rate-strategies-for-online-sales/\">social media impressions</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/25/how-iot-fixtures-will-power-the-bathroom-of-the-future/\">wireless charging</a> is another way of giving people what they want — a fully charged phone and unlimited connectivity. Examples like Domino&#8217;s are common. Restaurants are using mobile apps, streamlined delivery services and decision logic technology — anything and everything to further enhance customer experiences.</p>\n<p>Restaurants have transitioned to portable point of sale terminals, like the ones made by Ziosk. Olive Garden, TGI Fridays, and other big chains have embraced this trend which makes ordering another drink or paying the bill much easier &#8211; right from the table.</p>\n<p>However, keeping these terminals charged requires batteries or a hardwire. Batteries need to be removed daily and charged overnight, which means extra work before opening and at closing. Wiring these devices from the wall comes with the limitations already discussed above.</p>\n<h3>Integrating the wireless charging receiver.</h3>\n<p>By integrating a wireless charging receiver with the point of sale table-side terminal, the device could always remain on without requiring a wire or additional maintenance. Not to mention that vendors could also use their wireless power to let patrons comfortably charge their phones.</p>\n<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>A fast-food restaurant, cafe or public library with long-range <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/06/26/samsung-wireless-charging-case-dl1/\">wireless charging</a> represents a fundamentally improved experience. In the mobile age, people expect everything to be quick, easy and intuitive. The speed at which something goes from a novelty to an expectation has increased.</p>\n<p>Yesterday WiFi was something new, and today it’s essentially unthinkable that any restaurant or cafe would not have it. Long-range wireless charging is primed to follow a similar trajectory.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/20/the-future-of-charging-in-public-spaces/\">The Future of Charging in Public Spaces</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:00:35 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Future-of-Charging-in-Public-Spaces.jpg","linkMd5":"88e39a8f67ad1712564ba8cff14be0d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-26-225_15c9b3bb3ad1ba3f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Future-of-Charging-in-Public-Spaces.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":415629,"destBytes":382050,"author":"Yuval Boger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Future-of-Charging-in-Public-Spaces-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-14-436_552abea1e63bfe2e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"When the COVID is Past – Let’s go to Naples Florida","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167947","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/22/when-covid-is-past-lets-go-to-naples-florida/\" title=\"When the COVID is Past &#8211; Let&#8217;s go to Naples Florida\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/When-the-COVID-is-Past-Lets-go-to-Naples-Florida--300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"naples florida\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/When-the-COVID-is-Past-Lets-go-to-Naples-Florida--300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/When-the-COVID-is-Past-Lets-go-to-Naples-Florida--260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/When-the-COVID-is-Past-Lets-go-to-Naples-Florida-.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>When the COVID is past &#8212; you&#8217;ll need a break.

But a few simple tweaks to your processes can help your organization better detect, prevent and recover from an inevitable breach.</p>\n<h2><b>What’s different about COVID scamming?</b></h2>\n<p>Responding to COVID-19 <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-intelligent-data-addresses-the-chasm-in-cloud/\">cybersecurity threats is a novel challenge</a> in its own right.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we’re not seeing significantly different types of scams: Email phishing, Trojan malware and spoofed sites continue to dominate the threat landscape. If your company has developed a sophisticated strategy to prevent these types of breaches, you’re already headed in the right direction.</p>\n<h4>Why are cybersecurity problems different right now?</h4>\n<p>These threats, however, have never converged with world events and conditional factors such as newly remote workforces and public health standards. While managed service providers (MSPs) are typically successful at securing the physical perimeter defined by office space, IT professionals typically lack oversight into individual employees’ behaviors at home.</p>\n<h4>Home Environment &#8212; the fam.</h4>\n<p>Even with visibility into employee processes via work computers, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/how-to-ensure-data-privacy-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/\">you can’t monitor family behavior</a> — a kid downloading a game using home internet, for example, can leave other devices vulnerable to an attack.</p>\n<p>In addition, employees access work email from mobile phones now more than ever, and March saw a 300% <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-iphone-app-downloads-impact-work-education-increase-travel-decreases-2020-3#around-the-same-time-educational-apps-also-jumped-up-as-schools-across-the-country-turned-to-online-learning-2\">spike in business app downloads</a> as consumers flocked to productivity apps related to remote or teleworking, fitness and education.</p>\n<p>With the increased dependency on mobile apps for collaboration and communication, attackers have latched onto this new vector by embedding trojans into apps posing as free video conferencing providers.</p>\n<p>Your cybersecurity may come from <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/08/how-covid-19-is-driving-us-into-a-cloud-based-future/\">video conferencing</a> where a hacker can access user data through backdoor channels like search history, passwords and email addresses. With users flipping between various news sources throughout the day, supplying employees with an understanding of safe apps to download is critical.</p>\n<p><strong>Unprepared companies must simultaneously create and implement response plans, often doing so after a security event has already occurred.</strong></p>\n<p>Even Google algorithms struggle with delays in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/18/five-best-open-source-antivirus-for-carefree-cyber-threat-protection/\">email antivirus protection</a>. Antivirus software relies on real-time machine learning.  For example, an algorithm can quickly flag a sketchy email directing a user to sign in to eBay — but they don’t have the legacy data to differentiate which of the COVID emails flooding our inboxes are legitimate and which are not.</p>\n<h4>What About Domains and Certificates?</h4>\n<p>Hackers can easily create hundreds of domain names and obtain SSL certificates for spoofed websites within a few minutes. Assuming thousands of hackers are doing this at the same time, it may take Google — and the rest of us — a while to catch up.</p>\n<p>Given the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/best-business-intelligence-software-and-business-operating-system-options-for-2020/\">reality that business data is more vulnerable</a> than ever, what precautions should all companies be taking to mitigate these unique risks?</p>\n<h2><b>Focus areas for safeguarding company data.</b></h2>\n<p>COVID-19 has forced an essential point: If cybersecurity wasn’t a 2020 business priority before, it needs to be now. With the average cost of a data breach, this year set to <a href=\"https://www.scasecurity.com/cost-of-a-data-breach/\">exceed $150 million</a>, avoiding a damaging breach &#8212; hinges on your ability to navigate new security concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Even in a stressed environment, your security protocols don’t need to change dramatically.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re missing any of these critical cybersecurity elements, you need to take action now to mitigate the risk of a breach going forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on the basics.</strong>Though the number of attempted attacks will continue to increase, the main attack vectors remain the same. Protecting your employees from phishing emails that compromise their credentials should be your top concern.All cloud applications should be bolstered by secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) tools. As much as possible, enable MFA for employees by default and opt for apps that offer single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Start deploying password management tools</strong>Insist on the deployment of password management tools for both personal and business apps. In the same way <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/the-biggest-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-iot/\">that your essential security capabilities</a> should include MFA and SSO tools, your bare-minimum toolkit must include password management capabilities.When your organization requires passwords that are both complex and changed frequently, you’re much less likely to experience credential stuffing. Credential stuffing is a tactic in which attackers gain credentials by purchasing records for sale on the Dark Web.\n<p>Research on compromised credentials on the Dark Web by <a href=\"https://www.idagent.com/resources/password-education-package-campaign/\">Kaseya company ID Agent</a> found that disturbingly, names are the <i>most common types</i> of password, with “George” ringing in as the most popular name password. (Ya know, just don&#8217;t!)</li>\n<li><strong>Change and reinforce &#8220;best&#8221; employee cybersecurity behavior as much as possible.</strong>While the first phase of COVID response largely required forced change management — teams had a day or week to adapt and adjust policies. The next phase of response must reinforce and reward good cybersecurity practices as the new normal.For your organization to prepare for and respond to an attack, employees across your organization need upskilling through quality training programs.\n<p>Your best training programs will include phishing simulations, incident response training and safe internet habits.</p>\n<p>Remember, employee security training doesn’t need to be lengthy and tedious to be effective: Keep training concise, brief, and focused. Then focus on rewarding good behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Effective cybersecurity scams rely on fear and a lack of information to succeed. As humans, we’re driven by our innate desire to click links that promise more information or safety.</p>\n<p>More than ever, company leadership has a<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/17/how-to-invest-in-yourself-during-lockdown/\"> responsibility to educate their workforce</a> about how to succeed outside the office. Arm employees with tools and policies that address pain points.</p>\n<p>With basic defenses, effective communication, and behavior modification, even companies without advanced threat detection systems can greatly reduce their chances of attack, and set themselves up for success today and down the line.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/09/top-covid-19-cybersecurity-scams-to-watch-for-and-how-to-mitigate-them/\">Top COVID-19 Cybersecurity Scams to Watch For &#8212; and How to Mitigate Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 21:01:06 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cybersecurity-Scams-to-Watch-For-and-How-to-Mitigate-Them.jpg","linkMd5":"a194cc2c9a25d0e64eefaa5dbf33767f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-089_a2e31c9c4cef5801.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cybersecurity-Scams-to-Watch-For-and-How-to-Mitigate-Them.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":43615,"destBytes":34884,"author":"Kevin Lancaster","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cybersecurity-Scams-to-Watch-For-and-How-to-Mitigate-Them-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-23-345_a7d8c6d193825085.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/man-in-red-crew-neck-sweatshirt-photography-941693-300x260.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-28-623_43ed9db62c7ac7cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873724},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:48","title":"Is AI Going to Disrupt the Marketing Industry?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=174106","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/12/is-ai-going-to-disrupt-the-marketing-industry/\" title=\"Is AI Going to Disrupt the Marketing Industry?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"ai disrupt marketing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/27/future-of-artificial-intelligence-for-2020/\"><u>Developments in AI</u></a> are advancing at a rampant pace, with innovations improving the quality of life in different ways across disciplines.</p>\n<p>For instance, <em><i>Forbes </i></em>estimates that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2017/03/03/10-million-self-driving-cars-will-hit-the-road-by-2020-heres-how-to-profit/#2f3b47be7e50\"><u>10 million self-driving cars</u></a> will hit the road in 2020, and another study reported by <em><i>Business Wire</i></em> projects that automotive artificial intelligence will bring in <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170524005456/en/Automotive-Artificial-Intelligence-Revenue-Reach-14-Billion\"><u>revenues of over $14 billion by 2025</u></a>.</p>\n<p>Another example is Google’s Deep Learning program <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html\"><u>helping pathologists detect cancer</u></a> with higher accuracy. Another article from <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/reenitadas/2017/10/05/how-big-data-could-help-to-prevent-one-fatal-heart-attack-every-40-seconds/#3462df6a2089\"><em><u><i>Forbes</i></u></em></a> asserts how the use of big data can help prevent a heart attack every 40 seconds.</p>\n<p>Although many organizations across fields still lack the foundational practices needed to create value from AI at scale, <strong><em><b><i>AI is being adopted at a rapid rate by digital marketers across niches.</i></b></em></strong></p>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/190858/most-effective-online-marketing-channels-according-to-us-companies/\"><u>Statista</u></a>, artificial intelligence and machine learning are among the most effective digital marketing techniques used by marketers today.</p>\n<p>With more and more marketers learning how AI can help them create better marketing solutions, in 2019 AI saw an <a href=\"https://albert.ai/news/new-study-finds-that-88-of-marketers-are-using-artificial-intelligence-yet-many-marketers-still-dont-feel-very-well-supported-by-their-technology/\"><u>88%</u></a> adoption rate in marketing—up from 43% in 2016.</p>\n<p>AI aids marketers in gaining insights into their customers’ ideations and improves their marketing approach.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Most recent innovations in marketing with AI have seen great results. </b></strong></p>\n<p>The <em><i>Washington Post</i></em> has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2016/08/05/the-washington-post-experiments-with-automated-storytelling-to-help-power-2016-rio-olympics-coverage/\"><u>experimenting with automated storytelling</u></a>. <em><i>USA Today</i></em> leveraged AI to maximize video engagement, and Netflix continues to apply machine-learning techniques to <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/19/how-netflixs-ai-saves-it-1-billion-every-year.aspx\"><u>personalize your recommendations deeply</u></a> (helping them save billions of dollars annually!).</p>\n<h2><strong>Here are some more ways AI will disrupt marketing in 2020:</strong></h2>\n<h3>1. Advertising Networks</h3>\n<p>Technology has miniaturized, and people now <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/678739/forecast-on-connected-devices-per-person/\"><u>own six connected devices on average</u></a>. However, even with the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/16/10-reasons-that-demonstrate-the-importance-of-technology-in-business/\"><u>technological advancements</u></a> and all the screens an average person owns, advertising remains inept.</p>\n<p>Users are bombarded with ineffective advertisements that have nothing to do with their interests.</p>\n<p>It is safe to say that there’s a significant void in advertising—the lack of personalization—that can be filled using AI.</p>\n<p>Although primitive ad automation helps bring forth more relevant ads, the technology completely disregards privacy. It also does not factor in accidental clicks and taps on ads, which is where AI can chip in to help.</p>\n<p>AI can instantly generate a personalized advertising copy by security and anonymously analyzing user data. It will make predictions exhilaratingly accurate and boost ROI in advertising exponentially.</p>\n<p>Search sessions will become more relevant, and finding products will never have been easier. Both Facebook and Google incorporate machine learning to their ad platforms to furnish personalized ads to targeted audiences.</p>\n<h3>2. Email Marketing</h3>\n<p>Brands in all kinds of niches can leverage the power of AI to personalize emails in <u>email marketing campaigns</u> based on customer behaviors and preferences.</p>\n<p>AI will enable brands to make better connections with their audiences and, in turn, boost revenues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/06/machine-learning-software-testing/\"><u>Machine learning</u></a>, even in its nascent stages, can analyze millions of data points about a customer base and determine the best times to send customers emails.</p>\n<p>This information, coupled with the personalized content that the AI will generate, will drive more interest and clicks.</p>\n<p>In contrast, A/B tests take a lot of time and have a margin of error. AI will aid marketers in reaching and converting customers quickly.</p>\n<p>Tools like Boomtrain and Persado use AI to make email marketing campaigns potent and persuasive.</p>\n<h3>3. Content Generation</h3>\n<p>Although AI cannot <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/21/blogger-outreach-the-definitive-guide-for-the-beginners/\"><u>write a blog post</u> </a>or newspaper column unaided, the content generated by an AI can help brands attract visitors to their websites.</p>\n<p>AI can save marketers lots of time and resources by writing reports and generating news articles based on data supplied.</p>\n<p>Intelligent tools like Wordsmith and Quill are already in use by the <em><i>Associated Press </i></em>and <em><i>Forbes </i></em>to create posts that drive clicks on their website. Google, too, is working on an AI that will be able to generate a best-selling book in no time.</p>\n<p>The AI-based tools do not work unaided, and templates and “fill-in-the-blank” style forms are still used to enter data and keywords to generate unique, targeted content; however, the content generated by the AI is indistinguishable from that written by a professional.</p>\n<p>It is likely that users have already read posts on news outlets like BBC, CBS, the <em><i>New York Times</i></em>, and the <em><i>Washington Post</i></em> generated by AI.</p>\n<p>The technology is slowly trickling down and will change the way marketers create content.</p>\n<h3>4. Content Curation</h3>\n<p>AI can also curate content for the user and not just generate it. AI will make it possible for brands to connect with their visitors better by showing them more relevant, personalized content.</p>\n<p>AI is already used to make content recommendations that the visitor may find interesting. Amazon does this on a large scale using the “people who buy X also buy Y” recommendations.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, Netflix’s recommendation system uses AI to keep the user hooked to shows and movies they like. The AI helps Netflix reduce cancellations, saving them billions of dollars a year.</p>\n<p>Tools like Curata and List.ly enable markets to curate the most relevant content for each user.</p>\n<h3>5. Voice Searching</h3>\n<p>A report by Statista reveals that <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1036727/global-voice-search-region-device/\"><u>42% of the worldwide population</u></a> has voice-searched for something online in the first quarter of 2019.</p>\n<p>With smart devices becoming increasingly accessible and cheap, and the rise of Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and more recently, Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant is changing how we search.</p>\n<p>AI will make searching more accurate and leverage the data the user supplies to make personalized recommendations.</p>\n<p>However, the use of AI and voice searching leaves marketers wondering how they can optimize their content for voice searches since the natural, conversational language used in doing these searches does not involve the use of keywords in the same manner.</p>\n<p>Although marketers will have some trouble initially, the user will benefit from the personalized content and hence will make more purchases.</p>\n<h3>6. User Experience (UX)</h3>\n<p>Through the use of intelligent algorithms, it’s possible to personalize user experience on a website.</p>\n<p>After analysis of various data points about the user, including location, demographics, type of device, and style of interaction with the site, the AI can personalize offers and contents displayed on the website accordingly.</p>\n<p>In 2017, <u>33% of the marketers</u> were experimenting with AI for real-time personalization. When asked about the benefits of AI-driven customization, 63% of them responded that it improved the consumer’s experience and increased conversion rates.</p>\n<p>Tools like <a href=\"https://uizard.io/\"><u>Uizard</u></a> and Mockplus leverage AI to help marketers create better user experience.</p>\n<p>Excellent user experience keeps the user browsing the site longer, and the longer users stay on the site, the higher the probability of conversion is.</p>\n<p>Personalizing the UX will make websites highly attractive and immensely profitable.</p>\n<h3>7. Web Design</h3>\n<p>Creating websites is a lot easier now than it was ever before. Using tools like WordPress, programming or technical experience is no longer necessary to make a website.</p>\n<p>However, web design is about to get a lot easier.</p>\n<p>Tools like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXA4-5x31V0\"><u>Grid</u></a> use AI to design websites based on information provided by the user. Soon marketers will only need to supply AI with the text, images, and calls to action they want on their website to create a professional-looking website in minutes.</p>\n<h3>8. Chatbots</h3>\n<p>Many brands now use messaging apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and even Facebook Messenger to communicate with their prospects.</p>\n<p>Communicating this way is fast and easy since the customers are already using these tools to chat with their friends and family.</p>\n<p>Chatbots use AI to automatically engage and respond to both customers and prospective buyers’ queries.</p>\n<p>Marketers will sell their products and services passively—without needing to be available to respond to clients. With chatbots, there will also be no compromises in the quality of service.</p>\n<p>AI-powered chatbots are capable of answering open-ended questions using natural language processing and machine learning to generate the correct response.</p>\n<p>Other than making quality customer support available to clients 24-7, with chatbots, there are no risks of slipups. Waiting time will also no longer be an issue.</p>\n<p>Facebook bot tools and wit.ai are tools that help marketers train bots by feeding them example conversations. The chatbot will continually get better at responding to clients.</p>\n<h2><strong><b>Conclusion</b></strong></h2>\n<p>I firmly believe that digital marketing firms must take advantage of AI-driven tools and integrate the new processes, tools, software, and skills at the earliest.</p>\n<p>With the increase in popularity of AI-as-a-service models, marketers will soon have access to diverse and powerful tools that will aid them in creating and curating content that connects with prospects on a deeper level.</p>\n<p>These tools will also assist in fabricating digital marketing strategies and help brands deliver improved customer experiences. The technology will also give marketers a head start by designing enticing websites quickly. Therefore, missing out on this marketing revolution could lead to many Kodak moments.</p>\n<p>From all outlooks, it seems that 2020 will be an exciting year for AI, and businesses across disciplines, including <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/13/ai-in-finance-insights-from-bny-mellon/#4e5ec24a53c2\"><u>FinTech</u></a>, health care, and marketing organizations, will benefit from AI-based tools.</p>\n<p>The global market for AI is on the rise, with revenues generated from AI <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/\"><u>expected to increase to $118.6 billion by 2025</u></a>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, conclusively, I think the adoption of AI regardless of niche is what the marketing space needs to increase engagement and boost profits while reducing the direct costs of content research, creation, and promotion.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/12/is-ai-going-to-disrupt-the-marketing-industry/\">Is AI Going to Disrupt the Marketing Industry?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 21:00:33 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry.jpg","linkMd5":"7f0b20b71aa116323dadee90e2f3ddb5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-22-322_8bb4a278bf6158bb.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":27607,"destBytes":18492,"author":"Harikrishna Kundariya","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Is-AI-Going-to-Disrupt-the-Marketing-Industry-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-10-690_51f77b7f6368b7fc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195868862},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"BPM Core WiFi-Enabled Blood Pressure Monitor","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173377","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/29/bpm-core-wifi-enabled-blood-pressure-monitor/\" title=\"BPM Core WiFi-Enabled Blood Pressure Monitor\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BPM-Core-WiFi-Enabled-Blood-Pressure-Monitor-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"blood pressure monitor\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BPM-Core-WiFi-Enabled-Blood-Pressure-Monitor-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BPM-Core-WiFi-Enabled-Blood-Pressure-Monitor-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BPM-Core-WiFi-Enabled-Blood-Pressure-Monitor.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>BPM Core is a soon-to-be-launched WiFi-enabled blood pressure monitor.

The readings show up instantly on the device.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173384\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1-900x599.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-1.jpg 1840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Blood Pressure Results</h2>\n<p>BPM Core results include systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Taking your blood pressure at home helps alleviate the fear of going to the doctor plus gives you an easy way to regularly track your hypertension.</p>\n<h2>Electrocardiogram Results</h2>\n<p class=\"feature-subtitle\" data-tr=\"hkixihee\">Using an electrocardiogram can help to detect atrial fibrillation. BPM Core delivers a medical-grade ECG because it uses three electrodes. Like your blood pressure tracking, you can get immediate results to find out if you show any signs of atrial fibrillation.</p>\n<h2 data-tr=\"hkixihee\">Digital Stethoscope Results</h2>\n<p class=\"feature-subtitle\" data-tr=\"okroxox\">A digital stethoscope can help to detect valvular heart disease. BPM Core has a precise sound sensor and artificial intelligence capability that listen for heart sound frequencies that indicate how your heart valves are doing when it comes to opening and closing. The device can detect potential disturbances that may indicate you are at risk for common valvular heart diseases.</p>\n<p data-tr=\"okroxox\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173385\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-3-en-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-3-en-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-3-en-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-3-en-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/withings-bpm-core-3-en.jpg 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2 data-tr=\"okroxox\">Shareable Data</h2>\n<div class=\"col-insight\">\n<div class=\"insight-wrapper\" data-event-action=\"click-arg-block\" data-event-label=\"share-info-doctor\">\n<p class=\"insight-txt\" data-tr=\"etyl\">One of the standouts of using this smart device is that, if you have the iOS version of its Health Mate App, then you can share the data with your physician. By sending your physician data about your blood pressure history and electrocardiogram results, you have a better chance of effectively managing hypertension and heart health.</p>\n<h2 data-tr=\"etyl\">Standout Features</h2>\n<p>Some features to note is the ability to share the device with up to eight people. It offers free data storage and unlimited access to all the data recorded on the BPM Core. Other standout features include a rechargeable battery, integration with Apple Health, and instant results that are easy to read on the clear LED screen. The Health Mate App can track activity, sleep, weight, heart, and environment.</p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<p>While the Health Mate App works on Android devices, too, it doesn&#8217;t offer the ability to share the data with your physician yet.</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n</div>\n<p>The BPM Core device comes with a micro-USB cable and installation guide. The Health Mate app is free and can be downloaded from an app store. You also get a free Withings account, which is where your data can be securely stored, accessed, and downloaded at any time.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>The cost is $249.95, and it will become available shortly. A travel case for $29.95 will also be available soon. It will come with free shipping, a 30-day return option, and a one-year warranty.</p>\n<p>There is a link on <a href=\"https://www.withings.com/us/en/bpm-core\">Withings</a> where you can put your name on the list to be one of the first to purchase the smart blood pressure monitor.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Although this blood pressure monitor is more expensive than others on the market, it offers more functionality and features that greatly increase its value.

Increased venture funding has been helping to develop a robust tech ecosystem with major hubs in Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. Here&#8217;s how public venture funding can help build Canada&#8217;s tech talent.</p>\n<p>Despite this noticeable growth, however, Canadian tech companies still face significant challenges when it comes to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/today-the-tech-talent-shortage-is-everybodys-problem/\" data-original-title=\"\">attracting and retaining top-quality talent</a> — but that’s starting to change.</p>\n<p>Public venture funding has become a valuable avenue for growth for early-stage businesses in the sector, helping to put Canada’s tech industry on the map for professionals both locally and abroad.</p>\n<h2><b>Where Canada’s Tech Talent Landscape is Today</b></h2>\n<p>Canada’s capabilities for developing tech talent are evident across a number of its post-secondary institutions, and technical education is also seeing investment from industry players.</p>\n<p>Shopify is working with Carleton and York universities to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/careers/management/article-tech-companies-increasingly-hiring-passionate-committed-talent/?utm_medium=Newsletter\" data-original-title=\"\">recruit grade 12 students</a> for a co-op computer science degree. Despite such efforts, up to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-canada-facing-brain-drain-as-young-tech-talent-leaves-for-silicon/\" data-original-title=\"\">25% of STEM graduates</a> from the country’s top universities leave Canada to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/06/11/the-investment-landscape-of-the-future-toward-many-silicon-valleys/\" data-original-title=\"\">work abroad</a>, taking the investment into their education — and their potential to generate tax dollars — with them.</p>\n<h4>Canada is working hard to make it easier for skilled professionals from abroad to make their way into our growing tech ecosystem.</h4>\n<p>Government-led programs like the <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html\" data-original-title=\"\">Startup Visa Program</a> and the <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/05/why-we-moved-our-silicon-valley-startup-to-canada/\" data-original-title=\"\">Global Talent Stream</a> are proving successful in attracting quality talent.</p>\n<p>With the Global Talent Stream, for instance, the country has reduced visa-processing times from 10 months to two weeks for those with a background in IT or STEM-related fields. To date, some 1,000 technology companies have hired 4,000 workers through the program.<b></b></p>\n<h3><b>Imported talent — along with the STEM graduates that stay in-country, are often recruited by major international companies.</b></h3>\n<p>These workers are recruited to work in international development offices.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, employees in these satellite locations are paid at a discount of what their peers make at HQ. The code developed in these offices is then monetized by international firms. The monetization reduces the effective share of corporate taxes funneled into the Canadian government.</p>\n<h4>Besides, these companies will often work to move their top talent to their international headquarters, further contributing to Canada’s tech talent gap.</h4>\n<p>All of these factors add up to a tenuous talent landscape that begs to be addressed by both industry and government alike — especially if we want to see Canada’s tech ecosystem participate alongside other global leaders.</p>\n<h2><b>Incentivizing Tech Talent to Stay</b></h2>\n<p>If we want to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/today-the-tech-talent-shortage-is-everybodys-problem/\" data-original-title=\"\">keep existing tech talent</a> in Canada, then we have to ensure that our tech industry is something worth staying for. On their part, tech companies are taking their fates into their own hands.<b> </b></p>\n<h3><b>To combat the lack of private venture funding in Canada, growth-stage businesses are leveraging public venture capital.</b></h3>\n<p>Public venture capital has been vital in establishing Canada’s leadership in the resource space. Canada’s average deal size across all deals in 2018 was <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://central.cvca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CVCA_EN_Canada_VC_Q3-2019_Final2.pdf\" data-original-title=\"\">C$12 million.</a> That figure is compared to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/3Q_2019_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf\" data-original-title=\"\">US$14.5 million</a> for early-stage companies and the US $42.2 million for late-stage companies in the United States.</p>\n<p>Junior mining and energy companies capitalized on public markets like TSX Venture Exchange to attract retail investors. The capitalization also builds success early on. We’re now seeing our technology community leverage these same mechanisms to foster growth.</p>\n<p>An added bonus? By being public, companies can better <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/29/five-ways-to-close-the-iot-skills-gap/\">attract qualified employees</a> with stock options, helping them buy into the long-term success of the business.</p>\n<h3><b>Both federal and regional governments are working to develop innovation incentives that could develop more appealing job opportunities for local and international professionals.</b></h3>\n<p>The job opportunities include the <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-research-and-development-tax-credits-are-you-eligible-part-2\" data-original-title=\"\">Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&#38;ED</a>) tax credit. Federal tax breaks are offered of up to 35% to private Canadian companies that have an R&#38;D cycle at the core of their business model.</p>\n<p>As a result, organizations can now afford to seek out highly skilled developers and engineers to help them develop new, <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/01/free-up-the-worlds-best-entrepreneurs-to-keep-inventing/\" data-original-title=\"\">disruptive products</a>.</p>\n<h4>Changes are also being made at the provincial level.</h4>\n<p>British Columbia, for instance, has established tax credits of up to 30% for individuals and corporations that invest in <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/investment-capital/venture-capital-programs/eligible-business-corporation/tax-credits\" data-original-title=\"\">eligible business corporations</a> (EBCs).<b> </b></p>\n<p>Tax credits have also helped increase investor interest in many BC-based technology companies, allowing them to better fund their product development and talent pool.</p>\n<p>As other provinces and territories opt to implement such practices, there is a greater opportunity for tech companies to access available funding and become more appealing to both home-grown and imported professionals.</p>\n<h2><b>There’s Still More to Be Done</b></h2>\n<p>These public and corporate initiatives are starting to make a difference in the development of Canada’s tech space, making it more appealing to potential employees both within and beyond its borders. However, there’s still more to be done.</p>\n<h3><b>To further incentivize growth in this market, Canada’s federal government needs to take measures that help level the playing field between private and public companies.</b></h3>\n<p>With the growing move toward <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/31/why-private-access-to-public-assets-will-decide-the-fate-of-smart-cities/\">public venture capital</a>, the government needs to recognize the value of public markets. The government must make it easier for growth-stage companies to list on an exchange while still having access to publicly funded incentives like the SR and ED tax credit.</p>\n<p>As well, the<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/05/10-fabulous-predictions-for-the-future-of-cryptocurrencies/\"> government should also reward investors</a> for putting their hard-earned dollars toward local businesses, expanding the EBC program across the country. These credits should be made available to public companies as well.</p>\n<p>With these measures in place, there will be added opportunities for growth-stage tech companies to make their mark in the space and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/19/5-essential-skills-all-entrepreneurs-need-to-build-success/\">provide attractive jobs</a> to both local and international talent.</p>\n<p>Given all of the initiatives designed to boost tech innovation and funding in Canada, it’s a great place for recent tech grads to build their careers.</p>\n<p>By continuing to develop the innovation ecosystem with support from government programs and private investment &#8212; Canada can further create a space that attracts and retains local talent and benefits the economy.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Image credit: annie spratt, unsplash</strong></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/public-venture-funding-could-help-build-canadas-tech-talent/\">Public Venture Funding Could Help Build Canada’s Tech Talent</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:00:24 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Public-Venture-Funding-Could-Help-Build-Canada%E2%80%99s-Tech-Talent.jpg","linkMd5":"09cd96bb8719681d7755f8847239f662","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-690_2321878de3bbb5c4.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Public-Venture-Funding-Could-Help-Build-Canada%E2%80%99s-Tech-Talent.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":48069,"destBytes":42842,"author":"Brady Fletcher","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Public-Venture-Funding-Could-Help-Build-Canada%E2%80%99s-Tech-Talent-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-27-606_083c09e06aac6730.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195881022},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","title":"Outsource or Automate?

However, leaders have to delegate correctly. The act of delegating a task doesn’t merely involve dumping the work off and never giving it a second thought. Here is the question, do you outsource or automate? How do you strategically take tasks off your plate?</p>\n<p>Done right, delegating work should be carefully thought out with an eye toward the future. Will the person carrying out the task be able to deliver the expected results on time? Will he be able to help you focus on other things, or will you need to continue an unsavory micromanaging role?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the question that haunts modern leaders most when it comes to delegating tasks is whether they should hand off a job to another human — or a machine. Below are a few easily delegated tasks, along with insights into whether they should be entrusted to a human or an automated process.</p>\n<h2><strong>Invoice Data Entry</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most mind-numbing processes facing financial professionals is the daunting task of invoice data entry. Processing invoices is easy enough for a small business with a handful of financial interactions. When a company grows beyond that point, though, the volume of invoices can spike. That can make it nightmarish to keep up with inputting the data.</p>\n<p>Do you outsource this to an accountant, who can spend her days punching in numbers for you? Or is there a viable automated solution? According to data extraction company Rossum, smart optical character recognition (OCR) <a href=\"https://rossum.ai/blog/what-is-invoice-data-capture/?utm_source=facebook&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_campaign=blog_what_is_invoice_data_capture\">invoice data entry</a> is now easily automated.</p>\n<p>Not only can the newest software scan a document and gather data from it, but through machine learning, it can also find the data in a variety of templates and formats. The data entry software can then enter the relevant data, turning it into usable information within your accounting system.</p>\n<p>While you still want someone available to oversee the data collection process, you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to automate invoice data entry.</p>\n<h2><strong>Social Media Management</strong></h2>\n<p>Social media can dramatically help companies in multiple areas, especially when it comes to marketing and customer service. However, the benefits of a good social media strategy can be overshadowed by the intimidating job of regularly creating and posting content for various social channels.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are multiple options to help take this one off your plate. Best of all, they involve outsourcing <i>and</i> automation. To start with the latter, automate most of your social media efforts by utilizing applications to organize and schedule your social media calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a> and <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a>, for instance, are allow you to automatically post content at the correct times. In addition, software like <a href=\"https://zapier.com/home\">Zapier</a> can enable you to post content to one place, such as WordPress, and have it automatically spread across multiple social channels.</p>\n<p>However, you can’t properly automate the actual creation of content — not yet. For that, consider outsourcing your efforts. Fortunately, millions of freelance writers, editors, graphic designers, and content managers are available for hire. Most cost pennies on the dollar compared to a full-time employee. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\">Upwork</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/\">Fivver</a> provide easy access for short-term jobs, while sites like <a href=\"https://problogger.com/\">Problogger.com</a> source candidates for long-term freelance positions.</p>\n<h2><strong>Customer Service</strong></h2>\n<p>Customer service is more important than ever. There&#8217;s competition in nearly every industry, and online platforms empower customers to provide very public feedback. The way you treat your existing customer base has <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/284799\">never been more essential to success</a>.</p>\n<p>However, customer service is a painstakingly time-consuming job that can soak up endless amounts of a leader’s time. This is especially true for entrepreneurs and SMB owners, who often put in much of the customer service legwork themselves.</p>\n<p>Increasingly sophisticated chatbots utilize <a href=\"https://anadea.info/blog/10-verticals-where-ai-is-making-an-impact-in-2019\">Natural Language Processing to understand and interact with humans</a>. However, they&#8217;re still limited in the scope of their abilities. Therefore, unless your customer service needs are extremely simple, it’s likely better to outsource the job to another human being.</p>\n<p>With that said, flesh out a proper transition process. Write out your expectations as you consider different call centers and customer service options. Don’t simply pass the baton without a thought — you could end up hurting more than helping.</p>\n<h2>Outsource or Automate?</h2>\n<p>Each situation warrants an “<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/outsourcing-automation-future-of-business-scalability/\">outsource or automate?</a>” conversation. Leaders need to take the time to consider their tasks — what activities can be delegated to free up time?

It doesn&#8217;t even matter if it&#8217;s even under the same roof as us. We find ourselves calling the customer service representative of an ISP &#8212; screaming our lungs out about their bad internet coverage. However, is it all their fault?</p>\n<pre>Read more: <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/18/5g-and-blockchain-what-to-expect/\">5G and BlockChain: What to Expect?</a></pre>\n<h2>There are many reasons WiFi can be awful &#8212; due to the fact that even a good internet connection can be deemed unfit.</h2>\n<p>Internet, although, a part of our daily routine ends up making us feel highly frustrated &#8212; think many.</p>\n<h4>Here are some reasons your WiFi might be acting out.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Distance</strong> –</h4>\n<p>At times, the routers and access points have a limited reach of up to 100 feet indoors. They are designed to have a low-power broadcast in order to reduce the chances of interference with other equipment in the area.</li>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Construction</strong> –</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, Wi-Fi signal drops in particular rooms even though it is strong in the other ones. This is mainly due to the construction of your home in such a manner. Thick walls especially those that contain plaster and lath create a metallic mesh within the walls themselves.</p>\n<p>Such walls can successfully upset any WiFi signal that might pass through it. The signal might be reduced to minimal strength or be jammed completely.</li>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Device Interference</strong> –</h4>\n<p>Various non-WiFi devices can interfere with the signals due to a match in their operating bandwidth. A WiFi device runs in the 2.4 GHz bandwidth. But so do remote alarm products, cordless phones, wireless microphones, mobile phones, and even Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>Moreover, microwaves are also able to create significant interference for the frequency range used by other wireless non-Wi-Fi devices, which in turn can block the signals completely.</li>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Other Wi-Fi Devices</strong> –</h4>\n<p>Wireless devices tend to function as per the art of transmitting and receiving data on distinct paths. At times, they shift from the specific instructions to the same default channel.</p>\n<p>Thus, if you have more than one WiFi device around the house, office, etc. then you are just forcing all their signals to compete with each other &#8212; in the same frequency bandwidth.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong><u>Combating the challenges</u></strong></h2>\n<p>The latest WiFi products (802.11n) are to have a higher frequency range, therefore, the issue of <strong>distance</strong> can be tackled by observing its distance. In order to have a better and reliable network, over a lot of ground area. The best thing to do would be getting additional wireless routers or repeaters.</p>\n<h4>Wireless routers, repeaters or ethernet cable will enhance your coverage as long as you place them at a healthy distance from each other.</h4>\n<p>One thing that will always remain the same is your own distance from the device. The closer you will be to it the stronger connectivity signals you will have.</p>\n<p>When you seem to have a <strong>construction</strong> issue that might be interfering with the signal, you will need to change the router’s position to a more common ground for all the rooms.</p>\n<p>Change the position as much as you have to, the more you do it – the more you’ll know. Create a structured formation line and place your router as per that configuration to avoid the chances of intrusions.</p>\n<h4>If you think that there might be too much <strong>device interference</strong> then your strategy to overcome this would be placing such wireless devices away from the router.</h4>\n<p>However, if the disturbance persists you would have to replace those devices with wireless-friendly substitutes or equipment with 5GHz frequency bands (802.11n products).</p>\n<p>Since we already know that, <strong>other WiFi Devices</strong> may affect your signals as well. The best plan of action for you is to switch to a different frequency or a less packed area. A <strong>signal booster</strong> may also help you combat the challenges a WiFi device presents.</p>\n<h4>You can also install a <strong>DD-WRT</strong> on your router if it is possible.</h4>\n<p>All wireless routers have a pre-installed firmware designed with a software that helps its hardware work efficiently. Some of such routers have the ability to run 3<sup>rd</sup> party firmware as well, in order to boost their function.</p>\n<p>A DD-WRT is able to boost Wi-Fi signals by help you customize the router settings as per your desire. However &#8212; just remember that you need to adjust the amount of power your router can draw safely. Otherwise, it’d end up being overheated, and you losing your money to another router.</p>\n<pre>Read more: <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/05/9-main-security-challenges-for-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things-iot/\">9 Main Security Challenges for the future of IoT</a></pre>\n<h2><strong>How to Detect such Issues?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are many apps that can help you detect and recognize such issues without having to invest too much time.

While some might be able to help you come across every single thing that you ought to know others might just tell you about your signal strength or the position.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netspotapp.com/\"><strong>Netspot</strong> </a>is by far the best Wi-Fi analyzer app that I have come across. The company offered me a <em>Netspot Pro License</em> key for a month’s trial in September 2019, and it has done nothing but made my life easier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pictoral-Guide-for-NetSpot.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-162833 size-full\" src=\"https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pictoral-Guide-for-NetSpot.jpg\" alt=\"Pictoral Guide for NetSpot\" width=\"800\" height=\"2000\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>How does NetSpot work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Netspot is a software tool that is available on mobiles as well as laptops &#38; computers.

You can check the strength of each signal by clicking on it in the <strong>graph</strong> <strong>column</strong> alongside the other nit-grit piece of information that might come in handy. You can even download its CSV report.</p>\n<p>The other mode, “<strong>Full Site Survey,</strong>” helps you create a map or customize their sample map and place pins where you think all the WiFi devices are, one by one.</p>\n<h4>Once complete, you can start the survey and check which connection is strong and which isn’t.</h4>\n<p>The survey offers 15 different heat map visualizations &#8212; each one to focus on a different area of the WiFi assessment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-162829 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys-900x450.jpg\" alt=\"Active and Passive surveys in NetSpot for better internet connectivity\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys-900x450.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys-260x130.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Passive-Surveys.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>By far, this is the only app that I know of with this many heat map visualizations and detail.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why is WiFi Range and Position important?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have an office or company, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/3-ways-to-boost-the-efficacy-of-your-digital-marketing-plan/\">digital marketing</a> (being today’s best mode of customer acquisition) for you will be a failure.

It is also easy to cave to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/29/how-to-battle-severe-depression-as-an-entrepreneur/\">procrastination or to allow bad habits</a> to creep in. Another poor habit I&#8217;ve seen is individuals falling into the trap of social hysteria. While the fear is very much valid and certainly not out-of-place at this time, worry and fear will add no value to our individual lives, nor to our society.</p>\n<p>All that being said, we have two choices. We can sit tight and wait anxiously for the next months to pass and come out on the other side, or we can commit ourselves to make the most of the crisis and grow as individuals and a part of our company.</p>\n<h2><strong>Productivity</strong> <strong>vs. Proactivity</strong></h2>\n<p>Both words have been tossed around a lot for a long time. You can hardly read any self-improvement content without reading about being proactive and productive. I believe we should start by defining what each of those terms means and why both are a vital part of any efficient employee.</p>\n<h3>To be productive definition:</h3>\n<blockquote><p><i>“The effectiveness of productive effort, especially in industry, as measured in terms of the rate of output per unit of input.”</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>While subjective, productivity generally means to have effective production methods that generate significant results in terms of predefined targets. Being productive in my line of work would mean to be able to produce more articles for the same period while maintaining the same or higher quality of work.</p>\n<h3>To be proactive definition:</h3>\n<blockquote><p><i>“Creating or controlling a situation rather than just responding to it after it has happened.”</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Being proactive demands more than just improving on your process for the sake of results. It can often mean there is a need for a higher level of self-involvement. Such as setting the goals yourself. Being able to identify issues without being pushed to from a different source. And once those issues are identified it demands to lay out a plan and following through until a reasonable solution is reached.</p>\n<h2>What do I need to be both?</h2>\n<p>Being productive is a must. Both as an employee and individual, getting things done efficiently can make all the difference as to how far your career goes. And for many professions being simply productive may be enough, but if you have more self-driven goals then you also need to be self-driven in terms of proactivity.</p>\n<p>Being able to control situations as they arise is in your interest. That is beyond responding to external demands. Having a combination of both skills can unlock an entirely different realm of work for you. It can be the bridge to a leadership position or a successful independent business. Many have excelled with the opportunity to work as freelancers, especially in the IT industry.</p>\n<h2><strong>Professional Proactivity</strong></h2>\n<p>I am currently a part of a company that develops healthcare solutions (dreamix.eu), and we are all doing our best to stay on top of our game and remain productive despite the current working conditions. And while we all have laid out all of the objectives we are hoping to keep up with, there is more to maintaining a business throughout this crisis.</p>\n<p>Meeting the minimum demands is not enough. We need to do more. We can participate in thinking up ways to make the process more efficient to meet our targets and keep the business running, or finding ways to make a difference in society.</p>\n<p>Right now, people, businesses and communities need help. And there is a lot that can be done to contribute to our world at this time.</p>\n<p>For instance, our CEO initiated a “Hack the Crisis” event. The goal was to connect professionals from various fields, provide them with resources and experienced mentors, and unleash their creativity and problem-solving skills. In only a week the team put together and released the event. And in the duration of a weekend, 800 people joined in and developed 111 projects. Some of which will get the funding to be developed and be released to assist the crisis.</p>\n<h2>Here are a few examples of what the teams came up with:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Corona Positive </b>&#8211; a platform that is aiming to assist people with the mental toll of the current social situation. Along with connecting psychologists with people who seek them, the platform also makes strides to add a shred of positivity to people’s lives by connecting them with like-minded peers. The goal is to limit the devastating impact that the COVID- 19 is expected to have on everyone’s psyche.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Online doctor</b> &#8211; A system that allows online diagnostics to limit the face-to-face interactions between doctors and patients. With the world-wide hospitals packed with corona patients, it is less than safe to conduct a usual exam.\n<p>And while all emergency doctors are still on call and respond to all health issues, if possible avoiding contact is a must. The platform provides a reliable, secure and confidential channel for doctor-patient communication. It also records all history of consultations to allow doctors access to medical history and give them a chance for a more precise diagnosis.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SmallBags </b>&#8211; Businesses are closed. We all know that. And this is true for small grocery and convenience stores as well as non-essential services. The purpose of the platform is to connect people with a digital version of service to their favorite stores &#8211; as a result providing the business owner with income, and supporting the economy. For this to be possible, the store staff needs assistance in fixing and featuring the digital service.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Hero Courier &#8211; </b>a platform that connects volunteers and people in need of essentials delivery. A user can put in delivery over for themselves, they can also order necessities in the form of a donation to someone in a less fortunate circumstance. The couriers are volunteers and assist those who are under higher risk or cannot physically shop from grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are just a few of the ideas that were presented at the event. Being proactive in a time such as this goes beyond keeping your job, but also helping those who need it. As a direct result of being proactive, all participants made valuable connections to entrepreneurs in the community.</p>\n<p>Further, we were able to test the limits of everyone&#8217;s creativity- making a meaningful project to add to their CV and a newer appreciation for what they are capable of in just a short amount of time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Personal Proactivity</strong></h2>\n<p>As rewarding as assisting society can be, sometimes we need to help ourselves before we can help others. For many of us living under quarantine, uncertainty has become a core part of our lives and a constant worry can completely change us.</p>\n<p>It opens the door to degrading <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/06/can-iot-bridge-the-gaps-in-modern-mental-health-treatment/\">mental health</a> and lowered motivation to do things &#8211; for some; this means losing the drive to improve themselves and grow. I am sure I am not the only one who forgot to take care of myself for a while, overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>However, being proactive can be a tool to battle the current crisis. Even if considered just from the personal point of view. At the very least, we all need to be proactive in maintaining our health as best we can. Doing small things that are healthy can help our chances if we do end up sick with COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining a healthier mindset towards our habits will also help us all get back up on our feet once we come out on the other side.</strong></p>\n<p>My approach is simple. I started with consciously evaluating what is important for me right now. And then I thought about the small things I can do to feel better, healthier and stronger. I am sharing all of this with you, hoping you will find value in my experience, and find ways to make your life better for your current and your future self.</p>\n<h2>What is important to me:</h2>\n<h3>Physical health</h3>\n<p>Being physically healthy is an obvious perk. The stronger I am, the better my chances at a better future. And also, the more I can help my family. In an attempt to protect them, I do all of the shopping for necessities so they do not have to get exposed.</p>\n<p>I am always well-protected with mask, gloves, and hand sanitizer on hand. I also maintain my habit of daily exercise with a simple goal: 10 to 15 minutes but daily. It can be stretching, it can be lifting weights. Or simply dancing around or taking a walk around the house. And usually, it ends up around 40 minutes of exercise simply because <i>it feels good and I don’t want to stop</i>.</p>\n<p>I also take a combination of vitamins daily, make an effort to eat balanced. No food group is off-limits, and I indulge with small portions, which has all but killed my binge-eating cravings. Maintaining health demands proactive measures.</p>\n<h3>Mental health</h3>\n<p>I happened to end a long-term relationship just before going on quarantine. The breakup, coupled with uncertainty and fear for myself and my family, took a toll on me for a couple of weeks. Which is why I took special note of my mental health.</p>\n<p>I battled it by doing more of what made me feel better. I slept as much as I needed and invested more time to communicate with my loved ones. Drinking a lot of water became a daily habit. And picked up journaling if I was in the mood to put my thoughts on paper. Writing my thoughts down gave me a chance to process them and move on from them. The key to journaling? Forget structure and perfectionism. Let it be gibberish that is out of order. Let it be hectic, let it be chaotic. The relief is worth it.</p>\n<h3>Professionalism</h3>\n<p>My work is important to me. I love my work, I am good at it and I enjoy it. So doing my best to maintain my healthy working habits was imperative for me to feel useful and <i>normal</i>. So I made it a priority to meet my targets and work at a healthy but productive pace. To do that I made some much-needed arrangements.</p>\n<p>I dedicated a corner in my room for work only: a desk and a couch. I sorted through all of my belongings and took my time setting up my room in a way that is easy to work in.</p>\n<h3>Personal and creative growth</h3>\n<p>Start small &#8211; the more you do it, the easier it will be and the better the results will be. Set small goals for yourself &#8211; something so easy that you can do it consistently with little to no effort. And adjust your approach as you go. If you feel like doing more of something, just do it! Within reason, of course.</p>\n<h2>Growth and productivity as a principle</h2>\n<p>All hardship in life challenges our values and principles. The current crisis has made many, question what is truly important to us in a time such as this. And for many of us, there are some core principles that seem to align: keeping our loved ones safe and healthy, maintaining a source of income and stability, giving back to the society we are a part of.</p>\n<p>There is one principle for me that I do not see as often as the others, that I truly believe can make all the difference. That is personal growth &#8211; in whatever shape or form. To grow, truly a person needs to be proactive and productive with performing activities that bring us closer to our self-assigned goals.</p>\n<p>For some, it may be getting more efficient with work. For others, it may be picking up a new skill and turning it into a hobby. And for others, it may be as simple as becoming more patient with themselves and their struggles.</p>\n<p>Whatever our own weak spots are and whatever our goals are we need to continue making efforts to grow individually. It is what will bring us a better future and help us stay healthier &#8211; both mentally and physically.</p>\n<p>I hope this inspired you to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/03/physical-vs-digital-health-what-you-need-to-know-about-privacy-and-healthtech/\">be more productive and proactive</a> when working on yourself!

The integration of technological advancements and the convergence of emerging technologies have expanded the reach of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/31/4-trends-that-are-transforming-the-future-of-healthcare/\">proactive and preventive care worldwide</a>. Still, there is a lot of room left for improving healthcare facilities and enhancing the sharing of the patient’s health information between clinicians and healthcare facilities.</p>\n<p>Every year, more than 50% of deaths occur due to chronic and fatal diseases like cancer, stroke, and heart disease. These diseases have affected the quality of life and health of many people globally. Now, technology can lend a helping hand in increasing the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic care for such diseases. Are we talking about diagnosis or treatment technology? Healthcare is capable of providing a personalized experience to patients.</p>\n<p>These days, we witness a paradigm shift in both medical device manufacturing and healthcare app development industries in favor of the end-users or patients. Internet of Things-enabled medical technology is responsible for this reactive care paradigm in the healthcare sector. As <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-in-healthcare-2016-8\">forecasted by BI intelligence</a>, the number of healthcare IoT devices will grow from 95 million in the year 2015 to 646 million in the year 2020.</p>\n<p>It is an unchallenged fact that the medical community can deliver high-quality healthcare services if individuals care for their health and preventive pre-diagnoses care. The convergence of IoT and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/19/healthcare-is-booming-hand-in-hand-with-the-technology-industry/\">healthcare technology</a> makes this possible by revolutionizing reactive and proactive healthcare services. IoT-powered healthcare services can enhance data collection and analysis, increase patient usability of services, and empower service providers and patients alike.</p>\n<p>From predicting to the prevention of the onset of diseases and respond to other health-related complications, the IoT technology can assist clinicians and the healthcare executives to act more rapidly. For example, the patient’s data regarding lab tests, history, and other clinicians’ therapeutic options can help healthcare service providers improve their responses during any emergency situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Role of IoT in Medical Services</strong></p>\n<p>Physicians have to spend a lot of time in collecting and analyzing the patient’s data. As the number of patients keeps on increasing, it is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/09/5-reasons-why-artificial-intelligence-is-important-to-you/\">difficult for them to analyze</a> all aspects of every patient’s health condition along with analyzing health data. There, IoT-enabled technologies come into the picture. These technologies alleviate these difficulties by providing specific information to physicians that can help them make informed decisions in real-time.</p>\n<p>What’s more, physicians can also spend more time on sensitive issues of the patient’s health and focus on major aspects. Here are the top three <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/31/repositioning-your-brand-against-cybercrimes-through-vpns/\">healthcare domains</a> on which IoT can have a major impact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clinicians can get a concise and holistic data of Patient’s condition with other physicians’ reviews</li>\n<li>Healthcare professionals can get a better insight into patient rehabilitation through data</li>\n<li>Easy and effective transfer of data between healthcare providers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simply put, IoT has started providing many benefits to the healthcare sector and facilitate healthcare service providers to transform the traditional procedures into patient-centric procedures. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/O610P1XM\">IBM Watson has developed Knowledge Integration Toolkit (KnIT) </a>for discovery. It consists of a three-phase process of exploration, analysis, and interpretation of the healthcare procedures. KnIT uses Watson’s AI platform to read and analyze scientific papers.</p>\n<p>Here, Watson enables clinicians and healthcare service providers to get rid of data analysis while allowing them to spend time on improving the patient’s conditions and vitals. Companies like Biotricity are pioneers in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/06/20/the-future-of-healthcare-is-mobile/\">developing remote patient monitoring technology</a>. These companies build medical devices that fetch the real-time patient data and transmit the same for analysis within the cloud securely.</p>\n<p>This IoT-powered technology can facilitate communication across various devices and the system. It is designed to communicate data over a secure network and facilitate better data analysis for healthcare providers. As a result, the healthcare company can serve patients in a better way. Physicians can get real-time actionable data with feedback.</p>\n<p>Taking the example of Biotricity, the company has a remote patient monitoring technology known as Bioflux. This technology can improve patient care and reduce inefficiency. Ultimately, it assists doctors to save lives. Let’s go through the key benefits of IoT-powered healthcare technology and its importance in the modern healthcare industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Benefits of IoT-based Medical Technology in the Healthcare Sector</strong></p>\n<p>Here we mention five major benefits of IoT-enabled medical technology.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get and share alerts real-time-</strong> Many IoT devices work on a 24/7 basis, and therefore, they can play a significant role in the health industry. If any unusual findings or data are detected, these devices immediately alert the user. In a way, such devices can help patients to get emergency treatment and prevent the condition to get worsened.</li>\n<li><strong>More engagement-</strong> Just like <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/19/increasing-customer-engagement-five-tactics-to-use/\">customer engagement</a>, patient engagement has also become a buzzword in the modern healthcare system. IoT-based medical technology enables the patients to get more control over their health journey and encourages them to participate in the healthcare program with more confidence.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost reduction-</strong> The greatest advantage of IoT devices is they can reduce operational inefficiencies that cost a lot to the company. Official research has predicted that IoT will continue to reduce these costs by 25% or $100 billion every year. IoT-based healthcare technology can help patients to prevent any emergency situation or making the condition worse thereby saving a lot of money.</li>\n<li><strong>Telehealth promotion- </strong>The telehealth approach can be implemented in the best possible manner with the help of IoT technology. It facilitates the patient to receive healthcare services without physically going to the physician’s clinic. The telehealth concept is a technological boon for people who live in remote or rural areas.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More effective and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/iot-can-put-your-data-at-risk-heres-how/\">relevant data- IoT devices</a> can collect useful and relevant data across different industry sectors. In the healthcare sector, such devices monitor the patient’s conditions round-the-clock and fetch better-quality data for the specialist’s reference. Also, IoT-enabled medical devices are programmed to analyze, interpret, and report the data instantly.</p>\n<p>Do you want to know the future of IoT-enabled medical technology? Read on to know the scope of IoT in the healthcare sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Future of IoT-enabled Medical Technology</strong></p>\n<p>The thriving healthcare sector will rely more on healthcare app development services in the future. Customized healthcare apps will fetch real-time data and help clinicians predict and control any possible disease outbreaks. IoT wearables can be connected with healthcare apps to change the face of healthcare services globally. Ingestible sensors, smart glasses, hearables or hearing-based wearables, and ‘moodables’ or devices that are used to relax patients with stress disorders, depression, and ADD.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is a significant decrease in suffering or pain and cost. Let’s take an example of a stroke algorithm. It is based on the severity of stroke during EMS (Emergency Medical Service). Thanks to this algorithm, the ambulance staff can get real-time information and use advanced tools to identify the type of stroke and assess the patient’s condition. Based on this, the ambulance can take the patient to the most suitable hospital for specific treatment.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, healthcare services remain inadequate to provide personalized experienced to patients especially when the number of patients keeps on increasing worldwide. In other words, patient engagement is reducing day-by-day and the incidents of nonadherence are increased. Clinicians and healthcare staff find it difficult to cope with the growing number of patients and manage every process smoothly.</p>\n<p>There, IoT-enabled medical technology can transform the processes into more result-oriented and patient-focused procedures. It provides real-time, relevant, and medical-grade information of every patient to healthcare professionals. What’s more, it facilitates patients and physicians to record, share, and reinforce critical data on a 24/7 basis. In a nutshell, the future of healthcare services is an IoT-enabled medical technology and we will witness its exponential growth in the coming years.</p>\n<p>However, one should not utilize IoT without taking protective measures in healthcare services. It is fair to mention that clinicians or specialists should remain <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/05/9-main-security-challenges-for-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things-iot/\">vigilant for protecting the patient’s confidential data</a>. The patient-related data is usually stored in the cloud, but there is always a risk of a data breach. Therefore, while making the most of the IoT technology, the effective plan for protecting the patient’s data should be in place.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/iot-and-healthcare-technologies-converge-for-better-patient-care/\">IoT and Healthcare Technologies Converge for Better Patient Care</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:00:09 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IoT-and-Healthcare-Technologies-Converge.jpg","linkMd5":"ce29cf31f11b14aad06b89f3229c7256","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-25-801_2fd722e56d6d333a.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IoT-and-Healthcare-Technologies-Converge.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":39003,"destBytes":30716,"author":"Robert Jackson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IoT-and-Healthcare-Technologies-Converge-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn27@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-10-421_618babae3da8d0c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877757},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"What Happens When a Tech Startup Fails?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168122","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/what-happens-when-a-tech-startup-fails/\" title=\"What Happens When a Tech Startup Fails?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"What Happens When a Tech Startup Fails?\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Even universally acclaimed startups with strong leadership and great ideas can go under, if there isn’t enough demand or if the landscape changes. We’ve heard of hundreds of young tech companies, from the first dotcom legends to groundbreaking, disruptive startups of the modern era, utterly failing. But with up to millions of dollars at stake, the remnants of a new technology still lingering, and dozens to hundreds of people suddenly out of a job, what really happens to a CEO and investors <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/how-to-avoid-being-part-of-90-of-failed-companies/\">after a tech startup fails</a>?</p>\n<h3>Corporate Structure and Finances: Venture Capital and More</h3>\n<p>First, you’ll need to consider the structure of the company and the type of finances involved. For the most part, startups with any kind of money at stake are structured as a limited liability company (LLC), a corporation, or something similar. If you were to start a company as a sole proprietor and CEO, your name would be practically interchangeable with the company’s; if the company took on debt, you’d be responsible for paying that debt back.</p>\n<p>However, LLCs and corporations are treated as separate legal entities. If you started “TechStart, Inc.” as a corporation, “TechStart” would be seen as a totally separate identity in the eyes of the legal system. If TechStart held $1 million in debt, and you personally owned TechStart, you would not be liable for TechStart’s $1 million in debt (in most situations). You could simply walk away to your next venture.</p>\n<p>There are also different types of financing to consider. If the company was very profitable and had an excess of cash, it probably wouldn’t be in a position to fail or close; in most cases, the company has outstanding debts and liabilities to consider. Typically, a company does everything it can to make those debts whole as it closes. For example, it would collect on outstanding accounts, apply those payments to any outstanding debts, liquidate assets to pay debts further, then start paying back any and all investors who contributed money to the startup. In many cases, venture capital investors and other investors will end up with a loss.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a business or individual involved with the business will need <a href=\"https://www.rowdywilliams.com/what-type-of-bankruptcy-is-right-for-me/\">to consider filing for bankruptcy</a>. Bankruptcy is a legal option that allows a business or individual to claim themselves unable to pay a debt. Usually when this happens, the entity must prove its current assets and debts in a court of law, and work together with owed parties to come up with a reasonable solution. Different types of bankruptcy, like Chapter 7 bankruptcy and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, may be viable options if an entrepreneur is dealing with personal debt, but the most common form of bankruptcy for business owners is Chapter 11; in some cases, you can continue running the business after filing Chapter 11.</p>\n<h3>The Closing Process for CEOs</h3>\n<p>Most business owners and CEOs involved in a struggling business will eventually need to follow a process to “close” the business or shut it down in a systematic way. First, they have to decide whether or not the startup is salvageable; this is a long and arduous decision process for many entrepreneurs. Many companies are able to lose money on paper for months, or even years, leveraging debt or new investment capital to keep going, and eventually become successful. Accordingly, most failure points are the result of a major impact to the business, and not just a reflection of financial performance; for example, you may note that sales and market interest are declining, or that there’s significantly more competition than you expected, or that your app simply isn’t working the way you thought.</p>\n<p>At this point, an entrepreneur usually has conversations with the board of directors, venture capital investors who are financially exposed to the company, mentors, and other authorities. If multiple people seem to be in agreement, it may be time to close the business. Otherwise, the entrepreneur may step down in favor of new leadership, or collectively, the company may pivot in an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/18/the-4-critical-challenges-of-tech-startup-pr/\">attempt to revitalize the business</a>.</p>\n<p>If the decision to close the business moves forward, the founder must reveal the information in a deliberate and organized way. Typically, they’ll speak with decision makers and lawyers first, coming up with a high-level game plan. Then, they’ll begin to let their employees know, and if appropriate, may put together a press release.</p>\n<p>From there, the company will move into shutdown mode. It will begin to collect money from outstanding accounts, alerting customers that the company is going out of business, and will file official dissolution documents—which will vary depending on the corporate structure.</p>\n<p>After that, the business will likely begin liquidating assets in an effort to pay off its debts and simplify the end-of-life process; for example, you may sell off your computers, sell any commercial property you acquired, and get rid of any company cars. After paying outstanding debts, including tax requirements, founders typically distribute whatever money is leftover to shareholders in one way or another. There may or may not be any leftover money to distribute.</p>\n<p>One by one, in order of increasing importance, employees are let go. The founder will cancel business licenses and permits as necessary, and close any financial accounts. From there, it’s important for the founder and other shareholders (like venture capital investors) to keep meticulous records of everything to do with the closure of the business in case they’re necessary to reference in the future.</p>\n<h3>Technology and Intellectual Property: What Do CEOs Do?</h3>\n<p>Many people start tech companies because they love the idea of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/29/5-misconceptions-you-should-know-about-before-launching-your-tech-startup/\">introducing some new, amazing technology to the world</a>. When that technology stops developing, or when the company runs out of money, it can be heartbreaking. But it doesn’t always have to end there.</p>\n<p>During the asset liquidation phase, entrepreneurs frequently consider their tech product, possibly including their patent or their intellectual property, as an asset to distribute. In this process, they may be able to sell the in-progress technology to an interested buyer. For example, if you were developing a new app, you could talk to big tech companies in a similar space, and invite bids to acquire the technology for their own purposes. While this isn’t ideal for any entrepreneur or CEO, it can help the idea find new life, and introduce enough money to the startup that it can adequately pay off investors and shareholders.</p>\n<h3>The Post-Mortem: Communicating With the Market</h3>\n<p>Depending on the situation, the founder, board of directors, and other decision makers in the company may take the time to put together a post-mortem. This can take the form of a letter to shareholders, a short statement to venture capital investors, or even a press release. The basic idea is to explain, concisely, what went wrong with the company, how it could have (or couldn’t have) been prevented, and what’s happening next.</p>\n<p>Post-mortems are especially valuable to CEOs in a similar space; it’s a good chance to teach your peers and/or the next generation of tech founders about the mistakes you made. It’s also a way to clear the air around your company, to squash any rumors about why the company really went under.</p>\n<h3>The Next Venture for a CEO</h3>\n<p>While it’s almost always heartbreaking for a CEO to watch their startup fail, they can usually take comfort in the fact <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/24/e-commerce-failures-and-mistakes-why-do-so-many-startups-fail/\">that failure is incredibly common</a>—to the point where most successful entrepreneurs have helmed at least one business that didn’t go as originally planned. Failure is, in many ways, a learning opportunity; it’s a chance for an entrepreneur to reflect on what went wrong, celebrate their successes, and consider how they can apply those lessons to the next venture.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, this is the period that defines whether an entrepreneur will be successful. Will they take the loss personally, fear the prospect of starting another business, and go back to a mainstream kind of career? Or will they channel this energy into another startup, and disrupt a new market?</p>\n<p>Startup failure isn’t especially glamorous, and it’s not what we like to think about when we think about the prospect of entrepreneurship. However, it’s important to realize the important role that failure plays in the tech ecosystem. It’s a natural part of the cycle, and a common occurrence; but in addition to representing loss, it also represents learning and rebirth.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/what-happens-when-a-tech-startup-fails/\">What Happens When a Tech Startup Fails?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 17:25:44 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails.jpg","linkMd5":"e90432c561d80b2f06979cc50064e3e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-22-871_154c5c9bba2c9dc5.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":97939,"destBytes":52732,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/when-tech-startup-fails-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-16-274_4a7f28ff3f0fa0a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880678},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"AI Changing Pen Testing Game Worldwide","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171546","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/09/ai-changing-pen-testing-game-worldwide/\" title=\"AI Changing Pen Testing Game Worldwide\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"penetration testing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/17/the-penetration-of-artificial-intelligence-in-indian-railways/\">penetration testing services</a> arose a century back when the attacks on the systems became frequent. Lots of companies started losing their sensitive data and it affected their customers in the worst way possible.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The loss of sensitive data is exactly when (and why) the world saw another technical industry rising.</strong> </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see one </span>pen testing company <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giving way to a whole new industry of penetration testing. The company collected the best tech brains and asked them to come up with solutions to stop cybercriminals from harming organizations and individuals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>However, the field of cybercriminals and testers changes faster than any other technical field.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyber Criminals keep coming up with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/tips-to-hire-and-retain-the-right-cybersecurity-professionals/\">new sorts of viruses and cyber-attacks</a>. To save people from falling into these traps, testing companies needed to evolve enough to plan for these viruses and stay one step ahead of the criminals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s dive into the history of penetration testing to see how it has evolved over time.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Penetration Testing in the Beginning</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses always had a reason to opt for penetration testing to stay at a great distance from malware and other viruses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, penetration testing was only designed for systems &#8212; making them secure from every angle. Soon it was discovered that a business can be targeted through phishing and social presence as well. </span></p>\n<p><strong>The multi-angled attacks forced penetration testing companies to come up with solutions for every possible cyber threat.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, testing was done manually where a team of testers would sit together, understand the software, list down all the requirements, and build test cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These test cases were then run one by one and the status of every test case was recorded. In the end, a report was prepared for the developers to understand the possible loopholes present, ways to recreate them, and ideas to cover them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Different techniques were introduced in the market to suit different requirements of the people.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the steps were almost always the same since it involved a team of human testers to carry out all the activities. Then came the era of more advanced technologies; ones powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Machine Learning tech was smart but was unguarded and open for the cybercriminals to attack and get hang of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although every </span>pen testing company<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> felt it was a good idea to use manual testing for this new category of tech, IoT, they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/05/blockchain-success-stories-show-valuable-opportunities/\">failed most of the time</a>. The failure clearly called for new ways to be devised and used for the betterment of the organizations and individuals using AI and ML technology gadgets.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Era of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although testers were trying their best to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">fight new cyber threats</a> with the help of manual testing, they lost the battle many times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the hands of criminals, Artificial intelligence started becoming more of a threat rather than being a blessing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When AI became a threat to criminals is when the world of pen testing introduced a new turn in history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence and machine learning were made a part of penetration testing. Different AI and ML techniques and tools were developed to help catch malware and viruses present in the system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you must be wondering if artificial intelligence is so strong in the hands of criminals, should it not offer more benefits when used for pen testing? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, it should offer more benefits with pen testing &#8212; so here is how penetration testing companies are evolving with AI and ML embedded in their technologies and techniques:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Better Information Gathering</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most important stages of the whole pen-testing activity is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/11/23/controversy_surrounds_data_gathering_practices_of/\">gathering information</a>. It is also known as the reconnaissance stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to experts, if the testers manage to gather more data, in the beginning, the chances of their success gets even more than double. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is easy to say that and a lot difficult to do. In a pen testing activity, the team has only a limited amount of time to spend on gathering data. It is hard to ensure that the quality of the gathered data is the best.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With AI as constant support, a great amount of quality data can be gathered in a limited amount of time. One can even make use of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning to ensure a good profile of data is built with lots of details.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Scanning Systems</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing a lot of systems manually takes a lot of time. Also, since humans are bound to make mistakes, a lot of times loopholes go unnoticed in the system causing trouble later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/12/24/online-retail-ecommerce-scale-reactive-tomax/\">scanning hundreds of systems</a>, you can imagine the havoc manual testing can bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-empowered scanning ensures comprehensive coverage and good interpreted results. It can also be used to make a few amendments in the code where needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, it saves a lot of time and effort. Moreover, AI offers good test management and automatic creation of test cases. Hence, it makes your systems secure and sound in less time.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Maintenance and Access Stage</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the testers are past scanning, they are ready to gain access to multiple network devices and extract the targeted data and start testing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main purpose of this step is to ensure there are no loopholes left for the criminals to exploit later and take advantage of. The testing also includes checking for credentials for every employee and strong articles too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-based solutions are powered to try different password combinations to check how strong the passwords are to break-in. Different algorithms are designed to observe user data, on-going trends, present patterns, and train themselves to do better testing.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Better Reporting</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last stage of penetration testing followed by every </span>pen testing company<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (kualitatem dot com) is the reporting stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The reporting stage usually tests the ability of the attackers to cover their tracks and remove all traces of their presence in the system.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These kinds of evidence can be found in existing access channels, user logs, and unexpected error messages raised due to the infiltration process.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Manual testing has failed to find these issues at a larger scale making it easy for the attackers to perform their tasks without management being aware of their presence.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> On the other hand, artificial intelligence tools can easily discover hidden <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/12/know-your-enemy-the-5-different-types-of-data-breach/\">backdoors</a>, traces of the presence of cybercriminals in the system, and multiple access points that were not supposed to be there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once found, these activities and their details are stored and saved in a report. The detailed report also contains a proper timeline against every attack done.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Overall Benefits of AI-powered Pen Testing</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we have talked about the benefits AI has to offer and the changes it is introducing in the penetration testing world, we are able to count the benefits on our fingertips. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is the whole list of the ways AI-powered pen testing is much better than manual testing.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since artificial intelligence is involved in AI-based pen testing, the results are returned faster than manual testing. This decreases the expected investment of time and gives more time to developers to fix issues.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-based penetration testing ensures there are no loopholes left once the testing is done. This makes your system and software more secure as compared to manual testing.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The test results are more accurate as compared to manual testing. This leaves less headache for the developers and testers as well.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to companies, having AI do repetitive and boring tasks decreases investment. You can invest in an AI tool and forget about hiring and managing a large team of testers.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since organizations are growing at a good speed, it is hard to test for them through manual testing. Hence, AI-based testing ensures a large number of systems are tested with good results in less time.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tools are easily available in the market and stay updated with new threats and viruses entering the market. So you do not have to worry about upskilling your employees and investing in them.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/09/ai-changing-pen-testing-game-worldwide/\">AI Changing Pen Testing Game Worldwide</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 15:01:13 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide.jpg","linkMd5":"d15b21b180d05e8c352c862abd9d2c4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-22-639_80b04ebf9bf16804.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":48322,"destBytes":41944,"author":"Ray Parker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Changing-Pen-Testing-Game-Worldwide-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-14-217_b0733d6a442173b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873311},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"Understanding the Role of AI and ML in Sentiment Analysis","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167156","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/understanding-the-role-of-ai-and-ml-in-sentiment-analysis/\" title=\"Understanding the Role of AI and ML in Sentiment Analysis\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-the-Role-of-AI-and-ML-in-Sentiment-Analysis-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"AI and ML analysis\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-the-Role-of-AI-and-ML-in-Sentiment-Analysis-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-the-Role-of-AI-and-ML-in-Sentiment-Analysis-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-the-Role-of-AI-and-ML-in-Sentiment-Analysis.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As we all know &#8212; customer opinion and feedback is vital.

Now, smart technology has revolutionized how baby monitors work, providing a much better idea of what our babies are up to when we are not in the same room with them. The Cubo Ai Baby Monitor is one of the most technologically advanced, so I thought I would put it to the test with our littlest one. Here&#8217;s my review.</p>\n<h2>About Cubo</h2>\n<p>Joanna Lin started <a href=\"https://us.getcubo.com/pages/cubo-brand-story\">Cubo</a> after she could not find solace from the six different baby cameras she used to monitor her baby. A medical consultant/pediatrician, as well as technology experts, helped design the baby monitor.</p>\n<h2>How it Works &#8212; Features and Functionality</h2>\n<p>The first standout feature of this smart WiFi baby monitor is the covered face alert. The camera continually tracks your baby’s face. It will alert you if they get buried under pillows, blankets, or other items like stuffed animals. The danger zone alert is another essential feature. It lets you draw an area on the video from the app. That way, if your baby crosses that area, you get an alert.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-170221 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-900x596.jpeg\" alt=\"Smart Baby Monitor\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-900x596.jpeg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-242x160.jpeg 242w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-1536x1017.jpeg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor.jpeg 1807w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>Other features include infrared night vision, night light, camera zoom, and two-way talk. You can also record video as well as track room temperature and humidity. It does not offer features that other smart baby monitors may have, like playing lullabies or tracking baby&#8217;s health.</p>\n<p>Many baby monitors are easy to hack. However, Cubo encrypts all data and communications with a 256-bit symmetric-key encryption that is only accessible through your authenticated mobile device.</p>\n<h2>Video and Audio Quality</h2>\n<p>Cubo Ai has a 1080p wide-angle lens that is made by Sony. The picture is excellent during the day and night. Video streaming and sound quality also are superior to other baby monitors that we&#8217;ve tried.</p>\n<p>You’ll get a smooth video streaming experience as long as your Wifi connection is reliable. The remote function also provides welcome relief when you are away from home because you can still get a good quality video and zoom in from your phone.</p>\n<h2>Phone App</h2>\n<p>The phone app is also one of the best features, offering a way to control the baby monitor from either an Android or iOS device. The app is easy to set-up, including a fast registration process. There is also a family sharing account that can be set up so that more than one smartphone can sign in to the baby monitor.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-170222 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-635x719.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Baby Monitor Review\" width=\"635\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-635x719.jpg 635w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-265x300.jpg 265w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-141x160.jpg 141w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-1356x1536.jpg 1356w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-1808x2048.jpg 1808w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" /></p>\n<p>The Cubo Ai has a VOX mode, which means that the baby monitor works even if your screen is off. The app will run in the background and notify you if there is a relevant alert. It&#8217;s also possible to turn your screen off and just have the audio portion play. Otherwise, if you had to endure a continuous live video stream, your phone battery would die very quickly.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>There are many things to like about the Cubo Ai Baby Monitor. At the top of my pro list, the baby monitor delivers excellent video quality and zoom capability. It also has a high-performing app with customizable notifications and live video stream with only the slightest of delays. The baby monitor is really cute. Its design is the perfect fit for a nursery or child&#8217;s room because it resembles a toy rather than the typical baby monitor, which looks utilitarian.</p>\n<p>Another plus was the three options for mounting the baby monitor, including floor or mobile stand as well as crib mount. Other useful aspects of the Cubo include the covered face/rollover detection, which I could not find as a feature on other smart baby monitors.</p>\n<p>In terms of improvements, it could be easier to set up the baby monitor physically. However, it did feel sturdy once in place. There isn&#8217;t perfect packaging or presentation for storing the other two mounts that are not in use. It would be good if there were a storage case included. The app needs to be organized to make it easier to use.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-170220 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-900x600.jpg\" alt=\"Cubo Ai Baby Monitor Review\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>When you buy a Cubo Ai Baby monitor, you get the camera unit and two USB wall plugs. The box also contains the three mounting options, including the u-shaped camera holder (for putting it on a shelf), a mobile stand, a floor stand with base, and a critical stand.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>The Cubo Ai Baby Monitor is available on Cubo&#8217;s website as well as through retailers like Amazon. It&#8217;s available for $249 on Cubo&#8217;s website and offers free two-day and standard shipping. Their website also connects you with a financing option, but they also accept credit cards and PayPal.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Overall, I would recommend the Cubo Ai Baby Monitor over the other baby monitors I&#8217;ve researched and used. Although this baby monitor doesn&#8217;t have a feature like the baby&#8217;s health vitals, it is still an affordable, versatile option compared to the other smart baby monitors now available. It has provided solid peace of mind about your baby.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/cubo-ai-baby-monitor-a-smart-and-cute-way-to-protect-your-bundle-of-joy/\">Cubo Ai Baby Monitor: A Smart and Cute Way to Protect Your Bundle of Joy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:00:24 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cubo-AI-Baby-Monitor.jpg","linkMd5":"f924c2a1f756286d0ea0a2bdcc33cfe0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-24-241_a220f644193bce1c.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cubo-AI-Baby-Monitor.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":30482,"destBytes":23190,"author":"Deanna Ritchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cubo-AI-Baby-Monitor-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-15-731_769897c5d9e4e29f.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Smartbabymonitor-900x596.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-09-582_b3ae8349f87b743b.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smartbabymonitorreview-635x719.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-348_b41f3812a2eebf19.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CuboAIbabymonitorreview-900x600.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-904_480fe9036c574a19.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878375},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"How Technology Can Replace the Watercooler and Connect Employees","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169333","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/06/how-technology-can-replace-the-watercooler-and-connect-employees/\" title=\"How Technology Can Replace the Watercooler and Connect Employees\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-Technology-Can-Replace-the-Watercooler-and-Connect-Employees-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"tech to connect employees\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-Technology-Can-Replace-the-Watercooler-and-Connect-Employees-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-Technology-Can-Replace-the-Watercooler-and-Connect-Employees-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-Technology-Can-Replace-the-Watercooler-and-Connect-Employees.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Whether they like it or not, many businesses must learn to <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/05/remote-working-culture-the-facts-business-owners-need-to-know/\" data-original-title=\"\">work from home</a> as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. It remains to be seen whether this crisis will <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/11/the-modern-workplace-may-come-with-a-couch-chips-and-netflix/\" data-original-title=\"\">usher in a new era of remote work</a>. But in the meantime, companies must learn how to maintain a strong, healthy culture by proactively combating employee isolation and encouraging new ways to connect and share critical information.</p>\n<p>Of course, the actual work being done is an important part of the typical workday.</p>\n<h3><b>Employees also spend a lot of time chatting in the break room, sharing details about their personal lives, and brainstorming solutions to challenges.</b></h3>\n<p>The chats help employees feel like they’re part of a team and that their work matters. Though it’s easy enough these days to sit at a computer at home and cross tasks off our lists &#8212; it can be harder to maintain those channels of connection.</p>\n<h2><b>The Pitfalls of Remote Work</b></h2>\n<p>When employees feel cut off from one another and the company at large, they feel isolated.</p>\n<h4><b>Without regular interactions from these parties, they can easily <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/social-distancing-mental-health\" data-original-title=\"\">become stuck in negative thinking</a>. Their mood suffers, and engagement and productivity plummet.</b></h4>\n<p>Remote workers’ <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"http://workplacementalhealth.org/News-Events/Blog/January-2018/Loneliness-in-the-Workplace-Can-Be-a-High-Cost\" data-original-title=\"\">health can also deteriorate</a>: In fact, social isolation is correlated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and other ailments. This leads to higher health insurance costs and sick days — and you probably also want employees to stay healthy for their own sake, too.</p>\n<p>The risk of employees feeling isolated is even more severe when companies that usually encourage in-person interaction to establish remote work policies overnight. This was the case with many companies at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and it leaves no time to transition to remote life.</p>\n<h2><b>Building Remote Connections</b></h2>\n<p>It’s on company leaders to make relationship-building <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"http://workplacementalhealth.org/News-Events/Blog/January-2018/Loneliness-in-the-Workplace-Can-Be-a-High-Cost\" data-original-title=\"\">a strategic priority</a>. They must create new ways for employees to interact virtually and encourage cross-team collaboration, communication, and interaction — including chats that aren’t related to work.</p>\n<p>Leaders need to walk the walk, too: They should demonstrate the importance of building relationships virtually by reaching out to employees and scheduling one-on-one videoconferences and informal catch-up sessions.</p>\n<h4><b>Run-of-the-mill <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/30/best-collaboration-tools-to-manage-remote-workers/\" data-original-title=\"\">collaboration tools</a> (such as videoconferencing and instant messaging) are good places to start, but they’re not enough.</b></h4>\n<p>These tools are great at bringing together individual employees or small teams, but they’re not so great at facilitating connections across companies. Important messages can easily become lost in the noise.</p>\n<p>Again, when employees face prolonged periods of isolation, they need to feel connected to the company in addition to their co-workers and teammates.</p>\n<h2><b>The Right Tech for the (Remote) Job</b></h2>\n<p>Companies should invest in an <a class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/26/13-smart-strategies-for-keeping-remote-tech-workers-informed/#35e6cd541092\" data-original-title=\"\">accessible internal communications platform</a> that can serve as a centralized, trusted source for the company to communicate with employees and provide emotional support during uncertain times.</p>\n<h4><b>In other words, companies need a single place to share news, reinforce values, and celebrate wins.</b></h4>\n<p>For example, when Simpplr was in the process of moving to a new office, we were delayed for a week, forcing everyone to go remote. We used our own centralized platform to stay connected with departments and teams and kept everyone updated about move-in dates and new office policies.</p>\n<p>By using this technology and not relying simply on email or instant messaging, employees knew exactly where to go for updated, accurate information.</p>\n<h2><b>The Virtual Watercooler</b></h2>\n<p>Regardless of what tech you implement to keep connections <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/demystifying-8-core-myths-that-surround-the-internet-of-things/\">going strong among your remote workforce</a>, the goal for doing so should be to create a feeling of normalcy and help employees engage with one another. You can use technology to virtually replicate the office watercooler or break room.</p>\n<p>Here are a few ways to start your virtual watercooler:</p>\n<h3><b>1. Post weekly fun prompts.</b></h3>\n<div>\n<p>On your communication channel, post prompts that employees can respond to that aren’t related to work. For instance, you might ask questions about TV shows, movies, podcasts, or recipe recommendations.</p>\n<p>You could also host contests to see which employees come up with the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/03/6-ways-to-boost-employee-morale-with-visual-communication/\">best-themed photos each week</a>. This allows employees to connect in a fun, lighthearted way and talk about their hobbies and interests outside of work.</p>\n<div>\n<h3><b>2. Host virtual lunches.</b></h3>\n<p>Get people together from different departments or teams for lunch every few days. By connecting people who don’t typically work together on a day-to-day basis, you can help employees talk to people they usually wouldn’t be able to connect with and build new personal relationships.</p>\n<div>\n<h3><b>3. Recognize remote workers on a companywide scale.</b><b></b></h3>\n<p>Whenever remote workers have big wins or reach notable milestones, toot their horn. Just because they’re out of sight doesn’t mean they have to be out of mind, and a little bit of public recognition can go a long way in securing their trust and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Whether remote work is a crisis-only situation or becomes a new <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/24/5-technologies-to-support-working-from-home/\">norm for your company moving forward</a>, you need to proactively think through how to maintain your company culture and keep employees connected, healthy, and happy.

Consumers have more choices available to them than ever before and have come to expect products that are easy to use and effective. Clients and customers want you to be good at anticipating their needs and solving their problems. Here are four questions product managers should ask to ensure a stellar CX.</p>\n<h4><strong>Product managers are the driving force to guarantee quality and consistency in products and services.</strong></h4>\n<p>Your Product Manager is behind projects from conception through delivery and support, which puts the full responsibility for CX on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>Below are four questions product managers should ask themselves to make sure they’re delivering a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/21/a-better-customer-experience-why-little-things-matter/\">solid customer experience</a> and a product that meets users’ needs.</p>\n<h2><b>1. Do I </b><b><i>really </i></b><b>understand my customers?</b></h2>\n<p>Product managers always think they understand their customers: their goals, expectations, and the problems they’re seeking to solve.</p>\n<p>Often that understanding of the customer isn’t as deep as the company believes it is. It’s easy for any group of people to fall into groupthink about customers, operating on their preconceptions rather than objective customer data.</p>\n<h4>Add in helpful feedback from non-objective observers like colleagues and senior management, and a team can easily go in the wrong direction.</h4>\n<p>A non-vetted-vote creates a high risk that you’ll need to go back and redo work. You may be rushing either before launch when you discover the problems, or even worse after launch when you don’t get the traction you expected.</p>\n<p>The best way to control for this is to gain an in-depth, objective understanding of how your customers think and feel.</p>\n<p>You can gain this understanding via frequent contact with fresh customers who haven’t been contaminated by talking with you previously. I prefer to do this through video rather than in person, for reasons that I’ll explain below.</p>\n<h4><strong>Relying solely on quantitative data from surveys and analytics won’t cut it when you are searching for concrete data.<br />\n</strong></h4>\n<p>Your analytics will tell you what people are doing &#8212; but not what they’re thinking. Without human insight, you won’t be able to form high-quality hypotheses on what to build.</p>\n<p>It’s important to mention that not all customers are created equal when it comes to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/18/the-importance-of-customer-feedback-and-5-ways-to-obtain-it/\">obtaining feedback</a> to help guide product design. Product managers need to speak with users who are representative of their customer base as a whole—not outliers sourced from support.</p>\n<p><strong>Your noisy people on social media may not be the best resource.</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter is not a market research tool &#8212; it’s an echo chamber for enthusiasts. Getting feedback from the average customer allows teams to develop products that address the most common challenges users contend with. In this way, you can find &#8220;standard&#8221; goals that most often you&#8217;ll be trying to accomplish.</p>\n<h2><b>2. Is engineering on board?</b></h2>\n<p>Once product managers have a clear understanding of customer needs, it’s time to make sure engineering understands what to build and why.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned video feedback will prove useful here, giving engineers insights into what customers want—straight from the horse’s mouth.</p>\n<p>The video feedback lets you align the team quickly, and head off the religious debates that can sometimes slow down a product team. Video feedback from customers is emotionally compelling and settles disputes quickly.</p>\n<h2><b>3. Are all of the project’s stakeholders aligned?</b></h2>\n<p>Having easy access to customer video feedback is also helpful for aligning all of a project’s stakeholders. Often product teams are bombarded with helpful advice from random employees, senior management, or maybe a sales rep who’s on fire after a single customer meeting.</p>\n<p>Video feedback from customers aligns everyone by showing what users actually need, in their own words. This saves product managers the energy of having to explain why a product is being built in a certain way, a process that is usually slow and sometimes politically difficult.</p>\n<h2><b>4. Is my message being conveyed appropriately? </b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/07/27/customer-service-tech-personal-touch/\">Customer feedback</a> should also be shared with your customer-facing teams, especially marketing and sales.</p>\n<p>In addition to sharing the initial video feedback that led you to design the product, product managers (or your product marketing people, if you have them) can go back to customers again and test their value proposition to see if it holds true.</p>\n<p>Providing marketing and sales with insights on the problems they need to solve, and which features customers liked, ensure that the messages will reflect the real strengths and benefits of your product.</p>\n<p>From there, these teams have a solid framework from which to develop content that will closely resonate with prospective customers.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, marketing and sales teams are presented with the task of marketing a product to customers without the added feedback and context you want them to have.</p>\n<p>Sales may be successful in communicating certain selling points, but you&#8217;ll want them included and coordinated with the feedback so your results aren&#8217;t disjointed campaigns with materials that don’t do the product justice.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Qualitative customer feedback is the backbone of creating <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/07/3-ways-to-make-customer-experience-your-differentiator/\">outstanding CX</a> and proves to be valuable at nearly every step in the product development process. By keeping in mind these four crucial questions, product managers can keep their projects on the path to delivering a product that is tightly aligned with customer needs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/4-questions-product-managers-should-ask-to-ensure-a-stellar-cx/\">4 Questions Product Managers Should Ask to Ensure a Stellar CX</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:10:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Product-Managers-Should-Ask-to-Ensure-a-Stellar-CX.jpg","linkMd5":"24bbd5825de406ea3a3105c5443fcad9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-09-605_b251825cfebe953b.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Product-Managers-Should-Ask-to-Ensure-a-Stellar-CX.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":38890,"destBytes":31314,"author":"Michael Mace","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Product-Managers-Should-Ask-to-Ensure-a-Stellar-CX-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn63@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-10-535_ed4c7c8e12489239.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875292},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"Artificial Intelligence: Forecasts for 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=166069","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/04/artificial-intelligence-forecasts-for-2020/\" title=\"Artificial Intelligence: Forecasts for 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"artificial intelligence forcast\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020-900x601.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-Intelligence-Forecasts-for-2020.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dqindia.com/predictions-2020-ai-time-turn-artificial-reality-checks/\">53% of global data and analysis </a>established by decision-makers announced that artificial intelligence is established, or in full development within their company.

Concerning the implementation of automatic responses or chatbots (robotic discussions), &#8211; programs are designed to converse with Internet users or customers in the guise of a human &#8211; also called <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/04/9-critical-questions-to-consider-when-assessing-a-conversational-ai-solution/\">conversational agents</a>.</p>\n<h5>Conversational agents.</h5>\n<p>These conversational agent programs are also supposed to save time, especially for HR employees and IT (Information Technology) teams. There will need to be certain monitoring tools using Machine learning for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/11/evolving-relationship-between-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data/\">Big Data processing</a>. The programmers having previously created algorithms allowing the computer to sort the data.</p>\n<h5>Sorting data.</h5>\n<p>The more the algorithms sort the data, the more AI will be able to recognize the data that&#8217;s considered normal &#8212; and be able to find the data testifying to abnormal behavior. The human operator is therefore, directly directed by the machine towards abnormal behavior and can focus more quickly on the corrective measures to be taken.</p>\n<h5>Investment in automatic processes.</h5>\n<p>The increase in investment in this type of automatic process is partly due, according to the Forrester firm, to the anticipation of an economic downturn linked to the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/china-great-slowdown-economic-growth-slumps-27-year-191018035548056.html\">economic recession</a> in China.</p>\n<p>The economic recession in China could risk raising interest, which could dampen not only consumption and investment, but also reduce the market value of companies. Reducing market value is especially true in technology companies. The tech businesses have valuations that are highly dependent on the growth of profits in the long term.</p>\n<h5>Targeted automation.</h5>\n<p>No wonder companies are looking to develop the sectors to ensure the efficiency of their services. This type of targeted automation is also quicker to set up, and less costly than a transformation towards AI innovation projects, requiring a long-term investment, specifies the report.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>AI benchmarks, a new weapon of competitiveness.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the AI market grows and computing platforms struggle to be recognized as the fastest, most scalable, and least expensive to deal with artificial intelligence workloads. Benchmarks of the industry should play an increasingly important role.</p>\n<h5>Benchmarks.</h5>\n<p>Last year, the MLPerf benchmarks stood out as the benchmark in terms of competitiveness. All players, from Nvidia to Google, boasted of superior performance on these tests.</p>\n<p>In 2020, AI benchmarks will be a crucial element of the marketing strategy, and this segment will only become commonplace over time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>A development far from weakening in the face of certain reluctance or questioning.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forrester sited <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/what-it-means/ep28-artificial-intelligence/\">dangers</a> linked to the use of artificial intelligence. A few examples of the risks are disinformation due to the filtering of certain algorithms on social networks, mass technological <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/19/facial-recognition-shaping-the-future-of-identity-verification-market/\">surveillance thanks to facial recognition</a> (as is the case in China), the proliferation of “deep fake” videos thanks to the intelligent permutation of faces or algorithmic discrimination.</p>\n<h5>Reproduction of discrimination in society.</h5>\n<p>AI can show (either by genuine or fake means) an unmatched amount of data. The data can present a lack of diversity and reproduce the discriminations of our societies. We were able even to witness the origin of an accident caused by an autonomous car from Uber, for example.</p>\n<p>All of this will not diminish AI investment in companies in 2020, according to Forrester. These incident reports will lead to demonstrate the importance and the need for AI and to be “transparent” in its use. Additionally, the AI findings will show areas begging the need for improvements to be made &#8212; all described in the Forrester report.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Consideration of data source needs.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Forrester, the implantation of AI in companies will necessarily encourage managers to take the necessary measures to facilitate the work of developers in Machine Learning. For the most part, companies spend more than 70% of their time recovering all the data essential to the proper functioning of their programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>AI in SaaS mode reduces demand for data scientists.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since last year, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2019/02/06/the-microsoft-amazon-ibm-google-clouds-enable-emerging-technologies-and-everything-else/#50a5c0e82c65\">the machine learning offered as a service</a> from suppliers such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and others has gained momentum.</p>\n<p>As the trend for AI picks up, more and more business users will rely on these cloud providers to meet more of their AI needs. Cloud providers will allow businesses to move from teams of data scientists employed internally.</p>\n<h5>Saas providers and AI.</h5>\n<p>By the end of 2020, SaaS providers will become the primary providers of natural language processing, predictive analytics, and other AI applications. These AI applications will include tools such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/05/15/artificial-intelligence-transform-devops-dl1/\">platform services and DevOps tools</a>.</p>\n<p>Companies that will continue to support internal AI initiatives will further automate the roles of data scientists, so they will not need to hire new machine learning modelers, data engineers, and support workers. Over the decade, most data scientists will be recruited primarily by SaaS and other cloud providers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Continuous real-world experimentation for enterprise AI.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each enterprise digital transformation initiative is based on the use of the most suitable learning models. The learning models approach requires experimentation in real situations where AI-based processes test alternative machine learning models. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/18/4-mistakes-of-machine-learning-startups/\">ML model</a> will automatically choose those tests and models that allow the desired result to be achieved.</p>\n<h5>Real-life experiments in business processes.</h5>\n<p>By the end of 2020, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/10/businesses-can-safely-and-efficiently-adopt-artificial-intelligence/\">most companies will implement real-life experiments in all business processes</a>, both in contact with customers and those in the back-end.</p>\n<p>As businesses <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-intelligent-data-addresses-the-chasm-in-cloud/\">turn to cloud providers</a> for their AI tools, features like those launched recently by AWS will model iteration studios, and tracking devices. There will be Multi-model experiences, and model-tracking dashboards. All of these features will become the norm in 24/7 AI-based models of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/the-cloud-is-the-future-of-software-delivery/\">professional application environments</a>.</p>\n<h5>Best practices for optimizing AI.</h5>\n<p>Over the decade, AI-based automation and DevOps capabilities will spawn a universal best practice for optimizing AI-based business processes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>The work of modeling AI developers automated by AI.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neural networks are at the heart of modern AI. In 2020, the work plans of corporate data scientists will begin to incorporate a new methodology based on AI called &#8220;neural architecture research,&#8221; it is intended to automate the construction and optimization of neural networks according to objectives.</p>\n<p>As it is adopted and improved, <a href=\"https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/ai-machine-learning/neural-architecture-search-could-tune-ais-algorithmic-heart/a/d-id/1336275\">research into neural architecture</a> will boost the productivity of data scientists, help them make decisions to build their models based on established machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and random decision tree forest algorithms, or any of the latest and most advanced neural network algorithms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>End-to-end transparency of regulated AI.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI is becoming an increasingly important risk factor in enterprise applications. As companies face an upsurge of lawsuits on socio-economic biases, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/13/ai-how-its-impacting-surveillance-data-storage/\">privacy breaches, and other unfortunate effects</a> of AI applications, legal officials will demand full tracking of machine learning models to find out how they were built, trained, and managed, and how they are used in enterprise applications.</p>\n<p>By the end of 2020, the legal managers of most companies will ask their teams of data scientists to record each step of the machine learning process automatically, and to explain in plain language the automatic inference induced by each model. Over the next decade, the transparency of AI projects will be decisive for obtaining funding.</p>\n<p>Finally, it can be safely assumed that, in the coming years, demands for AI-based capacity regulation for all products. We will especially see those products that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/27/are-solutions-keeping-up-with-iot-security-concerns/\">use personally identifiable information</a> &#8211; will increase.</p>\n<p>Besides the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/09/5-reasons-why-artificial-intelligence-is-important-to-you/\">growing importance</a> given to transparency <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/18/what-can-we-expect-for-iot-in-2020/\">in the development of AI</a>, it is too early to say what the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-will-it-shape-up-the-future-of-the-internet/\">impact of these future regulations</a> will be on the evolution of the underlying platforms, tools, and technologies.

According to the Real Estate in a Digital Age 2019 Report by the National Association of REALTORS®, in 2018, 44% of buyers looked for properties online first. The Internet is often the first place people look when searching for a new home. Here are four technology trends shaping property portals.</p>\n<p>Gone are the days of having to browse newspaper classifieds and drive through neighborhoods to find the perfect home. Today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/19/5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-real-estate-industry/\">property marketplaces</a> make it easy for homebuyers and renters to search specific properties without ever stepping foot outside their homes.</p>\n<p>As property portals continue to grow in popularity, they also face changes due to industry trends. Here are four trends shaping real estate marketplaces.</p>\n<h2>1. Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to generate better search results.</h2>\n<p>Many people become overwhelmed when searching for a new home. Real estate portals recommend properties based on details such as square footage, price, number of rooms, etc. However, they often show irrelevant results and more information than potential buyers need.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/06/where-will-ai-take-the-real-estate-market-in-10-years/\">AI and machine learning</a>, property marketplaces can help consumers more accurately search for homes. Similar to how Amazon shows consumers relevant products based on their behavior, portals using AI can recommend properties that match consumers&#8217; lifestyles, preferences, and values.</p>\n<p>For example, if a user clicks on numerous properties with quartz countertops, machine learning algorithms enable real estate marketplaces to suggest similar listings that may be of interest to them. Portals can deliver fewer, higher-quality properties based on consumers&#8217; wants and needs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/13/does-your-business-really-need-an-ai-solution/\">property marketplaces </a>allow users to collaborate with family and their agents to pick the houses that interest them. They can group homes that fit their unique style into specific categories, such as “five bedrooms or more” or “homes with beach access.” Instead of switching between numerous tabs and sorting through lists of links, users can keep track of properties in one place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/the-challenges-and-opportunities-for-automation-in-the-real-estate-industry/\">Advancements</a> in AI and machine learning are helping property marketplaces simplify the home search experience and deliver far better results to potential buyers.</p>\n<h2>2. Facebook could become a property portal competitor.</h2>\n<p>Zillow and Trulia are the most popular real estate portals in the world. Meanwhile, there&#8217;s the possibility that Facebook might be building its own property marketplace to become the next competitor in the industry.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, Facebook <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/protecting-against-discrimination-in-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published an article on its news page</a> that stated it was building a tool so that users could &#8220;search for and view all current housing ads in the U.S. targeted to different places across the country, regardless of whether the ads are shown&#8221; to them.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s unclear precisely what the tool is, a standalone property search portal within the platform where <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/getting-high-returns-on-real-estate-investment/\">real estate businesses</a> where advertise directly would be a massive disruptor to traditional property portals. It would also change the way consumers search for properties online.</p>\n<p>If Facebook does roll out a property portal, it may force other marketplaces to rethink their current approach or increase their offerings to hold onto consumers.</p>\n<h2>3. Zillow adds mortgage lending services.</h2>\n<p>The most painstaking part of buying a new home can be getting a mortgage. Zillow, however, aims to streamline the process for consumers by providing its own mortgage origination service.</p>\n<p>Last year, the property portal giant announced the launch of its mortgage lending operation, Zillow Home Loans. Zillow will now compete with the third-party lenders listed on its mortgage marketplace, where homebuyers search for a mortgage through Zillow&#8217;s website. The shift towards buying and selling homes places the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/14/6-tech-trends-that-will-dominate-the-new-decade/\">portal among the competitive ranks</a> of companies like Redfin, Offerpad, and Opendoor.</p>\n<p>Zillow&#8217;s move into mortgages signals the trend of property marketplaces getting closer to the real estate transaction to create better customer experiences. While portals initially focused on property advertising, there&#8217;s a growing likelihood that they will expand across the entire real estate transaction to offer services related to mortgages, insurance, moving, and more.</p>\n<h2>4. Demand for mobile access continues to grow</h2>\n<p>Property managers have the opportunity to extend beyond property and transform into online marketplaces, which are valuable to today&#8217;s renters.</p>\n<p>According to a daVinci Payments survey, renters ages between the ages of 18 and 29 outnumber every other rental group combined, and those renters are looking at the quality of their experience. Furthermore, 71% of renters make purchases on their phones, meaning rental properties need targeted incentives designed for mobile use.</p>\n<p>Property managers that become an online marketplace can meet consumer expectations for on-demand services.</p>\n<p>According to the 2020 NMHC/Kingsley Apartment Resident Preferences Report, 81% of renters value having mobile access to their resident portal, which is an increase from 2017 when it was 77%. Additionally, renters would rather perform tasks, such as submitting maintenance requests (64%) and paying rent (58%) on a mobile device versus a desktop computer.</p>\n<p>Offering an enhanced <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/04/why-you-need-to-consider-iot-in-improving-customer-experience/\">customer experience over a mobile device</a> will make it more likely for property managers to hold onto renters. By <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/real-estate-vs-stocks-which-has-a-better-return/\">cutting costs from reduced turnover</a> and increasing their efficiency, property managers can buy back equity from the banks, enabling them to increase the number of properties they hold. With less money owed to banks, they can take out loans at excellent rates and grow their portfolios faster.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine buying a home before real estate portals. However, more buyers and renters are turning to the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/04/4-key-components-for-building-a-startup-website-that-converts/\">Internet to start their search for properties</a>, fueling the rise of property marketplaces.</p>\n<p>As new <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/19/9-web-development-trends-to-skip-in-2019/\">trends in the industry appear</a>, there’s no doubt that they will play a crucial role in shaping property portals – now and into the future.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pixabay<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/4-technology-trends-shaping-property-portals/\">4 Technology Trends Shaping Property Portals</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 20:00:46 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4-Technology-Trends-Shaping-Property-Portals.jpg","linkMd5":"31493234db1a10ad32f786fdaa78bc57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-19-832_587e03fed022086f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4-Technology-Trends-Shaping-Property-Portals.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":40144,"destBytes":34434,"author":"Adrian Fisher","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4-Technology-Trends-Shaping-Property-Portals-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-22-388_d9470dba2ea9d0fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878280},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","title":"Why HealthTech Companies Must Become More User-Centric or Risk Failing","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173600","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/16/why-healthtech-companies-must-become-more-user-centric-or-risk-failing/\" title=\"Why HealthTech Companies Must Become More User-Centric or Risk Failing\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric-300x217.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"healthtech companies\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric-300x217.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric-221x160.jpg 221w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric.jpg 584w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>HealthTech companies have been instrumental during the COVID-19 pandemic. These companies have made medical help outside of traditional facilities more accessible, kept communities informed, <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2020/05/how-data-analytics-and-technology-are-helping-us-fight-covid-19/\">collected contact-tracing data</a>, and facilitated the recent reopening of society. Here is how healthtech companies must become more use-centric or risk failing.</p>\n<h3>No doubt, HealthTech has cemented its role as a necessity in the digital age.</h3>\n<p>In May, the UN <a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2371\">pledged</a> to boost HealthTech production for COVID-19. Meanwhile, the UK has announced a <a href=\"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/europe/uk-health-tech-companies-take-centre-stage-covid-19-crisis-response\">£1.25 billion</a> government package for young HealthTech companies. The wave of support for the industry has spurred rapid growth and has poised HealthTech to be part of everyday life on a long-term basis.</p>\n<h4>As HealthTech platforms become more popular, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/12/how-to-create-a-better-user-experience-in-med-tech/\">user experience</a> (UX) is set to become a bigger priority.</h4>\n<p>Currently, HealthTech solutions are focusing on practicality over usability because he need to reach markets is more pressing than tailoring features and processes.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, to be successful, HealthTech companies have to put UX front and center. Research shows that 70 percent of customers will abandon a service that has <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/17/5-whatsapp-business-features-to-elevate-customer-experience/\">a bad user experience.</a></p>\n<p>Among a new landscape, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/29/crisis-versus-opportunity-6-ways-to-bootstrap-a-startup-in-a-post-covid-19-world-while-navigating-the-new-normal/\">new user behaviors</a>, and new UX expectations, HealthTech companies that do not put users first, risk losing consumers and even failing. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<h3><b>HealthTech companies in a new landscape.</b></h3>\n<p>COVID-19 has completely changed how people interact and the tools they use to maintain a sense of normality. Government-enforced quarantines have meant people are at home more, while social distancing rules limit outside physical contact.</p>\n<p>These environmental changes are leading evolutionary changes, especially in the relationship between humans and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/06/the-impacts-of-covid-19-on-sustainability-and-technology/\">technology</a>.</p>\n<h4>Drones</h4>\n<p>Already, drones have been used to <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/05/syracuse-company-develops-coronavirus-killing-drone-for-arenas-and-stadiums.html\">spray disinfectant</a> over large urban areas, robots are delivering medical supplies, and telemedicine companies are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/telemedicine-keeps-doctors-and-patients-connected-at-a-safe-remove/2020/05/14/5f1fa262-742b-11ea-ae50-7148009252e3_story.html\">catering</a> to people with no insurance or high deductibles.</p>\n<p>These new adoptions co-align with how people are turning to online services to continue their daily lives. Traditionally-offline services are now available via the internet, and so, people&#8217;s digital literacy is improving.</p>\n<p>However, there is still a sharp gap between the tech-savvy and tech beginners.</p>\n<p>The disparity presents a challenge for HealthTech companies that now have to provide solutions for the different user segments. They have to consider both avid users and those who are less-practiced with technology.</p>\n<h3><b>HealthTech companies and new user behaviors.</b></h3>\n<p>During the lockdown, people are online more often and for longer periods. In some parts of the world, internet usage has even gone up by <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/will-coronavirus-break-the-internet/\">50 percent</a>. The internet surge could mean that people are no longer browsing from their mobile phones but instead using their desktops.</p>\n<p>The change in hardware is key to HealthTech UX, which has to be optimized for larger screens.</p>\n<h3>The lockdown has led to an <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8/fulltext\">incline</a> in cases of poor mental health, anxiety, and stress.</h3>\n<p>In the midst of such uncertainty, people want solutions that relieve, not antagonize, their fears. As a result, people are looking for ways to preserve their health via quick, accurate medical advice with limited physical contact.</p>\n<p>For HealthTech then, UX needs to answer these new demands and develop systems that are instant, reliable, and remote.</p>\n<p>To be a wholly trusted mode of support, HealthTech also requires empathetic, &#8216;human&#8217; language, alongside engaging characteristics like animations, interactive graphs, and downloadable information.</p>\n<h3>HealthTech can equally look to other spheres for inspiration around UX.</h3>\n<p>Streaming sites are currently offering measures like <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">collaborative watching</a>, where people in different locations can view the same film or show at the same time.</p>\n<p>HealthTech companies have to consider if they can harness such features and apply them to their customer journeys. For instance, people may want to join consultations together or read progress reports simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the pandemic, people still have a desire to connect &#8212; HealthTech has to identify if this is a core new user behavior for the future or a short-term reaction in the existing climate.</p>\n<h3><b>HealthTech companies and new UX expectations.</b></h3>\n<p>On average, a person owns <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/air-highlights.html\">eight networked devices</a> &#8211; and that figure is expected to rise substantially within the next decade.</p>\n<p>Wearable devices like blood pressure, sleep, and step monitors generate huge amounts of data that users want to access in a clear and digestible format.</p>\n<p>Particularly amid and following COVID-19, people are more alert and want instant answers. HealthTech UX therefore needs to be minimalistic to effectively process numbers and calculations.</p>\n<h4>For less tech-ready user groups, guided, and easy-to-understand UX is a must.</h4>\n<p>Tech-ready groups are likely to look for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/09/if-conversational-chatbots-want-to-take-off-they-need-to-act-like-robots/\">chatbots</a> to get fast information, book appointments, and reduce their overall waiting time.</p>\n<p>In telemedicine specifically, chatbots are a smart tool to keep medical professionals and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/iot-and-healthcare-technologies-converge-for-better-patient-care/\">patients connected</a>, without being a huge drain on resources.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/top-10-greatest-ai-trends-in-business-2020/\">chatbots to be most efficient</a>, complex algorithms are needed to make conversations in-depth and natural. This is something HealthTech developers will need to prioritize when <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/23/optimize-micro-interactions-to-enhance-your-ux-design/\">making UX changes</a>.</p>\n<h4>Messaging Apps</h4>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that many users anticipate that chatbots mirror the layout of bots they are already familiar with. Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp are the messaging apps with the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/\">most active users</a> in the world, so mimicking their formats would be wise.</p>\n<p>Likewise, as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/07/06/infographic-the-1-000-year-evolution-of-speech-and-voice-recognition/\">voice recognition</a> devices become more commonplace in people&#8217;s homes, HealthTech will have to adapt and establish a user flow based solely on sound. This optimization would be beneficial for multiple user segments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/paving-the-way-3-industries-ripe-for-post-pandemic-change/\">Younger generations</a> are already accustomed to voice recognition, and older generations with limited mobility would welcome movement-free instructions. Alternatively, voice recognition can aid physicians in documenting patient information.</p>\n<p>For example, Suki is a startup that uses voice commands to help physicians create clinical notes or orders for tests and prescriptions.</p>\n<h3><b>HealthTech companies offering greater value</b></h3>\n<p>As new user needs are still surfacing throughout COVID-19, HealthTech companies have to be flexible and pivot to best meet emerging UX expectations. User testing and research should be a continuous, iterative process, that balances unprecedented circumstances with heightened sensitivity toward health.</p>\n<p>Still, in COVID-19 and the era that follows, patients are also consumers. As HealthTech accelerates, the industry will become more competitive. Companies built around customer preferences will have the most significant advantage.</p>\n<p>By having a more user-centric approach, HealthTech will not only scale faster in the new normal and garner loyal followings but also offer greater value to people when they need it most.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: cottonbro; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/16/why-healthtech-companies-must-become-more-user-centric-or-risk-failing/\">Why HealthTech Companies Must Become More User-Centric or Risk Failing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 15:00:26 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric.jpg","linkMd5":"570d5eabd05a1af46f365d09561d70b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-846_4f0163f0dbd1aa0e.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric.jpg","destWidth":584,"destHeight":422,"sourceBytes":25396,"destBytes":20806,"author":"Balint Bene","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Why-HealthTech-Companies-Must-Become-More-User-Centric-300x217.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-16-998_acf3561763c3ee1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195870491},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Impact of COVID-19 in the Crypto Market","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169699","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/impact-of-covid-19-in-the-crypto-market/\" title=\"Impact of COVID-19 in the Crypto Market\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"crypto on covid\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market-240x160.jpeg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In less than three months, the novel coronavirus (nCOVID -19) transformed from just one of the regular virus outbreaks in recent memories into a global pandemic, threatening to cause severe and drastic changes in the world&#8217;s most significant issues as we know it.</p>\n<p>Many have already termed the latest pandemic as the not so anticipated &#8220;<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/02/05/world-war-iii-is-already-here-and-were-losing/\">World War III</a>,&#8221; as it continues to spread across countries and continents. However, there have been specific actions taken. These actions were to curb the aggravating situation and ensuring the globe doesn&#8217;t come to an impending halt in virtually every sector.</p>\n<h2><strong>Impact of Covid-19 on World Economies.</strong></h2>\n<p>Educational institutions, travel industry to public events, almost everything is either postponed or in limbo, which is inevitably going to affect businesses at every turn. Thousands of cases and deaths have already been recorded globally, and with the mere thought of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2005/10/18/web_20_worm_pan/\">this pandemic not going</a> away anytime soon, stock markets began to take many hits in terms of new lows.</p>\n<p>The S&#38;P 500 index hit a new low since 2008 when the world plunged into a financial crisis. The crypto market has even become more volatile and has also experienced one of the worst sudden declines in its history. By the end of March 2020, there was a 6% loss in price, which occurred in the space of 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Being one of the most affected nations by the coronavirus, and also one of the largest crypto markets in the world, the United States had its treasury experience a new low. Investors drastically moved from &#8220;risky&#8221; assets to much &#8220;safer&#8221; assets like gold and oil, which have experienced a spike since the pandemic outbreak.</p>\n<h2><strong>Impact of Covid-19 on Crypto-mining. </strong></h2>\n<p>With China and South Korea owning more than 70% of the mining power of bitcoins (the most <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/13/crypto-feels-like-the-wild-west-but-really-big-tech-holds-the-puppet-strings/\">substantial cryptocurrency</a>), it is easy to say that the massive effect was expected as soon as the virus began to take its toll on the Asian continent, much less the world.</p>\n<p>Over the past years, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/15/cryptocurrency-fraud-is-the-exception-not-the-rule/\">numerous cryptocurrency mining</a> equipment has been devised, and with prices currently suffering, these pieces of equipment are exposed to certain inefficiencies. For balancing the new algorithms, mining farms became more and more critical than these pieces of equipment, which have been rendered ineffective.</p>\n<p>Isolation and quarantine became the major causes of this because there is lesser movement into mining farms, despite the notion that investors term cryptocurrencies as &#8220;safe assets,&#8221; especially in times like this. The prices continue to suffer at the expense of the initial expectations. With an overall 15% drop at the end of March, it is expected that the number will increase even further when Q1 of 2020 is complete.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Positives</strong></h4>\n<p>Despite all the negatives emerging from all business sectors of the world due to the coronavirus outbreak, it is still safe to say that many markets <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/coronavirus-bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-market-currency-usd-latest-a9411806.html\">are able to survive</a> these <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/03/what-it-really-means-to-be-forward-thinking/\">trying times and even benefit</a> from it.</p>\n<p>There are no doubts that the possibility of a global recession and capital authoritarianism lurks in the shadows of these dark times as governments of the world are prepared to induce capitalism as a way of solving these problems.</p>\n<p>Initially, the crypto-currency market might not be affected by these impending changes, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t safe from it, especially in the foreseeable future. This is because the world is very much prepared to use all available measures to fight back the pandemic using communication and medical technology to suppress the speed at which it spreads.</p>\n<p>Return of investment is one of the significant keys of business, and the imposed lockdown in many countries of the world is an opportunity to utilize prices in trading according to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/16/10-crypto-gurus-you-have-to-follow/\">financial experts</a>. There have also been updated features of auto-software in tracking useful information for crypto trading such as charts, prices, and analysis.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>The fear of bitcoin halving continues to linger in the minds of investors where prices will have to be cut in half to reduce its supply in the crypto market. Investors and experts have found this halving policy to be an interesting analysis in terms of balancing the books.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/15/top-25-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-speakers/\">While many futurists</a> have described the crypto-currency market as &#8220;beyond safe,&#8221; they have also stressed that it can also be identified as a good option in long term investments as the value continues to grow.</p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/19/when-will-you-be-able-to-use-cryptocurrency-to-buy-a-pack-of-gum/\">analyses are also predicted</a> to materialize in the coming months and will no doubt affect future prices in the future. The future remains the only place where we can be able to find the right answers. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to record more cases &#8212; arriving in the future will be the only way to tell us how all things will eventually turn out.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/impact-of-covid-19-in-the-crypto-market/\">Impact of COVID-19 in the Crypto Market</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:00:07 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market.jpeg","linkMd5":"080786efe0ebe70a4f0037787033b45b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-828_5c6f3871ce7f6770.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market.jpeg","destWidth":300,"destHeight":200,"sourceBytes":9599,"destBytes":9648,"author":"Adedeji Adewale","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impact-of-COVID-19-in-the-Crypto-Market.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-828_5c6f3871ce7f6770.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877927},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"Legacies Evolve; Promises Don’t: Pathstone’s Approach to Multigenerational Financial Stewardship","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172994","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/legacies-evolve-promises-dont-pathstones-approach-to-multigenerational-financial-stewardship/\" title=\"Legacies Evolve; Promises Don’t: Pathstone’s Approach to Multigenerational Financial Stewardship\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM-300x200.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM-240x160.png 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM.png 882w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In life, we all run our own race. But where we start, as well as where we wind up, depends in part on the generations that came before us. </p>\n<p>Coaching families through those choices are family offices like <a href=\"http://pathstone.com\">Pathstone</a>. To the families and foundations it serves, Pathstone makes a promise: to uphold the family’s legacy across generations.</p>\n<p>Pathstone thinks about each family’s legacy like a relay race: The first runner runs a portion of the race in a way that satisfies her. That first generation then passes the baton, while in the lead, to the second runner. The second runner runs the race he wants — while still respecting where he began — before passing the baton again. Each generation extends the lead while choosing its own path.</p>\n<p>Pathstone’s role in the race? Marking the course, training the team, and providing support from start to finish. </p>\n<h2><strong>Many Races, One Constant</strong></h2>\n<p>Just as there are different kinds of races, there are many types of legacies. No one is more meaningful or valuable than the others, per se, but Pathstone knows they need different kinds of support. </p>\n<p>Some family leaders turn to entrepreneurship. When it’s time to exit the company, Pathstone ensures a smooth handoff. In addition to rewarding entrepreneurs financially, Pathstone’s Steve Braverman, co-CEO, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2020/06/02/what-to-do-after-your-last-entrepreneurial-exit/#1ba19f553804\">explains in Forbes</a> that exits must be done in a way that ensures the remaining team can build on their vision and legacy. </p>\n<p>For others, <a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/service/philantropy/\">philanthropy</a> is the finish line. Pathstone helps families not just choose charities to support, but also maximize their tax deductions, structure their contributions, and manage associated funds. Its emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments distinguishes Pathstone among family offices.</p>\n<p>Multigenerational financial stewardship is, to still others, what matters most. Pathstone takes an “all of the above” approach. Financial planning, estate planning, and tax planning make sure the next generation is set up to succeed, while insurance and risk management guard against downside risks to the family’s future.</p>\n<p>Many, of course, want a blend. That’s where Pathstone’s customizable, unbundled financial support comes in. Someone who wants to live well while giving back, for instance, may be interested in advisory services, ESG investments, and financial reporting. An aging entrepreneur focused on wealth preservation might need help with property management and estate planning.</p>\n<p>Those priorities may change across generations. What’s constant is Pathstone’s promise: to ensure the legacy lives on, in whatever form its families choose. </p>\n<h2><strong>Ready, Set, Run</strong></h2>\n<p>To light the way on each family’s legacy, Pathstone has developed a series of initiatives, or paths. Like legacies themselves, they can be mixed and matched according to the family’s needs.</p>\n<p>A favorite among Pathstone clients is <a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/future-path/\">FuturePath</a>, which works to empower the next generation to be active, responsible stewards of the family’s legacy. FuturePath uses interactive events, peer engagement, and educational resources to ensure the younger generation understands its role in preserving and building the family’s wealth.</p>\n<p>For female family leaders, Pathstone has developed <a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/her-path/\">HerPath</a>. To help women take control of their financial situation, HerPath creates a space where they can connect over shared challenges and opportunities. HerPath’s nonjudgmental environment is key: Women can freely ask questions about wealth management, forge mentor-mentee relationships, and talk about their plans.</p>\n<p>Supporting philanthropic legacies is <a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/service/esg-and-impact/\">Pathstone Impact</a>, which helps families align their investments with their mission and values. Using ESG criteria, Pathstone Impact aims to deliver the best of both worlds: strong returns that make a difference.</p>\n<p>To fulfill its promise, however, Pathstone knows its clients can’t be the only ones on the path. For the firm and its employees, it has laid out two additional paths.</p>\n<h2><strong>Every Step of the Way</strong></h2>\n<p>Pathstone’s own legacy mirrors that of its clients: As the generations turn, Pathstone knows its services may need to change, but its core promise must be kept. Its final two paths reflect that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/careers/\">CareerPath</a> cultivates Pathstone leaders with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. With the company’s core values — caring, openness, passion, excellence, humility, teamwork, proactivity, innovation, and experience — in mind, CareerPath helps Pathstone stay true to its mission. </p>\n<p>CareerPath’s robust benefits program promotes commitment to the team, which is critical for fulfilling its multigenerational promise. By encouraging employees to make Pathstone their lifelong career, it builds trust and familiarity with the families it serves. </p>\n<p>Because its team members, like its clients, are looking for more than financial support, Pathstone launched Path4Impact in 2019. This initiative falls under the Impact Committee, which produces the <a href=\"https://www.pathstone.com/app/uploads/2020/05/2019-Annual-Impact-Report-Executive-Summary.pdf\">Annual Impact Report</a>. Through this initiative, firm actions, and events, Pathstone works to build a community of which its team can be proud. FitPath, part of the Path4Impact initiative, encourages employees to lead fit, healthy lives with interoffice challenges. </p>\n<p>For itself and its clients, Pathstone recognizes building a legacy takes a lifetime. Upholding it across generations, however, takes even more: a promise, a committed team, and a family that appreciates the gift it&#8217;s been given. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/legacies-evolve-promises-dont-pathstones-approach-to-multigenerational-financial-stewardship/\">Legacies Evolve; Promises Don’t: Pathstone’s Approach to Multigenerational Financial Stewardship</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 14:01:04 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM.png","linkMd5":"3d6e3a10707fdccc8a3961ecc0a33541","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-26-356_f7c0d932507a6062.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM.png","destWidth":882,"destHeight":588,"sourceBytes":799977,"destBytes":41054,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-16-at-11.14.22-AM-300x200.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-17-973_86737c4123fa5a62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875287},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"Why PewDiePie Sees New Opportunities in Live Video’s New Features","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171301","description":"<div>\n <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/10/why-pewdiepie-sees-new-opportunities-in-live-videos-new-features/\" title=\"Why PewDiePie Sees New Opportunities in Live Video’s New Features\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"PewDiePie live video\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>PewDiePie is coming back to YouTube. The Swedish video star, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, was once the platform’s biggest creator. He left in 2019, taking his live videos to rival upstart <a href=\"https://dlive.tv/m/home/\">DLive</a>. Here is why PewDiePie sees new opportunities in live video’s new features.</p> \n<h3>PewDiePie has had a volatile relationship with Google’s video property.</h3> \n<p>Accusations of anti-Semitism and racism in his video content led to an advertiser backlash, prompting YouTube to temporarily remove ads from his channel. Dlive, a blockchain-powered video site, had promised him a fairer payment system and higher rewards.</p> \n<p>So what brought him back? Why would one of the world’s biggest influencers leave a platform that now gives him complete freedom and a full 75 percent revenue-share? Why would he go back exclusively to a site that’s shown a willingness to exert control and even cut off ad revenues if it doesn’t like his jokes?</p> \n<h3>The simple answer is likely to be that YouTube will give him more money.</h3> \n<p>On Dlive, PewDiePie had attracted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52540437\">822,000 followers</a>. On YouTube, his account had more than 102 million subscribers. Even with a higher revenue share, PewDiePie would have been earning much less on the blockchain site than he could make on YouTube.</p> \n<p>But money wasn’t the reason that PewDiePie cited. Instead, he argued that both he and YouTube were putting more investments in live streaming. “Live-streaming is something I’m focusing a lot on in 2020 and beyond,” he said, “so to be able to partner with YouTube and be at the forefront of new product features is special and exciting for the future.”</p> \n<h3>Live streaming offers a number of benefits that aren’t available to recorded video.</h3> \n<p>Live streaming has an urgency — a live video is only live once. It’s interactive: viewers can ask questions and make comments that the broadcaster can answer during the stream. And it’s a format that platforms like Netflix and Hulu just can’t offer. Brands, even personal brands like PewDiePie, can use live streaming to attract an engaged audience and interact with it in real-time.</p> \n<p><strong>YouTube is now in the process of rolling out new features that will help live video streamers.</strong></p> \n<p>Content creators can separate audience figures, allowing them to see how many people watched a video live and how many saw it after the recording was uploaded. Smart replies, like suggested responses in Gmail, let broadcasters shoot back thanks to compliments in the comment stream while they broadcast.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok3qM3ecWJU\">Live Control Room</a>, which launched officially late last year, makes it easy for streamers to create highlight reels and track viewer activity.</p> \n<p>All of those features are useful but when it comes to live video, YouTube isn’t the only game in town, and even those new features won’t give it an edge.</p> \n<h4>Viewers are more accustomed to interacting with others on social media platforms than they are on a video platform like YouTube.</h4> \n<p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Facebook has seen a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/?p=171301/searchenginejournal\">50 percent increase</a> in live video audiences as people stuck at home look for real-time interaction. The company will soon let people watch live videos without a Facebook account. The options will include automatic closed captioning and digital tipping, and provide toll-free phone numbers for charity streams.</p> \n<h3>There’s more in Live Video!</h3> \n<p>Other companies have gone even further — to everyone’s delight. <a href=\"https://be.live/\">Be.Live</a>, a third-party provider, lets streamers on both Facebook and YouTube brand their broadcasts. You can highlight comments and questions on the screen, and even promote specific products. Think: complete with pictures, description, and price — and you have a general idea.</p> \n<h3>Live streaming has always had a value that recorded video just can’t match.</h3> \n<p>No other format lets audiences interact with broadcasters in real-time, ask questions, influence content, and engage with creators. At a time when live concerts are out of bounds, live videos are the closest audiences can currently get to a real-time event.</p> \n<p>It’s no wonder that both YouTube and Facebook are investing in this format — and it’s no wonder that PewDiePie is looking for the platform that will give him the biggest live audience.</p> \n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/10/why-pewdiepie-sees-new-opportunities-in-live-videos-new-features/\">Why PewDiePie Sees New Opportunities in Live Video’s New Features</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 21:00:50 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities.png","linkMd5":"afb5330617a9d809c4044646a239faa6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-25-837_3b56da1fca014d11.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":417388,"destBytes":20568,"author":"Joel Comm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Why-PewDiePie-Sees-New-Opportunities-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-28-157_f824b8eaaa3031a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876031},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"How to Invest in Yourself During Lockdown","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172502","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/17/how-to-invest-in-yourself-during-lockdown/\" title=\"How to Invest in Yourself During Lockdown\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Invest-in-Yourself-During-Lockdown-300x289.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"invest in yourself\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Invest-in-Yourself-During-Lockdown-300x289.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Invest-in-Yourself-During-Lockdown-166x160.png 166w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Invest-in-Yourself-During-Lockdown.png 607w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Investing in yourself may be the most profitable investment you ever make.

As talks of new stimulus packages come and go, the reality that businesses and people may have to face this crisis mostly on their own is beginning to set in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest challenges facing companies is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/06/how-technology-can-replace-the-watercooler-and-connect-employees/\">knowing which platforms and services to invest in</a>. While something may be effective now, there’s a chance it will lose value once the crisis is over. Businesses need to make investments that have value, both today and in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, more businesses are offering products that can help, regardless of the timeline. Take a look at these tech companies making waves:</span></p>\n<h2><b>1. <a href=\"https://www.easyredir.com/\">EasyRedir</a></b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As things grow more uncertain, businesses need to be assured that their customers can get to the pages they need without confusion. Companies are updating their onsite content and design at unprecedented rates to respond to the crisis; more than a few pages can get lost in the shuffle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EasyRedir makes URL and redirection management simple. With a platform that non-tech workers can use, EasyRedir allows any member of your organization to take over URL management. This lets you maximize SEO, engage in heavy-duty redesign, and move around content on your site without worrying about security warnings or SSL certificates. If you want users to always be able to find the pages they need, EasyRedir is the platform you need to weather this storm. Beyond, it will help you continue communicating at your best with customers. </span></p>\n<h2><b>2. </b><a href=\"https://zoom.us/\"><b>Zoom</b></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom has already made a major impact on businesses that have sent workers home, but its value will extend far beyond the COVID-19 crisis. The platform enables simple, effective video chats across any distance. Its audio features allow for streamlined communication, even when internet connections are poor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses can benefit from adopting more liberal work-from-home policies after their offices reopen. By allowing more workers to operate from their homes, companies can reduce their overhead on office supplies, travel, and rent. Zoom’s efficacy and reliability make it a serious option for businesses looking to cut expenses without cutting staff. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3. </b><a href=\"https://www.defendify.io/\"><b>Defendify</b></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shelter-in-place orders may have moved your business online, but that’s where it was headed, anyway. The digital revolution had already forced nearly every company to take some aspects of its business to the internet. This crisis is simply speeding up the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As your company becomes more digital, the risks it faces become greater as well. Most small businesses don&#8217;t have a fully equipped cybersecurity team ready to combat the threats they may face. That makes platforms like Defendify increasingly necessary options. Defendify offers an all-in-one service that makes it easy to protect your business from digital attacks. Its pricing is tailored to small businesses, making it an affordable way to keep your company safe, both today and tomorrow.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>4.</strong> <a href=\"https://asana.com/\"><b></b><b>Asana</b></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business doesn’t have functional project management software, it needs some — now. Spread-out teams and digital communication are particularly nasty beasts for managers, but the right platform can alleviate some of the issues that come with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each business will need different things from its project management platform, Asana is one of the best. By striking the perfect balance between depth and functionality, Asana works for projects both big and small. Of particular note is its recent incorporation of automation into its platform. This can streamline workflows and correct for errors automatically, saving you time and money in the process. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/\"><b></b><b>QuickBooks</b></a></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never has it been more important to account for every last dollar. Businesses need financial software that works, but they&#8217;re hesitant to make the investment — many of the best platforms are major expenses in their own right. However, even in uncertain times, it’s important to invest in software that can last in the long run and not just be a temporary fix. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QuickBooks offers an entire suite of accounting, invoicing, payment, project tracking, and payroll tools. By incorporating deep functionality within simple design, the platform makes it easy for anyone to get a handle on company finances. That prevents you from wasting time crunching numbers when you should be focusing on your business’s essential operations. There are different plans to choose from, so making the initial step during uncertain times can lead to a great long-term investment as your company grows. You can upgrade your plan without losing your financial history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business needs platforms it can rely on, ones that aren’t simply short-term investments. By checking out the options on this list, you can protect yourself against the current economic fallout while promoting your company’s success well into the future. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/14/5-tech-companies-to-turn-to-during-uncertain-times/\">5 Tech Companies to Turn to During Uncertain Times</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:11 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-08-at-9.12.39-AM.png","linkMd5":"b03d05d815779509a6e7596ea12e10d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-24-475_9072c05a152c9dc8.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-08-at-9.12.39-AM.png","destWidth":790,"destHeight":591,"sourceBytes":760686,"destBytes":72294,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-08-at-9.12.39-AM-300x224.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-17-055_09c0ba057f373ca8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878762},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"12 Lesser-Known IoT Protocols You Wished You Knew About Earlier","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168375","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/29/12-lesser-known-iot-protocols-you-wished-you-knew-about-earlier/\" title=\"12 Lesser-Known IoT Protocols You Wished You Knew About Earlier\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Lesser-Known-IoT-Protocols-You-Wished-You-Knew-About-Earlier-1-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"iot protocol\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Lesser-Known-IoT-Protocols-You-Wished-You-Knew-About-Earlier-1-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Lesser-Known-IoT-Protocols-You-Wished-You-Knew-About-Earlier-1-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Lesser-Known-IoT-Protocols-You-Wished-You-Knew-About-Earlier-1.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>According to a Gartner <u><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-11-07-gartner-identifies-top-10-strategic-iot-technologies-and-trends\">prediction</a></u>, there will be <strong>25 billion</strong> connected devices by 2021, which is significantly higher than their previous estimate of <strong>20.4 billion</strong> devices in 2020. IDC <u><a href=\"https://idc-cema.com/dwn/SF_177701/driving_the_digital_agenda_requires_strategic_architecture_rosen_idc.pdf\">data</a></u> shows that <strong>152,000</strong> IoT devices will connect to the internet every minute by 2025. Yes, you read that right, 152,000 devices per minute. These statistics clearly show exponential growth in the number of connected devices.</p>\n<p>Just like any other technology, IoT also has its fair share of challenges, which could hamper its wider adoption. The good news is that <u><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/19/what-to-expect-from-a-modern-iot-platform-in-2019/\">modern IoT platforms</a></u> are evolving to deal with future challenges. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">Security and privacy</a> have always been the Achilles heels of IoT devices. The lack of standards and protocols complicates matters even more. Thankfully, this issue has been resolved after the introduction of many new IoT protocols.  Unfortunately, a small <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/04/why-you-need-to-consider-iot-in-improving-customer-experience/\">percentage of enterprises</a> know about these IoT protocols, let alone implement them.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn about <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/iot-can-put-your-data-at-risk-heres-how/\">IoT communication protocols</a> and standards that no one told you before.</p>\n<h2>1.      ZigBee</h2>\n<p>Initially designed to fulfill industrial needs instead of consumer needs, ZigBee is an ideal choice for industrial sites where data needs to transfer in small quantities between different buildings or homes. It operates at a frequency of <strong>2.4 GHz</strong>. Famous for supporting low powered, scalable, and secure solutions, ZigBee 3.0 has converted the protocol into a single standard while making it easy to implement at the same time.</p>\n<h2>2.      MQTT IoT</h2>\n<p>MQTT stands for <strong>Message Queue Telemetry Transport</strong>. Developed way back in 1999 by Arlen Nipper from Arcom and Andy Stanford Clark of IBM, it is basically a messaging protocol that enables device communication and helps users monitor their IoT devices from a remote location. MQTT has long been used for collecting data from electrical devices.</p>\n<p>MQTT protocol has three key components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subscriber</li>\n<li>Publisher</li>\n<li>Broker</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publisher generates data and sends that data to the subscriber with the help of a broker. Brokers serve as a middleman whose responsibility is to ensure security and privacy of data being transmitted between publishers and subscribers. To make this possible, it authorizes and authenticates both subscribers and publishers.</p>\n<h2>3.      CoAP</h2>\n<p>CoAP stands for <strong>Constrained Application Protocols</strong>. Primarily designed for restricted smart devices, CoAP is the best option for devices that has a restricted community. What makes it stand out is its ability to work well even with HTTP protocols. In fact, it shares a lot of similarities and a few differences with HTTP protocols.</p>\n<p>For instance, it is based on the same restful architecture that HTTP uses. Secondly, both HTTP and CoAP take advantage of UDP for smaller data transmission. One of the main differences between HTTP and CoAP is in terms of ambiguity. CoAP eliminates the ambiguity associated with HTTP get, put up, delete commands.</p>\n<h2>4.      DDS</h2>\n<p>DDS stands for <strong>Data Distribution Service</strong>. Facilitating machine to machine communication, this protocol is capable of handling high performance, real-time communication between machines.</p>\n<p>DDS comprises of two main layers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DSPs)</li>\n<li>Data Local Reconstruction Layer (DLRL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The job of Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe is to deliver information to subscribers while the role of the data local reconstruction layer is to facilitate this process by offering an interface to Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe. What makes DDS unique is its ability to transfer data to both low footprint devices and cloud. This protocol was developed by Object Management Group in 2004.</p>\n<h2>5.      AMQP</h2>\n<p>AMQP stands for <strong>Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol</strong>. It is an application layer protocol that is primarily designed for middleware and is message-oriented in nature. What makes AMQP special is the fact that it is considered as a globally standardized IoT messaging protocol.</p>\n<p>AMQP protocol has three key elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exchange</li>\n<li>Message Queue</li>\n<li>Binding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exchange role is to put the message together and arrange it in a queue while the message queue is responsible for storing the message. As the name suggests, the binding element acts as a bridge between the exchange component and message queue components.</p>\n<h2>6.      LoRaWAN</h2>\n<p>LoRaWAN stands for <strong>Long Range Wide Area Network</strong>. Made for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/22/how-companies-can-leverage-data-protection-to-restore-trust-in-iot/\">supporting vast networks with millions</a> of low powered devices, it is one of the best IoT protocols for <u><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/22/how-iot-will-play-an-important-role-in-traffic-management-for-smart-cities/\">smart cities</a></u>. In addition to this, it is also being used to secure two-way communication.</p>\n<p>It’s <strong>15 km</strong> long range in suburban areas distinguishes it from other IoT protocols.  In urban areas, the range stays between <strong>2 to 5 km</strong>. Even though the frequency might vary from network to network, it’s ability to communicate over long distances makes it a great IoT protocol.</p>\n<h2>7.      Z-Wave</h2>\n<p>Z-Wave IoT protocol focuses on low powered radio frequency communication. This protocol can come in handy in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/iot-and-home-automation-is-it-the-future/\">home automation applications</a>. Unlike wireless network technologies such as Wi-Fi, it offers much better protection, low latency and other features. Since it works in <strong>sub-1 GHz band</strong>. The range is anywhere from <strong>30 to 100 meters</strong>. Data transfer rate is from <strong>40 to 100 kilobits per second</strong>. Z-wave can give you cloud access and acts as a bridge that connects different components from one another.</p>\n<h2>8.      SigFox</h2>\n<p>Operating in the middle of Wi-Fi and cellular, Sigfox takes advantage of ISM bands. Since these bands are free to use that is why you don’t even need to buy licenses to use this IoT protocol. Sigfox offers low data transfer speeds and consumes low power by using a technology called Ultra Narrow Band.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest downsides of using this IoT protocol is that you are only allowed to transmit data on a narrow spectrum but more than makes up for it with its low power consumption. All this makes it <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/its-time-to-truly-consider-the-privacy-implications-of-iot/\">one of the best IoT protocols</a> for machine-to-machine communication.</p>\n<p>We are already seeing its applications in smart meters, streetlights, security devices, patient monitors and environment, and agriculture-based sensors across Europe. In rural environments, this protocol can work in the <strong>30-50 km</strong> range and <strong>3-10 km</strong> in urban environments.</p>\n<h2>9.      Thread</h2>\n<p>Designed by inventor of Nest, famous <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/17/the-diminishing-returns-of-outsourcing-and-the-fallacy-of-automation/\">home automation solution</a> provider, Thread is the new entrant in the IoT protocol game, but it has shown immense promise. It is basically an IPv6 based networking protocol that is based on 6LowPAN. Initially developed to complement Wi-Fi networks in a home environment, it has expanded its applications substantially since then.  Capable of handling <strong>250 nodes</strong> with authentication and encryption, the thread works at a frequency of <strong>2.4 GHz </strong>and has a range of <strong>10 to 30 meters</strong>. Moreover, it can also support mesh networking within radio transceivers.</p>\n<h2>10. EnOcean</h2>\n<p>By far, the most innovative IoT protocol, EnOcean takes a completely different approach to IoT connectivity. Instead of following the traditional pattern, it leverages energy harvesting and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/iot-and-home-automation-is-it-the-future/\">wireless sensing capabilities</a>. This makes it a perfect choice for devices that have to alert users based on changing situations. For instance, notify device owners about changes in temperature and ligating conditions.</p>\n<p>Even though its applications are fairly limited to home automation, logistics, transportation and industrial automation but we might see its applications grow in different industries in the future. Covering a range of <strong>300 meters</strong> in outdoor environment and <strong>30 meters</strong> in indoor setup, this IoT protocol works on the frequency of <strong>315 MHz, 868 MHz and 902 MHz.</strong></p>\n<h2>11. 6LowPAN</h2>\n<p>LowPAN stands for <strong>Low Power Personal Area Network</strong>. 6LowPAN is basically a network protocol that uses its own header compression and encapsulation mechanism. The physical layer this protocol works on and the frequency band it uses makes it compatible with multiple communication platforms such as Wi-Fi, sub-1 GHz ISM, and Ethernet.</p>\n<p>Since this protocol is based on IPv6, it can easily handle millions of IoT devices. That is not all, each IoT device can have their unique IP address, which makes it easy for device owners to track devices and <u><a href=\"https://hostnoc.com/how-businesses-beef-up-cybersecurity/\">improve their security</a></u>. With IPv6 offering transportation systems for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/is-the-iot-nothing-more-than-a-sophisticated-spy-network/\">sophisticated control systems</a> and allowing businesses to communicate with devices too by consuming less power and costing your less money, we might see its popularity grow in future.</p>\n<h2>12. Neul</h2>\n<p>Just like Sigfox, Neul also uses a sub-1 GHz band. It uses different frequencies ranging from <strong>470 MHz to 900 MHz</strong> to create low power, high coverage, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/07/why-small-businesses-need-to-be-vigilant-about-iot-security-too/\">low-cost wireless networks</a>.  It uses Weightless communication technology, which is a new wireless wide area network technology designed to replace existing communication technologies such as GPRS, CDMA, 3G, and 4G LTE for IoT devices. IoT devices that use this protocol consume anywhere from <strong>20 to 30</strong> mA of power and can transmit data at a rate anywhere from <strong>100 bits per second to 100 kilobits per second</strong>.</p>\n<p>Which IoT protocols and standards do you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/12/why-iot-apps-are-eating-device-interfaces/\">use for communications</a>?

These two approaches will define our lives behind 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has put everyone into a new reality. The transition from our traditional lifestyle to isolation mode was anything but smooth. The whole world had to learn how to work and learn remotely and organize their leisure without leaving their homes. But the lockdown has also created a few niches for startups that no one could think of before.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, we couldn’t imagine the world without public transport and traffic jams, busy restaurants and shopping malls, crowded parties and concerts. Now it is here. Governments shut down the long-awaited innovation programs to invest in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/19/healthcare-is-booming-hand-in-hand-with-the-technology-industry/\">healthcare technology</a> &#8211; the industry that is getting the most attention nowadays. And for millions of people around the world, real-life has gone online &#8211; with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-online-shopping-is-evolving-with-the-times/\">evolving online shopping</a>, online classes, and even online parties.</p>\n<p>Despite restrictions easing in the vast majority of countries, no one can say when the lockdown will be completely over. Do we return to our normal lives this summer? Or the coming two years will be shaped by social distancing due to possible pandemic comeback?</p>\n<p>One thing is already clear: we are in the <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression/\">worst economic downturn since the Great Depression</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/coronavirus-unemployment-jobs-work-impact-g7-pandemic/\">unemployment rate</a> has increased drastically. Many small businesses shut down; great economies enter the recession. This doesn&#8217;t sound optimistic, right?</p>\n<p>But things are not that bad. The crisis opens many possibilities, as well. Here we discuss four industries that are experiencing a hard upgrade right now. If you want your company to be at the edge of improvements &#8211; hurry up and discover the potential startup niches!</p>\n<h2>Remote interaction &#8211; the new reality for private communication</h2>\n<p>For years, Zoom was a niche solution for online conferences and video calls. Since February 2020, it is the number one platform for all kinds of events: from birthday parties and blind dates to university classes and even city council meetings.</p>\n<p>Currently, this is a forced measure, but experts predict that virtual meetings will become a substantial part of our reality even after the pandemic is over. Generation Z (also called Zoomers &#8211; what a coincidence!) prefer online communication to personal meetings. But the tools currently available still can&#8217;t provide the whole spectrum of features the young users are searching for. And this is one of the niches for a startup founder to investigate.</p>\n<p>What do the myriad of online communication tools miss? User orientation, social features, and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Zoom and the alike were built exclusively for business needs. Companies that couldn’t afford a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/18/why-your-business-needs-custom-internal-communication/\">custom internal communication system</a> opted for a cost-effective SaaS solution. Their functionality fits the conference room, but not a virtual family lunch or a coffee-break. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/zoom-security-issues-zoombombings-continue-include-racist-language-and-child-abuse/\">Zoom security issues</a> are also a reason to look for alternatives.</p>\n<p>Some of the tools start to play with enabling masks or changing backgrounds, but the complex solution for entertaining group calls is about to arrive.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still the gap. And this is one of the potential startup niches to hit with a new app, right?</p>\n<p>First of all, analyze the apps popular among Zoomers right now. What features make them so unique? Filters, instant reactions, microformats, geolocation, augmented reality or interactive 3D models, built-in mini-games, group film streaming, etc. &#8211; any idea could be the game-changer.</p>\n<h2>To the door delivery &#8211; eliminating the need for traditional shopping</h2>\n<p>E-commerce was developing gradually, but it seemed like the full transition to online shopping was still a few decades away. Some buyers were not ready to decide on the product without having seen it with their own eyes; some others didn&#8217;t trust the seller they can&#8217;t personally talk to.</p>\n<p>And now we are here. The only type of shopping that is available during the lockdown is online shopping. And it turns out that basically everything can be delivered to the door: food, cosmetics, consumer electronics, furniture, gardening tools, and pet care products. Now that everyone was forced to try e-commerce, they could evaluate the convenience of the process and a chance to save much time. And after taking this first step, many won&#8217;t even return to classical shopping.</p>\n<p>We already watch <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/11/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-spending.html\">online commerce making a great leap ahead</a>. And when speaking of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\">global e-commerce trends</a>, to-the-door delivery is definitely one of the strongest ones. So we expect a growing number of P2P logistics services. This seems like one of the solid startup niches, right?</p>\n<p>The international companies of on-demand delivery like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Glovo focused on food delivery from restaurants first. Now they expand their services and are ready to bring anything to the door of their clients. However, high-quality delivery is still not available in the majority of smaller cities all around the globe. This means millions of people are waiting for a local company to satisfy their needs.</p>\n<p>Until such a solution appears, local businesses hire carriers or cooperate with taxi companies to deliver their products while clients choose to stay home.</p>\n<p>For many small businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic was an impulse to go beyond their physical shops and start selling online. E-commerce is booming, so do related services like delivery.</p>\n<h2>Education erasing the borders</h2>\n<p>If this crisis happened twenty or even ten years ago, millions of teachers and tutors, music and art instructors, fitness trainers would become unemployed in the blink of an eye. The lockdown would make their further work impossible as such.</p>\n<p>However, the technologies we have in 2020 make education, art, and sport accessible to everyone at home. And what is even more important &#8211; online classes have no geographical limits. You can have an online session with a trainer from the gym on the opposite side of the street, or join the online training held by the Olympics champion.</p>\n<p>Just as online shopping, e-learning was available for years. However, only a few of us have tried learning remotely. The reasons? Some complain about the lack of personal contact and instant feedback from the instructor; the others question their motivation and the ability to do their best while not being observed by a teacher.</p>\n<p>But the lockdown happened, and thousands of people were at home without the possibility of visiting schools and universities, art classes, language courses, and sports sections. They have a lot of free time, and they are bored with four walls. However, they have the internet. So the time for online classes and training sessions comes. Many users have tried remote learning for the first time, and they are likely to keep the tradition after the quarantine is over.</p>\n<h3>Online education as one of the prospective startup niches.</h3>\n<p>What does this mean for the teachers, artists, fitness instructors, etc.? The geographical limits are down. Even living in a village, you can have hundreds of clients from any part of the country or even abroad.</p>\n<p>Learning centers, language schools, fitness centers, and art clubs have the needed resources for a great leap. Adopt e-learning to expand to new markets.</p>\n<p>There are many platforms for online classes on the market; none of them is perfect, though. Consider it as one of the possible startup niches. You can build a software tool to make remote classes even more effective, or provide a marketplace platform for individual tutors. This type of application will be of great importance in the next few years.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, think of the perspectives of the academic year 2020-2021. The chances are that it may be interrupted by the new wave of coronavirus. And this time, schools and universities want to be ready for this. Now they are working on the programs of remote classes and experimenting with different technical solutions.</p>\n<p>Some renowned universities can afford the development of custom learning platforms. The rest of the educational facilities is looking for a ready solution to fit the needs of both professors and students. If you have deep experience in this domain, developing a Software as a Service platform for universities and colleagues may be a chance you shouldn&#8217;t miss.</p>\n<h2>Entertainment has gone online</h2>\n<p>The COVID-19 lockdown has taken work and education to online. The same happened to the entertainment industry. Now when cinemas are closed, we want to watch movies online. When a so awaited music festival is canceled, we want to listen to our favorite band online.</p>\n<p>Our Italian vacation was postponed, but we still want to enjoy the wine and pizza while watching an online excursion around Venice.</p>\n<p>When we can&#8217;t hang out with friends, we are looking for new fascinating things we can do together online. Something like an online game or a simultaneous cooking session?</p>\n<p>The online entertainment is getting huge benefits from the coronavirus crisis. Basically, the industry got rid of all the competition overnight. No more hard choices like &#8220;Should I go out with friends tonight, or would I better watch another season of that hot show.&#8221; Everyone chooses the show now. And there is no clear evidence that the situation will change soon. Startup niches in the entertainment industry look especially attractive now.</p>\n<p>Streaming services, games, and other types of online entertainment are booming. Will this remain the same after the lockdown when (or if?) the competition with offline events is back? Everything depends. At this time, new habits are born. If the new service manages to become a routine for a particular group of users &#8211; the exam is passed, it will still be popular after we are again allowed to enjoy our lives to the fullest.</p>\n<h3>How to hook your users?</h3>\n<p>Analyze the new gaps that appeared in everyday life.</p>\n<p>One day we used to go to the cinema with friends, eat popcorn, whisper funny comments to your neighbor, and discuss the movie with all the group afterward. This option is definitely missed now. And Netflix has it covered with its new service <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">Netflix Party</a>. It enables you to share the watch the link to a movie or TV show with your friends, watch it simultaneously and exchange reactions, comments, or screenshots in real-time. More than 1,000,000 people already use Netflix Party, and the number will keep increasing during (and most likely after) the lockdown.</p>\n<p>This is an example of how a simple solution has covered the needs of thousands of people.</p>\n<p>It is much easier to enter the online entertainment industry now than it was a few months ago. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so don&#8217;t miss it.</p>\n<h2>What to expect from 2020 and beyond?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, many businesses won&#8217;t survive the coronavirus crisis. But a few of them will adjust to the new reality. Those who are brave and wise will quickly innovate. We watch companies and individuals seeking ideas to make social distancing more comfortable and enjoyable for everyone.</p>\n<p>These innovators will succeed.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Elly Fairytale; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/12/new-niches-for-startups-created-by-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">New Niches for Startups Created by the COVID-19 Pandemic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:00:36 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Niches-for-Startups-Created-by-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-300x234.png","linkMd5":"324f13f597ccd7934b3fd8f051e837e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-07-813_76d9dc87905f78c0.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":234,"sourceBytes":104336,"destBytes":8454,"author":"Sofiya Merenych","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Niches-for-Startups-Created-by-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-300x234.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-07-813_76d9dc87905f78c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874872},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"How to Become an Expert Copywriter 8 Tricks to Learn","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167288","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/how-to-become-an-expert-copywriter-8-tricks-to-learn/\" title=\"How to Become an Expert Copywriter 8 Tricks to Learn\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"copywriter\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Become-an-Expert-Copywriter-8-Tricks-to-Learn.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Content has claimed its place in the most significant approaches.

However, to become the next great writer in this competitive market, there are many more constraints to look for and consider to lead your bright and successful career.</p>\n<h4>#1. Know What You Are Doing.</h4>\n<p>Understand and know your market. Irrespective of the domain you are hired for, it is necessary to keep your senses working all the time to find out the trends of your niche. An expert copywriter is expected to perform thorough research of the market to find out the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/how-to-validate-your-startup-idea/\">best ideas</a> to write for startups and even business giants.</p>\n<p>Relevant content is one of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/19/small-business-marketing-strategies-that-will-work-for-you/\">best marketing strategies</a> which can help the key to rank high in Google, and ultimately it magnifies the efforts of SEO to produce the best results. The characteristics of quality content are: it is relevant and engaging while remaining reader-centric at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you can find your best pace of writing with current events of your niche, this works in your favor to score a good number of reads and keep your content SEO-oriented as well.</p>\n<h4>#2. Find Your Type, Match the Vibe.</h4>\n<p>There is a multitude of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/11/outsource-or-automate-how-to-strategically-take-tasks-off-your-plate/\">copywriter jobs available in the market</a>. You have to decide on a particular field or niche where your interest lies. Whether you prefer writing press releases, creating exciting and creative social media posts, branding and advertising, writing articles for blogs, and more- these all belong to different niches. But the ultimate decision depends upon you.</p>\n<p>You can choose the field where your comfort zone is or can take up a challenge to shape up your resume with a plethora of skills. However, if you are a beginner in this field, you can take up any and become an expert with hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S</strong>.: The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/blockchain-marketing-6-effective-ways-to-boost-your-seo-in-2020/\">demand for SEO-oriented</a> content is rising, and it is an excellent field to enter for beginners. But the one to decide your field should be you. Observe what you are best at performing and get your creative juices flowing by generating right and required content for your organization.</p>\n<h4>#3. Understand Reality.</h4>\n<p>The world of a copywriter is highly dynamic. With the changing market scenarios, it becomes crucial to keep up with updates of the industry. However, the false promises of higher pay grade from the beginning are an urban myth of this industry. No copywriter can earn more without prior experience and expertise.</p>\n<p>It asks for thorough practices and complete focus upon what&#8217;s best for the industry to keep your pay scales as per your preference. To make your dream of earning a good sum through quality content come true, a lot of hard work and skill development practices is required. You can use your own blog to demonstrate your excellent writing skills, but without prior experience of working in the same field, the salary and packages offered might not match your imagined ones.</p>\n<h4>#4. Experience Limits, They Do Great.</h4>\n<p>If you want to improve your career as a copywriter, it is best to place limits on how you promote yourself. Placing a limit doesn&#8217;t include limiting your package and salary expectations, but it does impact the marketing of your content that you do to promote your efforts.</p>\n<p>As stated earlier, earning expertise in any one particular skill helps you more than adding a plethora of skills in your resume that you don&#8217;t know about.</p>\n<p>Recruiters understand their candidates and applicants well, and an applicant adding up more skills that are difficult to develop in a shorter time gets exit from their list of suitable applicants. Therefore, be realistic and be specific of the skillset you possess.</p>\n<h4>#5. Grammar is Very Important.</h4>\n<p>Grammar makes or breaks your game. Whether you are writing for your current employer or finishing up your own profile, <a href=\"https://hackersof.com/write-good-seo-content-inspires-readers/\">make sure your content is grammatically correct to impress your audience</a>. The spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, sentence formation errors, and more get highlighted when a reader starts reading the article and leaves a negative impression of the writer.</p>\n<p>If you are not comfortable with the use of heavy jargon, then don&#8217;t use them. Ensure to keep your content straightforward and easy to read. For example, if you are crafting content around a keyword clone, then do not use excess jargon or difficult words in your content. A quality content constructed with good use of grammar and thorough knowledge of the topic selected gets a good boost and support from readers.</p>\n<h4>#6. Social Media to the Rescue.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/\">The number of social media users is hiking by leaps and bounds</a>. These social media platforms have become one of the most significant resources to hire developers for developing mobile apps, for candidates to seek various job opportunities, and also for numerous people to connect with their loved ones. You can also make the most out of it and can win the market in no time.</p>\n<p>For copywriters, it is easier to get connected with the brand or the company they wish to work for through social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or any other to get highlighted. When you reach the companies through their<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/29/how-to-provide-customer-support-on-social-media-faster/\"> social media channels</a>, this poses a chance of getting connected to their employee (who handles their social media channels) and gets highlighted. This simple trick leads you closer to a company but is often not used by many.</p>\n<h4>#7. Keep in Touch</h4>\n<p>The keep in touch tip applies to all of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-recruitment-in-2019/\">candidates searching for their ideal job</a>. The modern world has created a way to pitch a company from any end of the world within seconds. As the vacancies at popular organizations often get taken quickly, many candidates lose their hope of getting selected.</p>\n<p>But the key is to keep in touch. Whether a company selects you or not, the candidate who keeps in touch lands a chance to work at the same organization when any relevant vacancy opens in the future. Therefore, never lose hope and keep trying to maintain your communication alive with the organization you are aiming to work for.</p>\n<h3>#8. Try It Out and Measure Your Productivity.</h3>\n<p>A copywriter has to do the job throughout the day. Professional <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">copywriting and freelance copywriting</a> are entirely different. If you have developed it as your hobby or a fun activity for passing your time, you need to ensure you are happy to do it when it becomes a full day activity for you.</p>\n<p>Therefore, before jumping right in, ensure to check whether you are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/04/how-ar-and-vr-will-enhance-customer-experience-pending/\">comfortable with this role</a> and the responsibilities entitled. Measure your business and employees&#8217; productivity throughout the day and find out if you love your job or not. If copywriting remains a fun activity for you, you can continue and excel at doing the same.</p>\n<p>But if it becomes a burden and starts boring you, you might not be in the right direction. Find out where your interest lies to engage yourself entirely in your work.</p>\n<h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/08/19-ppc-mistakes-that-can-demolish-your-business-for-good/\">professional copywriter</a> of today knows to craft engaging content when assigned any work. The digital marketing and media of today demand them to keep working at the best pace without compromising the content quality.</p>\n<p>To become an expert copywriter of the industry, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/the-modern-workplace-demands-better-visibility/\">relevant experience and expertise</a> of crafting content is required.

Moreso, there is a lot of competition with investors doing all they can to determine the viability of a business before putting their money into it.</p>\n<p>When anyone asks what investors<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2019/01/31/here-is-what-startup-investors-look-for-in-entrepreneurs-before-investing/\"> look for in startups</a>, typical answers include an experienced management team, a large market for their product or service, growth potentials, uniqueness. Lately, the word ‘disruption’ has become a cliche with the rise of companies such as Uber and Netflix, among others; Investors continue to look for startups unique enough to upset an industry significantly. In the same vein, various technological innovations such as artificial intelligence have made <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/16/ai-is-key-to-bias-free-vc/\">VC funding easier and less biased</a>.</p>\n<p>However, things have not been all rosy in the VC market. Every expert agrees that VC investing faced a huge setback last year with the IPO<a href=\"https://observer.com/2019/12/2019-ipo-roundup-stock-uber-lyft-slack-pinterest-beyond-meat-spce/\"> flops of major companies</a> such as WeWork, Uber, Slack, and Lyft as the facts show. Therefore, startups can expect investors to make significant adjustments based on lessons learned last year, which are rather harsh.</p>\n<h3><b>Stricter Business Conditions</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2019/12/06/what-venture-capitalists-vcs-see-for-2020/#19a96b74196a\">According to Ben Narasin</a>, “in 2020, investors will require firmer governance and oversight structures to safeguard against negative impact and ensure these protections are mandated in their term sheets.”</p>\n<p>One of the fundamental conditions for picking a startup is that they have a stellar management team. It is one of the several measures VCs take to ensure that their money is in the most capable hands and would produce desired results.</p>\n<p>Well, now investors are desiring to have more say in the direct control of the company, particularly its finances and its compliance with corporate regulations (for example, the GDPR, with tech startups).</p>\n<p>Investors would be more strict in their grilling of startup founders and leaders, hoping to expose every hint of “<a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2020-new-tech/\">overpromising and underdelivering</a>.” This may probably drive entrepreneurs to alternative funding options, such as equity crowdfunding. Startup leaders hoping to win a VC fund have to be more diligent in doing their homework, fine-tuning their pitches to perfection, and blazing through the interviews.</p>\n<h3><b>Stability over Speed</b></h3>\n<p>As far back as 2015, Kauffman Foundation had reported that a <a href=\"https://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/the-importance-of-young-firms-for-economic-growth\">whopping two-thirds </a>of the fastest-growing companies go under before attaining self-sustainability. Apparently, just because a company is growing rapidly does not mean it would be sustainable.</p>\n<p>It is not so uncommon among some <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/310166\">companies that grew too quickly</a> to face a downturn of fortunes, usually a result of rash decisions. Therefore, “growing too quickly can be as problematic as growing too slowly.”</p>\n<p>Fast-growing startups like WeWork and Uber have taught us that the speed of growth is not always a good indicator of future performance. Apparently, steady growth is now more desirable even if rather slow. It is easier to assess and determine the potentials of a startup accurately if it is stable.“<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/01/22/vc-news-venture-capital-outlook-2020/\">Growth at any cost is not acceptable anymore.</a>”</p>\n<p>What does this mean for startups? When they found their businesses, entrepreneurs are usually filled with dreams of how their idea would ‘shake’ the world and want to speed up as much as possible (instant gratification), so much so that slow but steady growth may seem discouraging. Either way (fast or slow, steady) is great, but the most important thing is to not ignore the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3><b>Impact investing</b></h3>\n<p>The focus of the world is now being directed at critical issues such as global warming, climate change, education, poverty, gender activism &#8212; and of course, COVID-19. Likewise, the investing industry is moving in this direction as well to solve real-world problems.</p>\n<p>Real-world problems are called &#8220;<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/10-ways-blockchain-is-impacting-real-estate-investing/\">impact investing</a>&#8221; where investors are not only looking to make huge financial profits but also to make an impression in the world, or at least their immediate communities. Therefore, they are on the lookout for startups who key into this vision. Besides, such companies are incentivized by the government in different ways, including tax cuts.</p>\n<p>One of the insightful<a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/impact-investing-hot-right-now-heres-why\"> facts about impact investing</a> is that it is no longer a small investing niche but has rather grown to be one with opportunities for massive returns just like traditional investing. And there are statistics to back up the fact that impact investments perform well too with at least 66% hitting market-rate returns.</p>\n<p>Startups that show that they are solving a global challenge in a way or the other (for example, green tech) have an edge in the investing market.</p>\n<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>\n<p>Startups now realize what they are up against and that they must highly improve their game if they are to win any <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/18/ai-driven-predictive-analytics-new-opportunities-for-financial-institutions/\">funding opportunities</a>. The future is not all bleak, but the competition has just become stiffer. This may mean smaller businesses getting pressed out of VC funding opportunities as investors would rather fund companies that have achieved significant growth already.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is apparent that 2019 was a less successful year for VC investing and CrunchBase<a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-q4-eoy-2019-global-vc-report-a-strong-end-to-a-good-but-not-fantastic-year/\"> described it as a</a> &#8220;good, but not a fantastic year,&#8221; based on more <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/20/technology-trends-to-follow-in-2020-infographic/\">impressive expectations.</a> A less successful 2019 has caused 2020 to be more unpredictable, though many remain optimistic. [Well, that was before the COVID-19, so we&#8217;ll see what happens now.]</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/vc-funding-in-2020-what-investors-look-for-in-startups/\">VC Funding in 2020: What Investors Look for in Startups</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 14:00:04 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VC-Funding-in-2020-What-Investors-Look-for-in-Startups.jpg","linkMd5":"28acdc6535e8f4cc250907e49577f059","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-09-572_70e2fd0b642f5724.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VC-Funding-in-2020-What-Investors-Look-for-in-Startups.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":38132,"destBytes":30990,"author":"Michael Usiagwu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VC-Funding-in-2020-What-Investors-Look-for-in-Startups-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-11-076_6a028adb0127aeb2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878950},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"How to Bootstrap Your Startup for Years Without Funding","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167046","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/how-to-bootstrap-your-startup-for-years-without-funding/\" title=\"How to Bootstrap Your Startup for Years Without Funding\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-300x199.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"bootstrap your startup\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-300x199.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-900x596.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-242x160.jpg 242w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>When starting a business, it&#8217;s typical to look for venture capital, angel investors, and even co-founders to help get the company up and running. While funding is necessary for almost all businesses, seeking it out yourself isn&#8217;t necessarily the right path for everyone. Instead, knowing how to bootstrap your startup might be a better option.</p>\n<h2><b>How to Bootstrap Your Startup</b></h2>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/04/30/bootstrapping-your-startup-7-hard-earned-tips-from-entrepreneurs/\">bootstrap</a> your startup, you retain full control of the new business. You don&#8217;t have to worry about securing and keeping funders happy. If bootstrapping is right for your small business, the following tips can help you through the process.</p>\n<h3><b>Get Creative With Startup Funds</b></h3>\n<p>It takes money &#8211; sometimes a lot of money &#8211; to start any business. So, your initial funding has to come from somewhere. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to give away equity in your business or seek out external funding. During the early stages of your business, it&#8217;s possible to rely on credit cards and the personal savings of startup founders as you get things up and running.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/03/increasing-business-credit-the-safe-and-smart-way/\">launching a bootstrapped startup</a>, you may need to get creative. Design your business model so that you can quickly start selling services or products to establish cash flow. Taking the time to write up a detailed business plan outlining all of your expenses can help you better envision the expenses that will be involved, as well as the time it may take to pay off those credit cards.</p>\n<h3><b>Focus on Your Customers</b></h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re working with limited resources, one of the best things bootstrappers do is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/9-ways-to-refresh-your-companys-image-without-spending-a-fortune/\">focus on clients</a> from the very beginning. Engaging with potential customers on social media can help inform everything from your marketing strategy to your product design and launches. The better connected your business is to your customers, the more aware you&#8217;ll be of what they&#8217;re looking for and how they&#8217;ll respond to your business, and products or services.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s equally as important to focus on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\">providing effective customer service</a>. When your business is willing to go above and beyond to create a positive customer experience, you can build customer loyalty as well as valuable customer referrals. Increased referrals can expand your business without increasing your marketing budget.</p>\n<h3><b>Consider Outsourcing</b></h3>\n<p>You may reach a point where your startup needs more team members, but you don&#8217;t have the finances or stability to hire anyone full-time. During this growth stage, consider outsourcing some of your work to talented <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/21/the-freelance-entrepreneurs-guide-to-surviving-in-the-world-of-iot/\">freelancers or independent contractors</a>. When you hire freelancers, you can often save money over the cost of hiring an actual employee, since you don&#8217;t have to pay into the Federal Unemployment Tax or worry about contributing to employee benefits.</p>\n<p>If you decide to outsource some work, be deliberate and cautious in the process. Outline the types of work that you would like to outsource and determine the skills and experience that you would <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/9-ways-to-refresh-your-companys-image-without-spending-a-fortune/\">want to see in a freelancer</a>. There are many platforms, like Upwork, where you can find freelancers, but this can be hit-or-miss in terms of finding talented, reliable help. Instead, try to network with other business owners to see if they have a favorite freelancer they would recommend.</p>\n<h3><b>Hire for Attitude</b></h3>\n<p>Chances are that your startup won&#8217;t have the funding to <a href=\"https://www.calendar.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-hiring-a-remote-team/\">hire top-tier</a> veteran talent, but when it is time to hire employees, hire for attitude, rather than experience. Aytekin Tank, CEO of JotForm, advocates for this strategy, and it&#8217;s paid off for JotForm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sort of adopted a belief at JotForm that we don&#8217;t necessarily hire superstars; we grow them. We hire for attitude and make sure we treat the standouts well with more responsibility and good pay. This has reduced turnover and kept our production consistently high.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Look for potential employees who are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/12/the-3-ways-your-business-can-utilize-social-media-analytics-data/\">invested in your mission</a>, and who know how to bootstrap your startup too. They&#8217;ll be a powerful investment as they learn on the job, and bring genuine passion and hustle to their work.</p>\n<h3><b>Embrace Slow Growth</b></h3>\n<p>As an entrepreneur with an exciting business idea, it&#8217;s easy to get frustrated when you&#8217;re forced to grow <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/outsourcing-automation-future-of-business-scalability/\">your business more slowly</a> because of limited funding. But according to Tank, slowing down can be a gift in disguise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re methodical about how we expand our team and add new products, and over time we&#8217;ve built something incredibly sustainable. We also always have a rule only to add new employees if we have the money to pay their salaries for an entire year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The forced slowed growth you&#8217;ll experience as you bootstrap your startup can make you more aware of how you&#8217;re spending money. And, you&#8217;ll become more deliberate and cautious in your business decisions. Taking the time to step back and evaluate each move can help ensure that your business is wisely built, encouraging its chances of being successful.</p>\n<h3><b>Be Patient &#8211; and Appreciate How it Helps</b></h3>\n<p>Finally, remember to be patient and relax.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bootstrapping is a long game,&#8221; Tank says. &#8220;So take time to unwind and appreciate what you&#8217;re doing so that you don&#8217;t burn yourself out. I&#8217;m much better nowadays at <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/04/can-you-learn-to-be-creative-at-work/\">taking vacations and breaks at work</a>. I also encourage the same from our employees. It keeps us more productive and fresh, not to mention preserves our sanity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bootstrapping can take time, but be patient and enjoy the experience of building something great, all with your own funding.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/how-to-bootstrap-your-startup-for-years-without-funding/\">How to Bootstrap Your Startup for Years Without Funding</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:10 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding.jpg","linkMd5":"454f50c0e08486534bf6ec6f09529aa0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-594_1021153be1f66440.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1272,"sourceBytes":168291,"destBytes":139936,"author":"John Boitnott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Bootstrap-Your-Startup-for-Years-Without-Funding-300x199.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-17-978_dc5139c751a239cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880843},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"What the Drones of Future Can Do","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168259","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/what-the-drones-of-future-can-do/\" title=\"What the Drones of Future Can Do\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"drones in future\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>On Oct 11, 2019, the high precision surveillance along 50 km of the entire route traversed by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s convoy in India by four drones designed by Anna University made us wonder at the possibilities spurting from something like 3 cm resolution at an altitude of 100 m.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, the drone attack in Saudi Arabia in Sep 2019, which mopped away some five percent of the global oil supply, and reverberated a difficult question.

The need for good technology, huge investment, and fast adoption. All three levels can conspire in a scenario where the antithetical opportunities for prosperity and destruction may coexist subject to our <strong>drones of the future.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Introduction to Drones</strong></h3>\n<p>A drone is an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/07/what-you-need-to-know-to-use-drones-for-your-wedding/\">unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)</a> that can be made to fly autonomously by a dedicated remote unit. It has the capability to perform certain operations in the air dictated by the computer program whereas flight mode controls are assisted by tracking devices such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/02/22/ping-gps-locator-dl4/\">GPS</a>.</p>\n<p>The origin of drones attributes to the need realized by the government and military for intelligent warfare devices since the 1960s. During the Vietnam War, the US Army actively used drones for surveillance purposes followed by the later use by the Israeli military in 1982 during the Lebanon War.</p>\n<p>However, with the advancement in technology, drones were later customized into different forms for many commercial applications. To the great benefit of mankind have come assistance in accessing harrowing situations, finding missing people, creating 3D maps, surveying landscape, wildlife conservation, pipeline inspection, traffic monitoring, weather forecasting, and firefighting, agriculture, photography, video making, academic projects.</p>\n<h4>Even delivery services &#8212; especially in pandemic situations, may find a comforting benefit for all of us.</h4>\n<p>The cost of drones depends on size and functionality. The mini version drones which fit in the palm may cost as less as $100 whereas the military-grade drones which fit in a backpack can cost tens of millions of dollars. One of the largest military drones is 47.6 feet long <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a28120333/mq-4-triton/\">MQ-4 Global Hawk</a> which is wider than a Boeing 737 airliner.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular drones in the market was the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/09/video-a-look-into-dji-the-worlds-largest-drone-manufacturer/\">DJI</a> Phantom 3 known for professional cinematography. The drone uses an advanced technology that is inherited by the latest drones such as the Mavic Air, Phantom 4 Pro, Inspire 2, Walkera Voyager 5, etc.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Drones Work</strong></h3>\n<p>A drone is made of light composite material to reduce weight and provide high altitude coverage. The motor operation is achieved by a compact high-torque multi-propeller system that makes this device highly independent and provides fail-safe features in a way that even if any motor inside this device stops working; it will keep on flying as it gets support from propellers that are working in a group.</p>\n<p>These propellers are operated by remote ground control systems (GSC) using radio waves, including Wi-Fi. Most of these devices contain removable batteries so that it can stay in the air for the long run. The flight time can increase with the use of powerful batteries in design.</p>\n<p>The rates of rotation and other parameters are relayed by the gyroscopes and sensors to computers that use algorithms to make adjustments to the positioning of the drone. This keeps the drone balanced, hovering consistently and moving forward, backward, or vertically.</p>\n<p>Computer algorithms assist the drone operator in controlling the drone’s descent. While the drone pilot can control where and when the drone moves, it is the computer positioning algorithms that ensure an automatic stability level.</p>\n<p>Navigational systems, such as GPS, are fixed in the nose of a drone which communicates the precise location of the drone. Optionally, an onboard altimeter can communicate the altitude vectors and keep the drone at a specific altitude, if commanded by the controller.</p>\n<h3>Evolving Technologies</h3>\n<p>The latest high tech drones of today are successfully outdoing previous versions in a variety of ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collision avoidance systems</strong> &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.dronezon.com/learn-about-drones-quadcopters/top-drones-with-obstacle-detection-collision-avoidance-sensors-explained/\">Obstacle detection sensors </a>are used to scan the surroundings, while software algorithms produce the images into 3D maps allowing the drone to sense and avoid obstacles. The most popular example is the latest <a href=\"https://www.dronezon.com/drone-reviews/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-review-of-features-specifications-with-faqs/\">DJI Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom</a> which have obstacle sensing on all 6 sides.</li>\n<li><strong>No Fly Zone Feature &#8211; </strong>In order to increase flight safety and prevent accidents in restricted areas regulated and categorized by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), the latest drones from DJI and other manufacturers include a “No Fly Zone” feature which gives a warning on entry into these zones.</li>\n<li><strong>FPV Live Video Transmission – </strong>The FPV (<a href=\"https://www.dronezon.com/learn-about-drones-quadcopters/what-is-fpv-flying-drone-equipment/\">First Person View</a>) based technology consists of a video camera which is mounted on the drone and broadcasts the live video using the radio signal to the pilot on the ground.  This gives real-time onboard experience to the ground pilot allowing the drone to fly much higher and further than one can from looking at the aircraft from the ground.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Interface &#8211; </strong>Most of the drones today can be flown by a remote controller or from a smartphone app, which can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple Store. Such a manufacturer-specific app allows for full control of the drone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>New Areas and Business Prospects</strong></h3>\n<p>The drones used for commercial applications are flourishing. This shall give different businesses a large scale opportunity to boost their revenue and help global economies grow in unimaginable ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shipment services</strong> &#8211; According to the recent reports, Google and Amazon are developing their own drones so that shipment can be delivered by air in a much shorter time. Facebook is planning to develop giant drones to carry the signal to remote locations for internet access.\n<p>In 2018, Boeing announced it had prototyped an unmanned electric VTOL <a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/features/2019/05/cav-first-flight-05-19.page\">cargo air vehicle (CAV)</a> that can carry up to a 500-pound payload. As a part of <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/10/medicine-from-the-sky-telangana-hits-milestone-for-drone-delivery-of-medical-supplies-to-remote-areas/\">WEF’s “Medicine from the sky” initiative,</a> Telangana Govt has adopted a framework to use drones for last-mile delivery of essential medical supplies such as blood and medical samples in an effort to increase access to health care to communities across the state. Drones are also in use by news reporters to gather information from inaccessible locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration with IoT</strong> – An integrated system of Drones with on-ground IoT sensor networks can help agricultural companies monitor land and crops, energy companies survey power lines and operational equipment and insurance companies monitor properties for claims and policies. In 2015, an experiment was conducted in Austin, Texas in which drones successfully spotted the IoT networks that were present in residential and business areas of the city.</li>\n<li><strong>Measurement and estimation </strong>&#8211; Drones can measure and record the height of crops, buildings, and mountains. This is done by using remote sensing technology called <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/10/15/seven-ways-3d-lidar-is-transforming-our-physical-world/\">Lidar</a> that illuminates the target with a laser and calculates distance and height by measuring what is reflected back.</li>\n<li><strong>Atmospheric studies</strong> &#8211; Drones can fly to unsafe and inaccessible areas to measure air quality, check for the presence of specific micro-organisms or atmospheric elements, and even detect earthquakes.</li>\n<li><strong>Live recording</strong> &#8211;  Television sports networks use Drones nowadays to capture sporting event footage that would otherwise be difficult to acquire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Given such sprawling grounds of new applications, here are some recent business predictions on drone economy:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PricewaterhouseCoopers has valued the drone-based businesses service market at more than $127 billion, with the top industries being infrastructure at $45.2 billion, agriculture at $32.5 billion, and transportation at $13.0 billion.</li>\n<li>The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) predicts the drone industry will create more than 100,000 U.S. jobs and add $82 billion to the U.S. economy by 2025.</li>\n<li>Goldman Sachs predicts a $100 billion market for drones between 2016 and 2020, with the military making up the bulk of it with $70 billion spending. It is estimated that consumer drones will take a $17 billion share of that market, with commercial and civil government use making up $13 billion.</li>\n<li>The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research quoted in its 2017 report that the global drone market may increase four times by 2022 from its 2015 value and surpass a net worth of $22 billion that includes drones used for both military and non-military purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above data clearly indicates that drones are here to stay, and so is the threat they pose if they land in unsafe hands.</p>\n<h3><strong>Threats due to Proliferation</strong></h3>\n<p>No matter how impressive drones might appear, for now, they can become dangerous weapons in the future. The increasing popularity of drones and ease of usage is a reason for a number of privacy, security, and safety concerns. Hence the importance of finding a way for them to safely coexist with manned aircraft is growing increasingly urgent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy threats</strong> – These mischievous spies in the sky can take pictures of individuals in their homes or other private locations. For example, a magazine like Splash News assembled about 200 photo sets of small episodes from the lives of the celebrities.  Drones have also been found in potentially unsafe areas such as urban locations and near airports.</li>\n<li><strong>Collisions</strong> &#8211; The increasing drone traffic may lead to midair collisions and loss of drone control. The threat of drones flying too close to commercial aircraft has prompted calls for regulation. For instance, in June 2019, Iran shot down a US military surveillance drone. The impact was the deterrence of major airline routes across the world to avoid attack by mistake on entering the country’s airspace.</li>\n<li><strong>The possibility of civil attacks</strong> &#8211; Drones are relatively cheaper in comparison to conventional weapons and yet can achieve far more destructive results. It is this easy-to-procure, easy-to-operate, and foolproof technology that makes it an attractive weapon of mass destruction. In a <a href=\"http://www.unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/increasing-transparency-oversight-and-accountability-of-armed-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-en-692.pdf\">2017 study</a>, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDR) said that the same characteristics that make drones attractive to militaries can make armed drones particularly susceptible to misuse. According to a report in the <a href=\"https://pennpoliticalreview.org/2018/11/eye-in-the-sky-the-militarization-of-drones-by-non-state-actors/\">Penn Political Review</a>, many armed groups such as the Houthi rebels, Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, Libyan militias, Ukrainian separatists, Kurdish Peshmerga, Al Qaeda in Syria, Colombian FARC are known to possess and use drones. Besides, the recent case of the Saudi Aramco oil facility drone attack proves how the expensive anti-missile detector systems turn ineffective for drones because of their low altitudes and slow speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Hacking</strong> &#8211; Drones in some ways are like flying computers carrying an operating system and software with programmable code that can be hacked. Drones have been developed to fly around seeking other drones, hacking into their wireless network, disconnecting the owner, and taking over the control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Safety Regulations by the Government</strong></h3>\n<p>Over time, regulators around the world have taken steps to prevent the possible misuse of drones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>China:</strong> Any drone weighing more than 15 pounds or flying higher than 400 feet requires a license from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).</li>\n<li><strong>UK:</strong> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) mandates the registration for drones weighing more than a half-pound and prohibits flying above 500 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>U.S:</strong> FAA specifically mandates certain regulations such as Remote Pilot Certificate for commercial drones and registration for speeds up to 100 mph, daylight-only operations with appropriate anti-collision lighting, and the prohibition of UAV operation over non-participants under a covered structure or inside a covered stationary vehicle.</li>\n<li><strong>Europe:</strong> SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) is planning the roll-out of U-space foundation services, including e-registration, e-identification, and drone geofencing and full integration with manned aviation for the avoidance of interference and collision with commercial aircraft.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>Drones are the spectacular gifts of technology. Their expansion at large scale is inspiring almost all the countries to develop their drones for different applications. A drone of today is a combination of all advanced technologies like microcontrollers, GPS, Wi-Fi, and sensor units. They need to work in a synchronized fashion which is giving business to many companies and start-ups. Besides, the profusion of drone kits, easy to learn programming languages, and course material on the internet makes it easy for novices to build and code a drone.</p>\n<p>The role of the government is vital in such a scenario to enforce the development of low-cost detection systems. Such systems should be advanced enough to spot malevolent drones and to build strong regulations. Lest the trespassers will misuse this precious technology.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/what-the-drones-of-future-can-do/\">What the Drones of Future Can Do</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 18:00:24 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do.jpg","linkMd5":"76bd3dff0ea2b7fd636e4d2a12ab8560","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-26-135_db10c8655c539a8f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":24437,"destBytes":16566,"author":"Bharti Jain","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-the-Drones-of-Future-Can-Do-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-23-083_fa3261cc40d00337.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878180},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"An Obscure Program Shows How FinTech Can Fight Stimulus Fraud","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172860","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/22/an-obscure-program-shows-how-fintech-can-fight-stimulus-fraud/\" title=\"An Obscure Program Shows How FinTech Can Fight Stimulus Fraud\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Obscure-Program-Shows-How-FinTech-Can-Fight-Stimulus-Fraud-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"fraud\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Obscure-Program-Shows-How-FinTech-Can-Fight-Stimulus-Fraud-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Obscure-Program-Shows-How-FinTech-Can-Fight-Stimulus-Fraud-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Obscure-Program-Shows-How-FinTech-Can-Fight-Stimulus-Fraud.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Sen. Chuck Grassley offered a scathing critique of the federal government’s EB-5 <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/global-immigration-market-is-shaped-by-ai-tech-careers/\">immigrant</a> investor program and the potential for fraud when the Senate passed a bill last year reforming the three-decade-old program.</p>\n<p>The money from foreign investors — who in return for investing $500,000 to $1 million were promised green cards — was supposed to spark economic activity in <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/11/11/how-iot-and-citizen-science-can-tackle-urban-disadvantage-cl1/\">distressed</a> and rural <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/30/the-blueprint-for-building-a-smart-city/\">areas</a>. “All of a sudden, investment dollars intended for communities in need were being sucked up for glitzy projects in America’s most well-to-do neighborhoods,” Grassley wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/op-ed-trump-s-changes-investor-visa-program-are-win-rural-america\">opinion piece</a> at the time.</p>\n<p>If that were true, the episode would be another disgraceful nail in the coffin of an American dream that’s stimulated hard work, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/how-voice-technology-is-changing-the-financial-industry/\">ingenuity</a> and brought the dreamers and ambitions of the global community to this country. A dream that made it the glorious example of human achievement it once was. Now, just like an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/22/what-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-the-college-admission-scandal/\">Ivy League</a> education, can your parents buy it for you?</p>\n<h2><b>What’s EB-5?</b></h2>\n<p>Understanding what went wrong with the EB-5 program, and how policymakers and the private sector adapted over the past decade, is instructive. It’s especially instructive, urgently so, as we deal with a new wave of funding, ostensibly managed by the federal government, but largely relying on the vetting and fraud-detection <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/does-artificial-intelligence-help-fight-financial-fraud/\">capabilities</a> of private financial services, from big banks to boutique investors.</p>\n<p>We could be entering a golden age of financial crime. Six trillion stimulus dollars have been injected into the financial system. That’s equivalent to 27 percent of the U.S.’s gross domestic product with more than half of it in cash sent out in only about three months. I can’t think of a larger structural change in the economy, ever. Even after Pearl Harbor, it took a year to get the vaunted World War II economy moving.</p>\n<h2><b>Follow the money</b></h2>\n<p>Early<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/07/business/small-business-loans-coronavirus.html\"> criticism</a> of the spending has focused on where the money is going. The Small Business Administration allowed <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/growth-opportunities-available-during-and-after-pandemic-times/\">funds</a> to go to parts of the country that weren’t as hard hit, according to reports. It went to companies that many felt didn’t fit their idea of small main street shops. Billion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/sports-franchises-could-qualify-for-loans-with-coronavirus-relief-bill.html\">sporting</a> franchises have allegedly been exploiting the “small” business loan. The list only starts there.</p>\n<p>Much of the money has already been lost to fraud and deception. In the banking sector the talk is all about “Know Your Customer.&#8221; Too late. There have been a huge number of projects to try to “know” the customer.</p>\n<p>But the silos of diverse and distributed data, incompatible technologies and processes within a firm, and poorly executed mergers have all undermined really understanding the customer. Banks lose insight into the customer&#8217;s behavior, sentiment, risk and expectations. Or whether even the customer is real, or honest.</p>\n<p>As we face a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2009/02/07/stimulus_package_stimulates_ne/\">long</a> road ahead in figuring out who inherits the debt and the associated risks from COVID-19 stimulus spending, what was Senator Grassley stewing over with the EB-5 jobs program?</p>\n<h2><b>Easy money</b></h2>\n<p>The EB-5 program started to grow in popularity after a previous series of reforms in 2005. Those reforms made the application process faster and easier. In 2015 alone, there were 17,691 applications for visas through the program.</p>\n<p>As EB-5 activity increased, so did abuse of the program, ranging from a couple <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-241\">accused of double-dealing</a> in their operation of a regional center for investment in California, to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-vt/pr/four-men-indicted-fraud-charges-related-jay-peak-eb-5-anc-vermont-project-northeast\">developers in Vermont</a> accused of a “multi-year wire fraud scheme.”</p>\n<p>The massive investments into New York City property,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/opinion/hudson-yards.html\"> particularly Hudson Yards</a>, also showed how a program meant to bring brains and ideas into the country, may have been just getting Green Cards for kids with more money.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one particularly important lesson from the EB-5 program&#8217;s past troubles. The government and investors are quick to blame financial institutions. Due diligence and identifying fraud is a must.</p>\n<p>The Government Accountability Office wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-696\">2015 report</a> that “fraud risks in the EB-5 Program are constantly evolving, and continually identify new fraud schemes.” Like nearly all specialized conduits for high volumes of funds outside of normal channels, EB-5 is susceptible to bad actors.</p>\n<h2><b>How technology figures in</b></h2>\n<p>There are many stories of past scandals. But proponents have plenty of evidence to argue EB-5 works. It works when it&#8217;s effectively and correctly used. It is actually highly beneficial to the U.S. economy and job creation.</p>\n<p>Looking back on the<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/05/09/investor-visa-program-kushner-jobs-000440/\"> jobs</a> created or saved by EB-5 during the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/07/08/5-startup-lessons-from-the-great-recession/\">Great Recession</a>, the 174,000 jobs the Department of Commerce discovered came from EB-5 represented 4.3 percent of U.S. job growth during that time.</p>\n<p>What few realized, and realize even today, is the role played by the rise of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/23/role-of-big-data-in-the-evolution-of-the-financial-industry/\">technology</a> to support fund administration, like the work of <a href=\"https://nesfinancial.com/\">NES Financial</a> in Silicon Valley, which has since been acquired by JTC Group.</p>\n<p>Purpose-built technology and processes enabled end-to-end process management beyond middle and back-office accounting and administration. Speed and quality have advanced. Early machine learning has delivered.</p>\n<p>Investors and fund managers need a clear picture of investment, compliance and impact information. They need to manage and report on large pools of small limited partners. That had to be done regardless of average investment size. Doing that established best practices, protected investors and helped limit fraud.</p>\n<h2>Getting to success</h2>\n<p>Senator Grassley may continue to be concerned about where the money goes. But the financial integrity of the program is now impressive. Past problems with fraud have not reemerged.</p>\n<p>Policy-making is now shoring up technology. Just recently a 2019 bill made many seemingly minor changes. But together they create myriad new opportunities. New chances to stop funds from going to bad actors. They also significantly increase the demands on the private and public actors involved.</p>\n<p>The 2019<a href=\"https://www.leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/EB-5,%2009-25-19,%20EB-5%20Reform%20and%20Integrity%20Act%20-%20Summary.pdf\"> law established</a> an “EB-5 Integrity Fund” — funded by fees from investors — to be used by the Department of Homeland Security for international anti-fraud activities including audits and site visits.</p>\n<p>It required background checks of project principals; more disclosures to investors regarding business risks and conflicts of interest; and more oversight of projects and closer monitoring for securities compliance. The technology that&#8217;s now in place is key.</p>\n<p>It makes these requirements possible. And it allows them to work, and not choke oxygen off from the program with frustrating paperwork.</p>\n<p>A success? Actually, yes. But crime evolves quickly and so the test will be how long this success stays on target.</p>\n<h2><b>A menagerie of fraud</b></h2>\n<p>The government is not the only one shouldering the threat of fraud. That&#8217;s true, in both the EB-5 program and the more recent employment-based loans. It also falls on the various banks and contractors involved in the deals.</p>\n<h4>Here are a few examples of what could be coming our way.</h4>\n<p>Employee stuffing or shedding is a problem. For instance, it occurs when companies fraudulently expand their payroll to increase their fund eligibility. They may then get rid of staff and continue making ghost payroll payments to avoid violations of the loan agreement.</p>\n<p>There are shuck and clean operations. Organized crimes take over distressed firms for cash. It&#8217;s not just for fraud. These operations are a wholesale assault by establishing hundreds of shell companies. And this one troubles us the most.</p>\n<p>We should be very concerned about opening up the financial markets to easy access to crime. Entities are dangerous when ownership is the same, but control over it has changed without the bank knowing.</p>\n<p>Identity theft and elder abuse are the types of petty fraud that often plague government-assistance programs. They will continue but will <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/01/04/new-form-of-online-banking-fra/\">get worse</a>, supercharged by the $350 billion in US stimulus.</p>\n<p>Finally, cross-system abuse is another problem. This is where companies use multiple bank relationships to make multiple applications for the same staff pool and the same receivables. Don&#8217;t confuse this with legitimate companies trying to switch banks mid-process.</p>\n<h2><b>Due diligence</b></h2>\n<p>The government&#8217;s approach has a major weakness. The rush of stimulus occurring now is running through relaxed due diligence.</p>\n<p>“If the PPP loan is being made to an existing customer and the necessary information was previously verified, you do not need to re-verify the information,” the <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/Paycheck_Protection_Program_FAQs.pdf\">Department of Treasure advised</a> in April.</p>\n<p>And this creates a perfect account takeover scenario both from within and now from outside the country. Companies can change hands and shed half their employee base without anyone noticing. The scale and urgency of the coronavirus crisis measures are enormous.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable why the federal government has tried to get money out the door with limited friction. As we learned with EB-5, the risk of reducing friction is inviting fraud.</p>\n<h4>Technology has to be the answer again.

Early executives from Salesforce, forming Global Founders Capital, have joined investors along with leading executives in the enterprise cloud and data science space.</p>\n<p>Vectice will use the capital, developing its enterprise AI asset management and collaboration software platform for data science teams and business stakeholders within the data-centric architecture arena.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael Neril, Founder and Managing Partner of Spider Capital, said, &#8220;We invested in the Vectice team because we believe their vision to provide a system of record for data science and AI teams is a critical missing piece for enterprises and F2000 companies to organize and scale their AI initiatives. We are excited about partnering with such a seasoned founding team whose platform will help power and optimize the significant AI investment initiatives among global corporations, which is expected to produce tens of trillions in incremental global GDP over the next one to two decades.”</p>\n<p>“Enterprises across many industries are launching AI initiatives that have the power to make a real impact on their businesses, but there are too few tools available to effectively build and scale AI applications,&#8221; says Phil Boyer, Principal at Crosslink Capital. &#8220;We believe there is a massive hole to fill in helping data science teams manage institutional knowledge and better collaborate with business groups, and that Vectice has the right team to do it. We are excited to support Vectice&#8217;s mission of accelerating AI adoption and impact in the enterprise.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vectice</strong> was founded by enterprise entrepreneurs Cyril Brignone and Gregory Haardt, to revolutionize the way data science teams work and collaborate in their organization. Data has become a primary and permanent asset in organizations requiring precise management that will be delivered by Vectice.</p>\n<p>Data Science Teams will be enabled to better track these assets including AI models and institutional knowledge, collaborating with the rest of the enterprise. Brignone and Haardt will help businesses have a more positive and concrete impact on their AI investment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gartner projects that 85% of companies&#8217; AI projects will fail to create measurable business value for the enterprise,&#8221; says Vectice co-founder Gregory Haardt. &#8220;What people are starting to realize is that leveraging AI to develop better products for their customers represents not only a technological challenge, but also an organizational and cultural challenge, and increasingly, a strategic imperative.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;To be successful and become AI-driven, companies need a solution to track all their AI assets and promote collaboration to align business owners and AI owners,&#8221; says Cyril Brignone, Vectice’s co-founder &#38; CEO. &#8220;Successful AI-driven enterprises will focus on enabling their business to seamlessly consume AI and efficiently produce AI.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Modern data science teams produce a rising compilation of assets, ranging from data sets, features, models, and many notes and experiments. The implementation of any given application and its assets will be around, valid and permanent, long after the model is gone. All of these assets are typically siloed and reside in different systems, and are rarely linked together &#8212; creating a lag-time and link disconnect for the context of their creation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As Brignone points out &#8212; &#8220;The results will show in analytics teams often spend a significant amount of time determining which datasets are &#8216;modeling ready,&#8217; what experiments have been run before, which features were used to train a given model, or trying to track down the &#8216;expert&#8217; on a particular domain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Understanding how models feed into business initiatives is a whole other challenge for analytics teams, who often have to build up their understanding of business context by curating a collection of meeting notes, chat histories, shared documents, and emails &#8212; all with no unifying system.</p>\n<p>Vectice will provide the unifying system software, helping those teams tasked with transforming customer and market data to help their companies develop better products. The Vectice software system will be providing helps for teams in such diverse fields as self-driving cars, novel therapies and drugs, risk scoring models for financial services firms and software to optimize industrial and manufacturing facilities, and more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Enterprise data science teams are expanding rapidly in terms of sizes, the complexity of tasks, and impact on profitability. Until Vectice, there has been no true commercial solution for managing business processes, simplifying knowledge transfer, increasing collaboration, and ensuring traceability to maximize speed to market, ROI, as well as minimize the risk of AI initiatives,&#8221; says Monica Richter, former Chief Data Officer of Dun &#38; Bradstreet and Vectice investor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Data science will be core to every job function for future successful enterprises,&#8221; says Chet Kapoor, CEO of DataStax and Vectice investor. &#8220;The Vectice software will enable enterprises to create an AI knowledge catalog and promote internal collaboration needed to successfully scale their AI initiatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-172999\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice.png\" alt=\"Vectice\" width=\"1920\" height=\"817\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice.png 1920w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice-300x128.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice-900x383.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice-260x111.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vectice-1536x654.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></em></p>\n<p><strong>The Founders</strong></p>\n<p>Cyril Brignone ​has 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur, R&#38;D leader, and sales executive in the field of IoT and enterprise solutions.

Here is how to create an effective journey map for your customers.</p>\n<p>Landing in the &#8220;no product at all&#8221; category makes it all the more crucial for marketers to study different customer-mindsets in-depth and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/a-startup-guide-to-creating-an-ideal-customer-profile/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=721269e438db37a5778ea368c4dde03d741e100c-1587714837-0-AY1r0IpZasv-31WhcVggM0ljh6kxU3m12NbRA4mRT4nvlL097jdS4rrrs8Cts0VAMJyNCg74GOiRivOe0JmeEDUu7x_g1ymstEk7L11SojK85SmgfCoHnzAk66QE9GdrYiC-FlFbHUKDbyy0J7qU-1XxH094MdXMhAJmC0ylVT7oo_UFYcRfDC2uoOuEPTZilKh9i7WVskGVLA47zwe-WohN1Cp8430AIp4Qfze-JoJR9kNg8kvsfXaAtoCvaMkp1mVlzo3w9g4XhkzK0UK3whrd_M1RYhag9QA3TdZJawyt3F4PU-yGKsmGQr-H0jqW-XudFuMWfVIEZvG8sLDWoIQcClyNVgN0TQ71ZDtYYi8XJlaB98AtZJMpomdrM2RAbCg8MnbalhyDzhyU7tJW-a5J9GvkxwZA2ZT1J8IhytxX\">learn how to create your customer&#8217;s persona</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s why experts recommend studying situations from the customer’s point of view; to anticipate what will be their next course of action. Only then can a marketer get answers to the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the root intent when one is<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/21/the-biggest-growth-marketing-trend-of-2020-radically-inclusive-advertising/\"> looking for a solution to a problem</a>?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why did the customer choose your competitor over you?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did they feel for the first time after using a product?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will allow you to create a message that instantly captures attention, and finally work upon creating a customer journey map. But besides answering these questions, you need to follow the steps below to create a journey map successfully.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Your Customers</h2>\n<p>Do you come up with a lot of questions when trying to understand your customers?</p>\n<p>“What encourages my customers to buy the product?”</p>\n<p>“Why do they hesitate about purchasing our product?”</p>\n<p>“What concerns do customers have when thinking of purchasing the product?”</p>\n<p>Well, these questions arise <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/08/26/customer-journey-maps-marketing/\">when you do not understand your customer’s personality</a> as their journey begins with your brand.</p>\n<p>But to know this, to answer your “how to create a customer journey map” question, you need to understand them in the first place. And once you know them well, mapping the customer journey also becomes simpler.</p>\n<p>In this section, we’ll help you to understand your customers in four easy-to-follow steps. So, let’s deep dive now!</p>\n<h3>Step #1: Gather Key Data</h3>\n<p><i>Did you know that </i><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>68% of customers</i></a><i> prefer version A to version B?</i></p>\n<p>But you’d only know this if you understand who your customers are.</p>\n<p>So, to understand customers, you need to gather crucial data about them. For this, use channels like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landing page performance data.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/cubo-ai-baby-monitor-a-smart-and-cute-way-to-protect-your-bundle-of-joy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer support tickets</a> received via help desk software.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incoming <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/05/marketing-automation-and-customer-service-how-are-they-connected/\">customer support chats</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRM data such as customer’s name, email address, products or services purchased so far, and so on.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search history of the knowledge base repository.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer behavior data via an analytics tool.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current social media activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Such data allows your business to answer the questions mentioned above and, from there, help you customize and create a customer journey map.</p>\n<h3>Step #2: Speak With Colleagues</h3>\n<p>Another way to know your customers is to communicate with your co-workers who are in customer-facing roles every day. Communication with coworkers can include your support, sales, and marketing team insights on customer behavior during a product purchasing journey.</p>\n<p>While sometimes it may seem to be a vague attempt, experience tends to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/09/the-customer-care-bar-has-never-been-higher-so-brands-must-automate-to-keep-up/\">help organizations understand customers better</a>. Those who face customer requests every day would know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your target audience better.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many stages should the customer journey be divided into?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How customers might end up behaving during support, sales, or marketing process?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #3: Send Out Surveys</h3>\n<p>Capture qualitative and quantitative data via surveys to get a holistic idea of a customer’s mindset. For this, send out customer satisfaction surveys and even Net Promoter Score (NPS surveys &#8212; like qualaroo dot com) to see where your brand stands.</p>\n<p>Plus, you learn whether the existing customers are satisfied with your services or not.</p>\n<p>Basically, the more data you collect, the more clarity you get on customers. And thus, it becomes easy to build an audience persona. In addition to this, you get to create a seamless customer journey mapping process.</p>\n<h3>Step #4: Develop a Target Audience Persona</h3>\n<p>With all the data in hand, time to develop a target audience persona. You can create personas like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/16/how-mobile-apps-can-enhance-real-world-experiences/\">Customer motivations</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer needs.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer’s hesitation towards your products.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer’s concerns <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/06/how-to-create-a-successful-crowdfunding-campaign-for-your-startup/\">related to the overall brand service</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s no guesswork; you can build viable personas with the quantitative and qualitative data you gather. Once you create these personas, it becomes simpler to reach out to your target audience with effective marketing campaigns that end up increasing sales.</p>\n<h2>Understanding What Customers Go Through</h2>\n<p>You’ve understood how to identify customers and what affects them when interacting with your brand. It’s time that you understand their pain points at a deeper level.</p>\n<p><i>91% of customers</i><i> who are unhappy with a brand will leave without complaining &#8212; this is important to note.<br />\n</i></p>\n<p>As a customer-oriented organization like yours, you wouldn’t like to see this happening with your customers. That’s why you need to work upon the next customer journey stage to understand what your customers go through.</p>\n<p>Doing so will allow you to create excellent customer journey mapping examples for upcoming teams at work hassle-free.</p>\n<h3>Step #5: Consideration Phase</h3>\n<p>As you complete the process of creating a target audience persona, you should dive deeper to learn what all things do your customers consider before making a purchase.</p>\n<p>Make a list out their concerns, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/ai-customer-service-will-save-you-money-but-it-might-cost-you-customers/\">service worth investing in</a>?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I need the product?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What purpose <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/13/create-a-product-that-truly-delights-customers/\">will the product’s use serve me</a>?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there any consequences I need to be worried about?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if the quality isn’t worth my investment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These help you create counter solutions that help you answer &#8211; what is customer journey mapping and how to simplify it further.</p>\n<h3>Step #6: Purchase Phase</h3>\n<p>As you map out this phase, you see the steps your customers take to complete the product purchasing process. Here your organization can identify the problem areas and provide solutions to improve sales.</p>\n<p>Questions you should look into can be inclusive of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When did the customer lose interest in the product?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should we cut-short the check out process?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should we add a live chat to create upsell opportunities?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should we trigger help when we see an exit-intent?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #7: Retention Phase</h3>\n<p>Finally, track your retention strategies and monitor how many customers you successfully retain with their help. You’d learn about things that put your customers off and why they deviate from the purchasing process. This would allow your team to further upgrade existing strategies and actually retain customers.</p>\n<p>Track what strategies worked out fine and which ones ended up losing more customers, only to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-customer-churn-rate/\">refine the existing marketing and retention strategies</a>.</p>\n<h4>In the End</h4>\n<p>It is important not just to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/5-questions-msps-should-ask-customers-to-determine-security-needs/\">understand the customers</a> but also to carve their journeys with your brand.

Friedman published his international best seller “The World Is Flat” in 2005, he wasn’t making a counter scientific argument. No, Friedman’s work examined what we also sometimes term a borderless world – one that is intimately connected by technology, that eliminates the barriers between people. What’s more, Friedman’s view actively engages many of today’s most widespread business tools, from workflow software to offshoring and international streamlined supply chains.</p>\n<p>Friedman’s work put a microscope to what it means to be a global society and specifically a global economy, but there are factors that his work couldn’t predict. In particular, Friedman’s work couldn’t foresee the recent changes in immigration policy that determine worker movement and that continue to transform the professional and technological landscape. Recent changes to immigration rules significantly favor those working in the tech sector who are developing the tools that make our world flat.</p>\n<h3>Remote First Isn’t Enough</h3>\n<p>In an unusual moment, one in which all types of businesses are attempting to operate remotely, it seems natural that all businesses should be developing in a remote first fashion. Focusing on remote operations would likely keep business costs down by reducing infrastructure and allow companies to take advantage of top talent across the globe. Workers wouldn’t need to immigrate and could just work from wherever they were in the world. As we’ve seen, though, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/07/remote-first-why-isnt-every-company-boundaryless/\">most businesses aren’t boundary</a> free. Instead, they rely on abundant local talent and cheap real estate to operate, elements that are no longer reliably available because of regional competition.</p>\n<p>Of course, even a few years ago, it made sense that businesses didn’t prioritize remote work, especially at a global level. It was one thing for local team members to work from home with reliable infrastructure, but it was much harder to consistently connect with international workers, especially those in less developed parts of the world. And that’s without accounting for the added difficulty of working across time zones, something businesses generally prefer to avoid among high level workers. What norms of years past overlook, though, is the exponential development of digital tools.</p>\n<p>All of these changes add up to our present circumstances: faced with more competition for top workers and expensive real estate, coupled with improved digital tools, companies could be remote first, but they’ve already invested too much into being place-bound. That means that companies need to get workers to wherever they’re operating. As such, they’re highly reliant on immigrant labor, leaving businesses subject to international policy changes and competing countries – not just competing businesses.</p>\n<h3>Industries Driving Immigration</h3>\n<p>What businesses are most reliant on immigrant labor to be successful? Historically, it’s been low paying jobs in food service and healthcare, and while that hasn’t necessarily changed, immigration policy has, making it harder for these workers to move between countries. The outlook is brighter in the tech sector, though, which now leads the way in driving professional immigration patterns.</p>\n<p>One sector that’s fueling immigration is Fintech, the subsector of banking that merges technology and finance. It has <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/11/14/making-online-payments-truly-mainstream/\">made online payment systems mainstream</a>, and it’s precisely the field’s relationship to banking that gives it so much power. Backed by enormous amounts of capital, these companies have the money to sponsor high paying tech jobs for skilled immigrants. Other companies in the tech sector have been similarly successful, though it’s been harder for tech startups to sponsor the types of jobs governments issue visas for.</p>\n<p>Another key consideration in the competition for skilled technology workers is the fact that more industries than ever rely on at least a small contingent of these professionals. From healthcare to industrial concerns, every field has some degree of digital integration, a backroom of IT professionals or an app that needs tending. Though much of this work is outsourced to software firms and other support companies, demand for this class of workers is greater and more spread out across industries than anyone might have predicted.</p>\n<h3>Understanding The New Rules</h3>\n<p>Given that even tech companies don’t adhere to a remote first philosophy and are up against fierce competition for top workers, it’s critical that they understand the rules that shape our connected world and these vary widely by country. In the UK, for example, Brexit has left companies reeling, trying to understand their new, cut-off place in the world, but the news isn’t all bad. The UK’s new immigration system uses a points-based system prioritizes professional skills, along with a minimum salary, with skilled workers offered additional points through an employer-led system. All employers need to do is sponsor a work visa; workers can then <a href=\"https://immigrationlawyers-london.com/\">identify sponsor companies</a> to support their immigration application.</p>\n<p>While the UK prioritizes immigration for skilled tech workers, in the United States, tightened visa restrictions are holding tech companies back, preventing them from competing for top industry talent. Whether looking for tech workers who understand <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/13/is-it-time-to-implement-iot-in-the-warehouse/\">industrial IoT for manufacturing</a> or professionals who can provide cloud support for healthcare, the United States is likely to fall behind in the competition for talent.</p>\n<h3>Will Immigration Change Tech Hotspots?</h3>\n<p>Given changes in immigration policy and the need for businesses to recruit global workers, should we expect to see changes in where tech talent clusters? Experts believe so. Silicon Valley, for example – among other American technology hotspots – are likely to face a shortage of skilled workers needed to push innovation. In fact, US-based companies were already looking to move away from the area, shifting to cities like Phoenix that are more affordable. But relocating won’t be enough, especially while the US continues to block workers from majority-Muslim countries. The entire country is cut off from major talent streams.</p>\n<p>At the same time that the US is actively blocking tech entrepreneurs from immigrating, London’s tech sector has been performing well <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/vc-funding-in-2020-what-investors-look-for-in-startups/\">attracting substantial VC funding</a>. If UK-based companies can demonstrate that they have access to a disproportionate quantity of top talent, companies there could attract additional funding that would compound their advantages. With more money, they can create more sponsored positions, further securing their industry dominance.</p>\n<p>We also shouldn’t discount Canada in the competition for top talent. Historically, Canada hasn’t attracted much VC capital and isn’t known for its tech dominance, but Toronto has seen the most growth in technology jobs in North America over the last five years. The country is also fast-tracking visas for tech workers and welcoming subsidiaries of international technology companies.</p>\n<p>Competition for global tech workers raises another question: where are they all coming from? India ranks at the top of the list, but countries like Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran also supply many of these workers. The UK is also likely to see an influx of skilled workers from parts of Eastern Europe, workers who were permitted free movement into the UK prior to Brexit.</p>\n<h3>Is There A Balance Between Immigration And Remote Work?</h3>\n<p>Technology jobs may direct the flow of workers around the world right now, but is there a balance between promoting remote work and encouraging workers to immigrate to innovation hubs? The next few years could determine the answer to this question.</p>\n<p>The most likely balance for tech companies trying to work within contemporary immigration policy is that they will sponsor jobs at the upper echelons, those who would, within the UK’s new immigration scheme, easily meet the points criteria. Meanwhile, workers lower down in tech operations are more likely to remain remote, especially as global infrastructure and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/30/best-collaboration-tools-to-manage-remote-workers/\">remote collaboration tools</a> improve. Technology jobs undoubtedly move people, but they won’t move everyone.</p>\n<p>The earth may not be flat, but the world – the space in which we all work and connect, in which we do business – absolutely is. Thomas Friedman may not have been able to predict future political fluctuations, but even fifteen years ago, he had a clear grasp of how technology already had and would continue to bring us closer together.</p>\n<p>From remote work to highly skilled technology careers, we’re all working more closely together than ever before, even if much of that interface takes place through screens.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/global-immigration-market-is-shaped-by-ai-tech-careers/\">Global Immigration Market Is Shaped By AI, Tech Careers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 12:35:53 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AI-Tech-Careers.jpg","linkMd5":"d82b093a9067c919f73a3d81b0333c3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-426_f26fd86bf816ba11.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AI-Tech-Careers.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":44954,"destBytes":19546,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AI-Tech-Careers-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-18-079_de8c7a67e08e36ee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878785},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"5 Technologies a Trucking Business Must Be Aware Of","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169341","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/25/5-technologies-a-trucking-business-must-be-aware-of/\" title=\"5 Technologies a Trucking Business Must Be Aware Of\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Technologies-a-Trucking-Business-Must-Be-Aware-Of-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"trucking business\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Technologies-a-Trucking-Business-Must-Be-Aware-Of-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Technologies-a-Trucking-Business-Must-Be-Aware-Of-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Technologies-a-Trucking-Business-Must-Be-Aware-Of-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Technologies-a-Trucking-Business-Must-Be-Aware-Of.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e066ed5 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"e066ed5\">\n<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f444e90 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"f444e90\">\n<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-31f3b44 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"31f3b44\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n<p>In long-ago-days, the trucking businesses and fleets may have refrained from adopting new technologies because of the inherent resistance to change.

The only way to be successful is to push beyond your brand-owned channels – like your website and individual social profiles – and to reach people on the outside. Once reached, it’s your goal to magnetize them to the brand. And while there are dozens of useful strategies for doing so, guest blogging remains one of the most effective. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/20/3-steps-to-get-your-guest-post-pitch-accepted/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When done well</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, guest blogging capitalizes on reach, relevancy, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> exposure. The only concern is that it’s traditionally been a cumbersome and time-consuming process. In order to make it work for your business, you have to find a better way. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/26/blockchain-will-forever-change-link-building-and-seo/\">Automating the process through certain tools</a>, services, and partnerships could be the answer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Guest Blogging: The What? and The Why?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just as a refresher, guest blogging – also commonly referred to as “guest posting” – is the act of writing original content for another company’s website or blog. In return, a guest blogger can usually expect an author byline, brand mention, and/or precious backlinks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Guest blogging makes sense for a number of reasons, including benefits like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Generates brand awareness from a new audience</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/24/10-radical-ways-iot-will-revamp-your-seo-strategy-in-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Provides SEO benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> through backlinks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drives traffic back to the website</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strengthens professional networks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Guest blogging has been successfully leveraged as a common content marketing and SEO practice for more than a decade. But as it’s become more commonplace and less white-hat, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/tips-on-recovering-from-a-google-penalty-f62l3yq9\">new challenges have emerged</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Problem With Traditional Outreach Models</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most problematic aspect of guest blogging is how hands-on it is. Every phase of the process requires you to be directly involved. This includes the outreach portion, which is arguably the most frustrating and time-consuming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the traditional approach, you run manual Google searches for blogs and websites that you think are relevant to your audience and/or beneficial to your brand. You find the contact information for all of the responsible bloggers and compile them into a spreadsheet. Next, you go through and send personalized emails to each blogger on this list – perhaps even pitching an idea or piece of sample content to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then you wait. And wait. And wait some more…</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re lucky, you might get a response to 10 percent of your emails. And out of those emails, more than half of them are likely to turn you down. Your affirmative response rate is likely going to be below five percent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then you actually have to sit down and write a post, edit it, and send it over. At this point, you cross your fingers and hope that the blogger hasn’t forgotten and/or that they don’t ghost you. (It happens!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That’s all for a single guest blog post!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you want to scale your guest blogging up to a meaningful level, this framework becomes a full-time job. As a result, most brands wave the white flag and move on to some other form of marketing and promotion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But is there a better way? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Guest blogging is clearly valuable – it’s just too time-consuming and demanding. Could streamlining some of the outreach process through strategic automation make this a more practical option for you and your business?</span></p>\n<p><b>Helpful Ways to Automate Guest Blogger Outreach </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we talk about automation, we aren’t talking about pressing a button and letting a programmed bot take over your <a href=\"https://seo.co/guest-blogging/\">guest blogger outreach</a> on your behalf. As hands-on and personal as this process is, this sort of approach would almost certainly destine you for failure. Rather we’re talking about streamlining the process through the strategic use of tools, services, partnerships, and scalable models that make engaging bloggers on a meaningful level more practical and higher returning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Without further ado, let’s dig in and discuss some pragmatic techniques:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Outsource to Strategic Partners</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s start with the best and highest-returning option: </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/29/outsourcing-site-content-writing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strategic outsourcing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. If you want to completely automate guest blogger outreach without compromising the integrity of your brand, you should find and hire a service to handle it for you. But it has to be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the right</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> service!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A good strategic partner is a service that has a rich network of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pre-established</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> connections. Notice the qualifying phrase. You want to work with an outsourced partner who already has the relationships and simply has to tap them. This speeds up the process and dramatically increases your chances of success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are only a few services out there that satisfy this requirement. </span><a href=\"https://seo.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SEO.co</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a good white-label link building service that’s known for securing top placement for clients. Do your research and look for partnerships that feel like a good fit.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Use MozBar to Discover Opportunities</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are three key phases of guest blogging: (1) Finding opportunities, (2) Reaching out, and (3) Writing/Publishing the post. Step one lays the foundation for steps two and three. If you don’t get this aspect right, everything else will suffer as a result. Thus the process begins with discovering realistic and valuable guest blogging opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few different tools available in the marketplace, but </span><a href=\"https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MozBar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is arguably one of the best options. It’s the industry’s most popular SEO toolbar (more than 500,000 installs) and provides instant metrics when viewing any SERP or individual website page. Some of the top features include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Craft custom searches by engine or location</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get instant access to the metrics that matter most (while viewing SERPs)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Find and highlight important keywords and differentiate link results by their type (e.g. follow, no-follow, internal, or external)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Expose different page elements like markup and link metrics</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Immediately assess ranking probability via Domain Authority and Page Authority</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In essence, the MozBar is a Chrome plugin that automatically runs in the background every time you conduct a Google search. Beneath each search result, you’ll get custom link analysis that helps you understand whether or not the website could be potentially valuable for your guest blogging and SEO efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MozBar isn’t going to tell you whether or not a certain website will accept you as a guest blogger, but it will provide insights on which leads are worth pursuing. This can save you hours of wasted time and frustration.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Try LinkAssistant</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.link-assistant.com/linkassistant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LinkAssistant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is another incredibly powerful tool. And whereas MozBar is designed with big-picture SEO in mind, this tool has been developed with guest blogging outreach and link building at the foundation. Features include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Refine your prospect search method by goal (guest blogging, commenting, reviews, etc.).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get instant access to a variety of important statistics and metrics, including Page Authority, Domain Authority, domain age, link metrics, social media metrics, etc.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instantly reach out to potential connections directly from the platform. It even includes email templates and built-in analytics to track emails sent, replies, and follow-up information.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a built-in link verification system, you can run periodic checks to ensure your links are still active and that they don’t get switched to no-follow.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though it doesn’t completely remove you from the process, LinkAssistant does a lot of the heavy lifting by making you aware of which guest blogging opportunities are most likely to deliver a high return on investment. It’s definitely a tool worth integrating into your arsenal.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Create Powerful Email Templates</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s unrealistic to draft an original email every time you want to inquire about a guest blogging opportunity. The only way to efficiently send out hundreds or thousands of requests is to rely on email templates that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">appear</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to be original and unique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a general rule of thumb, every email template should follow a similar pattern. Begin by introducing yourself and then dish out a compliment or positive observation about their blog. Continue with a clear and succinct offer/request, followed by a few reasons why they should oblige. Tell the blogger thanks and sign off!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here’s one example of an outreach template:</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hey </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chase</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My name is </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Amy Foster</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and I’m an entrepreneur and creative – just like you!</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I wanted to shoot you a quick message and let you know how much I enjoy reading your blog. It’s been one of my go-to resources for </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">digital marketing</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> over the past few months. Your blog post on </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LinkedIn messaging </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">has been a huge help to me.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quick question: Are you open to accepting guest blog post submissions? I’ve got a pretty good idea for an article that I think would work extremely will with your audience. I’d be happy to reciprocate if you ever wanted to post something on </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">my blog</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks for your time, </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chase</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">! I’m really looking forward to hearing back from you.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All the Best,</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Amy</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You obviously shouldn’t copy and paste this exact template into your own emails, but it at least gives you an idea of how to proceed. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Quantity Outreach, Quality Follow-up </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When it comes to guest blogging outreach, you have to play the numbers game. By creating powerful email templates, you can really ramp up the quantity of your outreach. (And assuming you’re using one of the aforementioned tools, you can find hundreds or thousands of potential guest blogging opportunities.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But if </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quantity </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is important in outreach, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quality</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is the operative word in your follow-up contact. Here’s where you dial down the automation and get directly involved. You want to engage people on a personal level and treat each guest posting prospect as the valuable opportunity that it is. </span></p>\n<p><b>Final Thoughts and Takeaways</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Guest blogging has played an integral role in digital marketing and SEO over the last decade and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">will continue to be important in the coming years</a>. The key is to streamline the process through strategic automation – all without removing personalization from the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hopefully this article has provided you with some keen insights on precisely how you can efficiently scale your efforts and get better results.

Though every one regarded it as an expensive and complicated approach first, it is slowly becoming a necessity for all the small and big companies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Digital marketing comes with a lot of elements, and today we are going to discuss how <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/20/how-to-scale-your-content-marketing/\">content marketing</a> is the most crucial among them all. But before getting into further details, let&#8217;s get to the basics.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Is Content Marketing? </b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Traditional marketing is fading away pretty fast, and every marketer is looking forward to finding an effective alternative to enter the era of content marketing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;<b><i>Content Marketing</i></b> is a strategic online approach that aims at creating and distributing relevant, valuable, and compelling content to its readers to gain maximum visitors on its website without being promotional about the company and its services.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read that definition again and understand the worth of good content. It not only attracts more visitors to your website like a magnet but also keeps them lingering upon your profile in a longer run, thus being the most effective way to drive your online marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Content marketing is more of a commitment than a campaign. Below, I have talked about some principal reasons that justify this statement.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>1. Slides Your Brand Into the Audiences&#8217; Minds </b></h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>Content is the reason search began in the first place.</i>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Lee Odden</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You see, it is the beauty of <b><i>content marketing </i></b>&#8211; it grabs the attention of a majority of audiences without even pitching them about the products or services you provide. How? I&#8217;ll explain this with an example.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s say, you Google the recipe for egg-less chocolate cake, and notice the blog that popped up at the top out of 83,00,000 search results? You perceive that it has ranked the highest, so it might have the best content.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, every time you search for the same recipe, you witness almost the same results, so you prioritize reading the top-most blogs over the others. These blogs may have back-links to their website. You click on them because you find them relatable. As a result, you go through their site and come to know about the services that the marketer provides. Bingo. Great content always wins the audience.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>2. Enhances Search Visibility and Website Ranking </b></h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>The best place to hide a dead body is page two of Google.</i>&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever read that quote before? Well, now, you did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you search for a product or service, you only read the content available on the first page. You, most probably, don&#8217;t even go past the first five results, forget about clicking on the second page. A website, thus, needs a solid <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/10/4-ways-to-optimize-your-site-to-rank-on-google-in-2019/\">SEO</a> to help rank on the first page, and <i>content marketing</i> is one of the most effective ways to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every new blog you add on your site becomes a new page for Google to index. High-quality content created with targeted keywords increases perceived expertise, relevance, and trust on a website. It leads to more inbound links from other sources, which, in turn, increases the domain authority. Higher D/A implies higher ranking and higher organic search visibility. Thus, a digital <i>marketer</i> must make sure that they create the highest quality content possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a matter of fact, even the sites with low DA/PA rank quickly with relatable and valuable content for the masses.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>3. Can be Utilized by Literally any Industry </b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is there any topic on which you cannot find information on Google? Of course, there isn&#8217;t. When it comes to crafting content, one can do so for virtually any topic starting from assembling a lego game to building a motorcycle from scratch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your brand becomes more approachable for the viewers if you provide them with insights regarding the topics that you cover in your business. There is nothing that falls into the category of harmful content. You can create content for any niche you want to. You don&#8217;t have to add or come up with anything new. Just rewrite the things that you know in a way that others on the Internet didn&#8217;t do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pageonepower\"><i>Page One Power</i></a> explains this phenomenon very well with their quote, &#8220;<i>You don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel; you just need to share your unique perspective on why the wheel is important.</i>&#8220;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>4. Prime Source of Driving Traffic and Engagement </b></h3>\n<blockquote><p>“<i>Traditional marketing talks at people. </i><b><i>Content marketing</i></b><i> talks with them.</i>”<b> </b></p>\n<p>&#8211;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dougkessler\"><i>Doug Kessler </i></a></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Better content generate interest. The more your audience shares your blog, the more new viewers visit your site, and the more your existing customers feel connected to your brand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you have interesting content, your users will have reason to stick around your site, reading further topics and coming across more of the services that you provide. Thus, it becomes more convincing for them to <i>believe</i> in your services. You can also keep your audience engaged in your social media platforms using automation tools like Socinator, Hootsuite, BuzzSumo, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to effectively channel your creativity into your content is via guest posts. When you provide content to the external publications as a guest, you get the chance to link your website and services there. This way, your site gets exposure among the readers on their site. By doing so on a site with high D/A and good traffic, a marketer can earn thousands of audiences with a single guest post.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>5. Assists You in Adapting the Changing Trends </b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How would you deliver what your consumers prefer if you don&#8217;t know about it in the first place? So, talk to them through your content, and try to understand what they want based on their response.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“<i>We need to stop interrupting what people are interested in and be what people are interested in.</i>”</p>\n<p>&#8211;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CraigDavisRuns\"><i>Craig Davis </i></a></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aim of crafting content is not limited to gaining more and more audience. As an online <i>marketer</i>, you need to keep an eye on the changing trends and shape your strategies accordingly. Talk to your audience about anything, in general. Write an article on a recent Instagram update, any upcoming technology, inclination towards a healthy lifestyle, the influence of social media- anything that resonates around your business, yet sounds <i>trendy</i> for the readers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Analyze your posts and record everything- audience reach, number of shares, click-through rate, etc. This way, you get to know about the type of posts that your audience likes and talk about the services they want from you.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>6. Fills the Gap Between a Buyer and a Seller </b></h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<b><i>Content marketing</i></b><i> is all the marketing that&#8217;s left.</i>&#8220;<b> </b></p>\n<p>&#8211;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog\"><i>Seth Godin </i></a></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let&#8217;s say you build the next big thing in the market. You come up with the best marketing strategies, and now, your brand becomes pretty popular among the potential audience. What next? How will you convince them to buy what they see? How will they know that your product is valuable for them unless you tell them directly about it?<b> </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People, these days, want to learn about things before they buy them. Convincing them becomes a lot easier with content, be it on a search engine or a social media site. Content is the only thing that bridges the gap between marketing and sales in the journey of a buyer.<b> </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Good content provides answers to the questions that your buyer has regarding how, what, where, and when should they buy your product.<b> </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aim of any advertisement agency remains the same- to convey the right message to the viewers about the products displayed. This process becomes much more effective and seamless with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/26/leveraging-the-benefits-of-marketing-content-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>7. Reaches A Myriad Of Audience </b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This point is as obvious as the noonday sun. One of the main reasons behind brands going digital from traditional is the amount of exposure that they are going to get with this shift. In the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jowyang\">Jeremiah Owyang</a>, Founder of Crowd Companies-<b> </b></p>\n<blockquote><p>“<i>Google is the new corporate homepage.</i>”<b> </b></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Folks of the Internet make things go viral in no time (we all know about the egg that broke the Internet). Your brand can reach thousands of potential leads when marketed correctly.<b> </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/\">4.48 billion active users</a> there comes a lot of online competition. If your content is relatable, it will grab maximum eyeballs, will make sure that your brand remains on the top of their mind, and will assist you in getting conversions, not just clicks.<b> </b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we already discussed above, you get maximum site visits when your content ranks up on the first page of a search engine. It helps build <i>trust</i> in the minds of the readers and increases your brand reliability, thus increasing your revenues exponentially.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Wrapping It Up </b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you think that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/10/19/infographic-why-content-is-kin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content is the king</a>, you probably need to expand your vision. It is not the king. It is the whole kingdom. As you might decipher how important it has become in the world of digital marketing, it is pretty safe to say that content drives the online market more than we expect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The information we gather from the Internet has become one of the primary sources of knowledge. Folks rely a lot on the online content and find it very credible. Thus, every marketer needs to focus on the type of content they create in order to stand out among the competitors in their audiences&#8217; eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Content is, indeed, driving the online market, and probably it will keep doing so in the near future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me know if I missed anything in the comments below.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Toa Heftiba, Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/is-content-driving-the-online-market/\">Is Content Driving the Online Market? </a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Is-Content-Driving-the-Online-Market-.jpg","linkMd5":"7960f4a46b691bb3fe18172ca903c014","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-21-553_7f7c4c0746059e03.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Is-Content-Driving-the-Online-Market-.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":130945,"destBytes":119780,"author":"Sumit Ghosh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Is-Content-Driving-the-Online-Market--300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-09-669_7dd38594523412cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879184},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"EZVIZ C3X AI-Powered Security Camera","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173839","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/03/ezviz-c3x-ai-powered-security-camera/\" title=\"EZVIZ C3X AI-Powered Security Camera\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123-300x300.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123-300x300.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123-719x719.png 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123-160x160.png 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3X-190313.123.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>More security cameras are hitting the market to help homeowners feel more secure about their homes and families whether they are home or away. Now, there is another new WiFi-enabled security camera that incorporates artificial intelligence. This security camera is from EZVIZ, and it&#8217;s known as the C3X. Here is my review after I recently installed it at my home.</p>\n<h2>About the EZVIZ C3X Security Camera</h2>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.ezvizlife.com/inter/product/c3x/12359\"> EZVIZ C3X security camera</a> is now available as a way to add extra protection to your home. The camera has a strobe light and siren alert system, customizable voice alerts, and excellent weatherproofing through its metallic enclosure to minimize the impact of dust, water, and even snow.</p>\n<p>Also, the H.265 video compression capability reduces the need for data storage and bandwidth.</p>\n<p>The security camera offers an app where you can designate the zones for the camera to focus on. The app provides alerts as soon as the camera captures suspicious activity.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173855\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision-900x506.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision-260x146.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XNightVision.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>What Makes this Camera Unique?</h2>\n<p>The EZVIZ C3X security camera has many notable features that set it apart from other security cameras.</p>\n<p>First, it&#8217;s considered to be a commercial-grade security camera. Second, it has dual lenses. The dual-lens technology features one lens that records ambient brightness while the other captures the color information. The images are then merged to present one of the best security camera pictures possible.</p>\n<p>Third, it has built-in artificial intelligence through an algorithm that provides more accurate alerts about people and vehicles. Finally, it gives you nighttime color video. This means you don&#8217;t have to add spotlights to help with night viewing.</p>\n<h2>Cloud Subscription</h2>\n<p>For $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year, you can get seven days of storage for one security camera. A 30-day plan costs $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year. If you have more than one camera, the CloudPlay subscription costs $8.99 per month or $89.99 per year for seven days of storage or $15.99 per month or $159.99 per year for 30 days of storage.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173854\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XSecurityCamera-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XSecurityCamera-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XSecurityCamera-900x450.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XSecurityCamera-260x130.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C3XSecurityCamera.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>There are many things to love about this security camera. It has some of the best video quality and accurate motion detection I&#8217;ve seen among all the outdoor security cameras. The color night video makes it clear and easy to see what&#8217;s going on outside. Other pluses include a built-in siren and strobe light, straightforward installation, app, and Alexa and Google voice control support.</p>\n<p>However, there are some aspects of the security camera where improvements need to be made. The biggest issue was inconsistent cloud performance, which meant that there wasn&#8217;t necessarily a guarantee that all footage would be stored and secured properly. It was often hard to get into my cloud storage account.</p>\n<p>And, since the subscription plan I had to pay for seemed more than others, I really expected it to be consistent. As an alternative, though, you can save recorded video locally on a microSD card. However, you will have to use your own media to do so.</p>\n<p>Also, it would be good if the security camera also worked with some of the other smart home hubs like HomeKit or IFTTT.</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>The security camera comes with a drill template, screw kit, waterproof kit, power adapter (nearly five feet long), and a quick start guide.</p>\n<h2>Purchase Options</h2>\n<p>Priced at $149, the security camera is available at retailers. These include <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/EZVIZ-C3X-1080p-AI-Powered-Outdoor-Smart-Security-Camera-Revolutionary-Dual-Lens-Night-Vision-Technology-Person-Vehicle-Detection-Voice-Alerts-Detect/490112293\">Walmart</a>, Best Buy, and Home Depot. Online, you can buy the camera from sites like Rakuten.com</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Ezviz C3X outdoor AI-enabled security camera is a high-quality, high-tech weatherproof security solution. It is reasonably priced, delivering clear color video both day and night.

Unfortunately, this shortsighted approach is not only disingenuous to net-net long term sustainability, it can frequently be simply untrue.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, today’s technology prognosticators love to use technological outgrowth to make sweeping and often crazy predictions about future events (robot apocalypse, anyone?). Nowhere is this more prevalent when it comes to the threat of jobs (clickbait) or the promise of massive savings in time and financial resources to business owners.</p>\n<p>It is also sometimes used as fodder to justify political ends. Social media went crazy a few years ago when <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-automated-jobs-could-make-ubi-cash-handouts-necessary.html\">Elon Musk used the automation fallacy to justify the eventual need to implement universal basic income</a> (UBI).  Other <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/01/10/automation-replace-jobs/\">AI experts have similarly opined the replacement of 40% of jobs in less than 15 years</a> once artificial intelligence is entrenched.</p>\n<h2><strong>Automation and Outsourcing are Not Catch-all Solutions</strong></h2>\n<p>In truth, we are likely farther away from complete workforce obliteration than many experts claim. Additionally, the opportunity for human redundancy removal, at least when it comes to automation and outsourcing, is less-likely felt in some areas over others. Yes, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/21/how-self-driving-cars-can-shape-our-future/\">transportation—a massive part of most economies—will be upended in a major way</a>, but what about other traditionally blue collar jobs? I don’t see plumbers, painters and electricians getting replaced by robots anytime soon. Also, highly-technical work, like code and online content consumed by humans is likely still best produced by humans, at least for the somewhat foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>While somewhat siloed and myopic, our internal data speaks similarly. For instance, roughly <a href=\"https://seo.co/white-label/\">38% of our link building clients are white label SEO agency partners</a>. This underscores the following apparent needs, at least in the content marketing community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/outsourcing-automation-future-of-business-scalability/\">Quality is paramount to price</a>, especially when long-term sustainability is desired. Short-termism frequently breeds a push toward lower quality work to save a penny. This is especially true for highly-technical tasks or tasks where the outcome is critical. One example is the complete outsourcing of raising a child. Daycare can only imbue the outcome you want to an extent.</li>\n<li>Scale requires resources. If you want to scale any endeavor, you must reach a critical mass in terms of resources and personnel. Companies without resources are more prone to outsource and more likely to automate. Doing so allows them the flexibility of not having to hire full-time, but keep expenses flexible—a perfect beneficial example of the gig-economy.</li>\n<li>Speed of delivery often requires more resources than what might be immediately available internally. Speed can drive outsourcing.</li>\n<li>Experts can’t all be housed in a single company. <a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-xs6pv-935f4cd?utm_campaign=w_share_ep&#38;utm_medium=dlink&#38;utm_source=w_share\">Outsourcing allows smaller companies</a> to tap into the expertise of individual consultants whose services would be far more expensive as full-time staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, while automation and outsourcing—while beneficial—cannot solve all the issues related to cost, quality and speed. In fact, an organizational assessment of both internal and external costs (to more effectively determine the net-net) will be required in each instance where such solutions may be suggested to replace the status quo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Outsourcing ≠ Offshoring </strong></h2>\n<p>But outsourcing and offshoring are not synonyms.</p>\n<p>If I were to ask, “what’s the first word that comes to mind when I use the phrase: ‘<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/06/why-automation-is-the-only-path-forward-for-manufacturing/\">outsourced manufacturing</a>’?” I’m no mind reader, but I would venture your response would be “China.” What about “outsourced software development”? My next guess: “India.”</p>\n<p>Most would argue, the rising tide floating all boats has a much greater net-net impact, the tendency toward corporate greed and profits shifts the investment to other areas. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2019/10/16/us-finally-succeeds-in-vietnam-as-more-companies-move-sourcing-there/#3afd0d6b4a4e\">It’s not just the trade war that is moving Chinese manufacturing to places like Vietnam</a>. Thanks to already-rising Chinese wages and manufacturing costs, the writing was already on the wall, the trade war simply acted more like a premature catalyst.</p>\n<p>When it comes to outsourcing tasks that are native to a particular culture that may be critical to success, we need to remove the temptation to automate and outsource these functions, especially those that tie most critical to the customer experience. Two viable examples that come to mind are telemarketing outsourcing and online content production.</p>\n<p>When I refer to telemarketing, I’m not referring to support staff you might encounter in India or the Philippines when you call Microsoft or American Express. No, I’m referring to outbound callers, who might be selling a particular product or service. In high volumes, even the blind squirrel picks up a nut now and again. However, when it comes to having the greatest impact in the shortest period, someone from the same culture, accent and communication style is often always</p>\n<p>Secondly, content production is also an area that can be outsourced, but likely not offshored cheaply. What types of content? Long form blogs, written articles on high authority publications, podcasts and commercial-like YouTube videos are all areas that might be easily outsourced, but should never be offshored. These types of customer-facing content experiences need to reflect the culture and style of the desired country in question. In our case, United States companies are best served by outsourcing their content work, but are more likely to experience a massive customer fail when they attempt to offshore it.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Present and Future of Outsourcing </strong></h2>\n<p>As industrialized nations have leveraged less expensive wages overseas, they have seen a highly-diminished return on their initial investment as wages always tend to increase over time. The trend typically continues until the cost to move to the next low wage environment is outstripped by the cost of staying.</p>\n<p>Today’s manufacturers of both code and clothes move from one nation to the next. During the industrial revolution in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, the United States was the outsourcers mecca. While that has shifted here at home, the fertile “next frontier” for outsourcing opportunities are diminishing as the rising tide of economic growth moves across the world.</p>\n<p>This wave of outsourcing is creating more of an economic benefit to emerging economies, but the inexpensive labor opportunities for large corporations looking to outsource will continue to diminish in the years ahead as we run out of proverbial “frontier.”</p>\n<h2><strong>The Future of Automation </strong></h2>\n<p>If automation does inevitably take over our workforce, the opportunity to fix and provide support to robotics, blockchain, servers and the ancillary services surrounding them are likely to be vast.</p>\n<p>There are also areas that automation and machines are likely going to be difficult to fully touch. Home cleaning services, nannies and other B2C services industries that have a great deal of stock in human-to-human contact will remain existent for many years to come, even if the cars that drive them eventually become autonomous.</p>\n<p>I personally side with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-jobs-created-globally-automation-manpower-report-2019-2\">those who believe automation will produce more jobs, not less</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>\n<p>There will no doubt be winners and losers on the frontier of both automation and outsourcing, but there is no doubt that the promise of automation may have less of a disjointed disruption effect than what prognosticators predict. Outsourcing, in its own turn, will continue to provide outsized returns for companies looking to save on costs. However, over time, there is no doubt such returns will continue to ebb as outsources truly run out of veritable frontier from which to source newer, cheaper labor. But, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/01/never-mind-the-robots-automation-will-lead-to-lower-prices-more-leisure-time/\">most compelling on both fronts is the potential for lower prices and greater time spent in leisure</a>.</p>\n<p>So, the next time you see an article that shows how video is going to somehow kill the radio star, remember many more video stars were created by video than were ever annihilated in radio.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/17/the-diminishing-returns-of-outsourcing-and-the-fallacy-of-automation/\">The Diminishing Returns of Outsourcing and the Fallacy of Automation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 22:52:51 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/outsourcing-automation-fallacy.jpg","linkMd5":"8c6cc7a2399505408a90011b6e238054","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-20-313_41ac17d1fcbde925.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/outsourcing-automation-fallacy.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":245675,"destBytes":201790,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/outsourcing-automation-fallacy-300x169.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-28-035_ee279ece6d5ff2d4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880986},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","title":"How Blockchain is Revolutionizing the Supply Chain Industry","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=161633","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/10/how-blockchain-is-revolutionizing-the-supply-chain-industry/\" title=\"How Blockchain is Revolutionizing the Supply Chain Industry\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-Blockchain-is-Revolutionizing-the-Supply-Chain-Industry-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"blockchain and supply chain industry\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-Blockchain-is-Revolutionizing-the-Supply-Chain-Industry-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-Blockchain-is-Revolutionizing-the-Supply-Chain-Industry-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-Blockchain-is-Revolutionizing-the-Supply-Chain-Industry.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The Supply chain has transformed, and companies have not updated the underlying technology for managing them in decades.

Until the advent of bitcoin and blockchain technology, the only way you could get a large number of entities to agree upon a shared, truthful set of data(such as who owns how much money). </em></p>\n<p><em>This was for appointing an impartial intermediary to process and account for all transactions.

You&#8217;ll have the foundation for a radically new approach to supply chain partners for banking nodes. You&#8217;ll also have the foundation for a radically new approach to supply chain management.</p>\n<h4>The use cases for this new way of working are compelling.</h4>\n<p>At its most basic level, the core logic of blockchain means that no piece of inventory can exist in the same place twice.

It offers a secure and reliable architecture for conveying information and transactions ( e.g. the exchange of data and assets among participants in a supply chain), which can be recorded digitally.</p>\n<p>As the distributed ledger is decentralized, each stakeholder maintains a copy, which prevents a single point of failure or data loss. This also means blockchains are highly resistant to altering or tampering. Such accurate and tamper-proof records secure data integrity and can be accessed to make regulatory compliance easier.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, blockchain can increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chains and positively impact everything from warehousing to delivery to payment.</p>\n<h4 class=\"has-background has-medium-font-size has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color\">All parties involved from beginning to end in the supply chain will be aware as the product is transacted and handled from party to party at all times.</h4>\n<p class=\"has-background has-medium-font-size has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color\">Through the implementation of Blockchain technology in the Supply Chain Industry, products can be tracked and traced throughout their entire process.</p>\n<h3>Traceable and Immutable Records</h3>\n<p>Blockchain data is immutable and digital signatures which require to confirm information ownership. If multiple companies work together they can use a blockchain system to record data about the location and ownership of their materials and products.</p>\n<p>The data is stored in the blockchain, which offers a full history of all items in the supply chain. Any member of the supply chain can see what is going on as materials move from company to company. These data records cannot be altered and are highly Traceable.</p>\n<p>In the event of a defective product, the source of the problem can be identified more quickly, which improves the efficiency of product recalls and disruption resolution between stakeholders in the chain.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_161636\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-161636\" style=\"width: 489px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blockchain-immutabiity-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-161636 size-full\" title=\"Traceable and Immutable Records\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blockchain-immutabiity-1.jpg\" alt=\"Traceable and Immutable Records\" width=\"489\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blockchain-immutabiity-1.jpg 489w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blockchain-immutabiity-1-260x111.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blockchain-immutabiity-1-300x128.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-161636\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>Traceable and Immutable Records</strong></em></figcaption></figure></figure>\n<h4>Having a transparent and complete inventory of product flow help businesses make better decisions.</h4>\n<p>It gives stakeholders and customers more confidence in the products’ quality.

You sold it, they bought it, as long as it was a prestige brand, a household name, or was <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/20/complete-guide-to-influencer-marketing-in-2020/\">promoted by an influencer</a> or by a really cool cartoon animal. Here is the importance of empathy-based marketing.</p>\n<h3><strong>People have a lot more choices, nowadays, and marketers everywhere are clamoring for their attention.</strong></h3>\n<p>To stand out, you not only need to have a quality product or service, but you also need to show that you understand your audience—not even stellar content curation and content promotion can save you if your marketing isn’t hyper-targeted.</p>\n<p>Enter empathy-based marketing.</p>\n<h2><b>What is empathy-based marketing?</b></h2>\n<p>Empathy-based marketing is a strategy that calls for you to walk in your customer’s shoes for a bit. Instead of using a hard-sell approach, you consider their experience and think about how your brand can help them get what they want, which could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More free time</li>\n<li>More happiness</li>\n<li>More friends</li>\n<li>Better health</li>\n<li>A more attractive appearance</li>\n<li>A career advantage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, you’re still out to make a profit, but with empathy-based marketing, your strategy is different. You need to connect with your audience on a deeper and more intuitive level by delivering an immense value that they never anticipated. In short, make them feel like you read their mind before going above and beyond.</p>\n<h2><b>Define your customer</b></h2>\n<p>A lot of businesses use <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog/customer-personas\">buyer personas</a> to direct their marketing. These personas are fictional characters that represent your ideal customers. Without them, your marketing efforts can be a bit like throwing snowballs in the dark and hoping that you blindly connect with something.</p>\n<p>To be effective, your personas need to take <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/5-product-discovery-tips-for-building-solutions-customers-will-buy/\">customer emotions</a> into account. Identify their wants and pain points, understand how these factors make them feel, and then plan your content accordingly. For example, customers who are constantly rushed for time will want a simplified usage guide while those who are buying to indulge themselves value things that make them feel extra-special, like a free gift with purchase.</p>\n<h2><b>Understand your customer</b></h2>\n<p>Who are you marketing to? Is it busy parents? <a href=\"https://www.candybar.co/blog/candybar-merchant-stories/\">Small business owners</a>? People who are passionate about the environment will pay attention. To communicate properly with them, you need to understand what they care about and how your product can give them what they want, whether it be more free time, a healthier body, or a new skill that they can use to climb the corporate ladder.</p>\n<h2><b>What motivates them to buy?</b></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://smith.co/assets/docs/SMITH-POV-8-modes-of-shopping-report.pdf\">detailed study</a> by commerce experts SMITH identified eight different emotions that <a href=\"https://www.reallysimplesystems.com/blog/emotional-branding/\">influence buying</a> and shopping decisions. For example, it found that some people will only buy products that are ‘cool’ and state-of-the-art to make themselves stand out from the crowd while others are directed by opinions: they need validation from friends, family, and online testimonials before they buy.</p>\n<p>So which emotions are guiding your customers when they shop? You can get the answer by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running an online poll on your website</li>\n<li>Use an <a href=\"https://www.emailvendorselection.com/mailchimp-alternatives/\">email newsletter service like MailChimp</a> to send a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/understanding-the-role-of-ai-and-ml-in-sentiment-analysis/\">customer sentiment survey</a> to your audience.</li>\n<li>Reading the testimonials on Google and your business Facebook page</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many businesses are even investing in artificial intelligence to collect and analyze customer data for info they can use for empathy-based marketing. <a href=\"https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/ai-in-business-intelligence-applications/\">This article</a> by AI research and advisory company Emerj provides some real-life examples of how businesses like Walmart use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/understanding-the-role-of-ai-and-ml-in-sentiment-analysis/\">business intelligence applications</a> to understand their customers.</p>\n<h2><b>Send a message that resonates</b></h2>\n<p>Empathetic content shows customers that you understand what it’s like to walk in their shoes. People feel positive about brands that can solve their problem, so send a message, <a href=\"https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/words-that-sell/\">using the right words</a>, that shows how your products address issues that matter to them.</p>\n<p>If your company website has a blog (and it should), use it to create a narrative that talks about these issues. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your customers are busy professionals who rarely have enough time in the day to get everything done, post some tips, and share links to productivity tools that don’t compete with your products.</li>\n<li>Are your customer&#8217;s <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/01/mural-paintings-and-the-impact-of-colors-in-our-lives/\">young professionals or entrepreneurs</a> who are just starting out in their careers? Share some ideas for assembling a classy-looking wardrobe on a budget, or maybe some <a href=\"https://www.sociallyinfused.com/marketing/how-to-start-your-own-business-ultimate-guide/\">tips for starting your own business</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bonus points if you use video, especially if you’re marketing to millennials. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/millennial-learning-statistics/\">Research presented by Google</a> shows that when they want to learn something new, this age group is nearly three times more likely to watch a video than read a book. However, the highly visual nature of video makes it a great marketing tool for all customer types.</p>\n<h2><b>Empathy-based marketing in action</b></h2>\n<p>So, what are some practical examples of empathy-based marketing? Below are two cases of well-known consumer brands taking customer service to the next level.</p>\n<h3><b>The Delta pizza party</b></h3>\n<p>Few situations are more frustrating than a delayed or canceled flight. Passenger reactions can be so extreme that they’ve been featured on countless reality TV shows.</p>\n<p>In April 2017, Delta airlines provided a perfect illustration of brand empathy when it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/us/delta-delays-pizza-trnd/index.html\">ordered hundreds of pizzas</a> for Atlanta-area customers whose flights had been canceled or delayed due to extreme weather. The pizzas were distributed to passengers stuck on runways and waiting in surrounding airports.</p>\n<p>This move was more than simply good customer service. It presented the Delta brand as one that understands and cares about its passengers, especially when they’re in one of the most stressful situations imaginable.</p>\n<h3><b>LUSH shows how it’s made</b></h3>\n<p>The LUSH beauty brand is all about natural products, so their customers are people who want fresh, homemade cosmetics. To assure its community that they really are getting 100% natural beauty products, LUSH has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_G_OaIbOuAmPFX8IubCXOp18_TBKyzhZ\">video series</a> called ‘How It’s Made.’</p>\n<p>Each episode shows real LUSH employees at work, explaining how they make all the soaps, lotions, bath bombs, and other products. Depending on what they’re making, you’ll see mounds of sea salt, fresh citrus fruit, and dried flowers on the counter, confirming to viewers that they’re getting what they pay for.</p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>Although we’ve got millions of years of evolution behind us and are capable of both critical thinking and abstract thought, emotions still guide a lot of our decisions, including what to buy.</p>\n<p>To succeed at empathy-based marketing, you want to create a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/11/how-do-you-create-an-effective-journey-map-for-your-customers/\">journey map</a> or experience/outcome that your ideal buyer can relate to, and feel good about. When you start by understanding them and then create content that delivers your brand message in an impactful way (go ahead and use a cool cartoon animal if you want!), you’ll stand out and succeed.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: unsplashed</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/25/the-importance-of-empathy-based-marketing/\">The Importance of Empathy-Based Marketing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 16:41:20 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Importance-of-Empathy-Based-Marketing.jpg","linkMd5":"e206ac4606e54b53b15e5f4a3abdac10","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn76@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-19-081_e98f7d710d78db4f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Importance-of-Empathy-Based-Marketing.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":95742,"destBytes":92096,"author":"Vincent Bucciachio","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Importance-of-Empathy-Based-Marketing-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn66@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-737_55124be1b3c9bab9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872359},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"The Best Digital Marketing Strategies for Startup Businesses","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171566","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/20/the-best-digital-marketing-strategies-for-startup-businesses/\" title=\"The Best Digital Marketing Strategies for Startup Businesses\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"startups\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>As a newbie in the industry, you should be ready to work hard so that you can earn more profits with the help of the new thing called the internet.

So it&#8217;s easy to see why so many companies are getting into this type of marketing.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">To build a list of potential customers, you will have to provide them with an email address. While this may seem like a tedious task at first, it really isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s all a matter of knowing where to find an email address, as well as making sure that you do it right the first time.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The way to get started with marketing is to go online and do some research on what other people are doing. Find out how they built their lists. You can also ask around to see what methods are working. Knowing the methods that are working can help to get you going, as well as give you great ideas on how to create your own list.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">One thing that you want to be careful about is giving out someone&#8217;s name and mailing address to many people that don&#8217;t care about your product or service. The more subscribers you have, the more money you can make. If you want your list to have longevity, then make sure you choose people who need your product or service.</span></p>\n<h3>Best Tips For Your Startup Business</h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">After you&#8217;ve determined who you are going to market to, you will need to start planning out your next step, which will include having a monthly newsletter. Remember that emails can easily get lost in the shuffle. So, having a regular newsletter will ensure that it is picked up each month by your subscribers. You want to make sure that you use a high-quality email marketing software to allow you to know when you should send out an email.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Once you have your newsletter sign up form established, you can start looking for your products or services or start building an affiliate link. Keep in mind that people are only going to join you if they have an interest in what you are offering.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">You will want to email these people with offers to promote your products or services and have them take action. You can do this through offers that promote your software or affiliate links, as well as offering incentives for signing up. Also, do a free trial to get their attention, and then you can offer them a discounted or even free product.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">While email marketing isn&#8217;t a new concept, it is only recently that many companies have begun using it. When done properly, it can result in a considerable amount of profit for your business.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\">Social Media Marketing</h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Social Media Marketing is simply marketing done through social media platforms. A marketing technique that combines website promotion, blogs, and discussion boards to connect with prospects and establish a brand. It allows businesses to connect with their customers but also promote their business via social media marketing. Helps establish business ties, generate buzz, and make an organization more appealing to potential clients.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Today, companies are turning to the Internet to solve all of their marketing needs; however, traditional forms of marketing do not offer the same convenience as they once did. For many years, businesses could only reach out to their customers through visits to their office or even by sending out business cards. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">With <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2012/06/29/why-you-cant-escape-social-media-marketing-any-more/\">social media marketing</a>, companies can reach their customers when they need them most. If you&#8217;re looking to make your startup business more attractive to customers, consider using social media marketing.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">One of the most critical aspects of the startup business is to have your products and services are unique. Unlike before, now, customers can easily find out about your business, providing them with fresh information about what you do. For instance, having your website listed on various search engines and sites will help customers find you. Websites are also a great way to connect with customers and create long term relationships.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Most network marketing companies are also looking to expand their reach online. Some of them have gained loyal followings because of their ability to leverage social media marketing techniques. These companies offer a variety of marketing tools for their members, including blog marketing, social networking, and more.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><b>Can Help Your Startup Business</b></h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Social media marketing is similar to traditional marketing. The only difference is that it provides a better way to connect with customers online. It helps to provide your audience with a sense of familiarity while providing your products and services to potential customers at the same time.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Although some might consider network marketing as competition from them, it is suitable for customer support. Since the company will be relying on customers to purchase your products and services, it will be beneficial to provide your customers with free content and discounts to keep them happy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">When people&#8217;s attention is brought to your site, it becomes much easier to get them to share your content with others. It makes sense to use social networking sites to connect with potential customers. Not only will you have a built-in community, but it will also give you a platform where you can further build a fan base.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">To reach more potential customers, you will need to implement social media marketing strategies in your marketing plan. If you&#8217;re looking to start a startup business, this is a great way to establish the name of your business and attract new customers.</span></p>\n<h3>Avoid Failure With Paid Promotions and Paid Advertising</h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The idea of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\">Paid Promotions</a> to help a startup business success is simple enough, but it&#8217;s also very easy to go wrong. You may want to spend months developing your own promotions and marketing efforts, only to realize that they&#8217;re not working well enough for you to earn money from them. On the other hand, you may discover that your existing marketing efforts are working, and then you&#8217;re simply out of ideas. Here are some tips to help you avoid this situation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">One reason why paying Promotions may not be as successful as you&#8217;d like them to be is because of the quality of your content. For one thing, you want to have something that will <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/25/how-to-create-top-performing-content-on-google-according-to-science/\">catch people&#8217;s attention</a> from the moment <a href=\"https://bloggeradvices.com/facebook-ads-placement-strategy/\">Facebook ads placement strategy</a> they come across it. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">For another thing, you should be writing for readers that will read what you&#8217;ve written. When you go into Paid Promotions thinking that only your own site is going to get traffic, this is not the case. A lot of articles and blogs go into Paid Promotions in a similar way &#8211; a good article or blog gets more views and traffic because people find it useful.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">It&#8217;s not always easy to keep in mind these things, but if you&#8217;re serious about getting your Business Online and driving traffic to your site, you need to remember that paying Promotions and Paid Advertising can help you. The success of Paid Promotions and Paid Advertising depends on the quality of the material you put out there. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The less work you have to do, the better off you&#8217;ll be. It&#8217;s not always easy to write an article, but if you&#8217;re doing it well and putting out high-quality content, it will make your Paid Promotions and Paid Advertising efforts more successful.</span></p>\n<h3>Search Engine Optimization for Startup Business</h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The most effective and cost-effective SEO optimization approach that will generate more traffic to your website is Search Engine Optimization. It is mainly a marketing plan that is driven by search engines to generate relevant traffic to your website.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\"> In this process, keywords or key phrases are associated with each page of your website to make it search engine friendly. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The idea is to make your site to be easily found by the search engines and also to bring about a targeted audience to your website. The best way to attract such visitors is through the use of rich media such as graphics, videos, voice over Internet applications, and animated images.</span></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171572\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO-300x182.jpg\" alt=\"startup business\" width=\"506\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO-300x182.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO-260x158.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Although search engine optimization is essential to the success of any website, this also comes with a price. To sustain this for a long time, you need to make use of the best practices of Search Engine Optimization. SEO includes the use of appropriate keywords, appropriate meta-tags, and the use of proper content on your website. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The content consists of all the essential information that is related to your business, product, or service. The SEO strategies should be taken into consideration as the process of SEO is at the forefront of the competition of search engines.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The first step for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">Search Engine Optimization</a> is research. You need to have a high level of competency to conduct a search engine optimization campaign. SEO is basically to get an understanding of what is on the mind of the search engines. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">There are many resources available for free that can provide you with the knowledge to carry out the process of Search Engine Optimization. Some of these are those that offer training. Once you have this knowledge, then you can proceed with the process of Search Engine Optimization.</span></p>\n<h3>Content Marketing</h3>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">If you are a blogger, marketer, or a freelance writer, you should be careful with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/20/how-to-scale-your-content-marketing/\">content marketing</a>. You might be losing clients by writing lousy content for your business. There are three ways to find out what the search engines think about your content. The first is by reading the Google manual that shows you how to find out what the search engines say about your content. You will also find that there are a lot of mistakes in the content of many blogs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">Another way to find out what the search engines think about your content is to have your own content analyzed. You should be aware that most content management companies do not analyze your content for you, but they do suggest improvements for you. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The best way to go about this is to find a company that specializes in this and employ them to write a blog post for you. They will tell you exactly what you should change about your content.</span></p>\n<h4>Content Strategy</h4>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">You can also use a service that will analyze the content of your business and send you an email when there is a problem with the content. It sounds far fetched, but you might find that the content management expert had seen similar issues before. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">The best thing about it is that you do not have to worry about the time it takes to do it yourself. You can ask them to rewrite the content for you for a little over $20 per article. Do a little research before employing a content management company. </span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; text-align: start; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #222222;\">A third option is to do it yourself, but I am afraid you will be writing content that is never going to be seen by many people because most people have no idea what the term content marketing means.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/20/the-best-digital-marketing-strategies-for-startup-businesses/\">The Best Digital Marketing Strategies for Startup Businesses</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 15:00:49 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses.jpg","linkMd5":"278c1f1288f90f3ee120780cec6b92cc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-128_7bc69f5bb6d07178.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":27434,"destBytes":22150,"author":"Sahin Alom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Best-Digital-Marketing-Strategies-for-Startup-Businesses-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn24@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-18-998_c6c8936b692f7f3d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AI-Change-the-Future-of-SEO-300x182.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-09-886_8317a242c7cc0886.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195871186},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"Brands Flock to Voice Search as 2020 Goes “Contactless”","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173502","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/brands-flock-to-voice-search-as-2020-goes-contactless/\" title=\"Brands Flock to Voice Search as 2020 Goes “Contactless”\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"voice search 2020\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>As businesses in every industry scramble to improvise “contactless” strategies for interacting with customers and delivering products and services.  The adoption of voice search technology <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/brand-playbook/how-use-voice-tech-during-covid-19/2260006\">has rapidly accelerated</a> for everything from internet searches and shopping to ordering food from a table in a restaurant. Here is how brands flock to voice search as 2020 goes &#8220;contastless.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Whether a business is completely virtual or maintains brick and mortar locations, it seems clear that voice technology will alter the business model much sooner than previously thought.</h4>\n<p>Every industry from food to financial services to retail and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/21/is-voice-search-the-next-big-travel-technology-trend/\">even travel</a> are being impacted by voice search. Voice search may even be a solution to the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/17/why-our-supply-chain-failed-us-during-the-pandemic/\">supply chain problems</a> that embroiled the country during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of brands paid little, if any, attention to their identity and positioning on voice search.</p>\n<p>Even fewer were embracing voice technology that transformed their fulfillment and delivery processes. Peter Peng, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.jetson.ai/\">Jetson</a>, which helps brands build their voice search presence, has seen a surge in companies pivoting to voice in light of COVID: “The global pandemic has changed the way that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/12/new-niches-for-startups-created-by-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">people shop and do business</a>. Virus-related restrictions have led to increased demand for ‘touchless technology’ — or e-commerce options that employ technology allowing consumers to maximize their shopping experience while minimizing physical contact and the need to touch screens.”</p>\n<p>As we look to the future of a world filled with less “touch”, it’s important for every company to at least review how their <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/14/biotechnology-benefits-and-risks-at-a-glance/\">brand is represented</a> even during a simple voice search, and whether their brand is even searchable at all.</p>\n<h3><b>Voice Could Become a Windfall for Fast Movers</b></h3>\n<p>It’s important to remember that every major shift in the industry throughout the centuries has brought with it even more opportunity than cost.</p>\n<p>The competition for attention through voice search is currently significantly less dense than it will be in another two to three years when there is higher adoption from brands. According to Peng, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/24/how-logistics-leaders-can-use-ai-right-now/\">brands adopting voice technology</a> quickly will have the first-mover advantage which will lead to better placement in search results and higher customer acquisition, especially for smaller brands.</p>\n<p>Says Pend, “Right now, relatively few small businesses are offering voice ordering. That means that if your business is proactive about getting on board with what we call the “voice revolution,” you’re far more likely to get top billing on voice search results.”</p>\n<p><strong>To take advantage of the &#8220;contactless future&#8221; a brand should be looking at two key questions: </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can I optimize my presence to be found via voice search? Which is to say, do you have a voice search profile and is it consistent with the rest of your branding?</li>\n<li>How can I offer a voice solution for actually purchasing and receiving my product or service? Are we currently selling any of our products directly on voice assistant tools (ie. Amazon Alexa)?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What Industry is Seeing the Fastest Voice Tech Switch?</h3>\n<p>We also asked Peter which industry he has seen the fastest growth of voice technology in. His response? Food. “Without a doubt, the food industry has been one of the fastest-growing areas for voice ordering. Jetson boasts over 10,000 food-related vendors on our platform.”</p>\n<p>Indeed as many cities begin allowing restaurants to reopen, voice technology for placing orders at your table seems to be an integral part of keeping both employees and customers safe.</p>\n<h3><b>Where to Start with Voice</b></h3>\n<p>For brands who have not yet explored a voice strategy and are now forced to adapt rapidly, understanding the technology and process may appear daunting. Peter Peng recommends starting with strategy before getting lost in the tactical implementation: “The first step would be to consider your company’s long-term goals. What do you want for your company, and how could voice search and voice commerce be part of that plan?”</p>\n<h4>How Does Voice Fit Your Plan?</h4>\n<p>Once you know how voice technology fits into your overall business strategy (ie, will you only be implementing a voice search identity or also using voice technology in other areas of order fulfillment, customer service, etc), you can tackle each component individually.</p>\n<p>There are a number of tools available, including Jetson, that streamline the process of creating a brand’s “voice profile” and optimizing it for maximum searchability and lead generation while making it affordable for businesses of all sizes. Being able to sell your products directly on voice assistant platforms also creates a new stream of revenue that many ecommerce players currently overlook.</p>\n<h4>The next step is to tackle your brand identity on voice search as quickly as possible.</h4>\n<p>Consumers are not waiting for brands to adapt, they are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/02/how-voice-search-is-changing-the-future-of-shopping/\">already flocking to voice search</a> at a higher rate than ever due to the unique circumstances of the times. Neglecting your voice search identity could be costing business money each day. Making sure your brand is searchable and optimized for maximum placement is the first priority to tackle.</p>\n<h3><b>Avoid Being Intimidated by Larger Brands Already Doing Voice</b></h3>\n<p>Peng points out that the biggest mistake most companies make is shying away from <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/02/how-voice-search-is-changing-the-future-of-shopping/\">voice search</a> because of the intimidating capabilities of larger brands. “A lot of companies will see big corporations like Wal-Mart or Starbucks offering voice-powered commerce options and will think, ‘oh, that’s cool, but they’re a lot bigger than me. Or maybe, &#8220;I can’t afford to invest in voice technology.’” Indeed the costs of voice capability for ecommerce have reduced significantly with the proliferation of technology and tools that make it a viable option for anybody.</p>\n<h3>Media planning company, Comscore, predicted that by 2020, 50% of all online searches will be voice.</h3>\n<p>That prediction was made prior to the pandemic that accelerated the trend further. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/07/impact-of-voice-search-on-seo-rankings-in-2020-5-tips-to-optimize/\">benefits of optimizing your brand</a> for voice technology run the gamut from increased exposure and online traffic to shortening your sales cycle. The sales cycle now makes it easier for customers to buy from your brand to even demonstrating your commitment to customer safety and concerns during uncertain times.</p>\n<p>Many services, including Jetson, even make it seamless for a brand to list and sell products directly on voice assistant platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Voice, and others, and they’ll facilitate the sale and process the payments for you.</p>\n<h4>Adapting to the shift to voice technology quickly will level the playing field for companies of all sizes.</h4>\n<p>All companies or varying sizes will be able to gain the first-mover advantage and secure valuable real estate that will become increasingly competitive just twelve months from now. Making the investment at a lower cost now is likely what is going to set apart the most visible brands of the future.</p>\n<p>Image Credit: alleksana; Pexels</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/brands-flock-to-voice-search-as-2020-goes-contactless/\">Brands Flock to Voice Search as 2020 Goes “Contactless”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 14:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D.jpg","linkMd5":"f936e74ed46a154096c6a4c619dd005a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-833_f0906d0a2bdd3921.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":853,"sourceBytes":65791,"destBytes":34754,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brands-Flock-to-Voice-Search-as-2020-Goes-%E2%80%9CContactless%E2%80%9D-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-12-435_307cc20e1418755b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874681},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"5 Post-Pandemic Changes to Expect in the Workplace","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171325","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/09/5-post-pandemic-changes-to-expect-in-the-workplace/\" title=\"5 Post-Pandemic Changes to Expect in the Workplace\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"changes in workplace\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Disrupting businesses in every sector of the economy and infecting nearly 7 million people at the time of this writing &#8212; with 400,000 deaths globally. The coronavirus pandemic that sprung up December 2019 has had negative <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/22/from-polarization-to-open-learning-how-technology-can-help-us-beyond-covid-19/\">effects on businesses across the world</a>, and the economy as a whole.</p>\n<p>The stay-at-home orders that have been mandatory in several countries have caused our work lives to be affected in so many ways, from working in open offices and interacting with coworkers daily to working from home and having to rely on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/3-ways-you-can-empower-your-remote-employees/\">video conferencing apps</a> for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/29/how-iot-embraces-smart-communication/\">effective communication</a>.</p>\n<p>These many changes in our current work-life have left many of us wondering whether it&#8217;ll have any lasting effects on our work-lives once the pandemic is over and the current lockdown measures are eased. How will how our new work lives proceed from here?</p>\n<p>The many effects the pandemic will have on our current work-life include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Higher Prioritization of workers&#8217; health.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The current attention that employee well-being has been garnered recently by organizations and employees themselves will surely increase. We will surely see employee health, wellness, and well-being being of greater importance in a post-pandemic situation.</p>\n<p>We can predict more sick day allowances and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/5-healthcare-tech-trends-worth-keeping-an-eye-on/\">health initiatives </a>like the full health checks and examination of employees before they enter their workplaces.</p>\n<p>After the pandemic and for a short period of time, signs may be posted to remind everyone to wash hands and perhaps limit how they give handshakes and hugs, and to maintain personal space.</p>\n<p>To avoid overcrowding, keycards and sensors will monitor your whereabouts throughout the day and alert you whenever you&#8217;re in close proximity to another individual.</p>\n<p>In the long run, contact-tracing apps for co-workers may also become part of the work-life experience to avoid the spread of future diseases and infrared body temperature scanners before access to the office building. These <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/big-data-as-a-double-edged-sword-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/\">contact-tracing apps</a> might even show areas with high coworker traffic similar to apps like Waze.com.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Remote work</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/18/how-to-achieve-tech-powered-collaboration-in-the-era-of-remote-work/\">role in-office collaboration</a> has to play in a company is overwhelming as it is important for building personal bonds and relationships between coworkers and boosting employee productivity, it is also essential for the creation of company culture, but what is more important is the safety of an organization’s employees.</p>\n<p>The importance of remote working at a time like this has shown as many organizations have looked too remote working as a means of sustaining their businesses and to keep them up and running.</p>\n<p>In a post-pandemic situation, it&#8217;s likely that we see the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/how-to-ensure-high-productivity-of-your-remote-workers/\">retention of remote working</a> as a means of working for non-essential workers by organizations. However, office and in-house collaboration are surely not going away and higher-ranking workers may still work in-house.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Restructuring of office spaces.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fundamental design of office workspaces and offices will surely be altered. More personal space, elevator capacity limits, and demarcating spots to stand in elevators to limit physical contact.</p>\n<p>More <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/15/5-work-culture-trends-that-improve-employee-productivity-and-satisfaction/\">space between desks</a> with coworkers sitting on every other seat, partitioning may be installed to reduce the risk of spreading diseases, fewer chairs in conference rooms, private cubicles or offices, there&#8217;s an endless list of how the overall design of the office space might evolve in a post-pandemic situation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Business travel and conferencing.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic will definitely have a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/30/building-a-startup-culture-that-encourages-wellness/\">lasting effect on meetings</a> as a whole, we should expect fewer conferences and curtailed travel plans in the post-pandemic era. Essential meetings will still hold, but ones with lesser importance will be moved to emails, phone calls, and video conferences.</p>\n<p>We should expect employees will only have physical meetings when a project is crucial and cannot be done via video conferencing. Conferences, meetings, and conventions will be halted for the foreseeable future with meetings that aren&#8217;t necessary would now be done with video conferencing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Work shifts and office hours.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations will have gradual returns and might not require most people to come back until there’s widespread testing, treatment, or a vaccine. Work shifts might be put in place to ensure there&#8217;s a limited amount of employees in the workplace at any given time.</p>\n<p>Limiting the number or set of people required to come to the office has been important for employee safety as it reduces the chances of them getting the disease. Only requiring essential workers to come to the office might be the norm in a post-pandemic situation.</p>\n<h5><b>In Conclusion</b></h5>\n<p>How business around the world is going to be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/06/deep-work-vs-shallow-work-how-your-distracted-habits-could-cost-you-your-career-in-the-new-economy/\">changed due to the current global pandemic</a> is unknown as we cannot predict the future with a 100 percent accuracy but by making educated guesses we might know how the impacts of the pandemic might shape our work life.</p>\n<p>Workplaces may have significant changes in the long run, these may include new seating arrangements and the addition of building materials that discourage the spread of germs.</p>\n<p>In order to reduce the risk of spreading future diseases, it&#8217;s a great time for new technology and innovation. We will need to be provided with access to rooms and elevators without employees having to physically touch a handle or press a button. Innovations in automatic door sensors, automatic sinks, soap dispensers, and maybe even voice-activated elevators.</p>\n<p>Measures will surely be put in place to reduce the spread of any future diseases and pandemics to guarantee the general public and employee safety.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Andrea Piacquadio; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/09/5-post-pandemic-changes-to-expect-in-the-workplace/\">5 Post-Pandemic Changes to Expect in the Workplace</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 18:00:16 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace.jpeg","linkMd5":"d4820fff60fdb523149b23e848d38b35","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-412_5a353fe7ffb2796c.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":41495,"destBytes":34796,"author":"Misan Etchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Post-Pandemic-Changes-to-Expect-in-the-Workplace-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-237_d75766c8f6a4a31e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195876045},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"What is the Future of SMS Marketing?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171689","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/what-is-the-future-of-sms-marketing/\" title=\"What is the Future of SMS Marketing?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"future of sms marketing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Over the past two decades, SMS marketing has become so ingrained in our lives that we don’t even pause to consider what life was like without it. Despite that, marketers still don’t regard the platform as highly as email or social media marketing. What a mistake. Here is what the future of SMS marketing is all about.</p>\n<h3>Fundamental channels for digital marketing.</h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/14/4-email-personalization-tactics-that-are-sure-to-get-clicks/\">email has long been a fundamental</a> channel for digital marketing campaigns. The hype around social media marketing is well deserved, if only for its powerful targeting and personalization capabilities.</p>\n<p>SMS marketing, on the other hand, offers <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/06/guerrilla-marketing-growth-hacking-your-startup/\">equally valuable yet unsung benefits</a> for marketing communications. If you’ve hesitated to adopt <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/19/if-you-arent-using-sms-in-your-business-nows-the-time-to-start/\">text messaging as a marketing channel</a>, perhaps it’s the best time to reconsider.</p>\n<h2><b>Why It’s the Best Time to Adopt SMS Marketing</b></h2>\n<p>Although SMS is now considered as a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/01/how-to-enhance-your-omnichannel-strategy-with-sms-messaging/\">powerful addition to an omnichannel strategy</a>, it wasn’t always an attractive digital marketing platform. It was too expensive for marketers to take it seriously. Plus, it lacked any semblance of a playbook, which email already had.</p>\n<p>Today’s digital landscape, however, has paved the way for text messaging to be a marketing platform that’s not just viable but actually worthwhile. In particular, these changes have driven its success as a medium for marketing:</p>\n<h3><b>Peak Mobile Penetration</b></h3>\n<p>The first SMS-ready mobile phone was introduced to the market in 1993. But, the rapid adoption of mobile phones came towards the late 90s as cellular networks became more stable and even allowed cross-network messaging.</p>\n<p><strong>By 2000, 12% of the world’s population</strong><strong> had mobile phones, and that number has consistently increased since the</strong>n.</p>\n<p>Today, there are over five billion unique mobile subscribers worldwide. The stat means over 65% of people all over the world have a mobile device of some kind.</p>\n<p>Although the number of smartphone users is increasing steadily, approximately <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/\">30% of mobile subscribers</a> don’t have a smartphone with internet access. But, each one is capable of receiving text messages.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_171691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-171691\" style=\"width: 719px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-171691 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-719x719.png\" alt=\"SMS examples\" width=\"719\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-719x719.png 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-300x300.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-160x160.png 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-40x40.png 40w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-60x60.png 60w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples.png 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-171691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>SMS examples with different country codes.</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3><b>Development of Regulations</b></h3>\n<p>In the early days of SMS marketing, there were barely any regulations to guide marketers in using it appropriately. It was essentially a free-for-all platform for any business that could afford to use it. Spam was prevalent and branded text messages were considered a nuisance.</p>\n<h4>Data Privacy Regulations</h4>\n<p>Several regulations have already been developed and widely accepted across the world to encourage not only respectful practices but also data privacy protection.</p>\n<p>These regulations have made people more open to receiving promotional text messages. In fact, nowadays, 75% of consumers say they don’t mind getting texts from brands for as long as they opt in.</p>\n<h3><b>Lower Costs</b></h3>\n<p>In the early 2000s, a single SMS could cost anywhere from ten to twenty cents, depending on the operator. For businesses engaged in mass texting, the costs quickly piled up. But, over time, costs were driven down by several factors. Not the least of which was the popularity of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and instant messaging software like Viber and Messenger.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, there are innumerable marketing packages that make SMS a cost-effective platform. Some of them could even bring costs down to one cent per text. Keywords and shortcodes involve additional costs.</p>\n<p>Keywords are unique phrases that your customers can use to interact with your company while shortcodes are the numbers to which those keywords are sent. In the text “Send HELP to 66586,” HELP is the keyword and 66586 is the shortcode.</p>\n<p>In the past, a business looking to seriously engage in SMS marketing would need to make use of dedicated shortcodes, which allow for unlimited use of keywords. Those could cost anywhere from fifteen to thirty thousand dollars per year. Nowadays, there are mobile marketing firms that share shortcodes across multiple businesses through a keyword rental model. Each keyword rental could cost anywhere from five to twenty-five dollars per month.</p>\n<h3><b>Software Advancements</b></h3>\n<p>Earlier, the SMS gateways that enabled computers to send, receive, and manage text messages were physical appliances that merely allowed marketers to ramp up their text messaging efficiency. Nowadays, SMS gateway applications allow you to do all that without the cost of procuring specialized hardware.</p>\n<p>Advancements in marketing applications have also led to the wide acceptance of SMS as a marketing medium. While there are SMS-specific apps for businesses with limited needs, there is also powerful software that allows you to manage entire marketing campaigns across multiple channels, all using a single platform. Using such applications, you can use SMS as part of an omnichannel strategy alongside email, social media, and search advertising.</p>\n<h3><b>Omnichannel Adoption</b></h3>\n<p>In recent years, consumers have shown a clear preference for omnichannel brand communications. Not only are purchase rates higher for companies that use three or more channels, but retention rates are also much higher. While businesses available on only a single channel keep approximately 33% of their customers, retention rates are as high as 89% for companies with omnichannel engagement.</p>\n<p>There’s no denying that a large part of the success of omnichannel campaigns is the proper use of SMS marketing. Not only are consumers more willing to receive text messages from businesses, but those who opt into SMS along with other channels are much more likely to convert. This rapid adoption and undeniably positive acceptance of omnichannel marketing make the future of SMS even more exciting.</p>\n<h2><b>The Benefits of SMS Marketing</b></h2>\n<p>Advancements in the digital marketing landscape have definitely paved the way for SMS to be a valuable marketing platform. To brands and marketers, these are the most significant benefits that are unique to the medium:</p>\n<h3><b>It Doesn’t Require an Internet Connection</b></h3>\n<p>Unlike email, it doesn’t take an internet connection or even a smartphone to receive text messages. That means your customers will receive your message no matter where they are and what kind of phone they’re using. In the US, that gives you access to<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/\"> 96% of the total adult population</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>It is a Widely Accepted Medium</b></h3>\n<p>A vast majority of digital consumers are eighteen to forty-nine years old. Of them, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/\">99% have access to SMS-enabled mobile devices</a>. But, the success of SMS marketing is not only because of cellphone penetration but also the acceptance of texting as a natural means of communication. In fact, among Americans younger than fifty, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/179288/new-era-communication-americans.aspx\">text messaging is the most popular form of communication</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>It is Always Within Reach</b></h3>\n<p>According to research by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/#53e7aee37475\">Morgan Stanley</a>, 91% of adults keep their mobile devices within reach at all times. In fact, Americans check their phones <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/\">every 12 minutes</a> while they’re awake. That means the average American engages with their cellphone about 80 times a day.</p>\n<h3><b>It is Easy to Consume</b></h3>\n<p>Since phones are always within reach and text messages are typically around 160 characters long, marketing messages on SMS are easily consumed. That is probably the reason why it enjoys open rates of over 98%. In contrast, email open rates average 14% across all industries. Additionally, about 90% of text messages are read within the first three minutes of receipt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171692 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics.png\" alt=\"SMS statistics\" width=\"816\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics.png 816w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics-300x154.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics-260x133.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px\" /></a></p>\n<h3><b>SMS Messaging Encourages Quick Responses</b></h3>\n<p>Because text messages are easy to consume, recipients are also more likely to respond. In fact, the average <a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/infographics/email-marketing-vs-sms-marketing-stats-infographic-02021390\">response rate for SMS is 45%</a> while email response is only 6%.</p>\n<p>SMS is also the preferred means of receiving coupons intended for both online and in-store redemption because of its convenience. In fact, redemption rates for SMS-based coupons are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/#53e7aee37475\">ten times higher</a> than printed versions.</p>\n<h2><b>The Benefits of Combining SMS With Other Channels</b></h2>\n<p>Email has been the long-established medium for digital marketing. It isn’t going anywhere, no matter how prevalent SMS marketing becomes. But, text messages differ vastly from emails not only in format but also in how they are consumed. For that reason, SMS undoubtedly has its own role to play in a truly omnichannel marketing campaign.</p>\n<p>While email excels because of its ability to communicate extensive and dynamic content, it can’t beat the timeliness of SMS. That makes text messaging the perfect complement to email. Time-sensitive offers, for example, perform best on SMS. Text messaging is also an effective way to drive your audiences to your email content.</p>\n<p>SMS and email make up the critical platforms of an omnichannel campaign. But, it doesn’t really end there. Depending on the nature of your business and the needs of your audience, using these two platforms alongside others like push notifications, social media, search advertising allows you to be truly omnipresent without being invasive.</p>\n<p>By combining available platforms and allowing each one to play their own roles, you’re able to provide seamless customer experiences that enhance both sales and brand affinity.</p>\n<h2><b>SMS Marketing is Bound to Become More Valuable</b></h2>\n<p>Though SMS has undoubtedly proven its worth as a marketing channel, changes and improvements that will inevitably come will make it an even more effective channel. Some of them might include:</p>\n<h3><b>Improvements in Personalization</b></h3>\n<p>As it integrates more seamlessly with other channels and becomes ingrained in more business processes, SMS marketing will enjoy a broader scope of data. Add to that the inevitable advancements in artificial intelligence and marketers will clamor over SMS for the extent to which they can personalize messages.</p>\n<p>More data and targeting options also mean better automation capabilities. Marketers will be able to set more specific triggers, and machine learning capabilities can lead to even more personalized campaigns. With SMS’ current performance as a marketing medium, these advancements in personalization and automation will undoubtedly lead to even more improved engagement rates and, ultimately, better sales.</p>\n<h3><b>Developments as a Primary Support Channel</b></h3>\n<p>Through AI-driven enhancements, SMS could become the primary means by which customers can access support. Today, chatbots can already accurately answer frequently asked questions. As they become more informed and more intuitive, they could be integrated into more business processes that will inevitably enhance customer experiences.</p>\n<p>Imagine entering a busy boutique and finding a top you like but not in the size you wear. Instead of waiting for your turn to ask the sales associate to check for your size, you could simply send a text message and receive a response in an instant. As SMS bots become even more integrated into business processes, they could even instruct sales associates to pull out the item you asked for, track you down within the store, and assist you through the rest of the buying process.</p>\n<h3><b>Usefulness in Various Industries</b></h3>\n<p>SMS marketing is currently most beneficial to ecommerce businesses. But, innovative marketers are quickly finding new applications for it and open up possibilities to harness its power in non-traditional ways.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon, its benefits as a medium will encourage more and more industries to adopt it. That, in turn, will further contribute to its wide acceptance and performance as a marketing platform.</p>\n<h3><b>Integration With More Channels</b></h3>\n<p>The most common way to use SMS is to complement email campaigns. With thoughtful planning and preparation, some of the more advanced marketers also successfully use it alongside other channels like push notifications, instant messaging, social media, and search.</p>\n<p>However, through data-driven insights and advancements in software, SMS should soon integrate more seamlessly with a wider variety of channels in order to provide a truly personal and cohesive experience that’s consistent across all platforms.</p>\n<p>Today, some of the most powerful marketing software are already making some of these scenarios possible. Nevertheless, apps will continue improving and further increase SMS’ value.</p>\n<h2><b>Best Use of SMS Marketing</b></h2>\n<p>Businesses have adopted SMS for a wide variety of applications. Here are some of the best ways to use text messaging effectively:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Post-Purchase Notifications: </b>The period after a shopper completes a purchase is crucial to customer retention. Apart from a comprehensive confirmation email, send them SMS alerts as you process their order, ship their item, and confirm that they have received their package. Doing so will make a second purchase much more likely.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Time-Sensitive Alerts: </b>The short format of text messages and the proximity of mobile phones to its users make it the perfect medium for time-sensitive information that you want your audiences to act on right away. These include product launches, sales promotions, and other limited-time offers or events.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Gift Distribution: </b>Impressive redemption rates make SMS an ideal platform for distributing digital coupons and virtual gifts. With marketing automation platforms, you can even send gifts automatically through relevant triggers like birthday and purchase milestones.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Customer Support: </b>The quick and direct nature of SMS makes it an excellent option for providing fantastic customer service. SMS bots can receive and answer basic questions and then escalate more complex or sensitive concerns to a highly trained support team. That allows support teams to focus only on critical issues while giving all customers access to timely assistance.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Accessing Information: </b>Apart from providing assistance, you can use SMS to offer quick and easy access to information. Practical applications include confirming availability, providing store locations, and offering product recommendations.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Drive to Site: </b>Through SMS, you can drive your customers to your site to boost traffic, promote new content, or get them to re-engage. This is especially useful for users that haven’t visited in a long time and have stopped opening emails.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Order Placements: </b>If you have limited SKUs, SMS could be a good way to accept orders. When fully automated, this could provide an effortless ordering experience to your customers, which could lead to better retention and more sales.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Appointment Setting &#38; Reminders: </b>Businesses can allow their customers to book appointments via SMS. You can use the same platform to automatically send appointment reminders.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Identity Verification Processes: </b>Two-factor authorization via SMS is not a new concept. But, as data privacy and security becomes more imperative to the success of businesses, more industries will surely adopt text messaging for identity verification.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Feedback Gathering: </b>Remarkable SMS response rates also make it an excellent platform for feedback gathering. Through text messages, you can ask your customers to answer simple surveys. You can even use SMS bots to ask questions as a human market researcher would.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>The current success of SMS marketing shows that it is here to stay. As <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/22/predictive-analytics-how-to-turbocharge-your-digital-marketing-strategy/\">brands’ innovative use of the channel</a> drives its growth and wide acceptance, it should become even more valuable. Ultimately, it will take its rightful place alongside email as an indispensable medium for marketing communications.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/what-is-the-future-of-sms-marketing/\">What is the Future of SMS Marketing?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 20:01:05 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing.png","linkMd5":"9ebb0de06cec7b54354299acb2bbf942","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-27-287_bc98a7a3cac2b337.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":387516,"destBytes":15342,"author":"Laura Narusyte","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/What-is-the-Future-of-SMS-Marketing-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-14-195_ac9540194fd24b8b.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-examples-719x719.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-973_37309b0a13befd8f.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMS-statistics.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-10-782_f63b2f87262ce9f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874397},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:01","title":"5 Ways Technology is Transforming the Real Estate Industry","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168389","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/19/5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-real-estate-industry/\" title=\"5 Ways Technology is Transforming the Real Estate Industry\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"&#34;real estate&#34;\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>As the Internet becomes more ingrained in every facet of our work and personal lives, industries that primarily rely on person-to-person interactions have started to adopt new technology. Adopting new technology allows companies to free up valuable time and resources for future development. Here are five ways technology is transforming the real estate industry.</p>\n<h3>Some fields have begun state-of-the-art technology adoption more slowly than others.</h3>\n<p>One market that’s been slow to change is the real estate industry &#8212; but under the surface, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/the-challenges-and-opportunities-for-automation-in-the-real-estate-industry/\">high tech is completely transforming</a> the industry.</p>\n<h3><strong>The real estate industry is massive.</strong></h3>\n<p>In the United States alone, the land and housing market <a href=\"https://realtyna.com/blog/how-big-is-real-estate-industry/\">contributes over $2.7 trillion</a> each year to the U.S. economy. Tech companies see the potential of this market and are developing products that help buyers, sellers, and investment firms. Here are five of the most innovative ways that technology is helping real estate professionals and their customers right now.</p>\n<h2><b>1. Repetitive Task Management</b></h2>\n<p>Realtors often fill out the same paperwork over and over across multiple properties. That eats into valuable time that could be spent networking, working leads on social media, or researching new properties. Entrepreneurs have studied these inefficiencies, looking to create products that automate redundancies.</p>\n<p>According to Roy Dekel, CEO of real estate software company <a href=\"http://www.setschedule.com/\">SetSchedule</a>, task automation is becoming increasingly critical for real estate transactions. &#8220;We see these technologies throughout the real estate ecosystem. They include email and drip campaigns for marketing, automated appointment scheduling, technologies that target and communicate with prospects, and even automation in the commercial space with portfolio management. These small process changes can make a huge difference in business strategy, prioritization, efficiency, and service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Using these small process changes to create a robust difference in strategy is especially true for asset management research. Asset management research usually involves finding the monetary value of every property in a <a href=\"https://jboitnott.com/the-cost-of-home-ownership-and-where-youre-probably-overspending/\">real estate</a> company’s portfolio and creating informative spreadsheets of that data. Tech companies have made tools that continuously monitor these property valuations, updating information in near-real-time without manual input.</p>\n<h2><b>2. Online Real Estate Marketplaces</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/real-estate-vs-stocks-which-has-a-better-return/\">Real estate</a> markets have always relied on in-person meetings between brokers and potential buyers. But technology has allowed for online marketplaces to be relatively secure and trustworthy, even for industries like real estate. Online marketplaces make it easy to see a list of all the homes that fit your preferences without leaving your living room.</p>\n<p>These sites provide things like virtual tours that you can view on your smartphone. Even better, some of these marketplaces don’t even require interactions with in-person real estate agents at any point during the process. Tech-enabled brokers let people buy with the assistance of a broker but without the steep commission fees.</p>\n<h2><b>3. Price Refinement</b></h2>\n<p>Brokers often rely on just a few neighborhood-level factors and house features to make price estimations for properties. But with technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and precise mathematical modeling, they can estimate prices more accurately than before.</p>\n<p>These upgraded models take into account everything from historical crime statistics to noise levels and nearby markets and schools. Experts like Bernard Marr, a futurist and technology adviser for businesses across the world, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/02/03/the-top-proptech-trends-6-technologies-disrupting-the-property-and-real-estate-industry/\">believe that</a> usage of this tech will let homebuyers make more intelligent real estate purchases in the future.</p>\n<h2><b>4. Smart Devices for Property Management</b></h2>\n<p>The Internet of Things is the collection of non-personal computer devices connected to the Internet. This includes everything from Google Home and Amazon Alexa to smart sensors that don’t require human input to transmit data. These devices are just starting to be integrated into rental properties. They provide unique opportunities for tenants and landlords to transform the landscape of property management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/04/the-key-to-smart-home-success-safety-and-security/\">Smart doorbells and locks</a> give tenants enhanced security by seeing exactly who’s at the door without having to go near that door. They also give landlords a way to monitor potential security risks. Smart thermostats intelligently change the temperature in rental units, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/04/3-ways-you-can-benefit-from-smart-home-technology-today/\">lowering heating and cooling costs</a> significantly while maintaining the right temperature for tenants.</p>\n<h2><b>5. Personalized, Targeted Real Estate Ads</b></h2>\n<p>High-end customers might do a home search in a certain area but can&#8217;t find exactly what they want. Ad tech is changing this, however. With ad management know-how, real estate brokers can now target perfect customers for new on-the-market homes.</p>\n<p>Experts like John Hall, co-founder of scheduling app Calendar and marketing expert, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/john-hall/as-industry-transforms-marketers-must-become-visionaries.html\">believe that</a> personalized ads will change how real estate marketing is done. For example, you might target ads based on several bathrooms, proximity to other houses, and other metrics.</p>\n<p>The real estate industry has historically been slow to change. However, with cost-effective technology not only helping real estate agents and brokers but also homebuyers, space is adapting faster than ever. Moreover, whether it&#8217;s machine learning algorithms or innovative software, real estate is entering a new era that may bring more profit for everyone.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/19/5-ways-technology-is-transforming-the-real-estate-industry/\">5 Ways Technology is Transforming the Real Estate Industry</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:00:38 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry.jpg","linkMd5":"1328c3d4cacaf35969275b04e9a5c54f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-24-989_cb1ee2d9daba612d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":74230,"destBytes":80728,"author":"John Boitnott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Ways-Technology-is-Transforming-the-Real-Estate-Industry-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-24-509_2ef8f2109e2d544d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195881449},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"How Display Ads Got Smart—and Keep Getting Smarter","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175802","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/12/how-display-ads-got-smart-and-keep-getting-smarter/\" title=\"How Display Ads Got Smart—and Keep Getting Smarter\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Display-Ads-Got-Smart-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"How Display Ads Got Smart—and Keep Getting Smarter\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Display-Ads-Got-Smart-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Display-Ads-Got-Smart-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Display-Ads-Got-Smart.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Advertising has been an embedded feature of our world for many decades now, providing brands with the opportunity to introduce new products to consumers and giving consumers a chance to discover new products. But over the years, advertising has evolved considerably. Today’s advertisers have access to an abundance of different platforms, analytics tools, and potential approaches to use to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/12/06/how_to_make_ads_that_dont_suck/\">get their target market’s attention</a>, and consumers oftentimes encounter advertising where they least expect it—or don’t even notice when they’re being advertised to.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting areas of development in this field has been with display ads. In just a couple of decades, display ads have gone from being a straightforward way to advertise on the internet to one of the most sophisticated and “smartest” forms of advertising in the world.</p>\n<p>So how did display ads get “smart,” and how could they get smarter from here?</p>\n<h3>Display Ads: The Basics</h3>\n<p>Let’s start with <a href=\"https://www.marceldigital.com/blog/what-is-display-advertising-a-display-ads-101\">a briefer on display advertising</a>. Display advertising refers to targeted advertisements that are used to promote a product, service, or brand; these ads are distributed across a wide network of different “publisher” websites, usually making an appearance in the headers, in sidebars, and in other locations. Display ads can come in many forms; you’ve likely seen a mix of text-based ads, images, and videos as you’ve browsed the web. Additionally, display ads come in different shapes and sizes; you’ve likely encountered some dominating ads that practically take over the rest of the page, and you’ve likely missed some innocuous ads that were hard to notice.</p>\n<p>There are many different display advertising “networks” that advertisers can leverage to promote their brand. Google’s Display Network is one of the largest, reaching 90 percent of all internet users across millions of different websites and blogs. With a set budget and the right advertising material, you can easily put together a campaign from scratch and start advertising. Most display advertising partners will charge you based on the number of clicks your ad generates, with a set “cost per click” (CPC) based on your industry, your competition, and your targets.</p>\n<p>The quality and accessibility of display ads have increased dramatically since their inception. In other words, display ads have gotten “smart.” But what factors have led to these developments, and what kinds of developments could we see in the future?</p>\n<h3>Factors Pushing for Display Advertising Advancement</h3>\n<p>Why have display ads become more sophisticated? We can consider these push factors as influencing their development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Profitability. </strong>Traditional forms of advertising have been expensive; you have to pay money to erect a billboard or print and distribute a flyer. But in the digital space, placement is relatively cheap. Tech companies and publishers can charge for advertising space without excessive costs, offering low prices to advertisers while still making a decent profit for themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Mutual gains.</strong> Every link in the display advertising chain gets some kind of benefit. Advertisers can tap into a vast network they otherwise wouldn’t be able to touch. Display ad networks get to make a stream of income. Publishers can generate revenue from their popular online content. And consumers get to see ads for things that are important to them.</li>\n<li><strong>Audience expansion.</strong> The internet has grown remarkably in the past three decades, with millions of new popular websites and billions of new users to browse them. Over the years, display advertising has been accessible to a bigger and bigger audience. Accordingly, the potential money to be made has increased.</li>\n<li><strong>Ties to other technology.</strong> Display ad networks are often tied into other forms of advanced technology. For example, if your company hosts websites for millions of users, incorporating advertising into those websites is relatively easy; this is why <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2007/08/20/text_and_banner_ads_on_amazon/\">major tech brands like Amazon</a>, Google, and Facebook have all gotten into the display advertising game.</li>\n<li><strong>Display ad competition.</strong> Of course, there are dozens of major players in the display advertising market, and thousands of other significant options to choose from. This fierce competition drives innovation, and forces companies to invest in new technology and more advanced features to offer their customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Audience Targeting</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest ways display ads have gotten “smarter” is with their ability to target different types of audiences. Any marketer can tell you the secret to an effective campaign is learning to target the right people; if you choose the right target demographics for your messaging, and capture their attention with a well-placed, well-written message, you’ll stand a good chance of converting them.</p>\n<p>Over the years, display ads have gotten much better at targeting the right types of people. Sophisticated display ad networks (<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2008/10/16/google_adwords_display_ads/\">like Google AdWords</a>) offer you the ability to choose target consumers based on demographic factors, like age, gender, level of income, level of education, and dozens of other factors. But beyond that, you can make your audience even more specific with things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remarketing. </strong>Through remarketing, you can specifically target users who have visited your website in the past. These are commonly used to remind people of the products they’ve seen on your site, and attract them back to complete their purchase (or research).</li>\n<li><strong>Interest. </strong>Google and other major tech companies keep detailed consumer profiles, so you can target people who have expressed interest in a specific type of product in the past. You can even target people based on the types of terms they’ve searched for in the past, and the types of websites they’ve visited recently.</li>\n<li><strong>Lookalike. </strong>One of the most impressive ad targeting features available today is targeting a “lookalike” audience. Here, you’ll upload an existing marketing list, and provide display advertising to people who resemble the types of people on that list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Analytics</h3>\n<p>Display ads have also advanced significantly in the realm of data analytics. Advertisers can now log into a dashboard to monitor and analyze how their ads have performed in the recent past. How many ads have been served? How many impressions are they getting? How many clicks are they getting? How are those visitors behaving once they reach your website? How much did you pay for this traffic? Are those users converting? You can also conduct an AB test with different variations of your ad to compare their performance; which features are most likely to attract the right people to your site?</p>\n<h3>Ease of Access</h3>\n<p>Online advertising used to be a complex endeavor, but these days, signing up for a display advertising account and starting your first campaign is easy. Major display ad networks want to attract advertisers of all shapes and sizes—including mega-corporations who want to reach millions of people and small-time bloggers who just want their <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/08/local-advertising-is-the-best-kept-secret-and-tech-can-help/\">first stream of local traffic</a>. Accordingly, they’ve designed platforms and products that can be easily understood—even if you’ve never run an advertising campaign in the past.</p>\n<h3>Budgeting and Costs</h3>\n<p>Display ads have always been affordable, except in highly competitive markets, but innovations in the industry have made it even more approachable for advertisers to set their budgets, understand their spending, and ultimately make better purchasing decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, in some platforms, you can set a firm budget of how much you want to spend in a given period of time. You might set a budget of $1,000 per week; if you do this, the platform can automatically optimize displays to help you get the most out of this budget.</p>\n<h3>The Future of Display Ads</h3>\n<p>Thanks in part to their constant competition, platforms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are constantly refining and improving their display advertising networks. In the coming years, we’ll likely see display ads with even more sophisticated targeting, lower costs, and lower barriers to entry—all with smarter and more advanced analytics platforms to measure your results.

I&#8217;ve used the YETI brand for their stay-cold drink containers.</p>\n<p>I recently purchased the <a href=\"https://www.yeti.com/en_US/hard-coolers/tundra-haul-cooler/10060200000.html#start=1\">YETI Tundra Haul Wheeled Cooler</a> to see how it worked for all of our on-the-go needs. Here&#8217;s my review.</p>\n<h2>About the Wheeled Cooler</h2>\n<p>This wheeled cooler from YETI is a beast in terms of its size and durability. Even with nothing in it, the cooler weighs nearly 40 pounds! It will hold about 55 pounds of ice and 45 cans of beer. To hold that much, the cooler has to be strong yet versatile to easily move around.</p>\n<p>The cooler comes in a wide range of colors. These include white, desert tan, ice blue, charcoal, navy blue, seafoam, river green, and coral.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173574\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Unique Features</h2>\n<p>The Tundra Haul uses YETI&#8217;s trademarked Fatwall Design. The cooler has extra thick walls that YETI says offers up to two inches of insulation to keep everything inside as cold as possible for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>The cooler is also rotomolded, which means it is made as one single complete body versus seams that can lead to structural stress and then potential leakage. Another feature is its hinge system, which the company guarantees won&#8217;t break, along with durable handles for when you have to lift it into and out of a vehicle.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>There are many pros when it comes to this incredible cooler on wheels. Besides its durability, storage capacity, and color choices, it can actually keep ice frozen for up to three or four days. You would be lucky to have ice still frozen on the same day with the typical ice chest. Plus, when I tried blocks of ice, they were still more than half frozen seven days after putting them in the cooler.</p>\n<p>You can also customize your YETI cooler with a collegiate or MLB logo. This is an additional fee but something that sets your cooler apart from all the others at the campgrounds or beach.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173576\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite-719x719.jpg 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>The cons are that there is stiff competition from other manufacturers with similar products where the ice can last up to 10 days. Others may not last as long in terms of freezing capability but they are significantly cheaper. However, I haven&#8217;t tested these other coolers so I&#8217;m not sure if they are as durable.</p>\n<p>Another con is that this particular model of cooler is not compatible with YETI&#8217;s dry goods basket or divider.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>Priced at $399.99, you can buy the YETI Tundra Haul Wheeled Cooler from the company&#8217;s website as well as other retailers like Amazon. Numerous sporting goods and camping retailers also carry this rugged cooler on wheels.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Although it is expensive for wheeled coolers &#8212; there are still more expensive ones. The YETI is backed by high-quality materials and a solid reputation for developing long-lasting products. With such durability, I know this cooler will last for years, saving me from buying a new one every summer.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/04/yeti-tundra-haul-wheeled-cooler-fun-in-the-sun/\">YETI Tundra Haul Wheeled Cooler: Fun in the Sun</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 04 Jul 2020 15:01:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraPink.jpg","linkMd5":"ebaaa203a38ead04cce63b3c5ab86862","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-27-107_76d980db4b1c47fa.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraPink.jpg","destWidth":1165,"destHeight":836,"sourceBytes":44282,"destBytes":32084,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraPink-300x215.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-15-725_83234974cc7c596d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YetiTundraHaulCoolerInside-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-104_c7cbedd276f41371.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/YETITundraWhite-300x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-427_87d6f37e18ab698d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874284},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Get Deluxe Sleep with the Helix Midnight Luxe","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171562","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/01/get-deluxe-sleep-with-the-helix-midnight-luxe/\" title=\"Get Deluxe Sleep with the Helix Midnight Luxe\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-5.07.46-PM-300x220.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-5.07.46-PM-300x220.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-5.07.46-PM-900x661.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-5.07.46-PM-218x160.png 218w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-5.07.46-PM.png 1520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The <a href=\"https://helixsleep.com/products/midnight-luxe\">Helix Midnight Luxe</a> is one of the best and most cost-effective hybrid mattresses on the market right now. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/11/cnn-underscored/best-mattress-side-sleepers/index.html\">CNN rated</a> it as the “best mattress of 2019” and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/helix-mattress-review-2018-9\">Business Insider</a> reported in their review that “I feel more supported at night…and have noticed decreased neck, shoulder, and back pain.” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The mattress boasts a blend of features, such as zoned lumbar support and Tencel Temperature Regulation, that enhance your hours of restful sleep each night, so that you wake up feeling rejuvenated. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The ReadWrite team got a chance to sample the Helix Midnight Luxe and we loved it.

It is rated at a medium-firm foam density ratio.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Memory Plus Foam Support Layer: </b>Industry-leading pressure relief from high-density foam, that gives a premium feel.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>High-grade Polyfoam Transition Layer: </b>Great contour support layer that spreads out the pressure of your body onto the foam support coils.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pocket Coil Mattress Core: </b>The core of this mattress is comprised of 1,000 individually-wrapped pocket coils that provide for the zoned support. This maintains spine alignment by being soft at the head of the mattress and more rigid below.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Base Layer of DuraDense Foam: </b>This layer lends support to the mattress to help ensure that it stays in good condition for its lifetime.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">This mattress is produced using materials that are 100% made in the USA and hand-assembled in HELIX’s domestic facility. All materials are OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified free from chemicals that have proven harmful to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Some pro tips: All mattresses require a break-in period – which for the Helix Midnight Luxe the optimal time before peak comfort is about 45 nights. Because the mattress is made from premium materials you do not ever need to flip over or rotate the mattress.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Helix Midnight Luxe is one of those rare combinations of top of the line quality combined with affordability. Helix offers a 100-night sleep trial as a guarantee that you will love your mattress, as well as a 15-year limited warranty. So there&#8217;s little to no risk in giving this mattress a shot. </span></p>\n<h4>Helix Add-ons</h4>\n<p>Helix&#8217;s product suite doesn&#8217;t stop at mattresses. They also produce their own pillows, bases, foundations, and bedding. In addition to the Helix Midnight Luxe, the ReadWrite team sampled the Helix Adjustable Base to experience the full Helix sleep package.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://helixsleep.com/products/adjustable-base\">Helix Adjustable base</a> has three main functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zero Gravity and Memory Settings: </strong>You can simulate &#8220;weightlessness&#8221; by adjusting the head and foot positions, reducing stress on your back and spine. The memory setting allows you to save specific positions.</li>\n<li><strong>Head-Up &#38; Foot Adjustability: </strong>The entire frame is adjustable so you can adjust both head and foot positions. These settings can provide optimal reading, watching, and &#8220;anti-snoring&#8221; positions.</li>\n<li>3<strong>D Wave Massage Technology: </strong>This setting provides a light vibration on the head and feet positions. This should not be mistaken with a massage similar to what you&#8217;d receive in a massage chair as the mattress sits in between the motor and your body.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The assembly of the Helix Adjustable Base is a breeze and it provides a completely customized sleep experience. The position and memory settings are great however we thought the 3D Wave technology wasn&#8217;t entirely necessary. It takes nothing away from the experience but doesn&#8217;t add a ton as far as comfort.</p>\n<p>Overall the team was pleased with the Helix Sleep package. Their products are priced fairly for the quality and comfort. We can&#8217;t wait to see what they have in store for us next!</p>\n<p><em>_ _ _</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was written in partnership with Helix Sleep.

At the time of writing, the world has seen 2,585,197 cases of COVID-19, and many countries are still waiting to hit their peak. Here is how big data as a double-edged sword in the fight against COVID-19.</p>\n<p>In such times, the efforts on the technological front to develop platforms to reduce its effects are ongoing with advancements in drug discovery, surveillance, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/10/is-artificial-intelligence-the-ultimate-university-stimulus/\">tracking and tracing technologies</a>. Tech companies and governments are spending billions of dollars on damage control and in developing Big Data and AI-powered tools to help control this situation, such as surveillance drones and contact tracing apps.</p>\n<p>While these technologies show immense promise as a vertical to fight the spread of COVID-19, there are significant limitations and concerns that have come to light about the use of these technologies. The concern of false positives and panic concerns over privacy and security in the wake of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/04/13/unassisted-ai-video-surveillance-techniques-help-numerous-verticals-to-scale/\">high-tech surveillance</a> and the use of these technologies in the post COVID world has led to a lot of raised eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Despite this, tech giants such as Google and Apple are working in collaboration to help with contact tracing while the governments of the world, such as the US, UK, and even the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/09/16/gdpr-european-union-business-dl1/\">European Union</a>, are relying on such technologies to fight COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how Big Data is being leveraged in the fight against COVID-19, the limitations of the technology, and the rising concerns with regards to its <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/05/9-main-security-challenges-for-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things-iot/\">long-term use on privacy and security</a>.</p>\n<h2>How Big Data Is being Used To Fight COVID-19</h2>\n<p>Big Data has been hailed by experts as one of the leading resources in the fight against COVID-19. Experts have found uses for Big Data and Big Data analytics platforms for various purposes, such as surveillance in Smart Cities, for contact tracing, and vaccine development.</p>\n<h3>Smart Cities For Surveillance</h3>\n<p>Within smart cities, big data platforms are being used to identify the compliance of the population with social distancing measures. Surveillance data from sensors and cameras are also being analyzed to identify pedestrian traffic within areas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">Road travel has gone down by 73% in the UK</a>, to levels similar to those in 1955. The way smart city technology is being leveraged is going to be crucial in understanding the response of the population to government policies, and the pandemic as a whole.</p>\n<p>It can also help narrow down the focus on specific areas using Big Data analytics where these measures are being followed with significant lethargy. The rate of spread of the virus in these areas can then be corresponded to their response, helping us better understand the impact of social distancing and lockdowns in reducing the spread of the virus.</p>\n<h3>Artificial Intelligence For Vaccine Development</h3>\n<p>The coming together of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data platforms has improved our ability to dig through years of data to identify possible drugs already approved by the FDA for treating similar viruses. These <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/14/how-will-the-pandemic-impact-the-future-of-work/\">AI and Big-Data powered systems</a> can also help identify new molecules using this database to help us develop a vaccine quicker.</p>\n<p>This process of drug discovery is powered by modern technology is one of the reasons that illnesses today are much less fatal than they would be in the 1900s. In the case of COVID-19, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/12/robotics-and-big-data-are-transforming-nursing-4-key-insights/\">similar applications</a> of these technologies are going to be crucial to the efforts of scientists and medical experts to quickly develop and distribute vaccines.</p>\n<h3>Contact Tracing</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-digital-contact-tracing-slowed-covid-19-in-east-asia\">Contact tracing has emerged as a digital solution</a> that has been accepted universally with countries like Israel (<a href=\"https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native\">HaMagen</a>), Singapore (TraceTogether), and South Korea already using contact tracing platforms to locate, test, and isolate potential carriers of the novel coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/?subId3=xid:fr1587465086697agi\">Apple and Google announced a joint plan</a> to release an API for public healthcare providers that allows contact tracing apps from public health departments to be interoperable between Android and iOS devices.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the tech giants also announced the integration of this capability within their devices for the future to ensure wider accessibility.</p>\n<p>Contact tracing uses BLE technology to gather encrypted identifiers from other devices in its proximity and logs it. Each app’s user can flag themselves once they are tested positive for COVID, and every person who would have come into close proximity would receive an alert. All of this action is through the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/03/24/wi-fi-industry-standards-needed-sm4/\">encrypted proximity identifier</a> that they might have been potentially exposed, including time and date of when they were close to a carrier.</p>\n<p>This data can be used to identify not just potential carriers but also areas with higher virility rates, helping governments take area-specific actions by labeling them as red zones.</p>\n<h2>Limitations of Big Data</h2>\n<p>One of the limitations of Big Data and information gathering is the inability of these technologies to count for social causes. This means that while they might be great at gathering and analyzing numerical data (which isn’t necessarily true), the context of those trends being unavailable can result in poor decision-making.</p>\n<p>For example, in poor neighborhoods, especially in developing nations, people neglecting social distancing measures can result in law enforcement agencies to take stricter measures, increase fines and, and implement stricter consequences.</p>\n<p>While that’s one way to solve the problem, it might still be ineffective based on the initial reason for the negligence. For many people, social distancing is hard because they don’t have access to the same resources as others. Daily wage laborers are one such demographic and do not share the privilege of maintaining long-lasting social distancing, and this is something <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/30/cybersecurity-ensuring-sanity-in-smart-cities/\">surveillance technology even within smart cities cannot account</a> for.</p>\n<p>So while the data available is accurate, it does not point towards a good solution, and treating all data as homogenous can be a fatal mistake that experts can make.</p>\n<p>Secondly, critics of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/27/covid-19-jobs-data-and-machine-learning/\">Big data-based platforms such as contact tracing</a> apps highlight that the Bluetooth technology might be ineffective in understanding proximity contexts. For example, Bluetooth can be caught across walls and partitions. Even if you’re safely partitioned from a person who tests positive for COVID-19 via a wall &#8212; you’ll still get a notification for potential exposure as long as you’re in Bluetooth range.</p>\n<p>The action allows for false positives to occur and creates unnecessary panic within the population. Demonstration the idea here &#8212; is that you cannot depend on these technologies solely and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/big-data-in-the-telecommunications-ecosystem/\">require experts to weigh in</a> on the context of the data you’re analyzing to better come up with strategies based on that data.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the biggest limitation of big data platforms such as a contact tracing platform Is that they have to be opt-in. The kind of user penetration it requires 60%-80% is incredibly difficult to reach for the platform to be a success. The biggest <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/is-there-any-stopping-techs-big-four-from-monopolizing-user-data/\">trouble here is trust</a>. With recent debacles with regards to user data and privacy, people generally vary of such invasive platforms and might not opt-in for these services.</p>\n<p>While Google and Apple are working on device integration, most people, in fact, don’t have access to the most recent devices, meaning that for a large portion of the population, penetration will still be a significant barrier and over-relying on these <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/12/know-your-enemy-the-5-different-types-of-data-breach/\">technologies can result in the negligence</a> of other important steps such as social distancing.</p>\n<h2>Privacy Concerns With Regards To Big Data</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons why Big Data is a double-edged sword is its long-term consequences. The kind of technological advancements in surveillance that are being made can have a massive impact on the world post-COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, of the “<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/what-the-drones-of-future-can-do/\">pandemic drones</a>” that the US is testing that can monitor body temperature, breathing, heart-rate, coughing, and sneezing of an individual. These drones can also be used to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/19/facial-recognition-shaping-the-future-of-identity-verification-market/\">identify people using facial recognition</a> technology and is something right out of a dystopian novel like 1984.</p>\n<p>That’s one end of surveillance that is more hardware-oriented. On the software end, contract tracing apps and big data platforms are being developed, which can be a huge risk of cyber threat. While Google and Apple have both promised commitment to privacy and anonymity, the tech giants of the world don’t have a great reputation with regards to upholding privacy and adopting transparent systems of accountability.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The challenge we face is the long-term use case of the innovative technologies that are being developed in the wake of COVID-19. Moreover, skeptics have raised concerns over the use of these technologies by authoritarian regimes even after COVID-19. But this skepticism can be directed towards all governments and tech companies that are involved in the development of such technologies.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Is there an expiry date for the usage of surveillance tech? To what degree will we wait for COVID-19 to slow down until we can stop violating the privacy of individuals in the way that this unprecedented crisis has forced us to do.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>One of the things that we have to realize with regards to technological solutions and leveraging big data is that they are not perfect solutions.</p>\n<p>Their effectivity is limited to the capability of our technological prowess, and we are yet to unlock their true potential as a race. While technological evolution has made incredible inroads towards solving this problem with multiple possible vaccines now in the human trial phase, simple things like washing hands and maintaining social distancing are incredibly crucial.</p>\n<p>How we use <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/13/ai-how-its-impacting-surveillance-data-storage/\">technology for surveillance</a> for potential carriers, then <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/16/the-false-choice-between-privacy-and-safety-in-smart-surveillance/\">surveillance</a> of those already tested positive, and in testing and drug discovery are all efforts that happen side by side fulfilling our social responsibility towards this pandemic.</p>\n<p>However, while there’s good, the double-edged sword that is technology is also something we should be cognizant about. How this tech evolves, post-COVID is a conversation that needs to happen today before it’s too late. Privacy, security, anonymity, and safety should always be an important factor in our planning in the long-run.</p>\n<p>How secure will people feel knowing that their mobile devices can be used to determine associations and activities by in-built systems of tracing, which are much more targeted than the traditional location services? The answer lies in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/coronavirus-a-test-for-modern-technology-and-tethics-trrm3wom\">our understanding of ethics</a> and the responsibility we take with regards to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/13/it-trends-of-the-future-that-are-worth-paying-attention-to-today/\">Big Data backed platforms</a> that we develop as tech companies. How we choose to limit the use of this technology in the greater good of society is what will define how sharp the double-edged sword cuts back when it’s no longer needed to fight COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/big-data-as-a-double-edged-sword-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/\">Big Data as a Double-Edged Sword in the Fight Against COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:00:52 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-Data-as-a-Double-Edged-Sword-in-the-Fight-Against-COVID-16-825x510-1.jpeg","linkMd5":"40835af680fefbf8173184b821385857","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-25-850_903000686cfc9bd9.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-Data-as-a-Double-Edged-Sword-in-the-Fight-Against-COVID-16-825x510-1.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":36221,"destBytes":30350,"author":"Abeer Raza","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-Data-as-a-Double-Edged-Sword-in-the-Fight-Against-COVID-16-825x510-1-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-054_01e07b53a42269fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878027},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Charting a Course Between Two Extremes of Startup Cash Management","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168381","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/charting-a-course-between-two-extremes-of-startup-cash-management/\" title=\"Charting a Course Between Two Extremes of Startup Cash Management\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"startup cash management\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In the world of startups, there are about <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/how-to-avoid-being-part-of-90-of-failed-companies/\">9 failed businesses</a> for every single one that succeeds. It&#8217;s the kind of statistic that&#8217;s enough to keep even the most seasoned founder up at night. If you take a peek inside that statistic, you&#8217;ll also find that the majority of startups that fail (besides those that were badly conceived in the first place). Many fail because they fail to keep their <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/01/04/startup-business-spending/\">burn rate</a> in check and then run out of investors who are willing to fund their operations.</p>\n<p>Part of that can be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/22/9-steps-to-assess-whether-a-startup-is-suitable-for-investment/\">chalked up to sheer mismanagement</a>. After all, many founders fall victim to the notion that the financial tap won&#8217;t ever dry up – and they spend like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. A surprising number of others, though, suffer from the opposite problem. They treat their startup&#8217;s burn rate like it&#8217;s etched in stone. Some companies are unwilling to either spend more or less than their estimates indicate. They don&#8217;t consider the facts on the ground and what the facts are indicating they should be doing.</p>\n<p>The latter group also tends to spend every waking moment in the pursuit of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/01/recession-startup/\">lining up new financing</a>. As a result, they neglect the very things that will determine the future of their startup. While they make the rounds looking for money, product lines stagnate, customer service suffers, and innovation grinds to a halt. The result is that their startup goes belly-up anyway, like a bunch of grapes left to whither on the vine.</p>\n<p>The natural question is how, then, is a founder supposed to strike the balance between over-managing burn rate and profligate spending? And how can they even recognize the condition their startup&#8217;s in from the inside, so they can take corrective action before it&#8217;s too late? To help, here&#8217;s a look at what the two extremes of startup cash management look like. If you see your startup reflected in either of them, it&#8217;s time to make some changes.</p>\n<h2>The Go-Go Startup</h2>\n<p>I refer here to startups that waste their financing as though there&#8217;s an endless supply of cash waiting to be brought in the doors as go-go startups. The reason is that the term is emblematic of the attitude that such startups tend to adopt. The people in charge see spending more as a symbol of getting things done, and can&#8217;t resist the lure of jumping into everything with both feet before looking at where they&#8217;re likely to land.</p>\n<p>To be more specific, they tend to throw excessive amounts of cash in the following areas:</p>\n<h3>Overstaffing</h3>\n<p>One of the areas where startups tend to overspend is in hiring staff that their development cycle does not yet call for. For example, it&#8217;s common for startups to begin building out a massive marketing department long before they have a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/08/03/minimum-viable-product-mvp-test/\">minimum viable product</a> (MVP) to bring to market. At best, the only value those marketers will be able to generate is in building up hype for a nonexistent product. Then, if your MVP doesn&#8217;t live up to expectations, you&#8217;ll have burnt up cash just to harm your own fledgling brand&#8217;s image.</p>\n<p>To avoid this pitfall, it&#8217;s essential to spend your startup&#8217;s money on building a product and getting it in front of potential customers before almost anything else. All of the other business functions that you might view as essential early on should be put on hold until you find out if the business itself has a viable market to focus on in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Lavish Workspace</h3>\n<p>Another area where startups tend to go overboard is in finding and securing their office spaces. Recent history is littered with failed startups that went from inhabiting posh, palatial offices to bankruptcy proceedings seemingly overnight. It&#8217;s easy to understand why. In recent decades, venture capitalists have prized style over substance, and part of generating a positive buzz comes from having a feature-story-worthy office.</p>\n<p>The problem is that crazy office spaces and the perks they enable cost money. That money would be better spent on creating products and services that drive revenue, however. Plus, all those office perks that reporters breathlessly laud don&#8217;t have much correlation to success. In fact, they may even kill your startup&#8217;s productivity.</p>\n<h3>Excessive Promotional Materials</h3>\n<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that profligate startups seem to love, it&#8217;s branded swag. If you can put a logo on it, they&#8217;ll buy it in bulk. Bonus points if the item is unique, expensive, and trendy (remember how every tech startup was handing out business card CD-ROMs during the .com boom?). The truth about all of that stuff, however, is that nobody cares. Nobody, except the marketing firm you&#8217;re shoveling all of that money at.</p>\n<h2>The Go-Slow Startup</h2>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_168385\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-168385\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-168385 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success.jpg\" alt=\"go-slow startup\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success-300x167.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success-260x144.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-168385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>The &#8220;go-slow-startup.&#8221;  </strong></em>                                                                                                                                   <em> Image credit: H_Ko / Adobe Stock</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>On the other end of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/14/5-tech-companies-to-turn-to-during-uncertain-times/\">startup spending spectrum</a> is the type of company that I like to call the go-slow startup. For them, it seems like the primary purpose of operating isn&#8217;t to make money, it&#8217;s to attract investment – whether it&#8217;s needed or not. At the same time, conserving operating cash isn&#8217;t a goal; it&#8217;s an all-consuming priority, often to the detriment of the business.</p>\n<p>Go-slow startups often exhibit the following characteristics:</p>\n<h3>Putting Funding Before Customers</h3>\n<p>The ethos of the go-slow startup seems to be: if we raise the cash to stay in business long enough, the customers will come. In truth, this is an idea that rarely, if ever, translates into reality. In service of it, startups sometimes use up their valuable time and manpower chasing VC funding rounds to the exclusion of almost every other useful business activity.</p>\n<p>This is folly for several reasons. First, venture capital <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/04/despite-what-you-hear-you-dont-need-vc-funding/\">isn&#8217;t always appropriate</a> for every startup. Second, investors mean expectations. Those expectations can take over the direction of your startup and push it toward decisions you&#8217;d have never made otherwise.</p>\n<p>In the early stages, this can rob a founder of the flexibility they need to execute their vision. Instead of chasing funding, it&#8217;s much more important to spare no effort to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/24/e-commerce-failures-and-mistakes-why-do-so-many-startups-fail/\">build a loyal core of customers</a> that will help keep your bottom line healthy – and that will grow along with your product or service.</p>\n<h3>Funding for Funding&#8217;s Sake</h3>\n<p>Another sure sign of the go-slow startup is the tendency to seek new funding sources every time there&#8217;s even a hint of progress on the business side. More often than not, there&#8217;s no particular reason they need the cash, except to build up a funding cushion in anticipation of harder days ahead.</p>\n<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve seen startups manufacture every possible excuse for this behavior, from the diminished purchasing power of the falling US dollar to a desire to take advantage of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/16/crowdfunding-your-startup-at-700-percent-oversubscribed/\">historic low-interest rates on business</a> working capital loans. I&#8217;ve even had a founder tell me they were raising money &#8220;because it&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The problem is the money a startup raises isn&#8217;t free. If there&#8217;s no real plan for how to use it to drive the company forward, taking on additional investors can have some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/07/13/pitfalls-venture-capital/\">pretty serious drawbacks</a>. The bottom line is that a well-run startup should only raise money when it needs money, and only when that need is related to the startup&#8217;s actual business goals.</p>\n<h3>Hoarding Cash and Making Unreasonable Demands</h3>\n<p>The last characteristic of the go-slow startup is one that I consider to be the cardinal sin of all early-stage businesses. It happens when the startup is so consumed with building a cash reserve that it begins starving its own organization of needed resources. This usually shows up in the form of a stubborn refusal to hire needed staff (as opposed to the excessive staffing discussed earlier), followed by an ever-increasing burden on existing employees.</p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s invariably true that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/outsourcing-automation-future-of-business-scalability/\">startup employees typically work long hours</a> in service of a greater goal. It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s a limit to what a startup should expect of its dedicated employees. They&#8217;re not a fixed asset. They&#8217;re not machines. If you push them too hard, they&#8217;ll leave &#8212; and take your startup&#8217;s soul with them.</p>\n<p>The problem is that many startups have dedicated employees that will keep acceding to unreasonable demands until they literally break down. At that point, it&#8217;s a situation beyond repair. For that reason, if your startup is doing this, make changes immediately.</p>\n<h2>Getting Things Right</h2>\n<p>The goal for every startup should be to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/17/12-best-sales-engagement-solutions-for-2020/\">pursue burn rate management</a> in the manner most appropriate for their specific circumstances. As you can see, there are quite a few ways that companies can be either too passive or too aggressive in their approach, and none of them ends well.</p>\n<p>Put simply, though, if your startup is exhibiting any of the qualities listed here, you need to reexamine your situation and make adjustments as needed. If you don&#8217;t, your startup may well end up joining the majority of its peers in irrelevance and insolvency – and not because it was a bad idea in the first place.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/charting-a-course-between-two-extremes-of-startup-cash-management/\">Charting a Course Between Two Extremes of Startup Cash Management</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:00:37 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management.jpg","linkMd5":"952e155a54b538c916e1c9ab4f3f3d91","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-27-131_09e3b64de53d1c4a.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":493531,"destBytes":496622,"author":"Andrej Kovacevic","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Charting-a-Course-Between-Two-Extremes-of-Startup-Cash-Management-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-15-576_a8434708dc16155e.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/startup-skyrocketing-success.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-19-596_d78091eff641fdc3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878259},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Why You Should Allow Employees to do Online Shopping at Work","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169231","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/21/why-you-should-allow-employees-to-do-online-shopping-at-work/\" title=\"Why You Should Allow Employees to do Online Shopping at Work\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"shopping at work\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping-.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Encouraging your employees to shop during work hours sounds odd, to put it mildly. But armed with some data, I’m willing to explain why it’s not quite like kicking yourself or throwing your money in the air.</p>\n<p>You should not only allow employees to do personal shopping at work. You should be happy when they do it. As the founder of the time tracking app DeskTime, I’ve always been passionate about productivity. But I’ve often found it to be misunderstood by staff and managers.</p>\n<p>On the DeskTime app, we’ve labeled sites and applications &#8221;productive&#8221; or &#8221;unproductive&#8221;. But are the unproductive ones really harmful to our team’s overall performance? Or, are they a distraction that’s sometimes welcome and even necessary?</p>\n<p>That’s why we decided to look at a supposedly unproductive activity – <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-online-shopping-is-evolving-with-the-times/\">online shopping</a> during office hours.</p>\n<h2><strong>Employees spend more than half an hour a day in online shopping.</strong></h2>\n<p>Many studies confirm what you may have already suspected to be true – most people engage in online shopping at work. When you look at millennials, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90408181/you-shop-online-at-work-we-all-know-it-and-this-research-proves-it\">81 percent</a> of them browse shopping sites during work hours.</p>\n<p>We decided to have a closer look at this phenomenon, so we gathered data from more than 180K users of our app. We pulled data concerning the use of online shopping sites over the last four years.</p>\n<p>First of all, we confirmed that office workers indeed use online shopping to procrastinate during work hours. We noticed that <b>online shopping at work is a growing trend</b>.</p>\n<p>Let me explain:</p>\n<p>In 2016, an average DeskTime user spent only up to 12 minutes a day on online shopping, but a year later, this number more than doubled. In 2018, an average office worker was already spending up to 45 minutes a day shopping. Last year, however, the trend seems to have slowed down with 32 minutes dedicated to online shopping per day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-169234 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-900x657.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"657\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-900x657.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-300x219.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-219x160.png 219w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-1536x1121.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>That being said, despite the slight changes in online shopping dynamics we observed last year, I still believe those office workers from all over the world will continue to flock to the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/20/4-technology-trends-shaping-property-portals/\">Internet to make purchases</a>. It wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if the total time spent on online shopping during work hours would increase again in 2020 along with the entire e-commerce market, which is also <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/\">continuously growing</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Where do employees shop the most during office hours?</strong></h3>\n<p>When it comes to online shopping destinations, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/tag/amazon/\">Amazon</a> remains the most popular e-commerce site visited during office hours. In 2019, people spent almost 60 percent of all time dedicated to online shopping browsing Amazon. The runner-up is eBay with 11.6 percent and Etsy with 4 percent ranking third.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_169237\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-169237\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-169237 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-900x484.png\" alt=\"popular shopping websites\" width=\"900\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-900x484.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-300x161.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-260x140.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-1536x826.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-169237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Top online shopping destinations during work hours, 2019</em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>So, if you weren’t sure that your employees shopped during work hours, now you should be. From now on, it’s up to you whether you let them do it openly or whether you’d prefer them to sneak around.</p>\n<p>Let me explain why I think<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/15/4-ethical-concerns-for-the-connected-world/\"> transparency is the best policy</a> here and why you should not mind your team doing some shopping at work.</p>\n<h4>1: Online shopping is one of the least harmful unproductive activities</h4>\n<p>Online shopping is far from being the biggest productivity threat to companies. So, before you block all e-commerce websites in the office or fire someone for browsing Amazon at work, reflect on this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only about <b>3.8 percent of the unproductive time is spent on shopping, </b>according to the data.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the meantime, social media and video streaming websites (such as YouTube and Netflix) take up 49 percent and 35 percent, respectively.</p>\n<h4><b>2: Shopping makes employees happier</b></h4>\n<p>Numerous studies point out that the use of social media <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/62718-social-media-habits-depression.html\">can cause depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/social-media-anxiety_n_1662224\">anxiety</a>. On the contrary, shopping has been found to promote the release of dopamine – a hormone that plays a vital role in how happy we feel.</p>\n<p>A distraction like shopping lets employees takes a mental break. And happy employees are found to be <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/its-true-happy-people-are-just-more-productive\">more productive</a> and efficient. Also, people who aren’t policed and restricted at work are less likely to search for another job.</p>\n<p>When you look at it that way, allowing your employees to buy some new gadget or a piece of clothing during working hours doesn&#8217;t sound like such a big deal, does it? Certainly not if it can boost morale and reduce employee turnover.</p>\n<h4><b>3: Shopping at work can actually make people more productive</b></h4>\n<p>Imagine yourself in a situation where you just did some shopping during work hours. How do you feel?</p>\n<p>Are you satisfied that you’ve saved some of your private time? Guilty for abandoning your work duties for a while?</p>\n<p>Probably a bit of both. I guess that this combination of happiness and guilt can give a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/13/5-quick-tips-for-improving-productivity-at-work-in-2020/\">productivity boost</a> to many people.</p>\n<p>Studies prove that employees’ productivity soars after short breaks. And psychologists claim that giving your brain a short rest can <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/changepower/201704/how-do-work-breaks-help-your-brain-5-surprising-answers\">help you stay focused on the task at hand.</a></p>\n<p>Ideally, you should encourage taking breaks away from the computer so that your employees rest their eyes, stretch, walk around, and drink some water. However, if a mental break is what they need at that moment, let it be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key takeaway?</strong></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/26/the-modern-workplace-demands-better-visibility/\">modern workplace</a> should put a focus on employee performance rather than on counting the minutes spent on productive or unproductive activities. And you heard that from me, the founder of a time tracking app.</p>\n<p>Instead of restricting personal shopping in the workplace, consider starting an initiative where each employee can spend up to 30 minutes a day on settling personal business at work.</p>\n<p>Remember &#8211; intrinsic motivation is a crucial player in a company’s overall productivity and in reducing employee turnover. Trusting your employees and giving them a break is a more significant motivation booster than you might think.</p>\n<p>Image Credit: Andrea Piacquadio; Pexels</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/21/why-you-should-allow-employees-to-do-online-shopping-at-work/\">Why You Should Allow Employees to do Online Shopping at Work</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:00:32 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping-.jpg","linkMd5":"471f9072d36750885c57348eaa9aad00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-27-855_81a0327893e11519.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping-.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":155468,"destBytes":113164,"author":"Artis Rozentals","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-You-Should-Allow-Employees-to-do-Online-Shopping--300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-13-609_5dc2de6d644cac7f.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/employees-shopping-at-work-900x657.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-28-023_5eee3e119d9e21b7.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popular-shopping-websites-900x484.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-28-339_92cf45fb4c648b50.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877690},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"How Can Publishers Grow Traffic After the Latest Google Update?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172659","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/21/how-can-publishers-grow-traffic-after-the-latest-google-update/\" title=\"How Can Publishers Grow Traffic After the Latest Google Update?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"latest google update\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><i>*Mentioned products, tools in the article are non-affiliated and non-sponsored. </i></p>\n<p>After Google announced its latest core update on May 4th, more and more publishers have faced a significant drop in their traffic. Having armed with key data and metrics, I would like to share with you four major tips on how to recover from this traffic crack.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Get your blog featured in Google News</strong></h2>\n<p>According to SimilarWeb.com Google News currently has over <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/news.google.com#overview\">500M monthly visits.</a> As it is the dream of most online publishers to reach an audience this big, this is the chance to distribute your content to a readership that is already well-established.</p>\n<p>The potential of Google News is incredible and can help you to become one of the most featured blogs in your industry.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s compare Ahref’s results on how organic traffic has changed from April to June for two Setupad publishers -– Publisher A and Publisher B.</p>\n<p>Publisher&#8217;s A website is dedicated to the news category and displayed in Google News.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Publisher&#8217;s B website is about recipes and food and is not featured in Google News.</p>\n<p>According to the figure below, on April 26th, organic traffic was greater for Publisher B. The Publisher B results could lead us to think that after Google&#8217;s latest update, Publisher B would see a heavier drop in organic traffic in comparison to a Publisher A, who is in Google News.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172661 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr..png\" alt=\"Grow your website's traffic Apr.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr..png 2000w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr.-300x105.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr.-900x315.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr.-260x91.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr.-1536x538.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The figure below shows that both publishers experienced a drop in organic traffic after the latest Google Update. However, for Publisher A, organic traffic decreased only by 28K, while Publisher B experienced a drop over 51K in organic traffic.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172670 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun..png\" alt=\"Grow your website's traffic Jun.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun..png 2000w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun.-300x105.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun.-900x315.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun.-260x91.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun.-1536x538.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><b>What should you keep in mind?</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your content has to be optimized for search engines, so make sure you are running <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/blockchain-marketing-6-effective-ways-to-boost-your-seo-in-2020/\">SEO</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google News SEO can help you to get listed in top stories, and thus increase your website traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>2. Site audit for your website</strong></h2>\n<p>A site or website audit helps you to track your page&#8217;s performance and evaluate how you are achieving traffic goals. By running a site audit, you can understand whether the website is optimized or not and whether it is friendly to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/16/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-search-in-2020/\">search engines.</a></p>\n<p>After the site audit, you can gain a clear picture of what is wrong with your site and the errors you should fix. By fixing and optimizing your website, you can attract more visitors and generate more leads.</p>\n<p>This audit gives you a strategic plan to help you take the right action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can compare your site results with that of your competitors to gain a competitive advantage.</li>\n<li>Evaluate your site’s overall SEO efforts and make corresponding improvements.</li>\n<li>Fix any errors, such as broken images, non-compressed images, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that it&#8217;s perfectly alright if you cannot manage to improve everything at once, but these changes can be made over time.</p>\n<p>The main difference between site and content audit is that a site audit also evaluates not only the content of your website but also its technical performance.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Content audit for your website</strong></h2>\n<p>If you want to know which pages of your website are ranked lower due to the update, a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/15/a-comprehensive-guide-to-a-content-audit/\">content audit</a> will help.</p>\n<p>With a content audit, you can track how well your blog articles and landing pages are performing, as well as the quality of your engagement with your audience.</p>\n<p>By running content audits and analysis, you can see which articles and pages have to be updated and re-written.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest tools to help you analyze your content is <a href=\"https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\">Screaming Frog</a>. This tool conducts an SEO audit of your website and checks the first 500 URLs for free. It helps you identify which pages have dropped in performance due to the update. Definitely recommended.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Improve user experience (UX)</strong></h2>\n<p>After doing your site and content audit, continue with improving UX. The truth is, if your user experience is bad, you cannot hope for good results in search engines and rankings. Since search engine algorithm updates have become more advanced, user searches have become the top priority and play a considerably essential role in website ranking.</p>\n<p><b>Where to start and what to check? </b></p>\n<p>Make sure your content is clean and readable. Remember to emphasize your headings, so that it&#8217;s understandable for users and matches what they expect to read.</p>\n<p>Check if you use colors that are consistent and echo your brand values. You can create a brand book or so-called style guide that includes the main elements that constitute your brand. Doing this can help you create strategic guidelines that drive all aspects of your brand.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/12/web-designing-in-the-age-of-iot/\">well-designed site</a> or a blog will boost your engagement. But remember that the focus should be on blocks that users see first— for example, testimonials on the homepage. Testimonials can also help you gain users and create great UX experience.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key takeaway</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do for your site is observing your analytics and identifying unexpected changes in your traffic.</p>\n<p>Remember that after running a site and content audit, you should fix any errors as soon as possible. This will help you increase your website&#8217;s traffic.</p>\n<p>Get your blog displayed in Google News. It can take you two to four weeks to get approved, but if you undergo the approval process, rest assured that traffic will go up.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn&#8217;t attempt to win Google over its updates. Google focuses on providing the best experience for its users, so it makes sense that websites with great UX rank higher and gain more traffic. As a publisher, your long-term goal should be to provide a better user experience, which will later result in less traffic loss due to algorithm updates.</p>\n<p><i>*Mentioned products, tools in the article are non-affiliated and non-sponsored.</i></p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Andrea Piacquadio; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/21/how-can-publishers-grow-traffic-after-the-latest-google-update/\">How Can Publishers Grow Traffic After the Latest Google Update?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 15:01:09 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update.jpg","linkMd5":"fcf35f4b5045bf3f688af21dfaa638f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn56@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-20-643_8329fb89cd14584e.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":853,"sourceBytes":84434,"destBytes":50386,"author":"Toms Panders","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-Can-Publishers-Grow-Traffic-After-the-Latest-Google-Update-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-21-685_c8944ec6a89ac1ca.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-traffic-with-Google-News-Apr..png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-13-037_a417eda45fe75d10.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grow-your-websites-traffic-Jun..png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-13-359_aa62f9c7e5736c6d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873345},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:51","title":"10 Different Ways to Use Employee Feedback Software at Your Workplace","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171676","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/15/10-different-ways-to-use-employee-feedback-software-at-your-workplace/\" title=\"10 Different Ways to Use Employee Feedback Software at Your Workplace\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Use-Employee-Feedback-Software-at-Your-Workplace-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"employee feedback software\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Use-Employee-Feedback-Software-at-Your-Workplace-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Use-Employee-Feedback-Software-at-Your-Workplace-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Use-Employee-Feedback-Software-at-Your-Workplace.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a company with a large number of employees is not an easy nut to break.

There was word processing software, platforms for inventory, accounting tools, and antivirus programs, but most served broad constituency. Ultimately, most critical processes either relied on in-house solutions (often the programs referred to as legacy programs in today’s tech ecosystem) or they had to be managed manually. These approaches were time consuming and prone to error, but limited software choices weren’t all bad.</p>\n<p>Back when they had few options, businesses had to think critically about what tools they would use and how, and carefully consider the best ways to complete a given task. Today’s tools may be more powerful, but those charged with choosing the right platforms are often overwhelmed by their scope, as well as the sheer number of options. Such excess actually makes it harder for businesses to determine whether they’re doing something in the most efficient way. When six different programs can all easily complete a task, does it really matter which one your company chooses? Yes, it does.</p>\n<p>Picking the right software can substantially boost your business’s efficiency, help keep costs down, and make your company more agile, but it isn’t always easy. By intentionally evaluating your current software, your process-based needs, and by setting targeted performance goals, you can streamline your digital ecosystem and optimize your company’s performance.</p>\n<h3>Start With Goals</h3>\n<p>The first step for any business seeking to streamline their software use with a focus on efficiency is, unsurprisingly, goals-based planning. What does your business do, and how do you define the successful completion of your professional aims? Planning isn’t just outlining a project idea, but framing how long it will last and how you’ll measure whether you’ve met that goal. This is why most experts recommend <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/02/how-entrepreneurial-planning-helps-you-have-smoother-sailing/\">using the SMART planning process</a>.</p>\n<p>SMART is an acronym for how goals should function. A goal must be specific, measurable – many goals leave out this step, it must be achievable, it needs to be relevant within the bigger picture, and finally, it must be time-bound. If you don’t know how long a task will or should take or how you’ll determine a project is complete, then you don’t have a SMART goal. And while you can, and should, use SMART planning across a variety of tasks, it works particularly well for choosing software programs for several reasons – reasons made evident through the evaluation process.</p>\n<h3>Evaluating Program Needs</h3>\n<p>Once you define what your core goals are, as a business and specifically for your software ecosystem, it’s time to look at what tools you’re already working with and what tools your company needs. This evaluation process should weigh several factors, including software integration, ease of use, scalability, redundancy, and cost. These elements will carry different weights in the final decision making. For example, it may be worth it to pay more for a program that delivers more <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/8-ways-entrepreneurs-can-improve-their-time-management-skills/\">automation through business process management</a> (BPM).</p>\n<p>Remember: time is money, so a program that costs more but saves time may still come out ahead of a more affordable program that requires greater staff engagement to complete tasks. In fact, time management is one of the most significant business concerns as software systems multiply, since a significant percentage of lost productivity stems from the need to switch frequently between programs.</p>\n<h3>Cutting The Fat</h3>\n<p>As your business evaluates what tools it needs in order to efficiently meet its goals, you’ll also likely uncover that your company has some loose ends floating around. That could mean several things, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You’re paying for software subscriptions you no longer use.</strong> This happens surprisingly often, in much the same way that many individuals end up with stray media subscriptions. Because the payments are automated and are small, relative to the overall scope of business spending, they may be overlooked.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re still running old software and it’s burdening your system.</strong> It takes time and effort to shift data and processes away from legacy programs, but it’s worth doing. Those programs are rarely optimized for speed and tend to be clunky compared to purchased solutions. They slow down your network, don’t integrate with new software, and it’s time to transition away from them.</li>\n<li><strong>You’re running processes through several programs to get results that really only require one. </strong>Most popular business software integrates, at minimum, with other programs from their own suite of offerings, but even more often with the other top names in business software. For example, since the majority of companies use Salesforce, other software brands design their platforms for Salesforce integration. But while it’s one thing for a process to move through several integrated elements in order to complete a process, anything that requires staff to manually transition information between programs is doing more to hinder your business than to help it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these factors are strong indicators that you need to make some updates to your software suite if you want your business to achieve maximum efficiency. Cutting back on the number of programs you’re running and instead focusing on choosing a small, targeted suite will also help your business <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346104\">minimize the risk of security breaches</a>, speed up onboarding, and more.</p>\n<h3>Key Efficiency Features</h3>\n<p>You’ve set out your goals. You’ve evaluated your current software holdings and needs and gotten rid of the elements that aren’t working. Now your business is finally ready for the software adoption segment of the optimization process. There are several key features that you’ll want to focus on during this process, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standardized Scripting: </strong>Remote monitoring and management platforms (RMM) have made it possible for businesses to streamline large scale data collection and analysis, but there’s no one size fits all approach to this process. Instead, the best RMM platforms <a href=\"https://syncromsp.com/time-saving-features-platform/\">include a script library</a> so that your businesses doesn’t need to craft the code from scratch for every new operation. Script libraries aren’t quite automation, but they enable automation.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Pathways:</strong> As noted above, integration is an important part of efficiency. If you have to manually navigate process pathways to complete an otherwise automated task, you can just about guarantee that there’s a better way. Look for software with integrated, automated process pathways for your most common tasks, such as invoicing, report generation, and patch management.</li>\n<li><strong>Easily Scaled:</strong> Scalability is critical to business success, and it’s one of the great advantages of today’s SaaS model. Though you may not have any intention or need to scale up in capacity right now, if your business is thriving, you’ll need to increase capacity (data volume, number of licenses) at some point down the line. If a program makes that hard to do, it’s not the program for your business.</li>\n<li><strong>High-Level Service: </strong>Customer service tends to be overlooked when businesses are choosing software. That’s not because it doesn’t matter – it’s just because it’s harder to test for. You can run a sample of software and watch demo videos, but you can’t be sure about support and maintenance services until you’re in the thick of things. That being said, you can <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/11/01/how-to-choose-the-right-software-solution-for-your-startup/#496fdaa52a6f\">discuss vendor support services</a> before committing to a contract. Will they dispatch a consultant to help with IT issues, or will they leave you talking to a chatbot? These details matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Overcoming Barriers To Software Transition</h3>\n<p>When a business needs to shift its processes, they tend to drag their feet. Making such a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/5-signs-that-you-are-ready-to-scale-business-and-deploy-innovation/\">change may feel impossible</a> or it may seem like there’s no right choice – or just too many choices. It’s okay to feel hesitant, but it’s important that you don’t let anxiety over innovation hold back your business. Instead, acknowledge your concerns and develop a plan that takes those concerns into account. By plotting out your goals, carefully evaluating your existing tools, and selecting for ease of use, automation, and strategic value, you can shift your business into its next iteration. It’s easy to get stuck in a rut, but your business won’t survive that kind of stagnation. Keep your eyes on the next step.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/15/striking-a-software-balance-how-to-choose-programs-for-efficiency/\">Striking A Software Balance: How To Choose Programs For Efficiency</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 10:15:20 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Striking-a-software-balance.jpg","linkMd5":"1d786385bd83a52d14cc56b324a41e5e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-26-114_ff89dd1cd4dc1c20.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Striking-a-software-balance.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":60692,"destBytes":30484,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Striking-a-software-balance-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-13-163_a3c548f96b7bab7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195870432},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Paving the Way: 3 Industries Ripe for Post-Pandemic Change","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171556","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/paving-the-way-3-industries-ripe-for-post-pandemic-change/\" title=\"Paving the Way: 3 Industries Ripe for Post-Pandemic Change\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM-300x223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM-300x223.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM-215x160.png 215w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt the world is going to change after the pandemic. Some of those changes will be temporary, and some will be more permanent. Most industries had to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/thanks-covid-remote-work-is-now-mandatory/\">adapt to remote work</a> and adopt new technology immediately, but it already existed. Change was imminent, but possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take restaurants, for example. A quick shift to takeout was required because eateries had no other option. Returning to the in-person experience will be awkward, at best, but it will be necessary in most cases to continue doing business and turning a profit. We were already using delivery apps as a subset of the food-buying experience, and they&#8217;ll see a continued uptick in the short term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when there&#8217;s a vaccine or a clear and obvious return to safe socializing, most will continue to go to restaurants for the experience. And restaurants aren&#8217;t alone in this.</span></p>\n<h2>The Times, They Are A-Changin&#8217;</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will also be true for sporting events, concerts, and other experiences that simply can</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t be replicated online. Denmark is doing drive-in concerts right now, hosting 500 cars per show. That</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s something that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s interesting in the short term, but it won</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t permanently replace the concert experience once crowds are permitted again</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sports may be a smart arena in which to test VR seating experiences, offering a sort of premium option for people viewing from home. Placing cameras in select locations that move with the action wasn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t a priority before, but ticket prices were getting tough for the average fan to manage pre-pandemic. That</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s something that could work in teams&#8217; favor, especially if it takes a couple years for things to get fully back to normal for all consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s perhaps the most important part of industry and technology going forward: People will take some calculated risks for the things and experiences that can</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t be replaced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where we will see the biggest changes? That part is obvious: Those will take place in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the industries that were already shifting and needed to shift. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Retail Will Change — It Has No Choice</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most obvious example could be found in retail. We were already trending online: Malls and big box stores were losing consumers&#8217; interest as more shifted to boutique retailers and online outlets. It took 20 slow years, but people finally got comfortable with ordering almost anything online. Direct-to-consumer companies were able to keep their costs low and disrupt industries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As consumers, this one seems easy — it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s safe to say that the majority of people will opt to keep buying things online, even when there&#8217;s an all-clear. When spending power is back, this will create plenty of online retail opportunities. And for a while, there will be a broadening of brands and entrants. That will consolidate over this decade, but if you</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">re in retail right now, consider market share a free-for-all fight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will always be those nostalgic for the mall. There will be a few exceptions that work because they create a unique experience, like Lush and other retailers in the health and beauty realm. But younger generations will be fine with buying products online and getting their tutorials from Instagram and TikTok.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Health and Wellness Are Going Digital</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side of cosmetics and beauty are how we treat common illness, get medicine, and stay informed about health. These aspects of well-being will become better suited for telehealth. Most people weren</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t using it pre-pandemic; if we look closely, health and medicine probably hosted the most antiquated systems people were using. It&#8217;s ironic in a world where medicine has come so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online portals for primary care still look like something from the early 2000s rather than the efficient apps and systems we expect. It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s easier to learn a language on your phone than it is to check in with your doctor. That</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s an opportunity that&#8217;s apparent now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every stage of life, expect to see app-based systems that inform, track progress, send updates, and map out health. Seem far-fetched? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a good example: FARE (Food Allergy Research &#38; Education) conducted a </span><a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/learning-early-about-peanut-allergy-leap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on peanut allergies. Approximately 1.6 million kids have these allergies. However, the study found that 80 percent of those allergies could be eliminated by introducing certain allergens early to infants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give parents something on their phone that lets them track what they can be doing. Then, kids will grow up with that system and use it as adults, rendering our healthcare system more efficient. There will be bumps, but that&#8217;s where we should be heading. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Education Has Changed for Good</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now, perhaps the biggest change: online education. There was a solid resistance to online education, even a few months ago, with people feeling the virtual experience deprived students of vital elements. Now that everyone has been forced to become online students and homeschoolers, they&#8217;ve discovered </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are some benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty million learners were already using Instructure</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s tool Canvas to manage online learning, so the technology exists; many colleges and universities already use it. That means that unlike healthcare, where tools will need to be built, there</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s already an accepted standard in education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifting more to online education has a couple immediate benefits. Students may be able to keep costs down and work more during school with a flexible schedule so they don</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t have as much student loan debt in their early career. Today</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s students get everything on-demand already, making education feel like the next frontier to follow suit and boost productivity and efficiency as a result.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And on-demand learning will see a bump post-conventional education. As conferences and networking events go on hold, LinkedIn Learning and Skillshare are growing. Forbes8 launched before the pandemic as a digital alternative to conferences and continued education via mobile videos and tutorials. Expect that sector to grow, as well, as the business world shifts its focus from in-person experiences to online development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is always changing. A pandemic and a recession are just accelerating the pace and making people comfortable with certain changes faster. Rather than wait for change to come, businesses should look at how they can influence and shape it.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/27/paving-the-way-3-industries-ripe-for-post-pandemic-change/\">Paving the Way: 3 Industries Ripe for Post-Pandemic Change</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 14:00:14 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM.png","linkMd5":"26326b43694d681d4b9585da4c4c2494","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-23-682_15bbc144b1676322.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM.png","destWidth":782,"destHeight":582,"sourceBytes":539505,"destBytes":26380,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-18-at-1.36.35-PM-300x223.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-18-843_9203e7b2435f8923.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877327},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Role of Big Data in the Evolution of the Financial Industry","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169247","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/23/role-of-big-data-in-the-evolution-of-the-financial-industry/\" title=\"Role of Big Data in the Evolution of the Financial Industry\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"big data and financial\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The financial industry has always been a highly competitive sector. Considering how disruptive technologies like Big Data have reached their maturation, big data can be made a beneficial part of the financial industry. Businesses can harvest big data for security, personalization, and investment decisions.</p>\n<p>Big Data is bringing forth new datasets that can help understand customer behavior and improve the area of predictive analysis. With this data-driven approach, let&#8217;s take a look at how Big Data is transforming the financial industry.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Enhanced Product Diversity</b></strong></h3>\n<p>As stated previously, Big Data is now highlighting new datasets that are a powerful medium to understand the customer psyche and accordingly offer them new and improved financial services.</p>\n<p>For example, companies now operate <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>fintech Robo-advisors</u></a> that offer holistic advice regarding digital investments. Given that these Robo-advisors make use of Big Data to gather insight on customer spending patterns and other parameters for personalization, the advice tendered will also be extremely relevant for the customer. Similarly, other services like loan availability, customer risk analysis, etc. can be included in the list of financial products.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Market Analytics</b></strong></h3>\n<p>Investors can effectively tap into the potential offered by big data to analyze market trends and make smarter investments. Several companies have cutting-edge predictive systems in place, which can not only understand large volumes of data but also interpret them to offer informed investment decisions.</p>\n<p>With AI-powered trading, investors can increase the profitability of their investments. As a result, the area of market investments is no longer limited to veterans or seasoned investors but also extends to newbies who wish to try their hand at capitalizing on market gains.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Robust Security</b></strong></h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/how-iot-changes-banks-and-fintech-companies/\">financial industry</a>, certain services are more vulnerable to security lapses and frauds. Thus, big data can play a vital role in plugging these gaps and keeping customers safer. Lending institutions and banks are making use of a combination of <u>machine learning and big data</u> (clearinghouse.org) to automate their security. Further, it keeps them two steps ahead of any miscreant who looks at exploiting security loopholes, especially in outdated systems.</p>\n<p>Location intelligence keeps track of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/improving-customer-service-using-artificial-intelligence/\">where the customer is using the financial service</a>. It also monitors the kind of products or services that they normally purchase and the number of transactions per cycle. With this information, big data can monitor and highlight deviations from the regular purchase patterns to alert and protect users from fraud.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Fewer Manual Processes</b></strong></h3>\n<p>Big data will usher with it the era of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/28/will-big-data-be-a-game-changer-for-the-banking-and-finance-sector/\">artificial intelligence and machine learning</a>. As a result, manual and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\">repetitive processes like documentation</a>, looking up customer history, etc. can be automated through algorithms. Furthermore, it also decreases the response time while also abiding by the prevailing regulatory structure.</p>\n<p>While cutting down manual processes does offer a customer-centric approach, it is feared that it will jeopardize the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/21/12-things-to-know-about-cybersecurity-now/\">job security of individuals</a> involved in these manual processes. This fear is exacerbated by the fact that technologies are more efficient, more accurate, and much cheaper. However, the displaced human resource can be utilized in new and diversified positions after thorough training.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Customer-Centric Perks</b></strong></h3>\n<p>Personalized services are one of the key takeaways of big data-assisted financial services. On the basis of the customer&#8217;s spending habits, financial institutions can offer personalized recommendations and upsell products that will meet their needs. With this value-added approach, the companies can develop customer loyalty across all verticals and enjoy a strong consumer presence.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Accurate Risk Analysis</b></strong></h3>\n<p>Previously, financial services like loans were based on one or two factors like credit score, debt-to-income ratios, etc. However, Big Data has diversified these datasets and introduced several variables that can offer a more concrete and individualistic risk assessment of the individual.</p>\n<p>Machine learning factors in economic conditions, business capital, customer segmentation, etc. in an unbiased manner to identify risky investments or defaulters.</p>\n<h3><strong><b>Key Challenges</b></strong></h3>\n<p>While, on paper, Big Data may appear like the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/11/online-id-verification-a-primer-for-fintech-businesses/\">ultimate solution for all financial institutions</a>, it does bring with it certain challenges. These obstacles may be company-specific and include:</p>\n<h4><strong><b>Data Volume</b></strong></h4>\n<p>Big Data is characterized by three &#8220;V&#8221;s: Volume, Velocity, and Variety. Essentially, it means that Big Data technologies handle vast quantities of data in a static and real-time environment while supporting multiple data types. Financial companies are either unable to compute such volumes of data or cannot access this from multiple channels. Moreover, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/why-you-need-a-data-driven-framework-to-guide-employee-experience/\">data silos make it difficult</a> to integrate all the collected Big Data.</p>\n<p>As a result, they are unable to tap into the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/25/iot-can-put-your-data-at-risk-heres-how/\">full potential of Big Data</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong><b>Accuracy and Quality</b></strong></h4>\n<p>Diluted and inaccurate data is of no apparent use. Companies have to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/top-2020-wordpress-plugins-for-business-data-visualization/\">make use of reliable data</a> to capitalize on the opportunity. When it comes to the financial industry, it becomes even more imperative to seek accurate and reliable data, which is a major challenge faced by several institutions.</p>\n<h4><strong><b>Security and Integrity</b></strong></h4>\n<p>Banking and financial institutions shall have to maintain the highest standards of safety and security when storing sensitive personal data of their customers. Any <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">security breach or possible threat</a> could result in a severe loss of trust. Some companies may not be prepared to offer this level of data security.</p>\n<h4><strong><b>Regulations</b></strong></h4>\n<p>In addition to online regulations, there are several banking regulations regarding data security, consumer privacy, reporting, and transparency. Adhering to these regulations while also keeping to digital safety can be a difficult task to balance.</p>\n<h4><strong><b>Final Thoughts</b></strong></h4>\n<p>In the years to come, it is clear that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/30/the-impact-of-using-big-data-in-industries-today/\">Big Data will revolutionize</a> how we perceive the financial industry. Big data will give companies an insight into customer behavior and profile the individual into certain types. Resultantly, this data can be of extreme value to businesses to further their business and establish a loyal customer base.</p>\n<p>It is only a matter of time until Big Data emerges as a second currency in the financial industry.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Carlos Muza; Unsplash</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/23/role-of-big-data-in-the-evolution-of-the-financial-industry/\">Role of Big Data in the Evolution of the Financial Industry</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 23 May 2020 15:00:41 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry.jpg","linkMd5":"6b0e15a20e05c44acf024070a8a0680d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-22-987_41a92ed084a0fcb0.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":40495,"destBytes":31400,"author":"Evan Morris","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Role-of-Big-Data-in-the-Evolution-of-the-Financial-Industry-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-15-109_12539c24b6fc05a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877252},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Developing a Secure FinTech App – Best Practice for 2020","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169368","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/developing-a-secure-fintech-app-best-practice-for-2020/\" title=\"Developing a Secure FinTech App &#8211; Best Practice for 2020\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"develop secure fintech app\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Over the years, we have seen a large increase in the usage of technology in finance and financial transactions. The introduction of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/23/secrets-of-financial-applications-traits-of-fintech-apps/\">financial applications</a> has ensured that the ease of use and effectiveness, which has been on a constant rise over the decade, is made possible. Here is developing a secure FinTech app &#8212; the best practices for 2020.</p>\n<p>End users can now make financial transactions through a snap of a finger through tech ease of access. But, we have to be wise in how we use the new FinTech apps.</p>\n<p>With the ease of apps <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/29/is-cloud-hosted-data-really-more-secure/\">comes the danger of financial security</a>, which is largely due to sensitive personal and business data shared on financial platforms. Care must be taken or it may result in major vulnerabilities such as data leakages and breaches.</p>\n<p>Recent studies reveal that FinTech startups, about 98% are vulnerable to cyber attacks, risk of theft, and phishing. Considering that the finance industry is one that should be 100% secure in the protection of client data, it begs a question on aspects to consider while developing a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/11/online-id-verification-a-primer-for-fintech-businesses/\">FinTech app to make it more secure</a>, while performing other functions as required.</p>\n<p>We need to look into the possible ways of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/what-happens-when-a-tech-startup-fails/\">developing a finance app</a> &#8212; keeping in mind that the security of data is paramount. Many companies forget security in their rush to get an app to market.</p>\n<h2>Integral parts of creating secure FinTech Applications.</h2>\n<p>With the focus on finding a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/improving-responses-to-medical-device-vulnerabilities/\">solution to the vulnerabilities</a> associated with developing a fintech app, this is some of the best practices on how to secure a financial app.</p>\n<h3><strong>Establish infrastructural security.</strong></h3>\n<p>It is without a doubt now that a responsible and trustworthy finance firm should consider establishing a secure infrastructure. Irrespective of either going for a private or public cloud storage system, it is imperative to make sure that cloud vendors of choice are security conscious and aligns with the modern data security standards.</p>\n<h3><strong>Establish a secure application logic.</strong></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, it is just making sure that while developing each stage of the app, security should be of conscious. In every step of the app usage, there should be a feeling of security to it. Questions like what types of data should be collected and safely secured, the passcode, and all other necessary info should be called to mind, not forgetting how best to monitor and secure the data collected.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ensure to write secure code.</strong></h3>\n<p>While it is important that your FinTech app is cross-platform responsive, it’s essential to also develop an algorithm that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/a-startup-guide-to-creating-an-ideal-customer-profile/\">allows for easy detection of flaws</a> in case of attacks or a breach. It is advisable to implement the inclusion of input validation and reviewing of data received in the app, while keeping a vivid eye on granting external access, defining clear access rules, and taking all adequate measures to secure appropriate data.</p>\n<h3><strong>Run an App Test.</strong></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s never enough, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/06/how-to-choose-top-ios-app-development-tools/\">take the time to test that app all over</a>. Through all the processes and steps, perform effective penetration tests, adhere to the standard testing process for FinTech firms, and if necessary, hire professional testers to establish efficient attack resistant code.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ensure API and Web-Server Security.</strong></h3>\n<p>APIs, as well as web-servers, are usually run on mobile devices, and this makes it a target; hence the sensitivity in its security.</p>\n<h3><strong>Encrypt Data.</strong></h3>\n<p>Considering that all info received on the app is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/16/fintech-boom-is-disrupting-the-way-companies-are-run/\">highly classified and important</a> to your end-users, it&#8217;s very necessary that you consider encrypting all the data collected on your FinTech app. You can introduce various encryption algorithms like AES which is regarded as the safest.</p>\n<h3><strong>Initiate a Payment Blocking Feature.</strong></h3>\n<p>To remain secure, one of the best ways to hinder fraudulent activities on the app is to initiate a payment blocking feature in cases of suspicious activities. This will help to ensure the immediate block of suspicious payment, say a large amount of money transfer, or an unusual location transaction.</p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/07/revolutionizing-the-banking-sector-with-next-level-mobile-apps/\">Developing a secure FinTech app</a> is a lot of work. It wouldn&#8217;t be FinTech if it&#8217;s not secure after all. It&#8217;s imperative to make sure of testing the app through this procedure, and if necessary, hire professional hands to help with the process.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/12/developing-a-secure-fintech-app-best-practice-for-2020/\">Developing a Secure FinTech App &#8211; Best Practice for 2020</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 12 May 2020 18:00:27 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App.jpg","linkMd5":"7e78b87099d477195ad9d6706fb98aee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn88@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-09-694_8c4a49ecc664bba5.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":261600,"destBytes":202436,"author":"Solomon Shojobi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Developing-a-Secure-FinTech-App-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-11-631_ba343a4c89de1186.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877604},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Trends that will Characterize the eCommerce Industry in 2020 and Beyond","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167187","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/trends-that-will-characterize-the-ecommerce-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/\" title=\"Trends that will Characterize the eCommerce Industry in 2020 and Beyond\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trends-that-will-Characterize-the-eCommerce-Industry-in-2020-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"ecommerce in 2020\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trends-that-will-Characterize-the-eCommerce-Industry-in-2020-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trends-that-will-Characterize-the-eCommerce-Industry-in-2020-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Trends-that-will-Characterize-the-eCommerce-Industry-in-2020.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In 1994, when Amazon was launched, its first package consisting of a Physics book was sent via post. Fast forward to 2020; today, drones are being deployed to deliver packages at customer doorsteps.</p>\n<p>Folks! The utopian future that was depicted in The Jetson’s Family cartoon is almost upon us. eCommerce is the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-will-it-shape-up-the-future-of-the-internet/\">key driver of the future</a>. Every year, new trends emerge in the eCommerce space at such a giddying space that it is natural to feel missed out.</p>\n<p>Even in 2020, we expect the global eCommerce space to evolve in several aspects. This blog aims to capture such trends that will shape the eCommerce space in 2020.</p>\n<p>What are those trends? Read further.</p>\n<h3><strong>Developments in on-demand deliveries.</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2019, eCommerce deliveries became time-sensitive. Numerous studies have proven that customers are willing to shell out extra bucks for same-day delivery or scheduled deliveries.<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey/2018/survey/delivery-expectation.html\"> PwC’s Global Consumer Insights Survey 2018</a> found that over<i> 40% of online shoppers said they would pay an additional charge for same-day delivery.</i></p>\n<p>From an eCommerce business perspective, same day deliveries can result in higher sales volumes. Another allied benefit is that there will be a reduction in the need for warehouse space. Thanks to the fast-paced deliveries made possible by last-mile deliveries, online stores will need only smaller distribution centers to store stocks.</p>\n<p>Now, how will the delivery scene change in 2020? Amazon’s Prime Air hints at a future when most deliveries could be made by drones<i></i>. In fact, in an interview<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/\"> with CBS News</a>, given in 2013, Jeff Bezos has hinted at the future when Amazon will deliver packages via drones. He claims that more than 86% of Amazon packages weigh less than 5 pounds. Read this fact, along with customers are willing to pay for immediate/same-day delivery, in 2020, we can expect to see more drones flying to deliver packages.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-167188\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/amazon-drone.jpg\" alt=\"eCommerce trends in 2020\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/amazon-drone.jpg 720w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/amazon-drone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/amazon-drone-240x160.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping\">Theverge</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Data privacy will take center stage.</strong></h3>\n<p>Businesses today have endless touchpoints from where they can collect and analyze user data. Web browsing cookies, mobile app usage, website behavior heatmaps, to name a few. However, reckless data collection of users could spell doom for the business. eCommerce retailers have been the infamous lot for sending too many retargeting ads and emails <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/13/it-trends-of-the-future-that-are-worth-paying-attention-to-today/\">that infiltrate user’s data privacy</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, there have been umpteen cases where brands have been found to be lethargic in protecting user data. The security breaches of British Airways, Equifax, Exactis, Cathay Pacific are a few notable examples. Accordingexciting to PWC&#8217;s<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity/digital-trust/2018-insights.html\"> 2018 Digital Trust Insights</a>, “although companies<i> encourage consumers to entrust them with their data, only 53% include proactive management of cyber and privacy risks in their digital transformation plans.”</i></p>\n<p>In 2020 and years to follow, such data privacy hindering activities will become restricted. GDPR was just a beginning to such data collection controls that hamper user’s data privacy. As data privacy takes center stage, businesses will be forced to implement new data protection measures or revamp their existing processes.</p>\n<h3><strong>Voice shopping to gallop in volumes.</strong></h3>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s Echo has 10% penetration of US homes, Google&#8217;s Home, 4%, and Microsoft&#8217;s Cortana, 2% — this is the estimated market penetration of virtual assistants in US homes. Do you know what is the most obvious feature of all these virtual assistants?</p>\n<h4><b>Voice search. </b></h4>\n<p>Right from checking how the day’s weather is going to pan out for the day to streaming on-demand music, there is so much that these virtual assistants can go. Furthermore, they have become catalysts for eCommerce as well. <a href=\"https://www.occstrategy.com/media/1285/the-talking-shop_uk.pdf\">The talking shop – the rise of voice commerce report</a> by OC&#38;C Strategy Consultants have found that by 2022, voice shopping is expected to jump to $40 billion in the US and by $5 Billion in the UK.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-167189\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voice-commerce-sales-2017-2022-02.jpeg\" alt=\"eCommerce trends Voice Shopping\" width=\"600\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voice-commerce-sales-2017-2022-02.jpeg 600w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voice-commerce-sales-2017-2022-02-300x276.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voice-commerce-sales-2017-2022-02-174x160.jpeg 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Source:<a href=\"https://voicebot.ai/2018/03/05/voice-shopping-reach-40-billion-u-s-5-billion-uk-2022/\">voicebot.ai</a></p>\n<p>Modern eCommerce retailers, if they wish to stay relevant in a business landscape led by voice search, will be forced to adapt their shopping channels to voice shopping. And 2020 will see more developments in that direction.</p>\n<h3><strong>Immersive experiences will become differentiators.</strong></h3>\n<p>One thing that makes eCommerce enticing for online shoppers is the experience of viewing, comparing, and making their final pick from an almost endless list of options. Until now, that experience was limited to watching 2D images of products from multiple angles with zoom-in and zoom-out feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/20/how-voice-technology-is-changing-the-financial-industry/\">Today’s customers</a> mostly made up of millennial age groups, want <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/the-rise-and-rise-of-mobile-payment-technology/\">immersive shopping experiences</a> packaged within their few-inch screen mobile screens.</p>\n<p>Luckily for eCommerce retailers, several new technologies can dish out immersive experiences that captivate users — augmented reality being one among the top of them. Augmented reality is one of the mixed reality technologies that embed digital snippets of data atop physical objects or surfaces.</p>\n<p>In eCommerce,<a href=\"https://www.intelivita.co.uk/blog/how-augmented-reality-is-promise-for-ecommerce-development\"> augmented reality has several applications</a>, including real-time product try-ons in actual physical surroundings. Virtual mirrors for fashion shopping to cite an example. Another real-world example if that of IKEA’s mobile app. It allows users to place their choice of furniture items in actual physical surroundings.</p>\n<p>The benefit of AR in eCommerce is twofold — first, it makes shopping enticing. Secondly, it helps reduce the volume of returns substantially. ECommerce brands that take heed in using immersive technologies will be able to differentiate themselves from the rest of the fold.</p>\n<h3><strong>Small businesses to become a dominant force.</strong></h3>\n<p>It is no secret that is the big enterprises that always hog the limelight with their dizzying stock prices and globe-spanning sales territories. But, there is another side to the story. Small businesses, typically floated by solopreneurs or by a small team of ambitious individuals, have been rising in number and volumes in recent years. They have fewer than 500 employees and yet have managed to penetrate markets that were earlier reserved for the bigwigs.</p>\n<p>According to the US Small Business Administration, there are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States, employing <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/All_States.pdf\">47.8 percent of US workers</a>. Also, studies by<a href=\"https://clutch.co/website-builders/resources/small-business-websites-2018\">Clutch.co-found that</a> <i>nearly Two-Thirds of Small Businesses Rely on Websites to Connect with Customers. At the beginning of 2018, almost two-thirds (64%) of small businesses have a website.</i></p>\n<p>In other words, it is safe, to sum up, that small businesses are a dominant force that will gather momentum in 2020 and beyond. In addition to generating employment, they will also leverage the power of eCommerce to carve a niche for themselves in a global market.</p>\n<h3><strong>Along with mobile shopping, digital wallets would also become mainstream.</strong></h3>\n<p>It is no secret that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/07/how-to-avoid-becoming-the-next-victim-of-a-data-breach/\">mobile commerce has grown</a> with leaps and bounds in recent years. However, there has been one catalyst feature that can be cited as the prime reason for this rapid growth of mobile commerce. It is a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/the-rise-and-rise-of-mobile-payment-technology/\">mobile payment facility</a> like digital wallets. The mobile payment industry is projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-payments-market\">$4,574 billion</a> by 2023.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-167192\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment-2.png\" alt=\"ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment\" width=\"800\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment-2.png 800w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment-2-300x189.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment-2-254x160.png 254w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecommerce-trends-mobile-payment-2-160x102.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://www.growcode.com/blog/ecommerce-trends/\">growcode</a></p>\n<p>There are several benefits that mobile payments and mobile wallets offer customers that make them enticing for customers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The convenience of not carrying a wallet or plastic card</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick online ordering without leaving the mobile app screen</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyalty points and rewards on transactions</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The facility of sending/receiving the money to contacts and most frequently used outlets</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>More inclination toward sustainable practices.</strong></h3>\n<p>Greta Thunberg’s flaring speech on <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/smart-cities-solving-todays-healthcare-challenges/\">climate change</a> sends ripples around the world. It was heard by businesses as well. After all, they are the biggest consumers of natural resources. Also, almost 90% of eCommerce orders being <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/12/10/google-cardboard-sdk-apps-virtual-reality-vr-headset/\">shipped in corrugated boxes</a>, which mounts huge pressure on the rainforests.</p>\n<p>With rising awareness about climate change, shoppers are inclining towards brands that have adopted eco-friendly practices. Top among them is eco-friendly packing. According to Nielsen, <i>73% of consumers say they would definitely change their consumption habits to reduce their environmental impact.</i></p>\n<p>Along with eco-friendly packing, consumers are also becoming increasingly <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/visual-merchandising-online-startups-cannot-afford-to-overlookvisual-merchandising-online-startups-cannot-afford-to-overlook/\">conscious about the products</a> they use and their impact on the environment.

In the past, and even today, this has put online stores in a spot to figure out innovative ways to meet customer expectations.</p>\n<p>There are two brands that have turned this challenge into their competitive advantage. The first is Amazon Go, which <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/06/4-unique-growth-tactics-for-2020/\">allows customers to pick up products</a>, pay for it through their Amazon Pay app without having to wait for a second at the cash counter — because there isn’t any. Although <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/31/will-we-someday-be-able-to-do-everything-through-online-platforms/\">Amazon Go is limited to groceries</a>, we can envision a future when this lightning fast way of shopping will become mainstream.</p>\n<p>After Amazon, it is Warby Parker that seems to have hit the sweet spot in impressing customers. Their <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/home-try-on\">Home Try-On</a> facility allows users to select five frames to test out for five days — and all the five frames will be shipped to customers for free.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-167193\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Warby-Parker-Try-At-Home-900x336.jpg\" alt=\"ecommerce customer policy\" width=\"900\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Warby-Parker-Try-At-Home-900x336.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Warby-Parker-Try-At-Home-300x112.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Warby-Parker-Try-At-Home-260x97.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Warby-Parker-Try-At-Home.jpg 951w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p>Source:<a href=\"https://bespokeunit.com/articles/style/warby-parker-home-try-on-glasses-review/\">bespokeuni</a></p>\n<h2>What’s in store for eCommerce in 2020</h2>\n<p>In the 1990s, when Amazon was in its initial stages,eCommerce development was hardly heard of.

Compared to conventional DNA sequencing, this is a relatively new technology. Nevertheless, </span><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02868/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are very excited about harnessing the massive amount of gut information for disease diagnosis and treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, it may become commonplace to get personalized nutrition plans and health care based on your genes and gut bacteria.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Connect with nature’s herbs and minerals</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s fast-paced society, cognitive technologies like nootropics are favored by many people who want 48 hours out of their day. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, scientists have said that there is no strong evidence in synthetic cognitive supplements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you still want ways to boost your productivity, natural compounds, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">herbs for health</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (herbcottage.com) care may be the safer option that actually works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you heard of these popular natural cognitive enhancers?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/08/6-supplements-to-solve-workplace-focus-problems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caffeine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A natural stimulant found in coffee, cocoa, and tea, which boosts alertness</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rhodiola Rosea</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a supplement derived from the herb </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rhodiola Rosea</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is often used in Chinese medicine to promote well-being and healthy brain function.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulvic minerals</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Naturally occurring organic acid found in humus that improve gut health and restore body minerals</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/08/6-supplements-to-solve-workplace-focus-problems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ginkgo biloba</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Extracted from the Ginkgo leaves, which has shown benefits for mental processing and working memory</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Replace stress hormones with happy hormones</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology and devices are great for offering valuable data, but that also means that we are constantly bombarded with information. How do we strive for a balance between performance and burnout?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer lies in our biology. Our body has intricate levels of different hormones that try to keep things in balance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we are stressed, our body produces stress hormones like cortisol. The hormone itself is not bad. It actually helps us control blood sugar levels, metabolism and blood pressure. However, a constantly high level of cortisol is known to harm both physical and mental health. In women, high cortisol also contributes to low libido and abnormal menstrual cycles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But luckily, we are also naturally equipped with happy hormones like </span><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320839#what-are-endorphins\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorphins</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These are our natural painkillers that reduce stress and pain. They activate opioid receptors in the brain, but without getting your addicted.</span></p>\n<h3><b>How do you replace stress hormones with happy hormones? </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no need for supplements.

But at the same time, they can also push our close family and friends apart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s not forget that the most </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">primitive and effective way of happiness, even in the era of technology</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is genuine human interaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Medical School</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports that people who have great relationships and social support tend to be happier and healthier. These include satisfying marriages, family, friends, and community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a landmark paper published in the journal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Science</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, researchers found that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/01/08/under-armour-record-mapmyfitness-follow-model/\">lack of social connections</a> puts people at increased risk of obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure. In contrast, those who do nourish their social relationships have better longevity, immune system, self-esteem, and many more health advantages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might not sound like a mind-blowing secret, but it is something that all of us forget sometimes. Social connections, just like our body and mind, need to be nourished. We can only live happily with new technologies when we use them to connect, but not disconnect.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/26/maintaining-perfect-health-in-the-world-of-new-technologies-and-devices/\">Maintaining Perfect Health in the World of New Technologies and Devices</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 21:01:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Maintaining-Perfect-Health-in-the-World-.jpg","linkMd5":"16fa45655fc089b14c6556b41f5161ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-24-513_b5361f7278ad9699.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Maintaining-Perfect-Health-in-the-World-.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":45221,"destBytes":35832,"author":"Michael Usiagwu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Maintaining-Perfect-Health-in-the-World--300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-16-971_244b3f7233ed7e3f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874511},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"Gotrax Xr Elite: An Electric Scooter with Kick","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173972","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/06/gotrax-xr-elite-an-electric-scooter-with-kicki/\" title=\"Gotrax Xr Elite: An Electric Scooter with Kick\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-900x675.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>From college campuses and workplaces to around town, electric scooters are gaining in popularity across the country. I&#8217;ve been eager to try one out so I started with the Gotrax Xr Elite Electric Scooter because this brand has been making a wide range of electric scooters for some time. Here&#8217;s my review.</p>\n<h2>About the Electric Scooter</h2>\n<p>Available in black only, the Gotrax Xr electric scooter is a low-priced model. It is foldable and has a large deck to stand on. There is an anti-slip material that is cushioned and helps keep me in place while riding.</p>\n<p>The electric scooter has a smart display that is easy to read while riding. It is where you control the headlights as well as access cruise control, see the speedometer, and check on battery life.</p>\n<p>There are also fairly large tires, an upgraded kickstand, powered LED taillights that activate when the scooter is on, and six retro-reflectors for good visibility at night-time.</p>\n<p>It goes about 18 miles before needing to be charged again. The battery also has protection from overcharging, over-discharging, temperature, short-circuiting, open circuiting, and over-current. The most weight it can take is about 220 pounds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173973\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-900x675.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>What I Like and What Could Be Better</h2>\n<p id=\"2-highlights\">For the price, it offers good ride quality, durability, and range for a budget-friendly price. The top speed of 15mph isn&#8217;t too bad, either. This speed comes from the upgraded 300W motor.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t weigh much, making it easy to take with me in the car to enjoy it at the park or beach. The folding mechanism is easy to use. Overall, the scooter also has a good waterproof rating.</p>\n<p>The electric scooter did fairly well at acceleration and hill climbs. Since it&#8217;s a budget model, I didn&#8217;t expect much here as I was mostly interested in taking it on flat surfaces around the neighborhood. The front and rear brakes also work well. It features disc braking and anti-lock electrical braking for responsive braking. Also, I am a big fan of the bell on it, too.</p>\n<p>They have a U.S.-based customer support team where I got fast, friendly and educated service.</p>\n<p>On the downside, there is some vibration on rougher roads, but again my expectations weren&#8217;t high, knowing I had selected an entry-level price scooter. The brakes also take some getting used to, but after practicing on the scooter a few times this was much better.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>The electric scooter costs $399. It comes with a three-month warranty, free shipping, a thirty-day return policy, and is available on the <a href=\"https://gotrax.com/products/xr-elite-commuting-electric-scooter?variant=31408323690611\">company&#8217;s website.</a></p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Gotrax Xr Elite is a budget-friendly electric scooter that is a good starter model. It has long-range and is durable enough to use every day. If you are looking for more features and technology, I&#8217;d recommend going with one of the more expensive electric scooter models.</p>\n<p>Currently, their website shows they are sold out because this is one of their most popular models, but they also note they will soon have more. This is a great gift for the commuter or college student!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/06/gotrax-xr-elite-an-electric-scooter-with-kicki/\">Gotrax Xr Elite: An Electric Scooter with Kick</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 00:00:23 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter.jpg","linkMd5":"67542710b639b785f22002d9fbc414d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-09-732_8076043a1a683c8c.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1440,"sourceBytes":329640,"destBytes":282956,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-300x225.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-16-733_df93926e2134cde4.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/go-trax-scooter-xr-elite-300x225.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-335_2e3377799c4234da.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875170},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"Blogger Outreach: The Definitive Guide for the Beginners","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170462","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/21/blogger-outreach-the-definitive-guide-for-the-beginners/\" title=\"Blogger Outreach: The Definitive Guide for the Beginners\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Blogger outreach for beginners\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Blogger outreach is developing relationships and is maintaining the same with some relevant bloggers as well as offering them high-value and relevant content which their audience and readers will find useful and engaging.

Their hard work should be your credit.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>How to do blogger outreach program in a proper way</strong></h3>\n<p>The practice of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/09/what-to-consider-when-choosing-an-influencer-marketing-agency/\">doing work with influencers</a> online as bloggers for building a favorable network that promotes novel products is noticed and earns acclaim by a wide range of customers is known as blogger outreach. Blogger outreach has five phases- planning, establishing identity, pitching, sending and promoting.</p>\n<h4><strong>How important it is?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, it is extremely important. This is because any normal buyer goes through multiple reviews before finally deciding to purchase it. Maximum reviews are in the form of blog posts. While researching about certain products or services, consumers mostly rely on advice that the bloggers give them. The information given by blogs is considered reliable. Bloggers, though influences of mid-level, have an audience that is more loyal than the audience of mega influencers.</p>\n<h4><strong>Steps for developing a blogger outreach program that kisses success</strong></h4>\n<p>These steps will definitely help you in your target of developing a blogger outreach program in a proper way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decide your goals-</strong> It is important that you determine your objectives. If you want to make your brand popular, build brand awareness. This will definitely entice new visitors and thus, increase sales.</li>\n<li><strong>Do good research-</strong> Spend time in researching to know about the leading bloggers for getting the best out of <a href=\"https://snchatterjee.com/start-guest-blogging/\">guest post blogging</a>. You will learn about the focus of dominant bloggers and then decide whether to link building service with them will be beneficial for you or not.</li>\n<li><strong>Search for relevant bloggers-</strong> Searching for relevant bloggers is one of the most important tasks in hand. You need to find bloggers who will be useful for you as well as your brand.</li>\n<li><strong>Homework matters-</strong> Contacting bloggers of all kinds will not at all be helpful for you. Do proper homework and find out after reading the blogs, which ones you require for the brand of yours. For insights, their most common posts can be examined.</li>\n<li><strong>Engage with bloggers and build credibility-</strong> For making connections, comment on the contents written by them and also share some of their good contents on social platforms. You don’t have to be overly obsequious. When you meet bloggers, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/20/3-steps-to-get-your-guest-post-pitch-accepted/\">try to be creative</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a unique and tailored communication-</strong> You need to give bloggers offers that they will find unique and impressive.

Show support to bloggers and by support, we do not mean you need to be overfriendly.</li>\n<li><strong>The resource has to be flexible-</strong> Present yourself in such a way so that you are considered as a useful resource. Try to help bloggers in their hour of need to build long-lasting relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring of results-</strong> Tracking the results is extremely important for a blogger outreach program.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>How blogger outreach is useful in business?</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are opting for blogger outreach service for working on your blogging and contents and also marketing of your content, then better you look for some of the qualities of your companies before selecting them, which are given below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blogger outreach uses the materials and stuff, from various formats available like the press release, social media sites, content marketing, and SEM or SEO. It gives stress on the importance of the keywords which are written in black, and also <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/15/a-comprehensive-guide-to-a-content-audit/\">the kind of content</a> in the blog that it leads to.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The team experts of a blogger outreach service should help you with the knowledge of the criteria. You should be able to have an exact idea of your targeted audience and hence make an analytics report based on your idea. Blogger outreach should be able to make your blog dominating and influencing the audience and should also make the good promotion of your sites and brands.While you are primarily on the basis of promoting your products you’ve to brainstorm the minds of your target audience by providing and soliciting what you intend to offer. Hence it can be said that the blog must be interrelating with your brand’s scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to build up the contact then try sending a complimentary material with the blogger. You should then be able to introduce it to the person. The company which you prefer for your job should be able to introduce you to that person. They should feature your brand and your message to that person and should let you know the details like the likes and dislikes of that person before your services are offered.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The lifestyle of the targeted audience must be included in your promotional phase.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure, that the content which you are writing and your company is marketing should be available to the maximum number of customers, on the search engine. If a person sits on the internet for some activity related to your site, they go through various online content and sites to get the proper information and reference.Also, the company should be able to get honest feedback from the users. They must provide and insert some high-quality keywords and phrases to your content to get the traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence the blogger outreach service should not <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/10/how-iot-will-change-content-marketing/\">distract a user from the content</a> but rather the person using your site should receive the appropriate and the exact information, about the content or topic he is searching for. They should be able to build a cordial and warm relationship, between the business people and the blogger (which is you).</p>\n<p><em>Following all these steps will effectively expand your credibility among the audience.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/21/blogger-outreach-the-definitive-guide-for-the-beginners/\">Blogger Outreach: The Definitive Guide for the Beginners</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 15:00:08 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners.jpg","linkMd5":"9a3fbdfbcec1fc6994ceb9bf193444a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-920_2be3ce83970b02d8.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":157435,"destBytes":145414,"author":"Debraj Chatterjee","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blogger-outreach-for-beginners-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-19-389_33fffc2a94ee6fe1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875493},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"4 Ways to Feel Less Stressed During Quarantine","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171552","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/4-ways-to-feel-less-stressed-during-quarantine/\" title=\"4 Ways to Feel Less Stressed During Quarantine\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"stressed during COVID\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>When our health and that of our loved ones are threatened, it causes stress. When our source of income is threatened, and our lives have been turned upside down by coronavirus, the pressure, and anxiety feels like the new normal.</p>\n<h2>We wake up to an endless battle every day with all the COVID stuff.</h2>\n<p>Our battle begins by staying safe from the highly contagious COVID-19. We battle to keep our homes stocked with food amid a pandemic, and a battle to find the right strategies to keep our businesses afloat. It is almost impossible not to focus on the uncertain future, and that has left many of us scared, frustrated, and depressed.</p>\n<h3>Does it seem impossible to shake off stress and anxiety at the moment?</h3>\n<p>For many, it may appear impossible to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/30/building-a-startup-culture-that-encourages-wellness/\">shake off stress and anxiety</a> at the moment. Experts argue that it is possible for the human mind to learn the resilience and new coping mechanism that is needed to soldier through this pandemic.</p>\n<p>According to Shevaun D. Neupert, Ph.D., a psychology professor at North Carolina State University, people need to think slightly outside the box in order to alleviate stress during the ongoing quarantine.</p>\n<p>Thinking slightly outside the box seems to be a stretch &#8212; particularly true because life as we know it has been so drastically disrupted right now. We&#8217;ve all worked <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/17/4-effective-ways-to-manage-work-stress/\">on stress coping strategies</a> &#8212; and they were working <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/big-data-as-a-double-edged-sword-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/\">before the coronavirus hit</a>. Is it just me &#8212; or are all the strategy is obsolete now?</p>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s explore four out-of-the-box ideas that will help you feel less stressed during the quarantine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Embrace the change</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grocery shopping has been turned into a difficult, stressful, and sometimes traumatic experience. Don’t allow this change to disorient your mind. Accept that grocery shopping is no longer the ordinary errand you used to run by yourself and instead embrace online grocery shopping.</p>\n<p>Instead of freaking out because you can’t cook and restaurants have closed down, why don’t you teach yourself how to prepare simple freezer meals through online tutorials? Freezer meals mean that you will not have to cook every day. Don’t overstretch your budget with online food delivery services, especially now that you aren’t sure of your financial future.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that we are all dealing with these changes together. No one has any tried-and-approved techniques of coping with the change, so you shouldn’t carry the burden silently. Join different communities online and try to figure out solutions together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Exercise</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maintaining a stable exercise routine has worked before for your troubled mind; it will work again this time. Exercising will get you off the couch and away from the stressful news headlines. It is your one chance to kill time and maintain your health and fitness status. Secondly, working out may help maintain a sense of normalcy to your schedule at a time when everything feels uncertain.</p>\n<p>At a scientific level, exercise has been proven to facilitate the release of endorphins in the human brain. Endorphins are directly linked to increasing a person’s sense of well-being, boosting mood, and neutralizing stress hormones. These benefits are needed now more than ever because stress levels are building up unprecedentedly fast.</p>\n<p>Because many exercises can be done at home, including some that don’t require you to have any exercise equipment, there is no reason why you shouldn’t add an excellent workout to your daily routine. You can even acquire a few motorized bicycles (bikeberry.com) for you and your family members. These bikes are great because they will give you a full-body workout, get your heart pumping, and get you sweating without stressing your knee joints.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Avoid the chaos</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stop obsessing over endless Coronavirus coverage. Switch off your TV and stop over-researching the pandemic online. All you need to know about this virus is how to protect yourself and the people you love. The scary statistics and daily updates aren’t necessary, especially if you struggle with anxiety. If you must research, ensure that you get all your information only from credible websites such as the official WHO website.</p>\n<p>Avoiding chaos also means keeping your home organized and clean. Take this quarantine period to declutter your home and your life. Attend to your indoor plants, for example, just to make your living spaces livelier. Take better care of your pets and your loved ones now that you have the time. Use your time to improve your living condition.</p>\n<p>You will also reduce your stress levels by trying to stick to your normal routine as possible. Try not to eat in bed, for example, and instead eat at the kitchen table or the dining area as you do on normal days. Instead of working from the sofa while wearing pajamas, work at your desk or home office, and be sure to wear pants. Loosening your normal routine can mess up your mind and leave you feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Look to a positive future</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing is certain: the coronavirus pandemic will eventually end. No one knows when, but it will end. Take your imagination to places where you cannot go because of the lockdown. Project your mind to the future- a future where you will party, travel, work, and make a better life for yourself. Learn a language or skill.</p>\n<h5><b>Conclusion</b></h5>\n<p>Don’t let this indefinite isolation dim your spirits. Don’t allow information overload to trouble your mind. Putting these issues out of your mind is how you will survive the spiraling negative thoughts that coronavirus uncertainty has precipitated. We are going to be okay. We are strong.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/22/4-ways-to-feel-less-stressed-during-quarantine/\">4 Ways to Feel Less Stressed During Quarantine</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 22 May 2020 18:00:06 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine.jpg","linkMd5":"bb5fe8c57527dd66c530c3011f8e7dd1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-26-818_5cf9ad2cb9afd71d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":23520,"destBytes":16228,"author":"Elliot Rhodes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-Ways-to-Feel-Less-Stressed-During-Quarantine-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-22-238_40e289b913799279.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877519},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"Tailoring Your 2020 Strategy to Win in the Remote Workplace","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171312","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/08/tailoring-your-2020-strategy-to-win-in-the-remote-workplace/\" title=\"Tailoring Your 2020 Strategy to Win in the Remote Workplace\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tailoring-Your-2020-Strategy-to-Win-in-the-Remote-Workplace-300x197.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"remote workplace\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tailoring-Your-2020-Strategy-to-Win-in-the-Remote-Workplace-300x197.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tailoring-Your-2020-Strategy-to-Win-in-the-Remote-Workplace-244x160.jpg 244w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tailoring-Your-2020-Strategy-to-Win-in-the-Remote-Workplace.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In a survey last year, three out of four workers worldwide said they considered flexible working to be “the new normal,” according to the <a href=\"https://assets.regus.com/pdfs/iwg-workplace-survey/iwg-workplace-survey-2019.pdf\">2019 Global Workspace Survey</a>. Since then, remote work has spiked. Tailoring your strategy in 2020 will be a key factor in ensuring business success and achieving, or at least continuing to progress towards, your business goals in 2020. Fix your strategy to win in the remote workplace.</p>\n<p>A strategy that moves the needle on business objectives doesn’t need to be tied to an office space. It often checks off three important boxes that can be completed near or far: prioritizing employee experience, tracking progress in real-time to know when to revise, and finding new ways to collaborate when setting and executing strategy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Prioritizing Employee Experience</strong></h3>\n<p>With the workforce at home,<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/why-you-need-a-data-driven-framework-to-guide-employee-experience/\"> employee experience</a> might seem like an afterthought &#8212; out of sight, out of mind &#8212; however, neglecting to prioritize employee experience would be a major blow to strategy execution. After all, as leaders carve out a way to make sure strategy is implemented effectively, it’s important to remember that execution is performed by, well, actual people.</p>\n<h4><strong>Business goal-setting lives in the world of paradox.</strong></h4>\n<p>Goal setting needs to be both ambitious but realistic, visionary yet concrete. It is essential that this balance surfaces in your overall strategy along with specific and actionable plans that help to execute your strategy throughout your organization.</p>\n<p>One way to ensure this is to slice company goals down into smaller, measurable fragments. With measurable fragments, employees, and relevant larger groups (departments and teams) are more likely to stay the course even as they’re located remotely.</p>\n<p>Specificity and quantifiability allow easier progress tracking and improve motivation, resulting in a great employee experience across all levels and teams.</p>\n<h4><strong>Focusing on transparent actions and cross-level communications.</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/03/5-common-strategy-mistakes-your-company-must-address-now/\">Transparent communication</a> is naturally, one of the best solutions for ensuring people in your organization feel heard. Transparency propels motivation, alignment and engagement while helping your team to better understand each other and achievement (or lack thereof) of respective goals.</p>\n<p>Transparency helps to highlight individual progress or times when an employee might need help, particularly when it is effectively integrated with communication tools, automated dashboards, and executive reporting.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tracking Progress In Real-Time to Know When to Revise</strong></h3>\n<p>While breaking <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/04/cognitive-automation-is-the-immediate-future-of-team-management/\">down goals and outlining how to achieve them</a> in your organization is a key foundation to a successful strategy, oftentimes leaders will “set and forget” goals &#8212; a sometimes fatal mistake for a blossoming business.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in a distributed workforce regular checkpoints become essential for keeping projects on track, but if the goals aren’t at the forefront of day-to-day actions, execution can become unproductive or stray off course.</p>\n<h4><strong>For some teams with established communications systems, the leader’s whereabouts are nonessential to the success of the team.</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/03/4-office-improvements-to-optimize-your-teams-productivity/\">Track productivity and aligning remote workers</a> around unifying goals and targets in real-time is an effective way to promote strong leadership and delegate clear tasks amongst team members. It is critical to identify immediately when your strategy isn’t resonating with the people responsible for executing it.</p>\n<p>You will likely see this in a post-quarterly review, but what if you could see it on a daily basis (or even in real-time whenever you needed it)? Think of the impact that might have on redirected strategy or execution gone wrong.</p>\n<p>There are many new tools designed to automate the work that teams are doing &#8212; after all, automation is a top priority for many businesses as they seek to improve processes and expand. Some of these are one-off tools, but there are options available that allow you to automate and integrate with many existing tools that your workers already use (ex. Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams).</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/31/g-suite-tips-to-make-workplace-collaboration-less-frightening/\">seamless integration</a> ensures that everything your employees do to progress toward company goals is automatically recorded in real-time and compiled into a simple and visual dashboard.</p>\n<p>Tracking progress automatically is the best way to ensure <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/07/7-tools-you-need-in-your-technology-stack/\">maximum productivity.</a> Automation can help scale activity tracking to an enterprise-level while also providing fascinating data insights into a remote worker’s performance—and the performance of the company as a whole.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/24/why-you-need-a-data-driven-framework-to-guide-employee-experience/\">data to inform performance</a> (and, conversely, performance to inform data) highlights the human issues that sometimes lie behind organizational problems. It equips an organization to change and improve and its employees to be productive team members and contributors to the company’s cause.</p>\n<h3><strong>Finding New Ways to Collaborate When Setting and Executing Strategy</strong></h3>\n<p>Two of the biggest challenges in collaboration that may confront remote workforces are a feeling of disconnect to the organization’s goals and priorities as well as a general lack of visibility into workloads, progress, teams, and management.</p>\n<p>These are common challenges for teams meeting face-to-face as well, and they go hand-in-hand when inhibiting teams from being productive and collaborating properly.</p>\n<p>Shifting to a remote workforce completely changes the context in which teams work together, and it can make tasks and projects more difficult to accomplish. One solution to this disconnect is relying on management software to increase transparency within and across teams in an organization.</p>\n<h4><strong>Use data and communication throughout an organization via a goal management platform.</strong></h4>\n<p>Companies can encourage and illuminate ways for all employees to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/09/building-creativity-into-remote-teams/\">be productive team members</a> who are all making a difference to the organization’s overarching goals. Technology like this can also help organizations make sure every teammate is aware of their responsibilities, and more importantly accountable for them so that everyone in the organization is contributing – which is a big part of being collaborative.</p>\n<p>In short, aligning <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/19/5-keys-to-a-successful-devops-implementation-in-your-organization/\">employees against a shared set of objectives</a> and then using data to provide a centralized, transparent tracker for each goal is a highly effective way to promote collaboration across functions, geographies and roles.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pivoting your strategy to win in the remote workplace doesn’t take much effort. </strong></h4>\n<p>Take a few simple shifts that can transform the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/04/simple-branding-is-key-for-complex-tech-says-renegades-drew-neisser/\">execution of a strategic vision</a> and lead to business wins down the road.

The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/trends-that-will-characterize-the-ecommerce-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/\">privacy act </a>has given broad rights to the consumers over their data that organizations hold. Here is CCPA for marketers and what you really need to know about it.</p>\n<p>The CCPS allows consumers to have <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\">complete transparency</a> and control over all types of personal data. These regulations have been especially difficult for marketing and advertising companies. Especially those businesses that rely on sharing and processing consumer information to develop an efficient marketing plan that will reach the right people.</p>\n<p>With all these regulations in place, it begs the question. How will marketing organizations prepare marketing plans without having full control over their customers&#8217; information?</p>\n<h2>How does CCPA impact marketers?</h2>\n<p>Whether an organization collects its consumers’ information through social media or other means such as an email survey, CCPA requires them to disclose what information is being collected and how it will be used. This requirement is known as ‘right to be informed’ under the <a href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/what-does-it-mean-to-be-ccpa-compliant/\">CCPA</a>.</p>\n<p>CCPA gives broad rights to consumers on how businesses collect and process their data. Upon request by a consumer, a business that collects and processes data on California residents must disclose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What it collects.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where it collects.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why it collects.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whom it shared with.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>CCPA gives consumers the right to opt-out of</strong><strong> having information being sold to third-parties.</strong></h4>\n<p>For companies that earn revenue through selling data, it will be a struggle to work around this restriction, potentially putting a dent in revenues.</p>\n<h4><strong>CCPA has also had a substantial impact on digital advertising.</strong></h4>\n<p>The impact on digital advertising happens because digital advertising works on the transfer of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/11/how-to-use-behavioral-data-to-inform-marketing-decisions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumer data from a data broker to the advertiser</a>. The ad-serving platform has many other layers of supported systems in between broker and advertiser &#8212; often a third-party business.</p>\n<p>If an organization is required to comply with the CCPA, it cannot transfer this data without the consumers&#8217; consent.</p>\n<p>So far, it seems like the CCPA is only having a negative impact on the marketing sector as it is restricting marketers from virtually doing anything as most of their operations rely on the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/10/as-digital-identities-evolve-data-security-should-too/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sharing of data</a>.</p>\n<h2>What Marketers Need to Do to Comply?</h2>\n<p>Trying to comply with the CCPA can be difficult for the marketing sector. The process is not just a matter of applying the same rules throughout the organization in hopes of complying with the CCPA rules. Instead, there have to be different goals set at each level to ensure that compliance can be met efficiently.</p>\n<p>At the highest level, marketers need to make it their personal responsibility to understand how personal data at their company has been used to message and serve customers. They also need to ensure their team has a clear understanding and has proper training on the law and compliance processes. Lastly, they need to make sure that these responsibilities delegate within the organization as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>On the next level of following CCPA rules, clarify the following roles:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate an individual who has the responsibility of reviewing proposed regulations to understand how it impacts your business.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicating a person who is responsible for mapping personal data and gathering notices across all internal and external systems.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure these notices are presented to customers via the privacy policy page and &#8220;<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/30/do-not-sell-my-info/\">do not sell my info</a>&#8221; links placed on the website homepages.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing and carrying out online and offline consumer rights requests.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train request handlers or assist consumers in exercising their rights under CCPA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/09/formulate-a-digital-marketing-strategy-using-ai/\">within your marketing team</a>, make sure if you&#8217;re providing discounts that could be perceived as an exchange for personal information, calculate the monetary value, and communicate that information in your privacy policy.</p>\n<p>You also need to understand how the CRM and marketing systems will send messages and whether these messages comply. Finally, connect with service providers and legal teams working on vendor contracts to ensure consistency when handling the rights requests you receive.</p>\n<h2>CCPA Compliance Checklist for Marketers</h2>\n<p>To comply with the CCPA, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/23/biometrics-payments-and-enhanced-customer-experience/\">organizations have to incorporate</a> all the following points to wholly and efficiently comply. See how many of the following points have you checked out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Update Privacy Policies</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although companies follow the strictest standards when drafting privacy policies, they need to make sure that their policies are compliant with the CCPA.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Create Methods of Accessibility</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Establish a means for the customer to easily request data access and data deletion. This could be at minimum a toll-free number</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Verification System</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People that can verify their identification can access their information held by organizations. Verification systems will be a part of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/11/ccpa-regulation-smb-and-ad-tech-how-will-they-co-exist/\">CCPA compliance regulations</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Data Governance</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prepare records, data maps and inventories of Californian’s personal data to fulfill any requests in an efficient and timely manner</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Opt-Out Button</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding in an opt-out button will help you stay compliant without the added hassle of manually updating that customer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><b>Obtain Consent from Minors</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Minors under the age of 16 will not automatically consent under CCPA. Organizations need to develop a process by which they can obtain direct consent from those aged 13-16 years, or parents consent from minors under 13 years.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The CCPA has really made operations for the marketing sector, but these barriers bring with it opportunities as well. Organizations need to make sure that the regulations are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/03/ccpa-do-the-penalties-fit-the-crime/\">enforced within all levels of the organization</a> to make sure that compliance is easily achievable.</p>\n<p>Regulations that are easily enforced means that there needs to be a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/15/how-will-iot-improve-the-way-startups-do-business-in-2020/\">proper level of training,</a> responsibility, and tracking. As well as proper records to stay ahead of the CCPA and other global privacy regulations.</p>\n<p>Organizations might find tracking and enforcing an added task. But in the long term, these regulations are going to be beneficial for both consumers and organizations alike. Doing the right thing is only a matter of adapting.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/17/ccpa-for-marketers-what-you-really-need-to-know/\">CCPA for Marketers: What You Really Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 17 May 2020 15:00:16 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CCPA-for-marketers-what-you-need-to-know.jpeg","linkMd5":"1054f704492363ec54a74e486e8970f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-21-904_b563a13f25fdaf19.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CCPA-for-marketers-what-you-need-to-know.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":41813,"destBytes":35286,"author":"Anas Baig","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CCPA-for-marketers-what-you-need-to-know-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn6@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-09-573_951e49f960f02a3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877014},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"Sales Prospecting Techniques for Sales Development Reps","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167180","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/sales-prospecting-techniques-for-sales-development-reps/\" title=\"Sales Prospecting Techniques for Sales Development Reps\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"sales prospecting techniques\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>New sales development reps (SDRs) are born into this world inspired, energetic souls. They win a job they really don’t know much about based on the belief they’ll be able to smash through walls for the sales team. At some point, ambition meets reality.</p>\n<h3><strong>The SDRs realize sales prospecting is more about chipping away at that wall &#8212; rather than flinging themselves against it.</strong></h3>\n<p>In this blog post, you will find some successful <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/07/7-tools-you-need-in-your-technology-stack/\">sales prospecting</a> techniques that may be just what your SDRs need to attack <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/03/connected-digital-assistants-will-change-the-way-we-work/\">that wall with a sharp pick</a>, and strike it for maximum impact.</p>\n<h3>What structure should be around the SDR function?</h3>\n<p>Our primary goal with the techniques in this blog post is to put some structure around the SDR function, to help Sales better describe the SDR mission and provide guidance on the <a href=\"https://www.getcloudapp.com/use-cases/sales\">sales tools and methods </a>they should employ to get the job done.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the responsibilities that sales development representatives?</strong></h3>\n<p>Closing leads is not one of them. Instead, SDRs find leads, connect with them, and determine whether they can turn into potential customers. An essential part of their job is finding businesses and identifying their needs. The second step is understanding how the company they represent can cater to those needs through the product they offer. Some of the next steps are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demonstration</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategy call</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fit assessment</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultation</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technical call</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>After educating and sending resources to potential customers, SDRs decide who will become a viable customer.</strong></h3>\n<p>Then, the SDR will pass along these contacts to sales representatives, who eventually close the leads. It doesn&#8217;t have to be as complicated as Chess &#8212; but the process does require some thought and strategy to be properly executed.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-166792\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1310\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line.jpg 1920w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line-300x205.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line-900x614.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line-235x160.jpg 235w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line-1536x1048.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line-182x125.jpg 182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>The SDR Mission</b></h3>\n<p>From the start, make the SDR mission clear. Maybe your SDRs already know this, but it helps them focus. So, what is their primary mission?</p>\n<p>Sales development representatives should know that finding the right opportunities is the big chunk of this job. To achieve this mission, they will need to reach accounts on a monthly basis and identify leads that are approaching the sales cycle. It is also critical for <a href=\"https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/sales-management\">sales management</a> to ensure the strategy is in place to achieve these goals.</p>\n<h3><b>SDR Goals Front and Center</b></h3>\n<p>Sales are always pretty clear on goals. Get the sale. Period. SDRs need the same clarity because their goals are a little more nebulous and diffuse. They need to support deals, generate opportunities that will become those deals and interact with enough people to make that all feasible. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/17/10-ways-smart-businesses-are-leveraging-iot-and-ai-to-bolster-business-conversion-in-2019/\">So, lay it all out there nice and simple for the SDRs</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the <a href=\"https://www.fourquadrant.com/setting-goals-for-sdrs/\">most common goals</a> for sales development representatives are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generating new opportunities</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting introductory meetings setup</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hosting demos</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating semi-qualified meetings</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passing fully qualified opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Garbage in, Garbage Out</b></h3>\n<p>Some of the best guidance you can provide an SDR is around <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/11/supercharge-your-sales-efforts-with-deep-learning/\">building a strong prospecting foundation</a>. Without the right database volume or the right contacts in that database, your SDR will be set up to fail. But with regular guidance and checks on their<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/27/how-ai-will-help-sales-representatives/\"> prospecting database</a>, you can ensure every SDR has a snowball’s chance.</p>\n<h3>Its a team effort to organize and get the most of your database.</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-165863\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups.jpg 1920w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>Go With the Flow</b></h3>\n<p>Inbound marketing leads &#8211; a creation of content and campaigns that bring in website visitors and convert them into leads, will be an important part of your SDRs job. You need to think of them as a l<a href=\"https://www.leadfuze.com/sales-development-representative-sdr/\">iaison between your marketing and sales operations</a>.</p>\n<p>Sales development representatives must understand your marketing funnel and customer journey map to be able to connect with potential customers. On the marketing side, some of their responsibilities can be analyzing the pages their target leads have viewed, marketing <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/14/how-to-send-the-warmest-cold-emails/\">emails</a> they have opened, and much more.</p>\n<p>This information will allow them to learn early on how the lead flow works and how to properly handle Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs).</p>\n<h3><b>The Proper Response</b></h3>\n<p>As SDRs interact with prospects you’ll want them to properly triage the leads. This helps keep the prospecting database clean and ensures you’re able to track the success of each SDR. You’ll want to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/startup-essentials-stop-overcomplicating-your-processes/\">keep this process as simple</a> as possible. Resist the urge to introduce nuanced categorization of leads. You don’t want a bunch of judgment calls clouding your data and slowing down your SDRs.</p>\n<h3><b>Use BANT to Qualify Prospects</b></h3>\n<p>Before we dive into ways BANT can help your SDRs identify qualified prospects, let’s discuss what this term stands for. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/bant\">BANT</a> is a sales qualification method that lets your SDRs determine whether the potential lead is a good fit based on their budget, ability to buy, need, and timing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Budget</strong><b>. It is important that your SDRs know that the budget should not be a blocker if the potential lead fits the other important criteria. To make it work, they can offer the potential customer a more affordable monthly subscription.</b></li>\n<li><strong>Authority.</strong> When contacting a prospective lead, your SDRs should ask themselves if the person on the other end is in a position to make a decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Need.</strong> Remember &#8211; people will be interested in buying a product if it directly caters to their needs or solves their problems. Therefore, your SDRs should always be aware of the obstacles their potential leads are facing to be able to find common ground with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing.</strong> To be able to better understand prospective customers, SDRs should know in what timeframe they are looking to implement a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>How Can Your Company Benefit From an SDR Team?</b></h3>\n<p>Some people are not sure if their organization needs an SDR team, and some also assume that salespeople can carry out the responsibilities designed for sales development representatives. So, do you really need an SDR team? If yes, how can they contribute to your company’s success?</p>\n<p>To begin with, you should know that finding prospective customers and reaching out to them takes a long time. In fact, it can take <a href=\"https://blog.topohq.com/proven-framework-successful-sales-development-team/\">60-90 dials</a> to get an appointment with a prospect. Moreover, not all salespeople are trained to identify the right customers and generate interest. As a result, the<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/13/ai-is-not-the-holy-grail-of-sales-at-least-not-yet/\"> productivity of your sales representatives</a> will suffer, as they spend most of their time on finding the wrong leads and not being able to close them.</p>\n<p>Having a successful sales development team means having a higher conversion rate. As a matter of fact, it has been recorded that <a href=\"https://blog.topohq.com/proven-framework-successful-sales-development-team/\">a company that has an optimized SDR team converts leads at 40%</a>. This can be explained by the fact that when employees have clear responsibilities they tend to perform better.</p>\n<p>If you already have an SDR team, the above-mentioned techniques will help your employees improve their work performance and increase efficiency. Besides these techniques, your SDRs should also keep in mind that the keys to sales success is being patient with their prospects, listening to their concerns, and offering a viable solution.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/sales-prospecting-techniques-for-sales-development-reps/\">Sales Prospecting Techniques for Sales Development Reps</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 16:00:12 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps.jpg","linkMd5":"cddb108091bc190929590834b23ab819","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-23-817_43389af9b5cfc300.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":253284,"destBytes":188680,"author":"Joe Martin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sales-Prospecting-Techniques-for-Sales-Development-Reps-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-23-503_48cf815247621f9b.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-Mastering-Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Boost-Your-Bottom-Line.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-18-159_cb58ddc09f1c3ae0.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-love-with-startups.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-20-487_c5fe049ede36c828.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879856},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","title":"How Will We Talk to Machines in the Future?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=175919","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/15/how-will-we-talk-to-machines-in-the-future/\" title=\"How Will We Talk to Machines in the Future?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"How Will We Talk to Machines in the Future?\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Computers and other machines are fantastic tools that allow us to become more productive, learn more information, and stay connected with each other. But in order to use them, we need to “communicate” with them in some way. Historically, this has been with the manual inputs of a mouse and keyboard (or a touchscreen), using a screen to read what the computer returns to us.</p>\n<p>In the past decade or so, we’ve seen the gradual rise of a new way of talking to machines: <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/22/evolution-of-speech-technology/\">voice and speech recognition</a>. But will this mode of “talking to machines” persist into the future? And if so, how might it evolve?</p>\n<h3>The State of Technology</h3>\n<p>First, let’s take a look at the state of modern technology. People are still using keyboards, mice, and touchscreens for much of their daily interactions, but increasingly, they’re turning to voice-based interactions. We can run searches on popular search engines with a simple phrase. We can say out loud what we’d like to type, and our phones can translate that into written text. We can even <a href=\"https://www.visix.com/resources/blog/talk-to-your-digital-signs-using-a-voice-user-interface/\">install digital signs that can talk to our customers</a> or directly engage with them.</p>\n<p>Over the years, voice-based interactions have grown to become incredibly sophisticated. In the early days of this technology’s development, it was basically a gamble; in most cases, the system wouldn’t “hear” you correctly, or it would misinterpret what you were trying to say. But these days, the most popular digital assistants and speech recognition programs can detect and understand human speech with human-like accuracy.</p>\n<p>In line with this, human beings have gradually become accustomed to voice-based interactions. In 2010, you might have felt foolish saying something like “OK Google,” or “Hey Alexa” to one of your devices. But in 2020, this is commonplace. In fact, it’s stranger when we see someone who doesn’t frequently interact with their machines in some way.</p>\n<h3>Why Voice Has Taken Over</h3>\n<p>Why has speech recognition seen such an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/07/17/speech-recognition-renaissance-disruption-dl1/\">impressive growth and development rate</a> in recent years? There are a few possible explanations. The first is that voice is simply more convenient than using your hands for everything. If you’re driving a car and you want to keep your hands on the wheel while typing a message, you can simply think “out loud” and take care of it. If your fingers are sore from a long day of typing, you can switch to voice-based inputs and give your hands a break. If you’re in the living room with no device nearby and you need to know the name of the actor in the show you just watched, you can speak your query aloud and get it addressed in moments.</p>\n<p>Voice is also low-hanging fruit when it comes to technological development. As we’ll see, there are alternative modes of machine-human communication that are much more sophisticated, and may take decades to fully develop—but we’ve practically mastered voice search in just a few years.</p>\n<p>Consumers see the benefits, and the technology keeps getting better. So it makes sense why voice-based interactions with machines have become the new norm.</p>\n<h3>Potential Issues With Voice</h3>\n<p>That said, there are some potential issues with voice-based machine interactions, even over the long term:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data privacy. </strong>Every new technology brings <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/20/ai-privacy-line-ai-as-a-helper-and-as-a-danger/\">concerns about privacy with it</a>. Much of our voice-based search and speech recognition technology is with us at all times; we have a smartphone on our person and a smart speaker in the corner of our living room. Are these systems listening to our conversations when we don’t want them to? What kinds of data are they gathering and sending to their tech company masters?</li>\n<li><strong>Misinterpretations. </strong>Even with sophisticated developments in recent years, speech recognition can fail. This is especially true when people are speaking with accents, or when they can’t articulate full thoughts for varying reasons.</li>\n<li><strong>The learning curve.</strong> Accessibility may also be an issue, especially with people who struggle with speech anyway. To get the best possible results, you have to speak in a clear, direct voice and articulate each of your words precisely. This isn’t intuitive for all users.</li>\n<li><strong>Background noise.</strong> High-quality speech recognition can still get muddied if there are significant levels of background noise. This means speech recognition is only ideal in certain locations and contexts; you can’t use it at a rock concert or on a construction site, for example.</li>\n<li><strong>Psychological effects.</strong> We’re still in the early days of voice search, but long-term, we may find that speech-based interactions with machines have psychological consequences. For example, we may find it hard to talk to machines without feeling some kind of emotional attachment to them, or we may condition ourselves to interact with the world in different ways because of our interactions with machines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How Voice Can Be Improved</h3>\n<p>Tech companies are continuously looking for ways they can improve their voice interactions and get an edge on the competition. These are some of the most important areas of focus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accuracy. </strong>Already, speech recognition systems are at least as good as human beings, with some systems exceeding human capabilities. However, there’s still room to improve in terms of accuracy, especially when it comes to fringe cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Predictive functionality.</strong> <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/22/predictive-analytics-how-to-turbocharge-your-digital-marketing-strategy/\">Combined with predictive analytics</a>, voice- and speech-based interactions could become even more impressive. Machines could ask us prompting questions rather than relying on our one-way inputs, and make active suggestions about things we might need.</li>\n<li><strong>Emotional context. </strong>It’s also worth considering the development of emotional context reading in digital assistants, or even mimicking human emotional content in their responses. For example, a digital assistant may be able to tell from your tone that you’re angry or afraid, and it may respond to you with a kind of technologically simulated empathy. Though the “creepy” factor may be high in this dimension, it could hypothetically lead to more natural interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Alternatives to Voice</h3>\n<p>So will we ever move away from voice as a mode of interaction with machines? That remains to be seen, but there are a handful of contenders that could one day replace both speech and manual entry—even if they’re years away from full development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gestures. </strong>One of the most interesting possible developments is communication with machines <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/10/05/gesture-control-moves-from-keyboards/\">in the form of gestures</a>. Rather than explicitly instructing your device what it should do, you can move your eyes in a certain pattern to call up a specific function, or you can move your fingers through the air to manipulate a holographic interface. Gestures are silent and more abstract than voice, making them simpler and more accessible in many ways. However, there may still be a steep learning curve—and the technology isn’t ready to be mainstream yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Thoughts. </strong>A handful of companies are looking into the possibilities of direct brain to machine interactions; in other words, you may one day be able to control your computer with your thoughts alone, the same way you might control the movements of your arms and legs. This is a scary thought to many, since it implies the connective interaction can operate in both directions. However, this technology is still in the earliest phases, so the presence or absence of problems will be difficult to anticipate.</li>\n<li><strong>Other communication methods.</strong> It’s hard to imagine what the future of machine and human communications might look like, so we can’t rule out the possibility of other, more abstract models. Some tech innovator might come up with a novel method of direct communication that we can’t even conceive of yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now, voice-based controls and communications remain the dominant force in the ways we exchange information with machines. The technology is so sophisticated that most people can harness its potential easily. There are problems with its use, including privacy concerns and limited predictive abilities, but these may be mitigated (or eliminated) with further development.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/15/how-will-we-talk-to-machines-in-the-future/\">How Will We Talk to Machines in the Future?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 12:41:42 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines.jpg","linkMd5":"c9784bcb12ce29d5f9fffeb753b55e50","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-25-055_6047bc8f6d99fe24.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines.jpg","destWidth":747,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":73891,"destBytes":36742,"author":"Frank Landman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Talk-to-machines-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-16-054_0326c55a0cf64989.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195869358},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"Gozney Roccbox: Commercial-Grade, Portable Pizza Oven","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173617","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/03/gozney-roccbox-commercial-grade-portable-pizza-oven/\" title=\"Gozney Roccbox: Commercial-Grade, Portable Pizza Oven\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"gozney roccbox pizza oven\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven-900x506.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven-260x146.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Having your own pizza oven typically involves a large kitchen or outdoor space that most people don&#8217;t have. However, Gozney Roccbox has found a way to shrink the pizza oven to a portable size while still delivering a commercial-grade appliance.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my review of the <a href=\"https://us.gozney.com/products/roccbox\">Gozney Roccbox portable pizza oven</a>, which I&#8217;m happy to say involved a lot of pizza nights in our house to see how it worked.</p>\n<h2>About the Company</h2>\n<p>Tom Gozney designed the pizza oven and started the company nearly 10 years ago. His goal was to create the perfect home-cooked pizza. Since then, he has developed many different products to help consumers enjoy restaurant pizzas at home.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173623\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Portable Pizza Oven Features</h2>\n<p>Available in gray or bright green, the restaurant-grade portable pizza has a long list of features. The company came up with the design based on what restaurants use, including adding professional-grade materials.</p>\n<p>The pizza oven has a built-in thermometer, retractable legs, and detachable burner system. You can choose to use the standard gas burner or add a detachable wood burner that comes as an accessory to purchase separately.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>The pros with this portable pizza oven are that fresh, homemade pizza is cooked nicely in just one to three minutes. The built-in thermometer helps to know exactly when the pizza is done. Plus, the oven is solid and durable, offering good heat distribution for even cooking. It&#8217;s also easy to set up and offers a cool look as cooking appliances go.</p>\n<p>Another standout feature was that the outer silicone skin and dense body insulation helped reduce the risk of skin burns. Of course, to be safe, I still kept the kids far away from being able to touch it.</p>\n<p>However, no matter how much I love cooking homemade pizza this fast with this portable pizza oven, there are some cons to address.  Despite the &#8220;portable&#8221; in its name, it&#8217;s heavy. The pizza oven comes in at 40 pounds, and that&#8217;s before adding the propane attachment. We also couldn&#8217;t really use the wood-burning attachment feature.</p>\n<p>Finally, it&#8217;s on the expensive side at $500 albeit that is less than building a pizza oven in the backyard. There are competitors to compare, although I have yet to try the other options because I&#8217;m fully vested in this one after the sizable investment.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173624\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pizza-van-conversions-gozney-pizza-ovens-01-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pizza-van-conversions-gozney-pizza-ovens-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pizza-van-conversions-gozney-pizza-ovens-01-241x160.jpg 241w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pizza-van-conversions-gozney-pizza-ovens-01.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s in the Box?</h2>\n<div class=\"prd-ProductAccordion_Body\">\n<div class=\"prd-ProductAccordion_Content rte-RichText\">\n<p>Along with the oven, you get a professional-grade pizza peel, detachable gas burner, bottle opener, and manual. The pizza oven also comes with a five-year warranty.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not in the box, you can find tutorials on how to use the pizza oven and delicious recipes on their website. We took advantage of both these options and found it useful to get us started with our pizza-making.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>You can buy the pizza oven through the Gozney website for $499 with free shipping and free returns. Along with the wood-burning attachment, their website has other accessories like a cover and other pizza tools for purchase. Amazon and Williams-Sonoma also carry the pizza oven.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>This Gozney Roccbox pizza oven is a fun and delicious tool to enjoy restaurant-quality pizza at home in just minutes. There is so little fuss or effort. The only downside is that we will have to make a lot of pizzas to get the return on the $500 price tag. I really love this oven and it&#8217;s nice to have if it&#8217;s in the budget.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/03/gozney-roccbox-commercial-grade-portable-pizza-oven/\">Gozney Roccbox: Commercial-Grade, Portable Pizza Oven</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 04 Jul 2020 01:00:12 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven.jpg","linkMd5":"3df6fda6683bba048e59bdc38c998554","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-22-395_97e968a9aeeb4f79.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven.jpg","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":562,"sourceBytes":309197,"destBytes":42396,"author":"Deanna Ritchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PortablePizzaOven-300x169.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn87@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-17-690_a0724a81a6724939.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GozneyRoccbox-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-12-266_ce2f4d6d224306b9.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pizza-van-conversions-gozney-pizza-ovens-01-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-14-123_0031da97d0b70272.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873804},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"On-Demand Money Making Business Model for Startups","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169484","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/on-demand-money-making-business-model-for-startups/\" title=\"On-Demand Money Making Business Model for Startups\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"257\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/On-Demand-Money-Making-Business-Model-for-Startups-300x257.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"on-demand business model\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/On-Demand-Money-Making-Business-Model-for-Startups-300x257.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/On-Demand-Money-Making-Business-Model-for-Startups-187x160.png 187w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/On-Demand-Money-Making-Business-Model-for-Startups.png 526w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>It wasn’t so long ago when we used to stand in queues waiting for taxis or go to local stores for grocery shopping.

If you can share or have access to goods and services immediately &#8211; there are low chances that you’ll prefer buying it.</p>\n<p>Owing to its benefits, not only consumers but on-demand businesses also rely on renting rather than buying the service permanently. That means they work with freelancers rather than hiring full-time employees.</p>\n<h2><b>On-demand businesses on the rise.</b></h2>\n<p>There has been a 360-degree revolution in technology that has encompassed the businesses and customers both. Now due to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic &#8212; on-demand appshave seen an unprecedented surge (spaceo.ca).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://www.spaceo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/a.jpg\" alt=\"guide to making on demand app during flu season\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p>Customers are no longer satisfied by getting what they want at a reasonable price- they not only want to have the best but also want to have it in a way that enhances their experience. And they are willing to pay for that. Businesses now understand the pain point, and if you observe &#8211; the ones that serve their customers with ‘convenience’ become most profitable.</p>\n<p>A report from Statista states: <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/2477/online-shopping-behavior/\">42%</a> of consumers prefer online shopping. If you’re phone any of them, you know why.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/03/13/mobile-future-notifications-not-apps/\">mobile apps</a>, the convenience factor has increased multifold. The ease of accessing a convenient service is what plays a role in attracting customers. All customers have to do is make a click, and the business will be there to serve them at their doorsteps in the most time and cost-effective fashion.</p>\n<p>The on-demand business is flourishing and how. Here’s a pie chart that shows the usage and spendings of on-demand companies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d3l69s690g8302.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/11082641/d50c80cc-108a-4866-a71e-c6a38e3fa806-624x624.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://d3l69s690g8302.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/11082641/d50c80cc-108a-4866-a71e-c6a38e3fa806-624x624.png\" alt=\"On-demand app ideas\" width=\"624\" height=\"624\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>86.5 Million Americans have used an on-demand service.</li>\n<li>45 Million US people have offered services in the On-demand sector.</li>\n<li>22.4 Million users annually spend around $57.6 billion on On-demand services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Businesses need to solve their prospects’ problems and that too in the most convenient way.</p>\n<p>On-demand business models leverage this fact and hence are thriving like never before.</p>\n<p><b>A report by Harvard Business Review states: the on-demand industry is attracting 22.4 million customers annually, who spend $57.6 billion on them.</b></p>\n<p>It wouldn’t be justified to talk about On-demand businesses and shared economy and miss out on Uber. The primary reason that Uber excelled is that it made the overall experience of commuting &#8211; convenient and cost-effective. From booking a cab to making the payment &#8211; it takes care of the whole journey. The entire service is brought to the users on a single user-friendly platter.</p>\n<h3><b>Reasons that make on-demand businesses profitable.</b></h3>\n<p>Uber has managed to raise approximately $10.2 billion, Urban Clap has raised nearly $35 million, and Ola Cabs has raised almost $1.18 billion after having completed seven stages of funding.</p>\n<p>Do you think this was possible if there wasn’t a demand and supply gap to fulfill?</p>\n<p>The on-demand businesses don’t rely on intuition and guesswork. Rather they serve their customers with what they need the most &#8211; efficient, convenient, technically updated, and cost and time-effective solutions.</p>\n<p>That’s the reason on-demand business models prove to be a success for investors, customers, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/29/5-misconceptions-you-should-know-about-before-launching-your-tech-startup/\">startup</a> owners.</p>\n<p>It becomes an attractive space for investors because they can predict the trends resulting from technological and business integration.</p>\n<p>The customers, on the other hand, are always on a lookout for better alternatives. This makes the on-demand industry more competitive and drenched in scope. The increasing demand is the reason that there’s no dearth of investors and industry tycoons who are more than willing to test the waters.</p>\n<h4><b>Another reason for its flourishing nature is that it is can be linked to all types of industries.</b></h4>\n<p>If we think about it, many apps practically make our every day lives hassle-free.</p>\n<p>From hyperlocal delivery to healthcare to home and local services, the possibilities of on-demand businesses are limitless.</p>\n<p>This means no matter what industry you choose, as long as your model is equipped with speed, accuracy, convenience, and quality &#8211; your business will be profitable.</p>\n<h3><b>The deciding variables for a successful on-demand business</b><b> </b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Degree of commoditization &#8211; </b>The rule is simple. The more the number of variables that users care about in the context of a product or service, the less commoditized the service/product is, and vice-versa. Think about Uber &#8211; fewer variables, more commoditized. You need to identify what <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/13/does-your-business-really-need-an-ai-solution/\">suits your business model</a>.</li>\n<li><b> Pricing structure </b>&#8211; There are two options you have &#8211; a singular pricing structure or for the complete platform. You need to choose one that fits your needs depending on your degree of commoditization.</li>\n<li><b> Delivery option &#8211; </b>Here again, you have the option of choosing between scheduled and instant delivery. However, no matter where you start, you can always expand from one to the other.</li>\n<li><b> Stakeholders- </b>The number of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/17/b2b-customer-experience-13-actions-bringing-better-results/\">stakeholders depends on your business model</a>. Most on-demand businesses, however, have at least two stakeholders. For example, Uber has two stakeholders- passengers and drivers.</li>\n<li><b> Supply Side and Platform relationship</b>&#8211; To <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/5-signs-that-you-are-ready-to-scale-business-and-deploy-innovation/\">run a successful business,</a> you’ll have to choose &#8212; whether to aggregate the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/25/ecommerce-how-to-survive-its-troughs/\">existing small businesses</a> or to contract the supply. It is easy to achieve the former.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><b>Final Thoughts</b></h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/04/building-an-iot-ecosystem-that-fuels-business-transformation/\">on-demand business models</a> are on a roller coaster ride that will only go up in the coming years. The future is bound to belong to on-demand businesses that will serve their customers with enhanced experience and convenience.</p>\n<p>These business models are indeed a goldmine for startups as the present-day market conditions are entirely in their favor.

Threats are evolving so quickly that manufacturers simply can’t keep up.</p>\n<p>But by breaking down cybersecurity into its independent parts, manufacturers can better prepare for inevitable data breach attempts.</p>\n<h2><b>Growing IIoT cybersecurity risks.</b></h2>\n<p>Despite the security risks associated with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), connected devices have far more advantages than disadvantages on the factory floor.</p>\n<p>The manufacturing industry must embrace digital transformation to remain resilient amid a tight labor market, shifting trade policies, and a global economy hit hard by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>IIoT devices can help manufacturers improve performance, access consistent reports and insights, improve process visibility and customize their capabilities more seamlessly.</p>\n<h3>IIoT devices are particularly vulnerable to attack.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many black box devices like smart sensors and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) run on outdated code — in some cases <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/08/sellyourmacs-brian-burke-on-the-true-costs-of-old-tech/\">code from the 90s</a> — with bolted-on modules.<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/urgent-11-ipnet-vulnerable-devices/\">decades-old code often contains bugs</a> that put devices at risk of dedicated-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or even total takeovers.</li>\n<li>Additionally, many of these black box devices aren’t set up or configured by IT departments. For example, most manufacturers choose which milling machines to purchase based on how quickly they turn out parts, not how strong their firewall is. But when these devices join the connected world, they’re exposed to new threats.</li>\n<li>The companies that produce connected devices often intentionally leave open a backdoor so they can more easily conduct routine maintenance. In some cases, the only way manufacturers can update a device is through USB ports, which are notoriously prone to malware transmission.</li>\n<li>Manufacturers haven’t done their due diligence in training blue-collar workers, who are often not as IT savvy as those in white-collar industries. Workers unfamiliar with proper security protocol are more susceptible to phishing scams.</li>\n<li>Similarly, as mobile scanning apps become more popular on the factory floor, manufacturers have introduced more opportunities for potential attacks. Most companies don’t have the capacity to manage various individual devices and apps in addition to their own technology, so personal tech often goes unsupervised.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Because IIoT devices are more susceptible to cyber breaches, DDoS attacks are common.</h3>\n<p>Think back to the 2016 attack on Dyn, a domain name system (DNS), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/ddos-attack-dyn-mirai-botnet\">brought down major sites including Twitter, Netflix, Paypal and Spotify</a>. Groups of automated harmful programs, or botnets, attacked IoT devices in what was, at the time, the largest DDoS attack in history.</p>\n<h4>Not only are the risks of cyberattacks growing, the consequences can be devastating.</h4>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-07-10-IBM-Study-Hidden-Costs-of-Data-Breaches-Increase-Expenses-for-Businesses\">study conducted by IBM</a>, the average time to identify a data breach is 197 days, the average time to contain a data breach once identified is 69 days and the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is $7.91 million.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGMOW7nLGvY\">words of former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III</a>, “It is no longer a question of ‘if,’ but ‘when’ and ‘how often.’</p>\n<p>There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.”</p>\n<h2><b>The assembly line approach to cybersecurity.</b></h2>\n<p>Even though <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/29/12-lesser-known-iot-protocols-you-wished-you-knew-about-earlier/\">data breaches are inevitable</a>, manufacturers can still take the right precautions to decrease their magnitude and mitigate potential damage.</p>\n<p>Think about cybersecurity like a product in your assembly line. At every stage in the process, something new gets added, until you’ve assembled the final product. But if you stop adding new pieces in the middle of the process and try to use the product, it likely won’t work properly.</p>\n<h4>Cybersecurity requires similar layers of firewalls, encryption, anti-malware, access control, and endpoint protection to best defend your IIoT devices.</h4>\n<p>Managing cybersecurity like an assembly line requires strategies for every part of the process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Education</b>: Employees who don’t know better are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/05/7-actionable-tips-to-secure-your-smart-home-and-iot-devices/\">some of the easiest targets</a> for cyberattackers. But a few simple process changes can help diminish instances of breaches caused by employees.\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Onboarding tutorials:</strong> Teach employees what to watch out for on day one. Include a web tutorial on how to avoid phishing scams as part of the onboarding process, and follow it up with a short quiz.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequent testing:</strong> Any <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/21/connected-devices-in-the-workplace-what-you-need-to-know/\">employees who use devices that can get hacked</a> should be tested frequently. Send your own test phishing messages to ensure initial training actually took hold. Employees that click the links in these test emails should be automatically scheduled to take a refresher course.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><b>Network segmentation and device fencing: </b>To address the rise of unsecured IIoT and personal devices on the floor, manufacturers should invest in network segmentation. By splitting your main computer network into subnetworks, or segments, companies can not only boost performance but also enhance security.\n<p>Segmentation restricts network access to approved users and gives IT teams the ability to better control, monitor and protect the flow of information. If one subnetwork gets hacked, the risk of spread and the amount of data compromised are much lower.</p>\n<p>Additionally, manufacturers should <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/30/how-to-create-an-effective-cybersecurity-routine/\">establish device geofencing</a>, which provides an added layer of access control and streamlines BYOD management. These boundaries limit access to certain applications or devices and track compliance within a specific geographical perimeter.</p>\n<p>A geographical perimeter can also be set up as a &#8220;device fence&#8221; &#8212; to alert system administrators when company-owned devices leave the premises or the device can be set to automatically shut off access.</li>\n<li><b>Hiring and outsourcing</b>: Many manufacturers simply don’t have the IT department needed to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/27/are-solutions-keeping-up-with-iot-security-concerns/\">monitor and manage security risks</a>. Often, the same person is responsible for managing both the company’s security and its network.\n<p>These employees are usually overworked and lack the necessary checks and balances of a fully staffed IT department. It should come as no surprise then that the burnout rate is incredibly high among these professionals &#8212; adding further strain to manufacturers trying to compete in a tight labor market.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Even with the right number of IT professionals in place, every business operating in the connected world needs 24/7 security coverage, 365 days a year.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/14/5-questions-msps-should-ask-customers-to-determine-security-needs/\">Managed security service providers</a> (MSSPs) can fill in the gaps that IT departments can’t manage single-handedly. External specialists not only have access to a much broader cybersecurity toolkit than in-house staff, they also often cost less than hiring an entire internal team. And the savings in reduced malware infection rates are invaluable.</p>\n<h3>MSSPs provide several crucial layers necessary for an assembly-line approach to cybersecurity.</h3>\n<p>The MSSPs approach includes a perimeter defense, endpoint security, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPs). The MSSPs also provide security information and event management (SIEM).</p>\n<h4>When selecting an MSSP, look for a partner with:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Considerable experience with incident response and use of leading endpoint protection technologies.</li>\n<li>Multiple client success stories, case studies and credible references.</li>\n<li>Breach detection that analyzes every trouble ticket, instead of just tracking trends.</li>\n<li>Experienced staff — with the proper certifications — in every time zone where you conduct business.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The pace of IIoT cyberattacks isn’t letting up anytime soon.</h2>\n<p>No, the pace of IIoT cyberattacks isn&#8217;t letting up &#8212; they’re <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/what-you-need-to-know-about-covid-19-related-cyberattacks/\">intensifying in the wake of the coronavirus</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s only a matter of time before your manufacturing company is breached — if you haven’t been already.</p>\n<p>Know that the right combination of security layers can help you detect and prevent more breaches, and recover quicker when the inevitable strikes.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Ivy Son; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/02/manufacturers-approach-cybersecurity-like-your-assembly-line/\">Manufacturers: Approach Cybersecurity Like Your Assembly Line</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 22:42:29 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Approach-Cybersecurity-Like-Your-Assembly-Line-300x300.png","linkMd5":"f21b945320662853f460237b304b4906","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-821_928820e5d0abb9be.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":149582,"destBytes":14990,"author":"Mike Rulf","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Approach-Cybersecurity-Like-Your-Assembly-Line-300x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn14@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-07-821_928820e5d0abb9be.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195873364},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"How to Launch Your Own Data-Driven Email Marketing Campaigns","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168275","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/16/how-to-launch-your-own-data-driven-email-marketing-campaigns/\" title=\"How to Launch Your Own Data-Driven Email Marketing Campaigns\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"launch email marketing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Marketers can take advantage of data to build effective email marketing campaigns tailored to their target audience. </p>\n<p>Studying and tracking data over time reveals what does and doesn’t work. And marketers can use a/b testing to rectify mistakes, overcome issues, and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/11/how-to-use-behavioral-data-to-inform-marketing-decisions/\">achieve better results</a>. </p>\n<p>Sourcing data to personalize campaigns is simple enough thanks to the proliferation of reporting tools in most email marketing platforms. However, knowing how to actually put the information to good use is more complicated. </p>\n<p>In this post, I explore how you can implement data into your email marketing strategy to improve performance and get stronger results. </p>\n<h2><b>Measuring Email Marketing Campaigns to Gauge Performance and Identify Opportunities </b></h2>\n<p>You want to know how customers react to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/06/13/why-i-choose-email-marketing-for-best-roi/\">email marketing campaigns</a> and what actions they take if any. As a marketer, you have access to a considerable amount of data in your marketing channels and platforms, but not all of it will be of use to you. </p>\n<p>The first thing you should do when measuring your email campaign’s success is to identify your goals. </p>\n<p>Is the aim to drive interest in a forthcoming product by encouraging new subscribers or existing customers to register for a live-streamed demonstration? Do you want to increase sales of low-value products through a flash sale? Are you looking to gain feedback from customers through a brief questionnaire, perhaps included with a welcome email or email newsletter?</p>\n<p>Understanding the goals of any <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/14/how-to-send-the-warmest-cold-emails/\">email marketing campaign</a> helps small businesses establish benchmarks and metrics. It’s vital to be clear on both to ensure you measure results accurately. You can see how specific emails achieve goals and explore what changes you can make if they don’t. </p>\n<h2><b>Choosing the Most Effective Metrics to Measure Performance </b></h2>\n<p>Business owners use metrics to measure email list performance and assess the varying response-types of emails get. </p>\n<p>These responses range from the most basic, such as email open rates, click-through rates, and bounce rates, to conversion rates, list growth rates, spam complaints, and unsubscribe rates. Each action is important in a unique way. For example, open rates tell you the number of subscribers who opened the emails after seeing them in their inbox. That’s an achievement in itself, considering how many emails we&#8217;re all getting. But, what made the individual open your email above something else in their inbox?</p>\n<p>The email open rate doesn’t tell you enough about how email subscribers are engaging with messages. Is the individual looking at the message but taking no further action? How will you know?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/top-tips-to-increase-website-conversions/\">click-through rates</a> and conversion rates come into play here, and tell you what you need to know. If a subscriber clicks on a link to watch a video, read a blog post, view a product, or sign up for a webinar &#8212; that means something in the email is done right. The email piqued their interest in the first place. </p>\n<p>But again, depending on the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/22/5-ways-to-improve-conversion-rates-for-your-landing-pages/\">quality of the landing page</a> and the content or products linked to &#8212; a click doesn’t necessarily translate into success. Conversion rates, on the other hand, tell you the number of subscribers who took the desired action after clicking through. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/15/data-analytics-the-skill-everyone-needs-to-know/\">Studying these metrics</a> will reveal insights into the quality of a website or other elements of the customer experience. For example, if promotional emails attract an impressive number of click-through rates but poor conversion rates, there may be a problem with the landing page or product catalog. </p>\n<p>In this case, the marketing is doing its job, but flaws outside of the emails themselves are to blame. </p>\n<p>Another critical step is to establish benchmarks, to see how your engagement levels compare to industry and previous averages. Measuring your email marketing efforts against the averages helps gauge a campaign’s success. It also shows the specific areas that demand attention, such as open rates or bounce rates.</p>\n<h2><b>Breaking Audiences into Segments to Boost Email Relevance</b></h2>\n<p>Finding the right <a href=\"https://blog.sendinblue.com/email-marketing-services-comparison/\">email marketing services</a> can be tricky. One way you know you have a good email provider if it has strong segmentation functionality.</p>\n<p>Segmenting audiences makes targeting customers with relevant, engaging emails much easier. It’s more effective than blasting every subscriber with identical messages and hoping enough of them take action to justify the effort. </p>\n<p>Marketers can use various types of data to segment audiences for their email marketing campaigns. One of the most important is customers’ transactional activities — what have they bought, how many purchases have they made, what’s their average order value, and how much have they spent in total?</p>\n<p>You’ll learn which customers are the most valuable and which have yet to make a purchase.</p>\n<p>Another key type of data is their personal details: name, age, gender, and location. You might get this direct at the point of subscription or when customers make a purchase. </p>\n<p>This data means marketers can send emails targeted to different age groups, genders, and geographical areas. For example, there may be a flash sale on women’s clothing or an event geared toward younger audiences. Segmenting ensures they’re only marketed to people most likely to show an interest.</p>\n<p>The next type of data relates to customer behavior. How many emails do they tend to open and take action on? How many times have they opt-in or make a purchase? Do they abandon their carts frequently? </p>\n<p>Subscribers with high click-through rates but no conversions may need a little push, such as a discount or free shipping.</p>\n<h2><b>Personalizing Email Marketing Campaigns to Boost Engagement </b></h2>\n<p>Personalization is the best way to make sure emails are relevant to subscribers and their interests. </p>\n<p>Something as simple as adding the recipient’s name in the subject line makes a positive impact. Using the name in the subject line is shown to <a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/infographics/understanding-importance-e-mail-subject-lines-infographic-01492127#za6tqbgOJuwEl071.97\">grow open rates</a> from an average of 15.70 percent to 18.30 percent, while working “free” into the subject line makes an email 10 percent more likely to be opened, too. </p>\n<p>The content of the email should be tailored to the target segment carefully. Consumers are more likely to shop with companies that include relevant offers and recommendations. </p>\n<p>Personalization may not always bring immediate, transformative results. But, it can make subscribers feel more valued by a brand, rather than just another faceless buyer. </p>\n<p>Follow the tips above to launch a data-driven email marketing campaign with the potential to secure higher engagement, conversions, and loyalty. </p>\n<p>Take advantage of relevant data to know your target audience better and cultivate stronger relationships with existing and prospective customers. Once you’ve established goals, chosen metrics, and put benchmarking into place, you can continue to track performance, chart progress, and spot improvement opportunities over time. </p>\n<p>Getting <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/21/6-email-marketing-trends-you-need-to-be-aware-of/\">email marketing campaigns</a> right takes time and commitment, but it will pay off down the line, with more customers and greater profit.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/16/how-to-launch-your-own-data-driven-email-marketing-campaigns/\">How to Launch Your Own Data-Driven Email Marketing Campaigns</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:22 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns.jpg","linkMd5":"e46cdacd4136b970a8133d8a60e0d7c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-24-448_325a505290b54c32.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":27029,"destBytes":21158,"author":"John Boitnott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Launch-Your-Own-Data-Driven-Email-Marketing-Campaigns-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-18-819_cb5938622e8246cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880275},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:50","title":"The Future of Cybersecurity in the Hands of AI","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173640","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/06/the-future-of-cybersecurity-in-the-hands-of-ai/\" title=\"The Future of Cybersecurity in the Hands of AI\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Future-of-Cybersecurity-in-the-Hands-of-AI-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"cybersecurity ai\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Future-of-Cybersecurity-in-the-Hands-of-AI-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Future-of-Cybersecurity-in-the-Hands-of-AI-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Future-of-Cybersecurity-in-the-Hands-of-AI.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Globally, the AI cybersecurity <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/22/why-theres-a-bright-future-in-a-cyber-security-careers/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=576a04ecf815fcf6fa3e5b854f943db5516b65ca-1592221799-0-AbQEMuxNxj85ptqi6vDC82y1NNa-ZCrvnKnaKDKAU6Ps5v_BTXwiTbGeEhctoDTHWWA7WfhSGv4ToaBLdYfs1i68Qrv1d-6LWPFNPrmleARjRHDl-im5uDL-ypRW52pf8b4-Qyb1suJUVeyDBJjXa8ROCt0fJg1H2Omtzb1ZL2C28wou44fDNvAffkWHslWrwcDky0hkDGUal-_AZGKCzPnpY8-njp9YYMgJz3z-ICleCdBV4hY6ide90WmNW_6GhEdYptAQ0NmFdOaM4iAR4FOlpsXqP49F_BTifmM7tZyDeZpSDq0cWxhun84GePorWdeUqZpUY96ddIRrrqtSqNjUVsvCjSEzj2Ka9iW68pYeVzbEXXSGr0TNJ_1Na6nWZ4rEn-cSf1mevYDzv4xqFfrrp539463JxAREKPXukqz1\">job</a> market will witness 3.5 million unfilled <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">cybersecurity</a> jobs by 2021 according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/business/the-mad-dash-to-find-a-cybersecurity-force.html\">The New York Times</a>.

Most content on the topic leaves the reader to do all the math, connect the dots, and try to understand the <i>real </i>problem behind the numbers, all by themselves – an overwhelming task.</p>\n<p>Two of the most interesting topics on the internet today are Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. You want solid takeaways and insights to embrace in today&#8217;s inter-connected digital economy.</p>\n<h2><b>Challenges of AI: A cybersecurity industry perspective</b></h2>\n<p>A recent survey by the Consumer Technology Association identifies AI’s top application as cybersecurity, with <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/805348/world-ai-application-areas-in-enterprise/\">44% of all AI applications</a> being used to detect and deter security intrusions.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum, cybercriminals are increasingly (and innovatively) using AI as digital ammunition. It is to create potent security threats, resulting in an increased demand for cybersecurity experts.</p>\n<p>On the subject of threats, here&#8217;s my pick of the top-3 current concerns:</p>\n<h3><b>1. Increased </b><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3aac4a1d143f318897ce2f2fbec5ebd3cb7c81cd-1590864307-0-AZ01iYuAJZ1yPLFjePvkUm3KvFcvzLr38MjWO-z1IQCHY3Gny6Djht3dT5MRllWSI8vW9q8mjzl1bRs3UbvH8lk3MptswEmIsPLcy-vKPogx11PmXrOPpfLw5tied7Pmp4NI06zczvZJOzMhSfnMP_GpUahaQH9n4peUaIdi4BvFOBodUC82YTbis-zEp1giN8RmhoQDO8RKvYPAd7aBEWk5TtWHkTw-2iXJMvCzscysmKqz9GxOXGQMJklzM0MvyKX7XbkwsDToPOgkMFfuMGyKvumAToYOaDYd8UzURvbnUvleM8sslwK9t4kJ-Wai9rYbK3YZtrkO61caUDFeiVpi2P9dj4bJOpJ0UF9gs0DyY78cO1pmJ-4468zGWO1TBTCngNm58X-eYtOTHKDFAczeSmpU7jMhibVjVYy_MNc9\"><b>cybersecurity threat</b></a></h3>\n<p>In 2019, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402\">reported</a> that a group of cybercriminals had demanded €220,000 from the CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm. An interesting twist to the plot: they used AI to impersonate the CEO’s voice. The lesson learned? AI provides cybercriminals with an additional <i>edge</i> to bypass security blind spots in an organization.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Accelerated volume and complexity of cybersecurity attacks and data breaches</b></h3>\n<p>A study by <a href=\"https://www.varonis.com/blog/the-world-in-data-breaches/\">Varonis</a> puts things into perspective:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173641 size-medium\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1-300x204.png\" alt=\"Accelerated volume and complexity of cybersecurity attacks and data breaches\" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1-300x204.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1-900x612.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1-235x160.png 235w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1-182x125.png 182w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data-breaches-stats-960x653-1.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Long story short, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/23/how-the-development-of-ai-has-advanced-the-technology-available-for-chatbots/#2e252e96c213\">AI-powered technology</a> can enable automation of tasks, protect the attacker&#8217;s identity, spawn the next frontier in enterprise fraud, a.k.a deepfakes, and refine malicious services (to name but a few instances) at a rate and scale that&#8217;s virtually unheard of.</p>\n<h3><b>3. A window of (threat) opportunity, owing to greater reliance on AI-enabled technology</b></h3>\n<p>Practically speaking, AI-led technology can swing both ways. Either in favor of organizations or in favor of cybercriminals, depending on the circumstances. Organizations can beef up their security by using emerging technologies and AI-led software.</p>\n<p>Ironically, attackers can overcome these security controls and manipulate routine tasks by using the same technology in an improvised capacity, giving rise to more complex and interconnected risks. Believe it or not, in 2018, <a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-almanac-2019/\">Cisco</a> reported that they “blocked seven trillion threats, or 20 billion threats a day, on behalf of their customers.” Currently, it seems like we&#8217;re stuck in a &#8220;chicken-egg&#8221; situation.</p>\n<h2><b>How AI is contributing to cybersecurity processes </b></h2>\n<p>According to Capgemini, two out of three organizations are planning to adopt AI solutions by 2020.</p>\n<p>Despite posing serious threats, AI augments and complements the future of cybersecurity best-practices. Here&#8217;s a lowdown of the &#8220;AI advantage&#8221; in the cybersecurity landscape:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>Reduced response time to threats and cost of preventing breaches</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Synack claims that “using AI accelerates the time to evaluate the breach-worthiness of vulnerability by 73%.”</p>\n<p><i></i>Plus, additional data by Capgemini research shows that “3 out of 4 executives believe AI in cybersecurity speeds up breach response &#8212; both in detection and remediation.<i><br />\n</i></p>\n<p>And around 64% said that it also reduces the cost of detection and response.” Expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaynemcgladrey\">Kayne McGladrey&#8217;s</a> take on AI explains what these numbers might mean. Talking to <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3515730/ai-automation-emerge-as-critical-tools-for-cybersecurity.html\">CIO</a>, she says:</p>\n<p>“AI’s tenacity results in reducing time to discovery, which doesn’t need holidays, coffee breaks, or sleep. And, is unlike Tier 1 security operations center analysts for whom reading endless log files and alerts gets boring.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>Ease of multi-tasking</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI is like a superpower organization that can use in a number of ways – to review user behaviors, find patterns, and locate irregularities in the security network to name just a few.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173644 size-medium\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data2-300x228.jpg\" alt=\"Ease of multi-tasking\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data2-300x228.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data2-900x685.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data2-210x160.jpg 210w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data2.jpg 1112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.whitehatsec.com/Content-2020-AIHumanSecurityReport_LPNew.html?utm_source=website&#38;utm_medium=0320-Website-AIHumanSecurityReport/\">Image Source</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>Enhanced and dynamic security practices</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The use of AI in combination with human efforts can help companies find and close critical vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://www.synack.com/press-releases/security-gears-up-for-a-turning-point-in-2020-thanks-to-augmented-intelligence/\">40% faster</a>.<i><br />\n</i></p>\n<p>Plus, this allows companies to focus their efforts on creating secure ‘choke points’ instead of spending millions to secure the entire work environment.</p>\n<p>Finally, by using AI for improved security, companies can leverage greater returns and minimize risks &#8212; a growing-concern among companies today.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>Minimized security responsibilities with high-quality results</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI is often described as intelligent, and rightly so. There are numerous application areas in which this powerful technology is helping organizations highlight recurring incidents and reverse the damage. (More on this in the next section).</p>\n<h2><b>Top-3 impactful use cases of AI in cybersecurity </b></h2>\n<h3><b>1. Combing through mountains of security data and automating routine tasks</b></h3>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns in cybersecurity is the sheer volume of data organizations have to tackle daily. This is probably one of the reasons why Gmail chose the AI route to<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/ridding-gmail-of-100-million-more-spam-messages-with-tensorflow\"> block 100 million extra spam messages every day</a> CTO of Seedcamp, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmytton\">David Mytton&#8217;s</a> explanation of how AI is disrupting the cybersecurity space is on-point.</p>\n<p>In CIO <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3515730/ai-automation-emerge-as-critical-tools-for-cybersecurity.html\">Mytton says,</a> “As more and more systems become instrumented, the problem shifts from knowing that ‘something’ has happened. This is to highlight that &#8220;something unusual&#8221; has happened.”</p>\n<p>Instrumented system refers to as &#8212; who has logged in and when? What was downloaded and when? What was accessed and when?</p>\n<h3><b>2. Reducing false security alarms and capturing unusual incidents</b></h3>\n<p>AI intelligence, in conjunction with threat intelligence, can detect new security issues and resolve them, offering a threat detection rate of 95% as opposed to traditional antivirus software, “where the detection rate is only about 90%, meaning 10% of malicious samples are being missed.”</p>\n<p>In the same vein, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeloverly/\">Michael Overly</a>, partner at Foley &#38; Lardner LLP, talked to <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3515730/ai-automation-emerge-as-critical-tools-for-cybersecurity.html\">Digital Munition</a> about the benefits of addressing these missed threats in a time-sensitive manner, saying:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The hope is that these systems will minimize false alarms and insubstantial issues, leaving a much smaller set of ‘real’ threats to review and address.&#8221;</p>\n<h3><b>3. Empowering foolproof security by offering predictive functions and improving efficiency</b></h3>\n<p>One of the most innovative and effective applications of AI in thwarting security breaches is the use of biometric authentication. Tech giant, Apple, uses this method &#8212; commonly known as &#8220;Face ID.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The powerful face ID technology combines built-in infra-red sensors and neural engines to recognize the user. If Apple&#8217;s claims are to be believed, the benefits are vast, with “only a <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/339509\">one-in-a-million</a> chance of fooling the AI to open a device with another face.”</p>\n<p>Apart from providing additional layers of security, AI is making teams more efficient, according to 70% of security professionals, and it is eliminating as much as 55% of employees&#8217; manual tasks.</p>\n<p>With the additional layer of security and helping the team pivot their energies towards solving more important tasks, AI also powers productivity. Helping with productivity reduces overall stress levels for everyone involved.</p>\n<h2><b>Key perspectives and future trends in AI security</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>Training AI-powered systems to protect us</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;ve spoken plenty about how AI works round-the-clock to keep an enterprise secure, but what about the safety and training of the technology itself?<br />\nExperts and enterprises need to refocus their strategies on training AI &#8211; ML models to max the value of these systems.<br />\nML systems can be trained to learn from historical data and detect anomalies. They can allow companies to mitigate and manage cyberattacks efficiently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>AI is the shiny new toy in the digital arms race</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From boosting the security defense to hyper-automating parts of the cybersecurity processes, AI will play an increasingly important role in preventing cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>Capgemini recently reported that AI “adoption is set to skyrocket, with almost two out of three (63%) of organizations planning to employ AI by 2020.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><b>AI as an offensive-defensive capability</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, AI is a technology that can be used to both defend and attack an organization&#8217;s digital defense systems.</p>\n<p>The need of the hour is for cybersecurity experts to proactively identify attacks (think: Spam email attempts, disabling critical infrastructure, among others) and defend against them.</p>\n<h2><b>Limitations of AI &#38; possible solutions </b></h2>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/13/10-security-tips-for-work-from-home-enterprises-during-covid-19/\">AI won’t solve all your security problems</a>.

To help you find the best chat support &#8212; we’ve curated a list of top 10 live chat software solutions that have made a mark successfully in 2020.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Live Chat Software?</strong></h2>\n<p>Live chat software is an online service that enables your business to connect faster with customers in real-time. Just like a messenger, live chat allows you to connect with multiple customers at the same time.</p>\n<p>In addition to these benefits, the use of live chat also helps you capture more leads, close more sales, and increase customer satisfaction. And while the use of the tool seems beneficial for your business, your customers may have different reasons to use the tool such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">42% of consumers say that they prefer live chat functions because they don&#8217;t have to wait on hold</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">79% of customers say that the use of live chat helps them get their questions answered quickly</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">51% of customers believe that the use of live chat software helps them to multitask during the support process</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">46% of customers express how they find live chat software as the most efficient form of communication method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers clearly state a win-win situation for both the customers and your business online. But the question is, <i>how does live chat work</i>?</p>\n<h2><strong>How Does Live Chat Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>A live chat has two interfaces. While one is visible to your customers, the other can be used by your operators. Let’s understand the two interfaces below and see how live chat works.</p>\n<h3><strong>Operator Window</strong></h3>\n<p>Operator window, also known as monitor window, is the interface that enables your operators to track and monitor visitor behavior in real-time. Although the features of the operator window vary from software to software, still there are a few common features that you are likely to find across all live chat software solutions.</p>\n<p>Some of them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of visitors online</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pages they browse in real-time</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of co-operators online</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of chats other operators are managing at the same time</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of time a visitor spends on your website</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access to the previous chat history</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access to previous chat transcripts</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operator-to-operator chat to increase collaboration during an ongoing conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The access to such features helps your operators to understand visitors better and initiate a chat with them in strategic moments. Other than the list of features mentioned above, some chat solutions also allow your operators to monitor and join ongoing chats. In short, the operator window helps your support reps to weave the best experience for your visitors/customers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Visitor Window</strong></h3>\n<p>Visitor window is the interface that the visitors on your website get to see when they click on the chat button for support. Your visitors can either initiate a chat or accept an incoming chat from your operators through their chat interface.</p>\n<p>Besides this, three other features will be visible once the visitor opens the chat window for support. These features include the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Pre-chat Form</b>To capture quality leads, a pre-chat form is considered to be one of the most crucial features in a live chat. You can gather details like name, phone number, address, email id, and more based on the nature of your business. You can even customize your pre-chat form fields to capture specific information about your visitors.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Offline Messages</b>Another form that your visitors can see when they open a chat window for support is offline message form. However, it is only visible if your operators aren’t online or your business hours for the day are over. With the use of this form, visitors can still reach out to your brand for support. Plus, you can avoid missing out on support opportunities too.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Self-help Article Links</b>The self-help articles are the latest feature in live chat solutions and isn’t available in all the options you may see below. However, its use is perfect for visitors who’d like to find answers fast and on their own accord. You can add self-help article links to your chat window to enable your visitors to find answers instantly and reduce your support chats and tickets effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these two live chat interfaces, we get to see how live chat works for a business. Now, let’s see how to add one to your website in minutes.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Add Live Chat to Your Website?</strong></h2>\n<p>Every live chat solution has one thing in common &#8211; the installation process.</p>\n<p>To add live chat to your website, you’ll see that all solutions would have most of the steps common. So, let’s lay out those common steps for you and see how to add a live chat to your website in less than five minutes below.</p>\n<p><i>Step #1:</i> It is common across all the live chat solutions &#8211; sign up.</p>\n<p>Before you install a live chat on your website and start giving support, sign up for the solution you think works best according to your business needs.</p>\n<p><i>Step #2:</i> Another common step you’ll notice is to navigate and find the chat code.</p>\n<p>Some may be easily found, others need to be searched for in the settings options.</p>\n<p><i>Step #3:</i> Finally it’s time to visit your website’s source code.</p>\n<p>Once you find the chat code, all you have to do is copy and paste the code in your website’s source code and save. And you are done!</p>\n<p>In a matter of three simple steps, you get to add a live chat software to our website in less than five minutes and you are up and ready to offer support to your visitors in real-time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why Add Live Chat to Your Website?</strong></h2>\n<p>Well, you may have come across a lot of reasons so far while reading the article on why add a live chat to your website. Let’s summarize them below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer instant, live support to customers in need of a solution</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor visitor behavior and initiate a chat in strategic moments</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easy to install</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convenient communication channel for customers as they wait time reduces in comparison to phone support</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enables both customers and operators to multitask during the support process</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But just in case these reasons aren’t enough for you to get a live chat for your support process, then we’ve got more for you. Let’s take a look at them below.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Capture Qualified Leads for Your Business</strong></h3>\n<p>To get more business, it is important to capture qualified leads for your business. And thanks to the use of live chat, you get to do that effectively.</p>\n<p>Features like visitor monitoring, pre-chat form, and offline message form help you learn if your target audience has approached your brand or not. And if the answer is yes, then automatically store them to your favorite CRM platform. It will help your sales team to approach them later on.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Boost Sales</strong></h3>\n<p>We all know that live chat helps you provide instant support to customers. But as per studies it also helps you to boost business revenues.</p>\n<p><i>For customers who chat before making a purchase, there is a </i><a href=\"https://www.proprofs.com/c/customer-support/live-chat-statistics/\"><i>10%</i></a><i> increase in average order value, a 48% increase in revenue per chat hour, and a 40% conversion rate.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Increase Customer Loyalty</strong></h3>\n<p><i>48% would be more likely to return to a website with chat support, and </i><i>41% trust</i><i> the brand more when this option is available.</i></p>\n<p>Another reason why you should get a live chat for your website is that it helps you to boost customer loyalty. Remember that <i>‘loyalty starts with awesome support’</i> and if you can offer that to customers efficiently, then you are likely to see more returning customers too.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Improve Website Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p><i>For </i><i>41%</i><i> of consumers, online chat, and live support is their preferred channel when it comes to engaging with companies digitally.</i></p>\n<p>Want to make sure you engage better with your website visitors? Add a live chat to your website. Real-time engagement helps you to find and offer relevant product recommendations to your customers, while your customers would find solutions faster. In short, it is a win-win situation for both.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Improves Operator Performance</strong></h3>\n<p>Live chat also helps you to improve operator performance, which ultimately results in reduced support costs. Let’s see how.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your operators can manage multiple chats at the same time. Unlike phone support, where agents can take one call at a time, each chat operator gets to manage more than 4 visitors at the same time. This also means that you can hire reps based on how many chats they can answer and run your support process at a lesser cost.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your operators no longer have to get up from their seats and ask for assistance from their fellow team members for a support request. All they have to do is initiate an operator to operator chat with the one who can best help them resolve a query faster.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operator performance reports give you insights on who is the star performer of your team and who needs to improve further.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are more than convincing reasons to add a live chat to your website. They are also one of the determining factors that help you get the best live chat software for your online business.

However, the ones on the list are quite popular and have been selected based on their reviews and ratings available on different business listing sites.</p>\n<p>But there are chances that you’d still feel confused and indecisive about which live chat solution should you opt for. Well to help with that, we’ve got a small checklist ready for you which will help you decide how to choose the best live chat software for your business.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Speed</strong></h3>\n<p>To manage multiple visitors at the same time, the one thing that will help your operators is speed. That means the experience for your operators should be seamless and enable them to offer support faster to visitors.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. More Customization</strong></h3>\n<p>The live chat software option you choose must-have customization options. A simple chat widget customization won’t work. Make sure the customization option enables the white-labeling of the chat widget too.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Detailed Reports</strong></h3>\n<p>You not only have to see how your operators are performing but also understand how your customers feel about your services. That’s why you need detailed reporting in a live chat solution. It would help you improve your services efficiently.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Mobile App</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure the live chat option you choose supports mobile app use too. It either comes with a mobile app or is mobile-friendly, thus helping your operators to offer support to customers no matter where they are.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Price</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes, it would be a great relief if the software you choose fits within your budget. But what you need to see is if the pricing is justified for the number of features you get in a package. Doing this will help you identify the best live chat software solution for your website that meets your support needs at cost-effective rates.</p>\n<h2><b>Which Live Chat Software You Should Choose?</b></h2>\n<p>Over the last few years, several service providers have made an entry into the live chat software domain.

Think about your top priorities and have a system of analyzing the pros and cons of each live chat software individually.</p>\n<p>There may be instances of bad judgment. You may have to indulge in a little bit of trial and error before you make the final call.</p>\n<p>And when you do strike the perfect balance, it is a marriage made in heaven.</p>\n<p>For the time being, we have got you covered with leg work and research.

Companies are pivoting their products and marketing while passionate, innovative teams are now working remotely. The fire to stay healthy and productive is lit, but flickering. Here is the best work from home snack box for remote teams.</p>\n<h3>There are some standard creature comforts we rely on when we work.</h3>\n<p>We had these classic perks in the office &#8212; but now we’re all at home. And we’re hungry all the time. Back in the office, we’d use our break to raid the micro-kitchen to find something to get us through the afternoon slump. Now, we only have our half-empty pantries and fridges to keep us satisfied. You and your team deserve better.</p>\n<h3><strong>Enter t</strong>he remote:<strong><em> Snack from Home</em> box.</strong></h3>\n<p>There are quite a few companies adapting to a new way of business, opting to send boxes of snacks typically reserved for the office to employees at home. Two specific companies that stand out as leaders in healthy snack box delivery? <strong>NatureBox and SnackNation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick overview of the two services to help you choose the right company for you and your remote team.</p>\n<h2>NatureBox</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171109 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naturebox.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naturebox.png 626w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naturebox-300x110.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naturebox-260x96.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></p>\n<p>Known as one of the original healthy snack subscription companies, Naturebox has a membership model that allows 20-40% savings on snacks that actually taste good. While the company has been serving snacks to corporate break rooms for many years, it recently launched a <a href=\"https://naturebox.com/office\">Snack From Home program</a> geared specifically for remote employees.</p>\n<p>Naturebox touts four curated box options available like the Less Stress Box and even an allergen-free box. They also give you the opportunity to create custom snack boxes full of precisely what your team needs. In addition to curated snack boxes, you can give your employees the ability to build their own boxes from over 60 different treats to choose from on <a href=\"http://www.Naturebox.com\">Naturebox.</a></p>\n<p>One of the unique benefits from Naturebox is that they provide corporate employees a free annual membership worth approximately $50 dollars. This program allows companies to add credit to their employees’ accounts, with an option to provide a monthly stipend to spend on whatever snacks they like.</p>\n<p>When it feels like Groundhog Day every day, variety matters. From high-quality roasted, salted almonds to more out-of-the-box options like turmeric black pepper popcorn, you can count on NatureBox for treats that make you feel good.</p>\n<p>NatureBox also offers a line of wellness snacks filled with <a href=\"https://naturebox.com/products/m-adaptogenic-snacks\">adaptogens</a> &#8212; ingredients that help you reduce stress and boost energy. Both traditional and health-minded snackers want to eat wellness snacks. These hand-selected snacks are created by NatureBox, which means you won’t find random brands or artificial ingredients you don’t know or trust in your box.</p>\n<p><em>The takeaway: NatureBox offers great variety, flexible options, truly unique snacks, and great value, especially when you add in the free membership.</em></p>\n<h2>SnackNation</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171110 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"712\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM.png 712w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM-300x295.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM-163x160.png 163w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM-40x40.png 40w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-06-at-1.58.45-PM-60x60.png 60w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snacknation.com/\">SnackNation</a> is another well-known company offering remote snack boxes for teams working from home. This company’s service is a good turnkey option &#8211; easy, fast, and convenient. You have three boxes to choose from: The Snack Box, The Super Snack Box, and a smaller Snack Box + Coffee. After you choose, the curators do the rest of the work for you. Curators review hundreds of different snack options to put in their rotation.</p>\n<p>The snacks come from a medley of different brands so what you get may change each month. SnackNation is a good option if you like the element of surprise or want to try out new snacks. To those that want to pick their favorites each month, this company’s Snack from Home box experience may be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Since the boxes contain single-serve packs, this feels like a fun gift idea rather than something to get monthly. On a positive note, SnackNation is donating meals to Feeding America for every snack box delivered to remote employees. Giving back is always appreciated, especially at a time like this.</p>\n<p>The takeaway: SnackNation offers convenience and fun initial experience. This is at the expense of customization and sustainability.</p>\n<p>Two honorable mentions go to <a href=\"https://fruitguys.com/\">Fruit Guys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ohmygreen.com/\">Oh My Green</a>.</p>\n<p>Fruit Guys offers wonderful fresh produce boxes for remote employees, but the content of those boxes vary due to availability and seasonality. Oh My Green is also a standout, but feature other brands’ snacks in their boxes rather than its own.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough time right now for teams and you want to keep your team in good shape mentally and physically. You just can&#8217;t get customized, curated boxes of delicious wellness snacks delivered to your home like you can with NatureBox.

How you understand the data and interpret the data into business decisions has a direct impact on your business conversion and growth. For a more precise understanding of data, today we have artificial intelligence (AI) and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/27/covid-19-jobs-data-and-machine-learning/\">Machine Learning</a> (ML) technologies on our side. No doubt, these technologies that mimic human reasoning can positively transform businesses and their strategies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need to understand the impact of AI and ML technologies have in shaping our understanding and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/demystifying-8-core-myths-that-surround-the-internet-of-things/\">capability to interpret data</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Data-Driven Personalization</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any business understands the importance of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/13/top-10-best-live-chat-software-for-2020/\">communicating with customers individually</a>. Yes, thanks to the very nature of digital interfaces that opened up the tremendous scope of individual preferences and choices, your business communication must take into account the preferences of individual customers. The increasing importance of addressing individual choices for business conversion has forced many companies to focus on data-driven personalization measures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only the large businesses but also the startups and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/16/8-best-digital-marketing-strategies-small-businesses-should-implement/\">small businesses</a> increasingly understand the importance of having <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/14/why-data-scientists-are-becoming-future-marketers/\">access to the relevant data</a> for meeting the needs of visitors. AI can dig the available user data deeper and fetch out relevant patterns and insights that can be further utilized for data-driven decision making personalization. AI can also help to scale up such personalization efforts for every individual user.</p>\n<h4>Stop the churn rate.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A superb example of how AI can allow personalization in business operations can be found in the case of Starbucks. The global coffee chain brand designed 400,000 different types of emails created based on the data of individual preferences, tastes, and choices. Such well crafted personalized communication can help brands to create more engaging communication and conversation for business brands. The brand actually AI to decipher the volumes of data corresponding to customer preferences and choices.</p>\n<h4>Data collection and data-centric.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to smaller businesses and little startups, such as AI-based data collection and data-centric personalization may be a little expensive. But small businesses can embrace similar approaches to create very specific data-oriented marketing campaigns with short duration to boost business conversion and customer engagement. Such AI-powered data-driven campaigns can also help to lift the brand image of any company.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Generating Sales Leads from Data that&#8217;s Understood<br />\n</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the B2B segment, business conversion highly depends on<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-customer-churn-rate/\"> generating new leads</a>. The B2B companies also need to depend heavily on tracking contact data and reaching out to them effectively through lead generation funnel. Most marketers agree to the humongous range of challenges B2B-based businesses face in doing this. This is where AI can play a great role in streamlining the process of lead generation through intelligent automation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/19/how-will-artificial-intelligence-change-the-world-of-sports/\">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) powered lead generation and contact tracking solutions have the capability to make an analysis of the customer base along with important trends and emerging patterns. These trends, patterns, anomalies, characteristics, and various attributes can deliver important insights for optimizing websites and web apps. Thanks to AI-based optimization insights a website can venture to use better programming language, tools, features, and UI elements to generate more leads.</p>\n<h4>Analytics and you.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, AI-based business data analysis can work hand in hand with big data analytics. This sophisticated and highly incisive approach to data utilization can easily help to discover ideal customers for a business. The interactions of users on web pages and corresponding data can be analyzed by B2B brands with the help of AI tools to produce the most relevant as well as actionable insights.</p>\n<h4>Analytical activities.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make things easier for the businesses, AI, and machine learning technology for such analytical activities are now spotted in most of the leading analytics solutions across the spectrum. Simple Google Analytics can also offer highly result-oriented and precision-driven reports. Such technologies can easily know about the shortcomings and loopholes behind the decreasing motivation of traffic and readings of business conversion fallout.</p>\n<h4>Great analytics tools.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are also great tools like Finteza that uses AI technology for monitoring website traffic on a continuous basis besides checking other crucial issues and irregularities. These tools can also improve your data security since by detecting bad traffic they automatically point out the vulnerabilities in the web app.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Poor web traffic often results in DDoS attacks, manipulation of website cookies, and hackers or malicious programs impersonating computer bots. An AI-based lead generation solution can also reduce these security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Optimizing the User Experience (UX)</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AI optimizes the scope of personalization in a data-driven manner and that is portrayed as the principal useless of AI in dealing with data. But AI is also highly effective in optimizing the web design and improving the <a href=\"https://www.cmarix.com/how-magento-2-mobile-app-builder-helps-delivering-the-best-native-ecommerce-user-experience/\">user experience</a> (UX).</p>\n<h4>User Behavior</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AI achieves this optimization and improvement by analyzing user behavior and interaction data and user feedback. Machine learning programs particularly can play a very effective role in learning from user behavior and adjusting various interactive elements accordingly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AI and ML programs running behind the scene basically collect a lot of data corresponding to real user behavior so that real-time feedback about shortcomings and improvement needs can be communicated to the business owners. An ML-based program can also bring instant tweaks to the UX attributes for better engagement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another important thing in this respect that needs to be explained is the great role of AI in improving the efficiency of A/B tests. In the A/B testing process the AI and machine learning can deliver the most important insights about user demands and preferences to take further enhancement measures for UI and UX.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most important aspect of AI in making an impact over <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2014/01/09/airlock-facebooks-a-b-testing-platform-that-helps-build-the-perfect-app/\">A/B testing</a> is that it leaves no scope for vague assessment or guessing. The data-driven insights guiding the A/B testing is more possible now as website cookies provide clear insights concerning user behavior.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on such insights the landing pages can reduce form fields as per user interest and preferences.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Biometric Data Pushing for Enhancements</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Biometrics data corresponding to direct interactions with a web app can help developers and marketers with a lot of actionable insights. There are many advanced online services right now available in the market that can help to understand and decipher website data.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Biometrics data coupled up with AI and machine learning technology opened up new possibilities for improved <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/26/ai-can-impact-mobile-app-development-and-user-experience/\">user experience</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among these available services for data interpretation mostly take the help of a combination of both artificial intelligence and machine learning. These sophisticated solutions can easily track the eye movements of the users.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, some of these services can also track facial expressions to assess user responses in different contexts. These services can extract the most organic kind of user data and generate the most valuable insights that can be used for UX design and performance optimization of websites.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Conclusion</b></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the trends stand, from this year onward the AI and ML-based data analytics and data-centric optimization of business apps will have more dominance. Thanks to these two technologies, there will be the least guesswork for all design, development, and optimization decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/02/how-can-ai-and-ml-transform-the-way-we-read-and-understand-data/\">How Can AI and ML Transform the Way We Read and Understand Data?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 15:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Transform-the-Way-We-Read-and-Understand-Data.jpg","linkMd5":"eb59ff86e037e2f6b67ff19bcc69ab2e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-23-860_883a3c5703d1ba15.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Transform-the-Way-We-Read-and-Understand-Data.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":51959,"destBytes":44134,"author":"Atman Rathod","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Transform-the-Way-We-Read-and-Understand-Data-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-12-234_f351ec23bd13352f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872317},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:56","title":"Should Amazon Sellers Go for Amazon PPC Campaign in this Pandemic?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171106","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/21/should-amazon-sellers-go-for-amazon-ppc-campaign-in-this-pandemic/\" title=\"Should Amazon Sellers Go for Amazon PPC Campaign in this Pandemic?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"191\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic-300x191.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"amazon ppc campaign\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic-300x191.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic-900x573.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic-251x160.jpg 251w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic-160x102.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Should-Amazon-Sellers-Go-for-Amazon-PPC-Campaign-in-this-Pandemic.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>As a vendor seller that is new to Ads, it&#8217;s essential to realize the terms identified with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/23/is-amazon-bank-the-future-of-banking/\">Amazon</a> PPC in light of the fact that they can undoubtedly destroy your spending plan on the off chance that you don&#8217;t have the foggiest idea what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n<h2><b>What is Amazon PPC Management? How does the Amazon PPC Auction work?</b></h2>\n<p>Amazon PPC (otherwise called Sponsored Products) is a notable promoting stage to assist dealers with enhancing their item deals on the web. Pay-per-click (<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/08/19-ppc-mistakes-that-can-demolish-your-business-for-good/\">PPC</a>) promotion is where a seller pays just for the notice that a potential purchaser snaps and perspectives the item.</p>\n<p>Just when an Amazon PPC battle is made, overseen, and executed appropriately, it assists with enhancing the deals, and subsequently, improving the organic rankings as well.</p>\n<p>This strategy is likewise called CPC. PPC works uniquely in contrast to pay-per-mail promoting PPM, which is an impressions-based strategy for publicizing like Facebook employments. With PPM, the Seller pays for every 1,000 individuals who see the promotion, versus the individuals who click on the advertisements.</p>\n<p>Amazon advertisements are one of the perfect ways for a vendor to &#8220;get or purchase&#8221; the top situation of the Amazon SERPs. Since Sellers pay just when a customer taps the promotion, the idea was named – <b>Amazon Pay per Click.</b></p>\n<p>Now the Question Arises,</p>\n<h3><b>Why should brands keep running their Amazon PPC campaigns throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, plus some guiding optimization principles that should be upheld throughout the coming months?</b></h3>\n<p>Although we are going through a very critical phase of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/open-applications-and-solving-the-future-of-platform-economics/\">economics</a>! The market is just not switched off, things are still working but in a little different manner. There are different reasons that we should keep running <strong>Amazon PPC campaigns</strong>.</p>\n<h2><b>First of All: </b></h2>\n<h3><b>Not everyone is affected by this pandemic!</b></h3>\n<p>More individuals are remaining at home and depending intensely on web-based business destinations, to be specific Amazon. Numerous Amazon accounts are as of now encountering gigantic deals <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/06/sales-prospecting-techniques-for-sales-development-reps/\">development</a>, like especially across Nourishment and Consumables.</p>\n<p>A forceful PPC procedure might be a need to keep contenders under control.</p>\n<h3><b>Secondly, Competitors are also down!</b></h3>\n<p>Another good to go reason for <a href=\"https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service\">Amazon PPC management</a> and campaigns is that many of the competitors are unavailable, or confronting serious calculated issues, presently is an extraordinary time to improve your natural positioning and item surveys.</p>\n<p>In case you&#8217;re a brand in an appealing class that has figured out how to maintain a strategic distance from any stock-out issues up to this point, all there are odds you have just observed extraordinary outcomes as a result of contenders briefly dropping out of the race.</p>\n<p>The excellence of Amazon PPC is that if a request begins to slide, you can alter your offers and day by day restraints whenever, so it pays to be strong now, particularly if the opposition is pulling back.</p>\n<h2><b>No. 3 &#8211; For the sake of Isolated Buyers:</b></h2>\n<p>“Customers are searching for diversion choices for buying during this time of isolation,&#8221; Amazon PPC quickly said in the event that they need to rank well in this season of phenomenal interest.</p>\n<p>Moreover, preceding Covid-19, customers on Amazon put an immense premium on quick delivery. Be that as it may, considering the unsure course of events of the present social separating rules, most customers won&#8217;t give it a second thought if their bundle shows up a couple of days late, particularly if Amazon is the main game left around.</p>\n<h3><b>Finally,</b></h3>\n<h3><b>Not only competitors but Different Selling CHANNELS are under crisis: </b></h3>\n<p>With their profound pockets and exceptionally mechanized satisfaction arranged, it&#8217;s difficult to think about a superior organization better set to climate the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/securing-the-digital-workplace-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">Covid-19</a> tempest than Amazon.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a decent possibility that you would&#8217;ve just seen different deals channels languishing.

It plays a significant role in all major areas of human interests and benefits. Biotech touches all areas including economics, environment, and health. The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/12/29/8-predictions-for-the-future-of-iot-in-2017-il1/\">applications of biotechnology</a> have both positive as well as negative impacts for human civilization.</p>\n<p>Biotechnologies are fundamentally oriented for improving the efficiency of production techniques in agricultural, industrial and biomedical fields.</p>\n<p>Several advanced surveys and statistics across the globe emphatically explain how biotechnology is poised to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/30/7-ways-ai-is-helping-doctors-diagnose-and-treat-cancer/\">change our lives for good</a>.</p>\n<h3>The &#8220;higher purposes&#8221; of Biotechnology.</h3>\n<p>In earlier times, biotechnology’s usage was restricted to fundamental processes like making cheese, wine, bread. Today we have the advantage of superior technologies and the motive of urgent requirements to use biotechnology appropriately for many higher purposes of the society.</p>\n<p>Biotechnology is controlling a major part of our lives without us realizing its presence in our surroundings and utilities.</p>\n<h4>The four disciplines of Biotechnology are in control of our lives.</h4>\n<p>Controlling many areas, such as the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/08/how-will-it-shape-up-the-future-of-the-internet/\">food we eat to medicines we consume</a>, the clothes we wear and how they are washed to the fuel we use, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/30/top-2020-wordpress-plugins-for-business-data-visualization/\">biotechnology is everywhere</a>. The four disciplines of biotechnology are making its invaluable presence felt in meeting our daily needs.</p>\n<h4>Biotechnology is often being regarded more as an art than a science.</h4>\n<p>Biotech is sometimes not <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/is-ai-just-as-biased-as-the-humans-creating-it/\">thought of as a science</a>, but it should be. Because of biotechnology&#8217;s ability to touch upon people’s lives by accentuating the quality of life, it&#8217;s becoming invaluable.</p>\n<p>The solutions Biotechnology provides change results for the grand challenges of society. Solutions are found for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/05/how-connected-devices-could-revolutionize-nutrition/\">food security</a>, climate change, energy shortages, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/23/arrow-microsoft-the-new-product-lifecycle/\">healthcare choices</a>, and affordability.

Prior to using a mark in identifying a specific product or service, there&#8217;s a need to perform a clearance search. A clearance search or trademark search determines whether there’s an existing mark. If there is an existing mark that is already registered &#8212; it&#8217;s likely similar or the same as to what you want to use. Here is how to conduct a trademark search for a business startup in UAE.</p>\n<p>Similar to a trademark in the US &#8212; a Trademark search in UAE is also referred to as due diligence search. It&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/26/how-website-design-integrates-with-the-internet-of-things-iot/\">systematic search of unregistered and registered</a> trademarks that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Are being utilized anywhere in the world or country, where applicable; </em></li>\n<li><em>Are similar or the same as the trademark that you plan on using or registering;</em></li>\n<li><em>Are being utilized for similar or the same products and/or services; </em></li>\n<li><em>Are likely to confuse consumers with regards to the source of the products and/or services </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is very essential to<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/24/cybersecurity-best-practices-7-ways-to-secure-your-data-in-2020/\"> keep proper records</a> of the progress and process of the trademark search (in UAE &#8212; farahatco dot com; a trademark searching service).  The date that the search has been conducted should also be noted as well as the words, codes, and terms that are used in the search. Also, don’t forget to record the database that was scanned and the trademarks that have been found from the search.</p>\n<h2><strong>Make a Trademark.</strong></h2>\n<p>Brainstorm a name for the mark or sketch a logo design. It is an excellent idea if you generate several different logos or names just in case the first choice is in use already by another person or entity.</p>\n<h4><strong>Provide a Description for the product or service that will be covered by the Mark.</strong></h4>\n<p>When applying for UAE trademark registration which is done with the UAE Ministry of Economy, you will need to identify products or services that are covered by the mark.</p>\n<p>Utilize the resources available in identifying acceptable terms which describe certain products and services.</p>\n<h4><strong>Highlight all the Related Products or Services.</strong></h4>\n<p>To make the most use of a mark, related products and services are also to be identified. Products and services will be considered as related by the authorities if they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Used together – hockey sticks and ice skates; </em></li>\n<li><em>Sold together – underwear and socks; </em></li>\n<li><em>Made with similar materials or ingredients &#8211; butter and cheese</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Identify Design Codes.</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/10/how-do-qr-codes-work/\">Design codes</a> are identified for marks that have design elements in them. If the trademark incorporates a logo or design, the trademark search should include a search for designs that are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p>Utilize the resources available (e.g., the services of a local or international trademark specialist) to identify appropriate codes for every single prominent design element within your trademark.</p>\n<h4><strong>You will also want to carefully review all guidelines for every one of the codes.</strong></h4>\n<p>To give you an example, if the trademark has a penguin that is sporting a bow tie, then the search codes must be identified for penguins in costume, bow ties, ties, silk scarves, etc. You should carefully watch these design elements whether in the U.S. or any other country. Respect whichever country design codes you are implementing.</p>\n<h4><strong>Scour Registries for Registered Marks and Pending Applications.</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/08/30/trademark-protection-for-startups/\">trademark database</a>, then search the specific works in the mark you plan on registering. Look out for exact matches, then move on to expanding your search with the use of words which sound like your trademark. Don’t forget to include spelling variations and similar meanings.</p>\n<p><strong>Scan results you uncover for trademarks that are already registered for the same or similar products or services that you are or will be putting on the market.</strong></p>\n<p>You can also conduct a combined mark search using the mark and the products or service terms. The search may also include international class code. Especially if the mark has design elements in it, the search for design codes as mentioned earlier.</p>\n<h2><strong>Review the Trademark Status.</strong></h2>\n<p>For every relevant mark that you have uncovered along the way, check the ownership information and current status. You may catch a trademark that has already expired and is not in use any longer by the trademark holder. These elements or trademarks, you may be able to use or acquire depending on the lapse of status.</p>\n<h4><strong> </strong><strong>If Possible, Expand the Search.</strong></h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/02/top-futurist-speakers/\">comprehensive trademark search</a> includes common law marks or unregistered trademarks, as well as trademarks that are registered at state or provincial levels.</p>\n<p>Resources that you can scour include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>social media sites</li>\n<li>internet search engines</li>\n<li>domain name registries on the internet</li>\n<li>yellow pages</li>\n<li>business directories</li>\n<li>national trademark databases</li>\n<li>business name registries</li>\n<li>e-commerce sites</li>\n<li>product catalogs</li>\n<li>trade publications</li>\n<li>trade associations</li>\n<li>local shopping malls</li>\n<li>newspapers</li>\n<li>magazines</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>There is a need for a vast scope of search and accuracy to make sure that a trademark search performed is effective.</strong></p>\n<p>The trademark specialists in <em>Farahat &#38; Co</em> can help ensure that your search results are reliable as they utilize several different strategies and technology in conducting a thorough search.</p>\n<p>Expand your brand today.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/09/how-to-conduct-a-trademark-search-for-a-business-startup/\">How to Conduct a Trademark Search for a Business Startup</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 18:01:10 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Conduct-a-Trademark-Search-for-a-Business-Startup.png","linkMd5":"e5c81b2a611b4150725ed6863d0ad39c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-637_376b9648004063cc.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Conduct-a-Trademark-Search-for-a-Business-Startup.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":829241,"destBytes":98416,"author":"Vinod Janapala","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Conduct-a-Trademark-Search-for-a-Business-Startup-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-14-876_a8b64c69e6702a7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874147},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"Airvet Showered by Investors with $14M in Series A Funding to Bring Virtual Care to Every Pet Owner in the Country","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173768","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/01/airvet-showered-by-investors-with-14m-in-series-a-funding-to-bring-virtual-care-to-every-pet-owner-in-the-country/\" title=\"Airvet Showered by Investors with $14M in Series A Funding to Bring Virtual Care to Every Pet Owner in the Country\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"116\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airvet-Showered-by-Investors-300x116.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airvet-Showered-by-Investors-300x116.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airvet-Showered-by-Investors-260x101.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airvet-Showered-by-Investors.png 896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>We’ve all seen telemedicine quickly work its way into the mainstream, giving us live on-demand<br />\naccess to dermatologists, therapists, or pediatricians virtually. In fact, with COVID-19 still<br />\nlooming, many of us have likely used it ourselves in just the last few months. But what about<br />\nour pets? We look at them the same as the rest of our family, so why aren’t we getting the same<br />\nlevel of care for them? With the Airvet app, you can.</p>\n<p>Airvet is the company behind the #1 telehealth app for pets. It launched out of Los Angeles in<br />\n2018 and just announced a $14M Series A financing to support and expand the explosive<br />\ndemand for its platform. The round was led by Canvas Ventures, with participation from<br />\ne.ventures, Burst Capital, Starting Line, TrueSight Ventures, Hawke Ventures, Bracket Capital,<br />\nMichael Stoppelman, and several major veterinary industry leaders.</p>\n<p>Airvet was built with a focus on providing a modern virtual care experience for pet owners<br />\nacross the country and quickly rose to be the #1 rated pet telemedicine app in the App Store<br />\nwith over 2,300 reviews and a 4.9/5 star rating. The company was started by a father-son duo,<br />\ncelebrity veterinarian Dr. Jeff Werber, and his son, entrepreneur Brandon Werber.</p>\n<p>When asked where the idea came from, Brandon shared that “It was simple. My dad is a veterinarian, so I’ve never had to worry about pet care. I’ve got two french bulldogs, Carlos and Denzel, who mean the world to me.</p>\n<p>Whenever I have a concern about their health or a question about their behavior, I just text or call my dad and get answers I know I can trust in seconds &#8211; it’s<br />\nextraordinarily comforting. I want every pet owner in the world to have that same feeling.”</p>\n<p>Using Airvet is straightforward and there are a couple of ways to use it depending on the situation.<br />\nOne option is their “on-demand” service for pet owners who need help right away, which can be<br />\nused by all pet parents whether or not their own vet uses Airvet yet.</p>\n<p>In these cases, pet parents can start an on-demand call 24/7 to connect with a licensed US-based veterinarian via live video or over the phone typically within a couple of minutes for just $30. There’s no time limit and cases will usually stay open for 3 full days, so pet parents can continue to access the same vet via chat for any follow-up questions or concerns.</p>\n<p>Another option is to schedule a virtual visit with a pet parent’s own vet, if their normal vet<br />\nalready uses Airvet, as thousands do. Airvet has partnered with hundreds of veterinary clinics<br />\nnationwide, enabling them to extend care virtually to their own clients.</p>\n<p>For these pet owners, virtual appointments can be scheduled to speak to their own veterinarian for various types of virtual exams and re-checks, for example. As curbside appointments have become popular, clients can even join an exam live from the parking lot while their pet is inside with the vet. Like at their office, vets set their own prices for these services.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 gave the company quite a boost, with Airvet growing its platform by<br />\nover 7x in just the last few months. Their nationwide network of veterinarians has also expanded<br />\nto over 2,700 veterinarians in 43 states who have helped more than 6,000 pets get care last<br />\nmonth alone.</p>\n<p>Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Werber, pointed out that “over 70% of pet parents go to Google or<br />\nsocial media to get answers to their pet issues before even attempting to talk to a veterinarian.</p>\n<p>I’ve been in those Facebook groups and I’ve seen the forums where the information that is given can<br />\nbe terrifying.

The funding is expected to fuel accesiBe’s expansion, widening its reach across North America and improving its support for its partners and customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What excites us most about our partnership with K1 is that now, with the amazing support of our investors, we can bring accessibility to the world. Our vision is to make the internet truly accessible to everyone. By utilizing machine learning, our solution can help millions of businesses comply with legislation and avoid lawsuits on the one hand, while enabling users with disabilities to browse the internet effectively on the other. It&#8217;s a win-win,” Shir Ekerling, cofounder and CEO of accessiBe, said.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171343 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-team.png\" alt=\"accessibe team\" width=\"468\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-team.png 468w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-team-300x200.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-team-240x160.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" /></p>\n<p>Web accessibility remains sorely lacking across the internet. In a survey of <a href=\"https://accessibe.com/blog/knowledgebase/we-analyzed-10000000-pages-and-heres-where-most-fail-with-ada-and-wcag-21-compliance\">more than 10 million webpages</a>, accessiBe found that only a small percentage was fully compliant with the provisions outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which ensure that websites can be accessed by people with disabilities. The lack of wide-scale compliance means that most websites remain unusable by people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the disabled are now actively looking for ways to remedy their situation, including resorting to legal avenues to push sites and businesses to comply. Laws such as the United States’ American with Disabilities Act (ADA) are now being used as bases for lawsuits against noncompliant businesses. Recently, US courts <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/01/15/17-55504.pdf\">have affirmed</a> that websites and mobiles need to be compliant and that the law can be used against organizations that do not provide equal access to their services through these digital channels.</p>\n<p>To drive change, accessiBe uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to help websites achieve compliance to the WCAG and ADA easily. Site owners and developers only need to integrate a single line of code into their websites, after which accessiBe’s AI would then perform a comprehensive audit of all web content and automatically perform the necessary changes to apply the standards.</p>\n<p>Conventional accessibility audits and remediation are lengthy and tedious to perform, usually requiring expert resources. Through accessiBe, what usually takes weeks or even months to accomplish can be done within 48 hours without any need for additional human resources.</p>\n<p>The solution also readily introduces features that support disabilities including visual, motor, and cognitive impairments. An accessibility panel is automatically integrated into the website, allowing users to change visual elements such as size, contrast, and color that would make it easier for visually impaired users to read the site. accessiBe also enables an option to disable animation and other flashing visuals which could trigger seizures in epileptic patients.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171344 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software.png\" alt=\"accessibe software\" width=\"468\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software.png 468w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software-296x300.png 296w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software-158x160.png 158w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software-40x40.png 40w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/accessibe-software-60x60.png 60w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" /></p>\n<p>Founded in 2018, accessiBe is already being used by websites ranging from high-traffic commercial websites to nonprofits. Development platforms and design agencies such Digital Ocean, BigCommerce, and Volusion also use accessiBe to introduce accessibility into their clients’ websites.</p>\n<p>The new investment puts accessiBe in a strong position to work on its mission of creating an accessible internet by 2025. Aside from capital, K1’s involvement also brings stewardship and guidance to accessiBe. K1’s portfolio includes a number of fast-growing technology companies such as Apttus, Gravyty, and Checkmarx.</p>\n<p>“K1 is excited to partner with Shir Ekerling and the accessiBe team as they continue their rapid global expansion,” said Mike Velcich, Principal at K1. “accessiBe has a highly differentiated product and unique approach to solving a critical need for all businesses with a web presence.

Patients are staying home, meaning nurses and doctors are using technology to administer care from a distance. </p>\n<p>The telehealth platforms currently in use may be a bit rudimentary. The coming years, however, are poised to shake up the industry in a major way. By 2030, telehealth will have completely transformed, becoming a defining aspect of the medical industry. But what will it look like? </p>\n<p>Things are uncertain, but a few aspects of telehealth are guaranteed to rise to prominence.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Greater access to products</b></h3>\n<p>A few years ago, the greatest factor in deciding which medicines you acquired was what your local pharmacy had in stock. Amid the industry&#8217;s digital transformation, companies are looking to the web to get people the medications they need.</p>\n<p>While general-use digital pharmacies aren&#8217;t yet the norm, niche providers are prospering. Leading the pack is <a href=\"https://www.innerbody.com/home-health/nurx-reviews\">Nurx</a>, an entirely online provider of birth control. Bolstered by its digital format, Nurx offers more than 100 different types and brands of birth control. That ensures that patients have access to the medication that&#8217;s right for them. The future of medicine is about patient choice, and telehealth gives patients more choices than ever.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Increased diagnosis accuracy </b></h3>\n<p>It may sound counterintuitive: How can diagnosis accuracy increase if patients aren’t in the office? All the same, it’s a reality of telehealth. While many technologies aren&#8217;t at peak performance, the coming years will see large-scale deployment of a number of programs to make diagnosis outside the office easy.</p>\n<p>Research published in The Lancet showed that artificial intelligence was <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326460#AI-on-a-par-with-healthcare-professionals\">just as good</a> at diagnosing patients as human doctors were — in some cases, even better. As platforms that track and record symptoms grow in sophistication and popularity, remote diagnostics will become increasingly common. Better diagnosis will allow for more specialized treatment, reduced in-person visits, and higher-quality care. </p>\n<h3><b>3. A focus on cost reduction</b></h3>\n<p>In 1960, the annual cost of healthcare for the average American was $160 — nothing compared to the nearly <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/causes-of-rising-healthcare-costs-4064878\">$11,000</a> it costs today. As medical expenses continue to outpace wage increases, people need ways to keep their costs as low as possible without sacrificing their well-being. </p>\n<p>Telehealth platform eVisit reports that hospitals using their service can reduce admission numbers by <a href=\"https://blog.evisit.com/research-review-does-telehealth-really-save-on-costs\">19 percent</a> and bed usage by 25 percent. These reductions could save huge sums for hospitals; doctors’ offices stand to benefit even more. From handling an increased volume of patients to lowering overhead, telehealth can completely alter a doctor’s operating costs. </p>\n<h3><b>4. More specialist availability</b></h3>\n<p>Specialists form a crucial part of any healthcare system, providing care other doctors may be incapable of performing. Specialists, relatively small in number, book themselves months in advance. They may also be prohibitively far away from patients seeking their expertise, a dangerous combination for those in need.</p>\n<p>Telehealth frees up doctors&#8217; schedules by allowing them to see more on any given day. Distance is no factor when it comes to telehealth — specialists can meet with patients anywhere in the world. With the average appointment wait time at nearly <a href=\"http://trapollo.com/can-telehealth-overcome-physician-shortage/\">a month</a> in length, telehealth platforms are needed now more than ever.</p>\n<h3><b>5. The rise of wearables</b></h3>\n<p>Wearable health devices are already a multibillion-dollar industry. Integration with telehealth will send the industry’s growth to new heights entirely. Connective healthcare company VivaLNK found that <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/patients-will-use-health-wearables-to-reduce-trips-to-doctor-survey\">nearly two-thirds</a> of people would buy and use a wearable device if it meant fewer trips to the doctor. </p>\n<p>Even now, wearables can detect unusual heart activity and other medical anomalies, but progressions in the technology mean they&#8217;ll be able to detect even more in the coming years. That will give those who want to stay out of the doctor’s office relief while staying healthy.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, the idea of getting proper medical care without leaving your couch would have seemed preposterous. It’s the reality for many using telehealth today. The future of the industry isn’t entirely certain, but one thing is: Doctors <em>will</em> be making house calls again.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/18/what-will-telemedicine-look-like-in-2030/\">What Will Telemedicine Look Like in 2030?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:01:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-12-at-10.57.22-AM.png","linkMd5":"bae7aa6cd9ecfd2c886ce888ce38daa2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-24-809_7a5a798aace405ca.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-12-at-10.57.22-AM.png","destWidth":1149,"destHeight":567,"sourceBytes":585542,"destBytes":30574,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-12-at-10.57.22-AM-300x148.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-18-844_ae2762cf7e094f94.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875139},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"6 Reasons You Should Start Buying Your Glasses Online","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171101","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/20/6-reasons-you-should-start-buying-your-glasses-online/\" title=\"6 Reasons You Should Start Buying Your Glasses Online\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-Reasons-You-Should-Start-Buying-Your-Glasses-Online-300x218.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"buy glasses online\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-Reasons-You-Should-Start-Buying-Your-Glasses-Online-300x218.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-Reasons-You-Should-Start-Buying-Your-Glasses-Online-220x160.png 220w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-Reasons-You-Should-Start-Buying-Your-Glasses-Online.png 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In these unprecedented times, &#8220;shopping online from home&#8221; takes on an obligatory meaning. However, purchasing stuff online in general, and shopping for glasses online specifically has been on the rise for quite some time. The benefits of shopping for your next pair of glasses from the comfort of your home are just too good to ignore. </span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Easy, Convenient Shopping From Home<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The main thing about getting your glasses online: It<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">s super easy and comfortable. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All you have to do is go on the site, pick out a frame of <a href=\"https://www.glassesusa.com/eyeglasses-collection?affid=readwrite-lp1944&#38;utm_source=publisher&#38;utm_medium=readwrite&#38;utm_campaign=052020\"><span class=\"s3\">eyeglasses</span></a> or <a href=\"https://www.glassesusa.com/sunglasses?affid=readwrite-lp1944&#38;utm_source=publisher&#38;utm_medium=readwrite&#38;utm_campaign=052020\"><span class=\"s3\">sunglasses</span></a>, enter your prescription (if you need one), and that<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">s pretty much it, all without getting up from the couch. The order is shipped right to your door, without the need to fight through traffic and overcrowded stores. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you head to the same brick-and-mortar stores &#8212; you&#8217;ll deal with opening and closing times. Your online shopping experience is never closed. That means that if you<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">re lying in bed late at night and think, &#8216;dang-it, I&#8217;ve gotta have new glasses.&#8221; You don&#8217;t have to toss and turn all night thinking about it &#8212; just hop up and order your new glasses and go back to bed. You don<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">t have to wait for opening hours, lines &#8212; social distancing, nor your COVID mask. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. Risk-Free<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One concern many people have buying glasses (and other items) online &#8212; is regarding what to do if they don<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">t like the item or items they receive. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To ease these worries, most major online eyewear retailers offer a free returns period (usually between 14 and 30 days). If you aren<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">t happy with your order &#8212; there is an easy return option. What the return policy gives you is a &#8220;free home trial&#8221; period. Try on your new glasses &#8212; you&#8217;ll want to wear them &#8212; enjoy the experience. Wear these beauties to work or school. Within a day or two, you&#8217;ll know how you feel about your new purchase. </span></span></span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Keep Your Wallet Happy<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prices vary and fluctuate from site to site, but as a general rule of thumb, buying prescription glasses online is going to save you a lot of money compared to brick-and-mortar eyewear stores. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are several reasons for the significant price variation. The logical reason is simple: It costs a lot more to operate a brick-and-mortar store compared to an online establishment. Online eyewear retailers can offer much better prices &#8212; and the online retailer doesn&#8217;t have the big boss in there putting on extra stress and pressure. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, at <a href=\"https://www.glassesusa.com?affid=readwrite-lp1944&#38;utm_source=publisher&#38;utm_medium=readwrite&#38;utm_campaign=052020\"><span class=\"s3\">GlassesUSA.com</span></a>, one of the biggest eyewear online stores in the US &#8212; you can find prescription glasses for as low as $38. The price includes free standard shipping on all orders. Free shipping is something worth paying attention to when you<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">re checking out an online site. Some of the online glasses sites only provide free shipping with a specific order or cost minimum. You may want to get regular glasses and sunglasses at the same time, in this case. </span></span></span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. High-Quality Frames<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another friction point for those hesitant about buying glasses online is worrying about the quality of the product. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not all online eyewear retailers are homogenous in the selections they offer. The leading players in the online glasses industry offer the same quality of frames and brand names, as you would find at the store. No-worries online &#8212; you&#8217;ll find the light-weight options you are looking for in acetate, metal, and titanium glasses. Best of all &#8212; online &#8212; you&#8217;ll find a much better price. </span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Tailor-Made Prescription Lenses<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the process goes with online glasses sites &#8212; after you pick a frame, it<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">s time to ,choose the lenses you want. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In short, you don<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">t have to worry about not finding lenses to handle your prescription. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, you can easily find single-vision glasses (reading or distance) for any optical power. Yes, you can find those bifocals and progressives, and even prescription sunglasses. GlassesUSA.com offers over 900 eyeglasses to choose from of all kinds. You<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">re not going to have an issue with finding glasses to match what your doctor prescribed. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What if you don</b><span class=\"s4\">’<span class=\"s1\"><b>t have your prescription at hand when going online to order glasses?</b></span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some sites are offering different variations of prescription scanners &#8212; so if you have a pair of glasses you see well with, you can scan the optical details right from home and use that script to shop online. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The variety doesn<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">t end with prescriptions. There are endless options for customizing your lenses. You can choose thin lenses and a variety of coatings, such as anti-scratch and anti-glare. Right now, the anti-fog options are becoming big &#8212; maybe because of wearing masks or being out when it<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">s cold. Don&#8217;t forget the impact-resistant lenses (Polycarbonate or Trivex) for sports, or the light-adaptive lenses that change from dark to clear, tints, mirrored, polarized, and many more. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The very best is that you are in the comfort of your own home &#8212; no pressure &#8212; take your time and enjoy the process.</span></p>\n<h4><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>6. Find Exactly What You Need<br />\n</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One final advantage of online eyewear stores over traditional brick-and-mortar shops is the inventory. Physical stores are limited in what they can showcase you. Online? You<span class=\"s2\">’<span class=\"s1\">ll find 1000s of styles in every shape, color, and size to explore from the comfort of your home. </span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An online store can offer more styles and colors of everything &#8212; including all your favorite designer brands (some sites have more than others) such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, Gucci, Versace, Persol, Michael Kors, and the list goes on and on. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What about trying on the frames you want?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trying on the frames you want is part of the fun of buying new glasses in the first place. Want to try some cat-eyed hot pink glasses? Want to break out of your traditional, always stuck with the same thing mode? Providing a wonderful experience is what &#8220;Virtual Mirrors and Try Ons&#8221; has in mind for you. You can see yourself in any pair of glasses &#8212; in front of your computer or phone. Be anywhere you like &#8212; have a friend over for a &#8220;glasses party.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The thing is, the online glasses retailers have your best interest in mind. These online eyeglass companies want you to love this shopping experience so that you&#8217;ll return.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Final Takeaways </b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During ordinary times &#8212; or these extraordinary times &#8212; shopping for glasses online is becoming more significant for everyone. Perhaps a few years ago better prices and big discounts were the only selling points of the online glasses crowd &#8212; but times have changed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Free shipping, innovative and easy virtual shopping experiences and risk-free return policies are just a start. Take a look at the wide variety of high-quality products. You can take as long as you want shopping for your next pair of glasses online. No need to rush with a pressure-point salesperson standing over you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More than ever, now is the time you can relax and find the best pair of glasses you&#8217;ve ever had in your life. </span></p>\n<p><em>_ _ _</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was written in partnership with GlassesUSA.com.

Whether you are a small business or a big corporation, you want to try and reduce fraud at each of the risk exposure points. Fraudsters are intelligent, trying to come up with new ways to get around security and controls.</p>\n<p>For small businesses especially, <a href=\"https://www.chamberofcommerce.com/business-advice/top-it-concerns-businesses-face\">fighting fraud can be a real struggle</a>. It can be difficult to keep up with the necessary time and resources to get fraud detection and prevention controls in place. As a business owner, though, you can do a lot with minimal resources to fight eCommerce fraud.</p>\n<h2><strong>Use PCI Compliance As a Guide</strong></h2>\n<p>The best thing you can do as an eCommerce store is to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/challenges-and-opportunities-for-payment-gateway-integration-challenges-opportunities/\">ensure you are PCI compliant.</a> The Payment Card Industry has a Data Security Standard known as PCI DSS. The set of standards is the best practice for online merchants to put in place to help to prevent fraud, as well as breaches of data.</p>\n<p>There is a PCI Compliance Guide and making sure that you are compliant in each of the steps is paramount. Once you are compliant, it is important to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/05/zoombombing-was-just-the-beginning-securing-your-teams-for-remote-work/\">ensure you maintain compliance </a>to avoid fines. Being a vendor that is PCI compliant can help to deter fraudsters, as they know it will be a much harder road to achieve their goals.</p>\n<h4><strong>Put Controls Around Your Payment Gateway</strong></h4>\n<p>Your payment gateway is the one place where you can put in some simple controls that can go a long way. As an eCommerce store, you want to require Address Verification or AVS, as well as Card Code Verification or CVV.</p>\n<p>The Address Verification or AVS process will check the billing address the individual enters against the billing address with the credit card company. The Card Code Verification or CVV method also requires a security code, to help to prevent card-not-present fraud.</p>\n<p>These are a good starting point but may not go far enough to prevent fraud. Reverse e-mail look-up is another great tool to help fight fraud.  With reverse e-mail look-up, you can analyze an e-mail address against public databases, blacklists, SMTP checks and social media profiles to ensure legitimacy before processing a transaction.</p>\n<h4><strong>Perform Regular Reviews of Activity</strong></h4>\n<p>You can do a lot by looking at the activity that goes through your eCommerce store. Most of the time, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/22/6-emerging-cyber-threats-to-lookout-for-in-2019/\">fraudulent activity</a> is something that will quickly stick out to you, if you know what to look for. There can be some things that you can look out for including fake phone numbers, e-mail addresses that do not look real, as well as addresses that are out of place, such as a zip code not lining up with a state.</p>\n<p>You may also <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/01/11-artificial-intelligence-trends-every-business-in-2019-must-know/\">look at your order or transaction history </a>for things such as large orders, or excessive orders of high-priced SKU’s.</p>\n<p>Other things that may look out of place are differences in the billing and shipping address, coinciding with requests for expedited shipping. Being on the lookout through regular reviews can help keep your eCommerce store secure.</p>\n<h4><strong>Reviewing the Billing Address Against the IP Address</strong></h4>\n<p>Where is the customer located in terms of their billing address against their IP address? You can use tools to help to match the two of them up. If you have an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/how-to-ensure-security-with-vpn-connection-and-stay-safe-online/\">IP address that is in a different country</a> in comparison to the billing address, it could be a sign of a fraudulent order.</p>\n<h4><strong>Strong Password Requirements</strong></h4>\n<p>Hackers use automated programs that will quickly run all password permutations until they get into an account. One of the best ways to combat fraud as an eCommerce store is to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/03/27/password-strength-weaker-than-you-think/\">require strong passwords</a> for customers. While it may not be convenient to have strong passwords, it can help a lot as it is less likely they&#8217;re stolen. This includes having a high minimum number of characters, requiring a combination of symbols, numbers, as well as capital letters. This type of control can make passwords that much harder to crack.</p>\n<h4><strong>Block Users After Declined Transactions</strong></h4>\n<p>Fraudsters may try to guess, or using software to do the guessing for them, when it comes to credit card numbers. They are hoping they hit a match so that they can continue on with their transaction. You want to set limits on how many times a transaction can be declined.</p>\n<p>When they get multiple declined transactions, there are two steps you need to take to ensure they don’t continue. First you want to keep a log of profiles who have tried multiple declined transactions for future analysis. Next you want to block that profile once the declined transaction count has reached a per-determined threshold.</p>\n<p>Locking out the shopping cart and directing the individual to a phone call with customer service is the best course of action. If they are a legitimate customer who was having trouble typing in the information will contact the business to get it resolved.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrap UP </strong></p>\n<p>As an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/11/how-is-ai-helping-the-ecommerce-industry/\">eCommerce store</a>, you always need to be thinking about different ways that fraud can take place. Fraudsters are smart and are always trying to think outside the box to get around controls. Security controls need to not only detect fraud but also work to prevent it in the first place.</p>\n<p>As a small business or big corporation, take the time to ensure you are doing your part in fighting eCommerce fraud. Taking it one risk exposure, one control at a time can net positive gains in the long run.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Andrea Piacquadio; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/05/6-strategies-for-ecommerce-stores-to-reduce-fraud/\">6 Strategies for eCommerce Stores to Reduce Fraud</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-Strategies-for-eCommerce-Stores-to-Reduce-Fraud.jpg","linkMd5":"550786351b76adb5e5882aff3ba30469","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-25-215_1e96fe8209a5db9b.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-Strategies-for-eCommerce-Stores-to-Reduce-Fraud.jpg","destWidth":500,"destHeight":333,"sourceBytes":23763,"destBytes":21042,"author":"Matt Shealy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-Strategies-for-eCommerce-Stores-to-Reduce-Fraud-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-20-531_2c32b311122b8f76.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195870976},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"Less Data Transparency Means Less Investor Trust","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170013","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/25/less-data-transparency-means-less-investor-trust/\" title=\"Less Data Transparency Means Less Investor Trust\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"data transparency\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Less-Data-Transparency-Means-Less-Investor-Trust.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The business world can take two lessons away from the countries that have been most successful in fighting COVID-19. Data <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2017/06/15/incorporating-machine-learning-enterprises/\">operations</a>, data transparency and clear communications matter. Those are particularly important lessons for asset managers that need <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/03/how-to-ensure-your-data-is-providing-trustworthy-insights/\">trust</a> almost more than anything else right now.</p>\n<h2><strong>Singapore</strong> and data</h2>\n<p>Singapore’s initial response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) has been among the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/world/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve-countries.html\">better</a> in the world, though they are not out of the woods by any stretch.</p>\n<p>Attention has been focused on what decisions Singapore, as well as South Korea and <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-03-20/how-civic-technology-can-help-stop-pandemic\">Taiwan</a>, have made, and when they were made. But more attention should be paid to how those decisions became <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2010/02/03/send-help-disaster-response-from-the-cloud/\">possible</a>, and how they have been communicated. That is true for how these countries and their businesses approach economic contagion as well.</p>\n<p>In many cases, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/10/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse-which-is-the-best-data-architecture/\">efficient</a> data operations have been the “how.” It’s a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/13/how-data-analytics-can-save-lives/\">lesson</a> other governments and businesses can learn in order to try to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/15/it-project-management-a-love-affair/\">catch up</a> to what is happening now, what will happen next, and what can happen after that.</p>\n<h2><strong>Data operations</strong></h2>\n<p>A review in The Lancet <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30551-1/fulltext\">found</a> that Singapore’s data and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/15/decoding-the-future-trajectory-of-healthcare-with-ai/\">information</a> handling during the pandemic has been superior relative to the rest of the world. South Korea has admirably rolled out testing and used <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2011/04/13/mapping_geolocation_and_the_future_of_scalable_disaster_response/\">geolocation</a> data to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-throws-up-innovative-tech-solutions-in-coronavirus-fight\">identify</a> whom to test.</p>\n<p>China is faulted for not moving fast enough early enough. Transparency continues to be a concern. But once in motion authorities <a href=\"https://theshift.media/features/big-data-china-coronavirus-control\">used</a> mobile apps to support 14-day quarantines and infrared cameras in train stations to quickly identify travelers with fevers. Chinese authorities have to work hard to regain trust. Fears that something is being hidden will turn into more problems.</p>\n<p>Contrast that progress with Europe, where cases in Italy have surpassed those in much-bigger China. European authorities have been <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-03-20/how-civic-technology-can-help-stop-pandemic?utm_medium=newsletters&#38;utm_source=fatoday&#38;utm_content=20200320&#38;utm_campaign=FA_TODAY_032020%20Taiwan%27s%20Successful%20Pandemic%20Response%2C%20Trump%27s%20Information%20Crackdown%2C%20How%20Corruption%20Shapes%20the%20World&#38;utm_term=FA%20Today%20-%20112017\">called</a> bureaucratic and often technophobic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Transparent communications</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s not just how data operations have enabled decision-making. It is how information is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/digital-marketing-coronavirus/\">shared</a> rapidly, clearly, consistently, and in detail.</p>\n<p>We’re faced with a public health crisis where well organized and transparent data is crucial. Poorly organized data, shared inconsistently, leaves a vacuum filled by conspiracy and fear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/07/05/south-korea-smart-city-model-cl4/\">South Korea</a> quickly deployed a central<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\"> tracking</a> app that publicly informs citizens of cases within 100 meters of their current location. Koreans have embraced clear and credible access to information. They want to make informed decisions. Citizens want data transparency. They don&#8217;t want <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2010/12/20/shame_on_democratic_south_korea_for_censoring_face/\">hidden</a> realities.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has shared details quickly and openly with an analysis of COVID-19 mortality rates. These efforts provide every citizen with a war room <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-is-beating-the-coronavirus-can-the-us-do-the-same/\">dashboard</a> that allows them to feel that nothing is being hidden. Singapore releases detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-date-information-sharing-1.5500709\">each</a> COVID-19 case.</p>\n<h2><strong>Lines of communication</strong></h2>\n<p>There has been a longstanding fear in the asset management world of allowing too much transparency. Nobody wants investors trying to grab the steering wheel. Due diligence to earn investment in the first place is one thing. GPs suffer frustration if the questions keep coming after the money has changed hands.</p>\n<p>Allocators have built up their own data teams. They&#8217;ve pushed for more data, faster. To keep up funds and fund administrators have learned to build dashboards and to automate. But it hasn’t been with enthusiasm. There is a worry about setting expectations for data sharing that the fund will regret later.</p>\n<h4>When there’s no good news, there is anxiety over what the LP will believe they see in the data.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/private-equity-job-vs-hedge-fund-job-what-to-choose/\">Funds</a> will do better when they show <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/12/to-bolster-trust-businesses-must-act-with-humanity/\">trust</a> first, share data, and have established the infrastructure to offer transparency.

A select few are likely to see expansion during uncertainty while others are more likely to see shrinkage, furlough and contraction.</p>\n<p>Because the days of preparation for a crisis are past, it&#8217;s our current response and reaction to the current uncertainties that will play the biggest role in how we navigate and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/digital-marketing-coronavirus/\">thrive during and after events like COVID-19</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Commodities, staples (and those that serve them)</strong></p>\n<p>What a great time to be selling toilet paper, hand sanitizer, flour, food and liquor! <a href=\"https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/condom-shortage-due-to-pandemic\">Reports of condom shortages</a> underscore the fact that some services and industries continue in spite of economic reversals.</p>\n<p>Luckily, those who provide both direct and indirect inputs in the form of products and services to certain commodity sectors are so often insulated from other industry implosions. Grocery stores and eCommerce sites that provide such services continue to see peak (and greater) demand as people continue to use the toilet and drink alcohol.</p>\n<p>For instance, we have a current online marketing client in the candy industry who has been crushing his sales thanks to the current situation. With advertising costs down and demand for candy up, his has more than quadrupled the <a href=\"https://roi.me/\">ROI</a> on his ad spend.</p>\n<p>Finding opportunities to work in or service industries that may be providing commodity products to consumers during uncertain times will ensure you can both weather and thrive during economic crisis.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to credit, bailouts and wealthy benefactors</strong></p>\n<p>The recent rushed implementation of the CARES Act and it&#8217;s quick postmortem, confirms that attempts at widespread assistance are never distributed evenly or to those who may actually be in dire need. It becomes the classic case of largess distributed to the &#8220;who you know&#8221; few&#8211;or at least to those familiar with processing credit through the SBA.</p>\n<p>A perfect example is the implementation of the payroll protection loans (PPP) provided in the recent legislation. News feeds have been rife with stories about lack of both fund access and oversight as a small minority of crisis-stricken companies have even been able to get close to the needed funding.</p>\n<p>I know of only two of 20 or so CEOs in my personal network who were able to get the needed funding. Both banked with the same SBA lender and were able to get approved in less than a day with access to the funds in less than a week. Most others in my SMB circles were not nearly so lucky. Some spent an entire day completing forms while others waited with no response from their lender, only to find out from news outlets that the funds had run out in about 10 days.</p>\n<p>Those who have access to reasonably-priced debt and equity during crisis times (especially those not serving commodity sectors) will survive through the current rout. I have personally found that access is more about &#8220;who you know.&#8221; Cultivating those relationships on the finance side through a crisis is critical for survival. For the SMBs out there, start yesterday.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth in contract work while the labor rebound slips</strong></p>\n<p>As with recessions in recent memory, the current situation is also likely to have an even slower job recovery&#8211;or more like a lack of one.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_170137\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170137\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-170137 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions--900x450.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions--900x450.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions--300x150.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions--260x130.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-170137\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our current situation is more likely to mirror our most recent recession, thanks to more automation and current full-time workers picking up the slack. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States\">Source</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>A slower job recovery means stiff competition for positions, less full-time employment and more expansion of the gig economy. We are seeing this very trend among our <a href=\"https://seo.co/seo-reseller/\">SEO resellers</a>, those who start their own SEO agency using the outsourced resources of other firms. We expect to see similar trends across other services sectors where 1099 employees expand more quickly than W2 full-time work as businesses prefer the flexibility and lack of payroll and healthcare responsibility of full-time workers.</p>\n<p>As many <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/11/29/automation-could-kill-73-million-u-s-jobs-2030/899878001/\">major media outlets</a> have reported, the further <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/how-to-successfully-automate-your-approach-to-guest-blogger-outreach/\">growth of automation</a>, artificial intelligence and outsourcing is likely to continue to squash &#8220;real&#8221; job growth. Recessions unfortunately tend to accelerate creative destruction of jobs.</p>\n<p>As a small business owner in this environment, hunkering down can help, but there are certain sales, finance and operational roles within the organization that are critical to the continued survival of your org. If you have to furlough or let go certain employees, it may be worthwhile to bring them in on a part-time contractual basis to ensure the business operations remain intact through the trough.</p>\n<p>As an un or under-employed individual during this time, it may be wise to begin exploring more contract-based work as we head toward a flat job recovery. The earlier the better ensures you win out to those who may be late to the 1099 party.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay abreast of the latest news</strong></p>\n<p>The proliferation of negative news and information is rampant right now. Yes, it is healthy to avoid the 24-hour news cycle as it can fuel unnecessary anxiety. However, there are huge benefits to staying abreast of what is going on in the world as doing so can serve to benefit your activities and your survival rate going forward. In other words, the pros of staying very current on the news heavily outweigh the cons. The situation is changing rapidly and multiple times a day. Understanding the next moves of companies and governments can serve to protect you physically and financially as we navigate uncharted waters.</p>\n<p>For instance, think of those who could have taken advantage of a PPP or EIDL loan application (you miss 100% of the shots you don&#8217;t take), but missed it due to lack of information. Stay attune, stay abreast, stay safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare to survive, then thrive </strong></p>\n<p>In our current socially-distanced situation, the new reality has created some unlikely winners amid many unexpected losers. For instance, no one would have predicted that those providing home exercise equipment would make a killing in the next recession or that the typically recession-resistant dentists (most of whom have been furloughed through mid-May here in Washington state) would have been hit hard during a recession. Unlikely indeed.</p>\n<p>When it comes to recessions, some will thrive, some will survive and many will fail. Avoiding failure is the best that many business owners can hope for at this juncture. For those that are able to survive the current fray, they are likely to succeed in a greater fashion when the recovery eventually occurs (and it will). The reason: there will be a vacuum void in supply of goods and services that will need to be filled and fewer market leaders to fill the void when demand returns.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is remain calm, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/23/is-technology-artificially-engineering-panic/\">don&#8217;t panic</a> and work to survive and you will be poised to thrive in the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/growth-opportunities-available-during-and-after-pandemic-times/\">Growth Opportunities Available During and After Pandemic Times</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 15:21:41 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/economic-growth-during-uncertain-times.jpg","linkMd5":"8108ea27d36bdd5debdd0630e4e92b3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-24-079_6c36d2d2d1b45dce.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/economic-growth-during-uncertain-times.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":276886,"destBytes":238274,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/economic-growth-during-uncertain-times-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-39-103_cfacc33121a86245.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/job-recovery-during-recessions--900x450.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-14-648_ed6a25c3dd339925.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878328},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Give a Great Startup Founder and Entrepreneur  Media Interview","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168161","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/give-a-great-startup-founder-and-entrepreneur-media-interview/\" title=\"Give a Great Startup Founder and Entrepreneur  Media Interview\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview-300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"startup media interview\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview-300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview-260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>It’s always on the checklist for a business and startup founder &#8212; get media attention. And of course, you want that attention – it will put eyeballs on your product, which may lead to users, which can bring money, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/vc-funding-in-2020-what-investors-look-for-in-startups/\">potential investors</a>, and all the other wonderful things that can come from matching the right product with the right audience.</p>\n<p>But once you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/05/fifteen-podcasts-you-must-listen-to-in-2019/\">land that interview opportunity</a> – what next? How do you actually talk to the media? It can be intimidating, and obviously, you want to hit it out of the park.</p>\n<p>I spent more than a decade in the news business, and a lot of that time was spent talking to people who were <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/29/5-misconceptions-you-should-know-about-before-launching-your-tech-startup/\">trying to launch new businesses</a>. They were people with big dreams – to operate their own restaurant or speed-dating service (for real) or to sell an app appealing to recreational golfers. They all had an entrepreneurial streak and a desire to succeed.</p>\n<p>What they weren’t necessarily ready for was how to handle a reporter. Talking with these fine folk could be like pulling teeth. While they were excited about the media attention, once I got them on the phone or in person for a chat, they would clam up. Or they would be unsure how to answer my questions. It might have been a lack of confidence stemming from little experience dealing with media, they might have been wary of how a reporter would interpret their words, or perhaps they were just naturally shy.</p>\n<p>If you are a company or startup founder who has successfully secured the attention of a reporter and you’re nervous about your first real media interview, fear not! We’re here to help with tips to help you prepare for your interview.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Be Informed</strong></h3>\n<p>This sounds obvious, but you need to go into the interview knowing your stuff. You know how you got to where you are, and you know your product. But you should also make sure you are up to date on your industry, your competitors, and any recent developments or controversies in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>A reporter may try to throw you a tough question or a bit of a curveball just to see if you really know your stuff, especially if your industry was recently in the news. So be prepared to tackle just about any topic revolving around your industry.</p>\n<p>But – and this is important – if you <i>don’t</i> have an answer to something, just admit it! Don’t try to fake it, because the reporter will see right through you. Say you’re not sure, but you’re going to look into it and get back to them in an hour, or later in the day.</p>\n<p>And then, make sure you get back to them as soon as you can. A reporter will appreciate your honesty, and unless they are on the strictest of deadlines, they will likely be willing to give you the extra time to give them an informed answer.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Be Real</strong></h3>\n<p>Be yourself. If you spend the interview trying to spin or sell, just hammering home how awesome your product or service is and not really answering questions in a sincere way, you’re only going to turn them off, and possibly kill the story before a word is ever written. Reporters have finely tuned “BS detectors,” and they don’t appreciate an attempt at being snowed by anybody.</p>\n<p>You can be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-software-developer-interview/\">passionate about your product</a> without being overbearing. And you should absolutely let your passion show – just be careful not to overdo it.</p>\n<p>So relax a bit. Be yourself and be honest. Your story likely includes challenges and failures you’ve endured, so mention those and explain how you were inspired to keep going in the face of adversity. Don’t hesitate and stammer or show that you’re uncomfortable with a particular line of questioning. If you’re prepared, as we’ve already mentioned, you’ll be ready for anything.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Keep it Simple</strong></h4>\n<p>No doubt, there is a long story behind your company. And you know all the intricacies. Resist the urge to dive into every detail or side tangent. Doing that may water down your narrative and leave you unfocused when you’re talking with the reporter.</p>\n<p>Instead, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocialMktgFella\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andre Bourque</a> explains <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andre-bourque/3-things-to-do-to-prepare_b_6295132.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, you should create an outline of your key message so you can keep yourself on track.</p>\n<p>“Many companies make the mistake of saying too much or going off on unrelated tangents which bury the more important information,” Bourque writes. “Create powerful analogies, use precise statistics, and be prepared to provide the reporter with a strong, usable quote.”</p>\n<p>Memorize some highlights in order to remain on point. That doesn’t mean you can’t deviate from your main message based on how the conversation goes and based on what the reporter asks, but if you go in focused with a key message and clear narrative in mind, you’ll be more confident and clear in telling your story.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. But be Colorful</strong></h3>\n<p>“Color” in a story is interesting information or comments beyond the basic, necessary facts.</p>\n<p>When you’re telling your story, give examples to back up what you’re saying. Go in armed with anecdotes about when you started your business, how it has changed, or what you have learned along the way can all add color, or a little extra zest, to your narrative.</p>\n<p>Interesting anecdotes and little details are more likely to interest the reporter and the reader (potential future customers) than the basic history of your company. They can also lead to other, future stories if you’ve really piqued the reporter’s interest.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Respect the Media’s Role</strong></h3>\n<p>Sure, you want the reporter to write a glowing piece about how amazing your company is and how you are revolutionizing your industry. But that is not their goal, and it’s certainly not their job. The job of the media is to inform their audience about the news that may interest them and to give them the full picture on the topic with a fair, balanced story.</p>\n<p>Putting pressure on a reporter will not work. Respect their role and understand that they have their own goals and their own bosses. Be thankful that you’re being included or being featured; it could snowball into many more opportunities.</p>\n<p>Another tip: it’s OK to ask a reporter when they think a story might run, but refrain from being pushy about it. Don’t email or call them repeatedly to ask about the status of it. You can check in now and again (say, every couple of weeks), but don’t badger them.</p>\n<p>And remember this: if you impress a journalist by being honest, real, informed, and reasonable, you will undoubtedly be a source of information a reporter will return to. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksenia_valley\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ksenia Chabanenko</a> writes <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246427\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, “Next time the journalist has a request, you might be the first founder he/she calls simply because you were the most cooperative and prompt.”</p>\n<p>Like most reporters, I usually had little time to turn around several <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/03/11/8-real-world-stories-of-why-startups-fail/\">entrepreneur stories</a> at once. And while I would try to switch things up and interview a wide variety of sources as much as possible, I wouldn’t hesitate in a pinch to call up a source I knew was informed and able to think on their feet.</p>\n<p>You could be that source for a reporter, by sticking to some of the concepts we’ve mentioned here.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/give-a-great-startup-founder-and-entrepreneur-media-interview/\">Give a Great Startup Founder and Entrepreneur  Media Interview</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 15:00:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview.jpeg","linkMd5":"252a73b20ee4833b710d8780bf7603bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-21-718_b972ea460c6aaf8d.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":29061,"destBytes":21190,"author":"Sameer Ahmed","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Give-a-Great-Startup-Founder-and-Entrepreneur-Media-Interview-300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-19-476_119f06f02283fcfe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878471},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"How to Fix your Headphones Yourself: A Step-by-Step Guide","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167074","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/02/how-to-fix-your-headphones-yourself-a-step-by-step-guide/\" title=\"How to Fix your Headphones Yourself: A Step-by-Step Guide\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Fix-your-Headphones-Yourself-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"fix your headphones\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Fix-your-Headphones-Yourself-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Fix-your-Headphones-Yourself-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/How-to-Fix-your-Headphones-Yourself.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>If the music from your headphones sounds only in one ear &#8212; don&#8217;t rush to throw them out. Most people have experienced getting a pair of headphones only to have them stop working &#8212; especially on one side. You&#8217;ll find that your headphones are easy to fix and it&#8217;s quite fun, too. Most damage occurs while your headphones are still good. Here is how to fix your headphones for yourself &#8212; a step-by-step guide.</p>\n<h3><strong>Damaged contacts on your headphones can be sealed &#8212; especially on the plug.</strong></h3>\n<p>Surely you are familiar with this situation: you put on your headphones, anticipating the enjoyment of your favorite tunes &#8211; and that’s all: you don’t hear anything. Or only one earphone works, which is even more annoying.</p>\n<p>If such problems occur, in most cases, you can slightly twitch or tweak the cable at the plug or gently squeezing the base until the sound goes from both channels. This may help for a while &#8212; but you usually have to continually fiddle around with them to keep them working.</p>\n<p>The easiest solution, in this case, is to toss these in the trash and buy new headphones. That option is not bad, but what if the headphones you bought are not some ordinary headphones? What if this time you bought expensive, high-quality headphones, or they&#8217;re your most beloved and wonderful ones?</p>\n<p>There are thousands of headphones to choose from. Research claims that the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/10/26/market-hearables-reach-16b-2020-dl4/\">headphones market will reach $16B by the end of 2020</a>. Now, you&#8217;ve bought an earphone by spending hours of your precious time, comparing them, reviewing them and a lot more. Do some careful research before buying a pair of costly earphones because you&#8217;ll likely leave them somewhere, or your buddy will borrow them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Remember that the annoying issues with headphones usually don&#8217;t indicate a breakdown of the headphones themselves.</strong></h3>\n<p>You&#8217;re facing some kind of small damage to the contact, cable or connector plug on your headphones.Replacing the plug is not very difficult and expensive. If you contact the master, you&#8217;ll just be asked for money for fixing your headphones for a simple fix you can do on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>If you do careful work and your hands do not tremble, you can do everything yourself at home.</strong></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have a little preparation for the repair. There are a few components you&#8217;ll want to buy &#8212; but then everyone will be coming to you to have their headphones fixed.</p>\n<p>Standard contact plugs are sold in electronics stores for less than $100. A new plug always required a solder to the wire.

It will be easier to solder if you first individually tear the ends of the wires that you&#8217;ve already stripped.</p>\n<h2><b>Now, solder and fix.</b></h2>\n<p>Before you start soldering, it is useful to study the design of the stereo-pin contact plug. The headphone cable contains three wires: the right channel (usually red), the left channel (green, white or yellow) and the ground (in our case, usually copper).</p>\n<p>On a mono headphone plug, there is no right-left channel separation. Depending on the plug, the solder contacts will be of different sizes. Try not to create electrical connections between the contacts during soldering. Be especially careful with the ground, otherwise, when headphones are connected to the device, it will short-out (called a short circuit). Be mindful not to expose the ends of cables more than you need to for soldering.</p>\n<p>According to the photo below &#8212; solder the three wires to the contacts of the new plug. Then, move to the part of the cable that doesn&#8217;t have insulation.

We all know this, I know, but do you know that if you <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/26/byod-is-more-than-a-trend-heres-how-to-encourage-it-while-still-keeping-your-network-safe/\">expect survival of your business</a>, the steps you are probably applying might not be sufficient enough to save your device?.</p>\n<p>As all businesses are linked to the internet one way or another, that is through trading actions, websites, and so, your devices are exposed to the chances of a DDoS attack. A business encountering the threats of a botnet as inevitable. Most of us take some measures, but what if these steps were not as effective as we thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are attacks seen as a threat to a business? </strong></p>\n<p>Botnets are controlled by the herder &#8212; the herder is the one responsible for gathering all the corrupted bots and making an army that he uses to attach the device.</p>\n<p>We know the botnet are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/08/time-to-build-robots-for-humans-not-to-replace/\">robotic networks</a> used by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/12/10-practical-strategies-to-secure-your-digital-life/\">cybercriminals</a> to commit crimes.<strong> </strong>The bot herder who is the one who controls the bots uses his army of corrupted bots to cause a disruption on the internet; he makes the bots overload a website, which in turn brings about a denial of entry into the website this is also called a DDOS attack.</p>\n<p>When this is done, it gives the herder the opening to do as he pleases. It also disrupts the functioning of a device and making it obey the commands of the hacker or herder if the &#8220;bots,&#8221; they can be used to defraud advertisers using fake ads which is also a route through which the botnets gain access to the computer system or device, so with one click of the fake advert on the internet the botnets gain entry of the device.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Memorable attacks</h2>\n<p>The botnets have recorded some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/23/how-iot-has-exposed-business-organizations-to-cyber-attacks/\">level of very memorable attacks.</a> Businesses that have been affected by botnets are Twitter and Amazon from history in October 2016.</p>\n<p>On that Friday attackers controlling a vast collection of internet devices unleashed several massive attacks on Friday that left dozens of popular websites, including Twitter Inc. and Netflix Inc., unreachable for parts of the day on that was one notable event amongst many others.</p>\n<p>The attack denied many users from gaining access to websites and also affected the owners of such websites.</p>\n<p>Businesses since the invention of botnets have faced security challenges in their operation, tendencies of being defrauded off a large sum of money, identity falsified, hacked websites, fake ads on the internet. Since this is seen as a bane of businesses, it ought to be eradicated or managed in the way that it is not able to carry out its damage.</p>\n<p>Some businesses agree that the best way to deal with &#8220;botnets&#8221; are the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/22/unlocking-the-promise-of-enterprise-iot/\">precautionary steps</a>, whereby they try to avoid them from entry, but this is just like a war being fought from the outside leaving the insides unguarded if the enemies gain entry through a spot you missed they wreak havoc because within was not guarded.</p>\n<p>The precaution comes in the way whereby they are on the lookout trying to avoid entry of botnets. Although this is not a bad step, the truth is one cannot really be too careful; one way or the other, it finds its way in and gets the people or the device unprepared and could wreck its damage and bring loss for a while to such business.</p>\n<p>However, if one were to take predictive measures where they already have planned the action to take when it shows and how to deal with it, this would yield more results, precaution measures are measures that prepare the device for when the botnets attack. As stated before, precaution measures are not said to be wrong, but a more assured way is the predictive measure, which prepares the organization ahead of encountering it.</p>\n<p>So what are the steps that you are not really paying attention to? Make sure it&#8217;s a tradition upgrading your operating system. One fascinating thing about botnets is that they also upgrade themselves towards surviving your preventive measures, so an outdated operating system would soon enough outlive its immunity over the botnets’ attempt for entry.</p>\n<p>So for the fact that one could fall short in updating the OS due to forgetting or so on, you can set it on automatically updating. There you are not just safe, but you are also assured of future safety.</p>\n<p>It is important that you also know that downloading files from the internet also has a large probability of botnet attack. Botnets, usually in files and sharing services and when you end up connecting, they are given access to get into your device.</p>\n<h4>Before you download any file or receive any file, make sure it is well scanned or just look for more protected file-sharing networks.</h4>\n<p>Also, if you wanted to keep botnets out, you would avoid clicking on links that you are not totally sure of. Just as mentioned earlier, botnets hide in areas like ads waiting for that click, and with it, they gain entry.</p>\n<p>Such dangerous links that contain viruses live in places like YouTube comments, pop up ads. So you would examine the link and check its authenticity before clicking.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2007/12/11/report_spam_accounts_for_90-95_percent/\">you should avoid emails from unknown sources</a>. This also is a route through which botnets gain entry. The botnets could also be tricky and hide behind a known contact, so you should examine your emails closely in essence, scrutinize it, and make sure you are sure of its source before opening.</p>\n<p>One also ought to consider that it is vital to educate your personnel well, most are not well educated on the matter of cybersecurity, and that could be a deterring factor. Do not also give access to your computers or device to about just anyone, very important is the part that only well trained and trusted admins should manage your computer.</p>\n<p>Lastly, for solutions, you would be doing yourself a lot of harm if you operated without <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/18/five-best-open-source-antivirus-for-carefree-cyber-threat-protection/\">antivirus software,</a> am sure a lot know this. Antivirus comes in different types<strong>. </strong></p>\n<p>Also, primal is that you know that it is the most efficient way to remove botnets. Look for an antivirus capable of safeguarding your devices, which includes your phones, PC’s, and so on. Also, some of them (Antivirus) require upgrades, so try to make sure that they are upgraded.</p>\n<p>Concluding, we cannot totally be sure we are covered from botnets &#8212; they upgrade. Sometimes it takes time to get used to the various applications to keep them out, and soon enough they surpass the protective measure adopted, which is why upgrading your Operating system was mentioned.

A shortlist of the home connected devices include <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/17/gate-all-in-one-video-smart-lock-a-new-level-of-home-security/\">connected consumer electronics</a>, connected health devices, smart locks, thermostats, security cameras, sprinkling systems, and more. But long-range wireless power promises less waste and lower cost with <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/25/8-ways-to-keep-your-home-safe-and-secure-from-burglars/\">these smart home systems</a>.</p>\n<p>Interoperability and connectivity are two key deciding factors in purchase decisions. As the number of devices increases in the home, so does the need to keep them consistently charged and working (no one wants the smart lock on their front door to lose power).</p>\n<p>For those smart home devices that still call for the use of traditional batteries, consumers are faced with both an enormous amount of battery waste and high replacement costs. Also, because batteries only have a small total energy capacity, manufacturers are forced to sacrifice device functionality just to extend battery life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Taking <em>Charge </em>Without the Waste </strong></h3>\n<p>The proliferation of devices is driving the need for a sea-change in<em> how</em> those devices are powered. Batteries are expensive, wasteful, and often die quickly, leaving our smart home devices unusable, sometimes for days.</p>\n<p>Annually, Americans discard approximately 180,000 tons of batteries (more than three <em>billion</em> batteries), of which 86,000 tons are single-use alkaline batteries that cannot be recycled.</p>\n<p>Placed end to end, the dead alkaline batteries alone would circle the world at least six times. Much of this waste ends up in landfills, not only taking up precious land but also allowing harmful chemicals to leach into the surrounding soil and waterways.</p>\n<p>Despite advances in battery and charging technologies – like longer-lasting lithium-ion rechargeable batteries &#8212; a new Zogby report talks of, &#8220;Charging America 2019.&#8221; The Current State of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/21/coway-airmega-ap-1512hhs-smart-air-purifier-and-clean-design/\">Power Options for Smart Home</a> and Mobile Device<em>s, </em>found that 40 percent of consumers have to replace smart home device batteries multiple times per month.</p>\n<h3><strong>A New Path – Long-Range Wireless Power </strong></h3>\n<p>Not only do we need a more sustainable energy delivery approach for the benefit of our planet, but consumers are also hungry for alternative energy options. They want possibilities that will give them more excellent reliability and reduce their costs associated with having to purchase a plethora of batteries continually.</p>\n<p>25 percent of consumers that are investing in smart home technology said that they would spend an additional 10 percent or more for a smart home device with long-range wireless power if that meant making the device more mobile, easier to install and less of a hassle to service on a reoccurring basis.</p>\n<h4>Long-range wireless power is the disruptive technology that is cutting the cord.</h4>\n<p>Long-range wireless power is the disruptive technology that is cutting the cord on a soon to be an archaic system of powering devices, especially in the smart home.</p>\n<p>The process? A wireless power transmitter sends safe infrared beams to a receiver (typically embedded in the devices to be powered), and a small photovoltaic cell in the receiver converts the light to electricity. The concept is similar to solar panels converting sunlight into electricity.</p>\n<p>Infrared beams can travel with little degradation over a distance, efficiently and safely providing wireless power across a room. The infrared process dramatically reducing the need for batteries, and thus decreasing the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/13/3-ways-the-iot-can-offer-innovative-solutions-to-serious-environmental-problems/\">environmental footprint</a> caused by battery waste.</p>\n<h4>The infrared method of charging frees up manufacturers to create the smart home devices that consumers desire, free of the power limitations imposed by batteries.</h4>\n<p>Long-range wireless charging will turn the tide on battery waste with a more sustainable way to charge not only smart home devices, but mobile phones, tablets, wireless speakers, and industrial sensors.</p>\n<p>Long-range wireless eliminates the need for batteries and power cords altogether. It’s a win-win for consumers, manufacturers, and most importantly, our planet.</p>\n<p>The time is now for this disruptive tech to enter the entire industry. The long-range technology will innovate and prepare for a new way of charging the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/17/from-smart-home-to-aware-home/\">growing prominence of smart devices</a> in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>Just like WiFi-enabled a new class of products &#8212; long-range wireless charging can usher in the next generation of powered, eco-friendly smart devices.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Hilary Halliwell; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/25/ditch-batteries-save-the-planet-with-smart-systems/\">Ditch Batteries, Save the Planet with Smart Systems</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 25 May 2020 18:00:09 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ditch-Batteries-Save-the-Planet-with-Smart-Systems.jpg","linkMd5":"ed1fffb5b8aa21461268808efd3d361c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-20-756_f89c3a5375526358.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ditch-Batteries-Save-the-Planet-with-Smart-Systems.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1206,"sourceBytes":217246,"destBytes":145348,"author":"Yuval Boger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ditch-Batteries-Save-the-Planet-with-Smart-Systems-300x188.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-595_ad5878b1f572633c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877213},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"5 Advantages Artificial Intelligence can Give Your SME","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169252","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/24/5-advantages-artificial-intelligence-can-give-your-sme/\" title=\"5 Advantages Artificial Intelligence can Give Your SME\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"AI for SMEs\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>How fast do trends in the market advance? Specifically with regards to artificial intelligence. Businesses are taking advantage of artificial intelligence as a breakneck pace. According to a BI Intelligence report, 80% of companies will use AI <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/21/prodigious-customer-service-live-chat-vs-chatbots/\">chatbots</a> by 2020. Here are five advantages artificial intelligence can give your SMEs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence is </strong><strong>a trend that makes sense.</strong></h2>\n<p>Some SMEs fear that AI is an unattainable technology and difficult to apply. Conversely, business intelligence will help SMEs save a lot of time and money.</p>\n<p>But what is artificial intelligence, and how does it relate to business? What are the advantages that artificial intelligence can give your SME?</p>\n<h3><b>Artificial intelligence and business.</b></h3>\n<p>The term artificial intelligence can be used on all tasks that solve human intelligence foibles, and they are solved, quickly, by machines. Tasks such as planning or learning languages, for example, or recognizing objects in photos, people&#8217;s voices, and feelings, can be done by AI.</p>\n<p>And the truth is that artificial intelligence has a lot of potential. It is hoped that it can help solve very diverse problems ( prevent natural catastrophes, for example), but also that it will generate many other solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk\">Elon Musk</a> is a strong promoter of AI regulation. Musk believes that if AI is not regulated &#8212; it can be perilous. A recent example of this could be the GPT-2 text generator, capable of generating fake news that is too credible. Its creators (OpenIA, powered precisely by Musk) saw this generator as a threat more than anything else and decided to censor the full version — fearing the consequences. Thus, artificial intelligence has advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<h4>Tasks machines solve</h4>\n<p>Some examples of artificial intelligence we can find in our daily life: so, when we open Facebook and see the content that appears in the &#8220;News&#8221; tab, there is a selection in what is shown to each user, and an algorithm makes that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/10/is-artificial-intelligence-the-ultimate-university-stimulus/\">selection with artificial intelligence</a>. The same as when Amazon recommends a product or book. Or surely you have seen some content that Netflix suggests to you because you saw another similar one. These examples are from the machines in the form of AI software.</p>\n<p>Other examples are easier to see. Emotech&#8217;s assistant, Olly, is very similar to Amazon&#8217;s Alexa or Google Home, but has a fundamental difference: her personality can evolve &#8212; this is AI.</p>\n<p>We see that artificial intelligence is linked to business, and companies are taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do their tasks faster and at a lower cost.</p>\n<p>AI is one of the most disruptive technologies of the century, and it is helping SMEs to evolve faster, especially in the field of communications, product development, and customer service.</p>\n<p><b>Ways AI can help your business.</b></p>\n<p>The results of a Vistage survey of SME leaders make clear that the benefits of artificial intelligence are becoming very important to the business. 29.5% of those surveyed stated that, of all the new technologies, artificial intelligence is the one that will have the most significant impact on their companies.</p>\n<p>So what are the benefits that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/24/10-radical-ways-iot-will-revamp-your-seo-strategy-in-2020/\">SMEs can get from using artificial intelligence</a>? The AI advantages are capable of reducing costs, optimizing the use of time, and achieving an increase in results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><b> Optimize Human Resources tasks.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the areas in which artificial intelligence is advancing is Human Resources. Today, it is possible to take advantage of artificial intelligence to improve personnel selection processes, as well as to receive returns from new employees on the same method (and optimize it).</p>\n<p>Among the advantages of using AI in this type of process can be the fact that it can help your company choose between lots of applicants to see precisely which ones match the search criteria. Matching the search criteria not only reduces time and costs but also enhances applicants&#8217; quality and suitability, which, in turn, saves HR time they can spend on other tasks.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Automate conversations with customers.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A chatbot with artificial intelligence is another of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/how-ai-at-the-edge-other-iot-trends-are-transforming-every-industry/\">the most common examples in business</a> intelligence. The acquisition of chatbots by companies is, as we saw above, increasingly common and necessary for SMEs, regardless of their size.</p>\n<p>One of the most important trends in digital marketing is conversational marketing, which proposes a return to conversations and the human factor in sales.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s where chatbots have a lot to contribute: they can become a 24/7 customer service, and above all, capable of generating conversations. Potential clients don&#8217;t want to go through the experience of filling out long forms and then have to wait for an answer: they need immediate attention and human warmth.</p>\n<p>Many of the SMEs do not have sales teams or customer service. If this is your case, then you could find in chatbots a way to relieve the pressure of generating and maintaining lots of conversations at the same time.</p>\n<p>And if you have a sales team, using a chatbot can be a great idea. Not only does it ease the operational burden, but it helps them focus on what they really need to do: sell.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Make content marketing more accurate.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we can see, one of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/24/3-ways-tech-startups-are-using-ai-to-revolutionize-customer-experience/\">advantages of artificial intelligence</a> is that it is helping marketing to oil their strategies &#8211; refining them, making them more effective. And one of those strategies is content marketing.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, good content is not just about composition and writing: it is also about making data-driven content. It is essential to create content from the data collected about audiences, to give them personalized content that resonates and is useful to them.</p>\n<p>In this sense, there are already artificial intelligence tools capable of helping marketing teams to make specific content. For example, there are different types of software to create algorithms that detect what content can generate interest, based on previous readings by audiences. What&#8217;s more, some algorithms can predict the content to determine its potential to generate conversions.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Increase sales with CRM.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CRM (English customer relationship manager ) are systems designed to optimize the relationship with customers. In general, these systems collect data through different platforms (mail, social networks, telephone) and streamline sales processes using the knowledge they obtain with this information.</p>\n<p>Some CRM platforms are already using AI to help SMBs analyze this collected data. In this way, they can propose lead generation activities based on information analysis, and as a result, they can speed up the process of acquiring new customers — and ultimately, sales.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Boosting SEO.</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the Google search engine, there are 67,000 searches per second. An impressive number, I must emphasize.</p>\n<p>Searching is one of the most important sources of income for the giant Google, which is determined to improve it more and more. His <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/is-ai-just-as-biased-as-the-humans-creating-it/\">artificial intelligence assistant</a>, Duplex, uses neural networks to understand and generate natural language. Its Lens program enables image searches. There is constant work at <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/10/4-ways-to-optimize-your-site-to-rank-on-google-in-2019/\">Google to understand what users are looking for</a> and how to give them better answers.</p>\n<p>Consequently, companies will have to pay attention to these changes to satisfy the requirements of the Google search engine. And in this field, artificial intelligence again shows its advantages, combined with SEO.</p>\n<p>Some of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">AI and SEO-focused programs</a> can help analyze and automate site rankings.</p>\n<p>For analytics, examining essential metrics of the operation of the site, analyzing the competition and positioning, or optimizing the site to attract more potential customers.</p>\n<p>Regarding automation, many of the SEO tasks are well known but difficult to execute, and this is where AI software oriented to SEO can come into play—automating the search for keywords, the use of links, the blogging, all tasks that take a considerable amount of runtime — an effort that can be saved with the use of AI.</p>\n<h3><b>Towards effective AI execution</b></h3>\n<p>AI is not so far from the solutions that an SME requires in its day today. By contrast, the AI implemented in those solutions is not something esoteric or utopian, and there are AI tools that can help solve business problems.</p>\n<p>Remember that the chatbot has some functions that allow effective and accessible use of AI.</p>\n<p>The conversation analysis function is one of them. The feature applies AI to the conversations companies have with their customers. Through text mining, artificial intelligence helps uncover the phrases that dominate those conversations, thereby telling companies what their customers are asking the most.</p>\n<p>AI classifies that information into unigrams (one sentence) and bigrams (two sentences), which precisely detail the topics of the conversations. With this information in hand, companies benefit in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have reliable information on what are the topics of the conversations it is generating.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can use that information to make an effective landing page.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can configure Google Ads campaigns based on the specific demand of potential customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, there is a suggested answer function. If the previous function was used to determine what the topics of conversation were (what is most asked by users), the automatic response function suggests answers based on the recognition of the bigrams. AI works from what your clients ask to give suggested answers and thus shorten the cycles of the dialogues.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>AI can optimize your company&#8217;s daily work. It is not something far from the reality of your SME, but it is a tool that can make significant contributions.</p>\n<p>If we dwell a little more on the example of the conversations, we can think of it this way: if you have around 100 thousand chats and you see what they ask you the most, you will probably miss a few days of work on it.</p>\n<p>An AI trained for this task can do all of this for you, saving time in the process, as well as resources that you can allocate to what you do best.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: LJ; Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/24/5-advantages-artificial-intelligence-can-give-your-sme/\">5 Advantages Artificial Intelligence can Give Your SME</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 24 May 2020 15:00:01 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME.jpg","linkMd5":"8836f2000f21427839e1297c91363977","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-22-324_c031b1f5772d7603.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":151425,"destBytes":99780,"author":"Nabeel Ahmad","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Advantages-Artificial-Intelligence-can-Give-Your-SME-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-19-943_9ce7cb05ca1b867c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877307},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:59","title":"5 Signs that You are Ready to Scale Business and Deploy Innovation","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=167090","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/5-signs-that-you-are-ready-to-scale-business-and-deploy-innovation/\" title=\"5 Signs that You are Ready to Scale Business and Deploy Innovation\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business--300x185.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"scale business\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business--300x185.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business--260x160.jpeg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business-.jpeg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>The entrepreneur&#8217;s path is challenging and exciting.

A business needs new professionals in a team, new approaches, and new opportunities for growth. The usual state of things does not satisfy you as a business owner anymore. It is the first sign that your venture should be scaled soon.</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>“Think of [business scaling] like driving a car. Once you reach a certain speed, the gear that got you there will not get you to the next level of speed. You need to shift gears. If you don’t, your engine will burn out.” &#8211; </i><b><i>Daniel Marcos</i></b><b><i>, Co-Founder and CEO of </i></b><b><i>Growth Institute</i></b></p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>RESISTANCE. Do you feel the inner resistance to getting rid of old patterns?</strong></h3>\n<p>Before making a decision to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/startups-dont-need-to-be-revolutionary-they-need-to-be-different/\">incorporate innovation into your business</a> processes or to scale them, you may start thinking that the old patterns are not so bad as they have seemed previously. &#8220;I can continue running my business in this way in the couple next years, nothing bad will happen.&#8221; However, it may.</p>\n<p>Missing the right moment and opportunity to run a business transformation, you waste your company&#8217;s time and ability to evolve faster. The opportunity that is given but not used may lead to the most unexpected outcomes for your business. This money could be saved if I took the risk at that moment. That company could become our client if we hired more area-specific professionals. And so on</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>“The lizard brain is the reason you&#8217;re afraid, the reason you don&#8217;t do all the art you can, the reason you don&#8217;t ship when you can.

No, this shift is impossible for our company</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes, it seems impossible. However, was Steve Jobs thinking that the first personal computer is impossible to create? The feeling of impossibility fuels real innovation. A lamp can&#8217;t shine without any visible source of energy. The modular lighting panels can&#8217;t be stuck together on the wall without glue &#8212; those lights maybe not. But your light &#8212; may be. Think out of the box.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The ability to go beyond your own limits allows you to do the impossible things and bring innovation for others too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>“It’s kind of fun to do the impossible.” – </i><b><i>Walt Disney</i></b></p>\n<h3><strong>FEAR. Are you afraid of making incorrect decisions and facing failures?</strong></h3>\n<p>You will definitely make them. Probably, you will make them even more than you might expect, and it is normal. Innovation requires you to experiment and make mistakes. The path to the sky-rocket <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/04/3-ways-artificial-intelligence-could-boost-the-success-of-your-business/\">business success</a> is made up of the mistakes, experiences, and the right conclusions.</p>\n<p>Your team may conduct in-depth product research and investigate all your competitor&#8217;s tactics. However, you are not insured against failures. You must be ready to make as many mistakes as needed to refine the market-ready product or scale business less stressfully.</p>\n<p>Fear creates only an illusion that failure is equal to possible death. Actually, it only looks like this, but it is not fatal. We are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/09/what-business-leaders-can-learn-from-professional-sports/\">born to succeed</a> as well as to fail, make the right conclusions, and achieve even larger success in the future.</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>“From my experience, transitioning from a small business (10-30 employees) to a middle-sized company (50-100 employees) is the most stressful. Your thoughts are messing around questions, like &#8220;How to hire all these people?&#8221; or &#8220;How to control the quality and delivery process in the growing company?&#8221; </i></p>\n<p><i>After this point is overcome, business scaling happens less stressfully. You stop overthinking about coming problems; you just try to solve them. Later, you pass over other business scaling phases easier by following a particular algorithm based on your own experience or experience of people who are smarter than you. Particularly, I would recommend the book &#8220;How To Solve The Mismanagement Crisis: Diagnosis and Treatment of Management Problems.&#8221; </i><b><i>&#8211; Dima Venglinski, Founder and CEO of </i></b><b><i>Fireart Studio</i></b></p></blockquote>\n<p>You might hear a saying that laziness drives innovation. However, fear drives it even more effectively. The idea that evokes the biggest fear inside of you is likely a perfect point for your inner upgrade. It pushes you to come out of particular frames and help the rest of the world do the same using your products or services.</p>\n<h3><strong>VULNERABILITY. Are you afraid of being ashamed and vulnerable in the eyes of your customers and employees?</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p><i>“If you are deliberately trying to create a future that feels safe, you will willfully ignore the future that is likely.” &#8211; </i><b><i>Seth Godin, Entrepreneur, </i></b><b><i>Author</i></b></p></blockquote>\n<p>An entrepreneur is like a phoenix. Phoenix never dies but revives again and again. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/refocusing-media-operations-during-pandemic-long-term-growth/\">Stand up and stand out</a>. Real innovation also means a real risk, the likeability to fail and appear to be completely vulnerable to financial issues and a bad reputation. However, modern business needs <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/16/kubernetes-going-mainstream-innovative-startups-rise/\">more art and innovation</a>. They are worth risk-taking.</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Work hard and never give up. Don&#8217;t believe anybody who claims that it&#8217;s easy to do something really valuable. Success is not magic but hard work. Good things take time and effort to happen. All successive entrepreneurs who I know are hard-working people with the incredible ability to revive after plenty of failures.&#8221; </i><b><i>&#8211; Dima Venglinski, Founder and CEO of </i></b><b><i>Fireart Studio</i></b></p></blockquote>\n<p>It is not about making impulsive decisions that implicate taking ill-considered risks. Of course, each step in an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/06/competitive-strategy-how-to-create-an-unbeatable-business/\">unbeatable business strategy</a> needs refinement, analysis, and probably in-depth research conducted by a professional team. Here, we are talking about moving away from conservative industrialism and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/09/china-and-america-want-the-ai-prize-title-who-will-throw-the-knockout-punch/\">stepping closer to innovation</a>.</p>\n<p>It can be a shining and promising opportunity for success and breakthrough (not only yours but your prospective customers’ too). However, it may also be scary in its beauty and unreachability. It may irritate your eyes with its amazing shine and allure with stepping into a completely new experience.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/07/5-signs-that-you-are-ready-to-scale-business-and-deploy-innovation/\">5 Signs that You are Ready to Scale Business and Deploy Innovation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 21:00:27 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business-.jpeg","linkMd5":"8ec933f9f732b4af7a576298b35f7a63","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-24-869_c2c86dfe84492ad7.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business-.jpeg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":25958,"destBytes":19530,"author":"Dana Kachan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5-Signs-that-You-are-Ready-to-Scale-Business--300x185.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-11-012_3badf8b1246f5c9d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pexels-photo-1036936-e1582043060437.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-14-299_3f9a69b41a3c4a86.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pexels-photo-443426-e1582043205450.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-19-901_1a7393675bb3be12.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195879093},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"5 Benefits Attracting Tech Talent to Your Startup","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171690","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/5-benefits-attracting-tech-talent-to-your-startup/\" title=\"5 Benefits Attracting Tech Talent to Your Startup\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM-300x198.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM-300x198.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM-243x160.png 243w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM.png 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Solid tech talent is vital for any company to exceed. Unfortunately, within the next decade, companies can expect a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/today-the-tech-talent-shortage-is-everybodys-problem/\">serious dearth of technical applicants</a> across the board. In fact, estimates put the shortage at around <a href=\"https://www.kornferry.com/content/dam/kornferry/docs/article-migration//FOWTalentCrunchFinal_Spring2018.pdf\">85 million</a> candidates by 2030.</p>\n<p>If your company has a growing or anticipated need for technology gurus, take action now to ensure you minimize the effect this shortage could have on tomorrow’s operations. Below are several recruitment strategies aimed at wooing high performers from the tech industry into your organization. </p>\n<p>Better yet, they ensure they’ll stick around for more than a year or two. The longer you retain exceptional superstars, the better positioned you’ll be to lead your industry without lagging behind.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Develop a robust top-shelf benefits package.</b></h3>\n<p>You probably already know that you should plan to pay competitively for top tech talent. Even lower-paid systems administrators <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3235944/hiring-the-most-in-demand-tech-jobs-for-2018.html\">fetch nearly $70,000</a> annually. Longtime network security architects can command close to $200,000 each year. Yet savvy job seekers aren’t just looking at salaries. They’re interested in what else a company offers in terms of benefits packages.</p>\n<p>How can you boost your plan’s appeal for incoming tech folks? Add a <a href=\"https://www.guideline.com/blog/small-business-guide-offering-401k-plan/\">small business 401(k)</a> with a generous match. An average match across the board is 4.3 percent of an employee’s pay, per <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120315/what-good-401k-match.asp\">Investopedia figures</a>, but you could up the ante by going to 6 percent. Other competitive benefits to sweeten the deal include fully funded comprehensive health insurance that includes partners, extensive paid time off that’s accruable, life insurance options, and attractive personal development stipends. </p>\n<h3><b>2. Give tech personnel a voice.</b></h3>\n<p>We’ve all heard of the stereotypical tech employee who sits in a back room and is rarely seen. That’s a myth that needs to end — technology professionals deserve to contribute to the decisions made at various levels in your company. If you’ve never given your technicians the chance to add their ideas to marketing brainstorms, sales funnel conversations, new hire interviews, or other dialogues, now is the time to bring them in.</p>\n<p>When you tap into the brainpower of everyone on your team, including techies, you get an important perspective that can often be overlooked. Plus, you make all employees feel heard and valued. As a result, you may see a noticeable uptick in worker engagement, which studies show <a href=\"https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/major-benefits-employee-engagement/\">helps lower employee turnover</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Consider making remote work the norm.</b></h3>\n<p>You’ve always housed technicians on site. But could they realistically perform their duties just as well remotely? In the past four years, <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-work-statistics/\">statistics culled by FlexJobs</a> indicate that remote working opportunities have increased by 44 percent in the United States alone. Many analysts believe that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/what-coronavirus-means-for-the-future-of-work-from-home.html\">telecommuting may be the wave of the future</a>, especially after employers discovered how easily it could be done during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Allowing your technicians to work out of their home offices does more than just improve morale or provide flexibility. It also expands your job search reach. You can virtually roam the world looking for the most applicable fit for your technical job openings. That broadens your ability to find and onboard individuals you would otherwise have overlooked.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Support technology programs at schools and colleges.</b></h3>\n<p>Where are your future technology leaders? If they’re members of Generation Z, they’re in high school, college, or graduate school. Sure, you could wait until they graduate to approach them. On the other hand, why not make inroads with them today by turning your corporation into a visible and vocal advocate of technology and learning?</p>\n<p>From technology-related scholarships to summer internships, your company can brand itself as a tech-forward, tech-friendly organization. Ask your current tech employees what types of outreach they feel would be most appropriate. Then, get out and support young people as they work toward launching careers in technical fields. Be sure to talk about any outreach on your social media pages and blog for maximum publicity and positive messaging.</p>\n<h3><b>5. Set up mentoring opportunities for tech employees.</b></h3>\n<p>Many technical workers feel a desire to learn from others at the company, and maybe even branch out into non-linear career paths. Get to know each of your technology employees to find out what they’d like to focus on professionally so you can help them find the best mentors throughout the company.</p>\n<p>The more hands-on and personal relationships your tech employees have within the company, the higher loyalty should be across the board. And let’s face it: Loyal employees tend to stay rather than leave, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295860\">even when tempted by higher salaries</a>. In order to boost ties with technology whizzes, you have to give your time and commitment.</p>\n<p>Unless you’re satisfied with a watered-down technical team, not to mention constant employee churn, rethink your recruitment techniques. By tweaking your benefits, branding, and culture, you could turn your organization into one that appeals to some of the strongest tech prodigies poised to make their mark.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/29/5-benefits-attracting-tech-talent-to-your-startup/\">5 Benefits Attracting Tech Talent to Your Startup</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM.png","linkMd5":"285b805fb9eee82669d255a0703e8d3c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-20-284_6eb0618708f2b778.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM.png","destWidth":870,"destHeight":573,"sourceBytes":552546,"destBytes":28850,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.34.57-AM-300x198.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-18-498_5ae40ff70ad958cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877467},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:53","title":"Mattress Fit Airweave Mattress Advanced: Luxurious and Restful Sleep","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173870","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/07/mattress-fit-airweave-mattress-advance-luxurious-sleep/\" title=\"Mattress Fit Airweave Mattress Advanced: Luxurious and Restful Sleep\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airweave-Mattress-Advanced-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Airweave Mattress Advanced\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airweave-Mattress-Advanced-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airweave-Mattress-Advanced-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Airweave-Mattress-Advanced.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>In search of the best online mattress company, I recently tried one of the more luxurious, pricey online companies to see if their new Airweave Mattress Advanced had the right sleep stuff. Here&#8217;s my review.</p>\n<h2>Backed by Technology</h2>\n<p>The company offers a Web-based app to conduct body measurement analysis. The information serves as the basis for personalized mattress configurations that have been used in their new Airweave Mattress Advanced.</p>\n<h2>About the Mattress</h2>\n<p>Made in Japan, the Mattress Fit Airweave Mattress Advanced is one of the most luxurious among the online manufacturers.</p>\n<h2>Mattress Materials</h2>\n<p>The reason I focus on the materials here is that this mattress is unlike any other I&#8217;ve tried before. Usually, these mattresses have some type of springs or memory foam. This mattress has neither. Instead, it is entirely made of a kind of a resin fiber most often use to make fishing lines.</p>\n<p>The mattress is made mostly of polyester. The Airfiber® core is 100% polyethylene 100%. The outer cover and two soft layers are 100% polyester. Finally, the inner cover is 70% rayon and 30% glass fiber. Airfiber is the company&#8217;s proprietary technology and material. It uses an interwoven design that is intended to help with movement, weight distribution, and airflow for a more restful night of sleep.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>One of the things I like best besides the sleep quality is that I could test the mattress for 100 days and return it no questions asked if it didn&#8217;t work for me. Another good thing to note about this mattress is its lightweight modular design, which makes it easy to pick up and move. You can take the top off the mattress and throw it in the washing machine, which is something you can&#8217;t do with other mattresses.</p>\n<p>When you want to replace it, again, the modular design allows parts to replace, so you don&#8217;t have to throw away the whole thing, which means it costs less in the long run and is better for the environment.</p>\n<div class=\"property-text\">\n<p>Plus, the mattress comes in three boxes. It was so much easier to manage and unpack compared to other bed-in-the-box companies. Because it comes this way, I also didn&#8217;t have to wait for the mattress to decompress.</p>\n<p>The only con for me is that it is a bit too firm for my liking. However, those are personal impressions like the pros on this list. It&#8217;s definitely worth trying since they do the body analysis before your purchase.</p>\n<p>A con for others who use an adjustable base is that they will not be able to use that with this particular mattress.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<p>The pricing is somewhat affordable for such a luxurious mattress. The price is $2,000 for a twin; $2,200 for twin XL; $2,500 for a full; $2,700 for a queen; $3,100 for a king or California king. It comes with a ten-year limited warranty. The mattresses ship for free to all states except Hawaii. Returns are free as long as they are within 100 days, and the mattress has been used for at least thirty days.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy?</h2>\n<p>You can purchase the mattress through the <a href=\"https://www.airweave.com/products/new-mattress-advanced?variant=31373617791074\">company&#8217;s website</a>.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>There are so many mattress-in-the-box companies, and many offer a good product. After trying this luxurious mattress out, I would recommend the Airweave mattress for anyone who likes firm support, especially those who want to sleep on their stomach. Also, if you want a cool night&#8217;s sleep &#8211;this mattress helps regulate temperature for a non-sweaty night.</p>\n<p>I would also recommend this mattress to couples because of the motion transfer and edge support.

Here is the future of IoT devices and what it means for connectivity.</p>\n<p>Does edge connectivity mean we&#8217;ll outgrow <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/03/technology-trends-that-are-emerging-post-pandemic/\">Cloud-based connectivity</a> and that we are heading towards the era where edge computing takes central place? Good question.</p>\n<h2>When we say IoT, what do we mean?</h2>\n<p>When the Internet of Things term was first introduced around 20 years ago, it alluded to the Internet, which was a big thing back then.</p>\n<p>The concept of miniature sensors sending and receiving the data from the cloud over WiFi was huge and breathtaking. When talking about the Internet of Things today, we mean a remotely controllable ecosystem of devices connected to the cloud and to each other with some kind of connectivity.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, these devices must be able to perform some actions.</p>\n<p>In terms of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/26/iot-and-home-automation-is-it-the-future/\">smart homes</a>, we talk about smart speakers/voice assistants like Alexa or Google Echo, that can issue commands to switch on the lights, tune the conditioner or order a pizza at the nearest Domino or Pizza Hut.</p>\n<p>The connected-concept can be rigged up to smart systems controlling commercial real estate across a variety of scenarios. When talking about the Industry 5.0 factories and other industrial installations like wind farms, the IoT means an ecosystem of devices capable of communicating with each other and able to perform some actions based on the commands received.</p>\n<p>However, as the technology evolves, the meaning of the terms like IoT and connectivity broadens, and we must take into account this updated image of what connectivity is today — and what it will become in the future.</p>\n<h2>Why IoT is not enough anymore</h2>\n<p>The concept of IoT as an independent development entity centered at the gathering, sending, and receiving data has overstayed its welcome. In short, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hodfleishman/2020/01/07/its-2020-lets-stop-saying-iot/#357bb35c73dd\">the IoT, in its original meaning, is long dead</a>.</p>\n<p>Such systems must provide much more business value to be feasible nowadays. They must enable the users to analyze the data gathered and perform meaningful actions based on the results of this analysis.</p>\n<p>The focus of the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/06/25/no-just-connectivity-telecom-must-leverage-the-most-of-iot-to-deliver-value-based-services/\">IoT and connectivity</a> has shifted from the brilliance of myriads of sensors to the value of data they gather. The data, not the sensors, is king. There are surely more sophisticated sensors to come, but their main value is the data they can gather &#8212; and the actions we can perform based on this data.</p>\n<p>Of course, we only need a smart kettle to be simply switched on when we are close to home so that we can get a cup of tea or coffee faster.</p>\n<p>But an autonomous car must be able to react to the changes in the road situation around it, and a smart factory must be able to adjust complex working scenarios should something go awry.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the IoT alone as a concept of Digitally Connected Assets, or DCAs, is not viable. It cannot exist in a vacuum, as such systems must be able to process the data quickly and make use of it either through analytics or through issuing some commands.</p>\n<p>Performing the task in the cloud means too large latency &#8212; so we need something faster. &#8220;Faster&#8221; is where the edge computing concept comes into play.</p>\n<h2>Edge computing &#8212; the next stage of the IoT evolution</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/introducing-the-technologies-set-to-redefine-cloud-computing/\">edge computing term</a> refers to the concept of local computational nodes that form the hearts of the sensor networks in some locations. These sensor networks can be a server node on a factory or in an agricultural complex, an aforementioned Google or Amazon smart home system.</p>\n<p>The system can also be the smart utility control system for commercial real estate like malls or office buildings.</p>\n<p>In short, edge computing provides a Local Area Network connection for sensors, enabling lightning-fast data transmission. It is also <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/introducing-the-technologies-set-to-redefine-cloud-computing/\">connected to the cloud</a> to enable centralized data gathering and analysis, storage of historical data, and training of AI/ML models on this data.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, edge computing nodes provide sufficient computing capacity to host Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning algorithms locally, which allows these models to issue the needed commands based on the data received from the sensors.</p>\n<p>Let’s imagine the fully-automated Industry 5.0 factory equipped by various sensors (movement, temperature, humidity, etc.), a fleet of robots, and multiple actuators.</p>\n<p>The robots perform the production operations <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/03/17/efforts-disaster-prediction-take-step-iot-sensors/\">while the sensors monitor the situation</a> &#8212; and one sensor signals the drastic overheating in one of the conveyor belt engines.</p>\n<p>The local edge computing node receives the signal, and the AI/ML algorithm running it enacts one of the response scenarios. The scenario can shut down the engine, apply the coolant if possible, disconnect the engine from the conveyor belt (if there are backup engines &#8211; start them).</p>\n<p>To minimize the production disruption — or reroute the flow of production to other conveyors. All of the functions are done within milliseconds, preventing fire and saving the manufacturer millions in potential damage.</p>\n<h2>To make operations possible, the edge computing nodes must have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/06/15/critical-capabilities-for-edge-computing-in-industrial-iot-scenarios/#30fc3b096df9\">three key abilities</a>:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To control the processes in the physical world. Edge computing nodes must be able to gather the data, process it, and enact some response actions.</li>\n<li>To work offline. Deep underground mines or sea installations far from the shore can have issues communicating to the cloud, so their systems must be able to operate autonomously.</li>\n<li>Zero-second response time. With automated production or utility operations, a delay in several seconds can results in huge financial losses, so the response scenarios must be enacted and executed immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The future of IoT: cyber-physical, contextual and autonomous objects</h2>\n<p>As we can see, the meaning and the value of the IoT have shifted from the ecosystem of interconnected devices for gathering data to the ecosystem of devices able to gather the data, process it, and act based on this data. Therefore, we can define three main categories of existing and future IoT devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Cyber-physical objects.</h4>\n<p>The sensors that collect physical signals and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/02/how-can-ai-and-ml-transform-the-way-we-read-and-understand-data/\">transform them into digital data</a>. Think of smart wearables that track our vitals, digital printers, many machine-to-machine and telematic equipment, various smart home systems like thermostats, etc.</p>\n<p>All the consumer devices that can perform only a single function like switching the light on/off or rolling the blinds up/down also belong to this group.</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Contextual objects.</h4>\n<p>Simple cyber-physical DCAs just provide the data or execute single commands, but more complex systems allow understanding the context in which these sensors and actuators operate and make better decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example, let’s imagine an agricultural complex, where DCAs control the irrigation systems or the location and operations of a fleet of automated machines.</p>\n<p>By supplementing this with an edge computing node, the farmer can consolidate this data to a single dashboard and augment it with weather forecasts and other crucial information, which will help get much more value of the data and control all the systems effortlessly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomous objects: the highest level of the “gather-process-react” chain, these systems combine the sensor networks, edge computing nodes, and the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/24/how-ai-at-the-edge-other-iot-trends-are-transforming-every-industry/\">AI/ML algorithms</a> to form autonomous objects that take the responsibility from humans to machines. An example is the factory incident we mentioned earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summing up: call it as you wish &#8212; connectivity will not die</h2>\n<p>We must operate in the real world and use the tools available to us. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/02/demystifying-8-core-myths-that-surround-the-internet-of-things/\">Basic gateway devices</a> provide ample capacities for data gathering, storing, and processing within an edge computing node.</p>\n<p>These nodes enable the ML model in it to take action. Nevertheless, they cannot provide sufficient computing resources for training a model like this, as it requires processing mounds of historical data over hundreds of computational cycles, which can be done only in cloud data centers.</p>\n<p>Connectivity is still crucial for connecting edge computing nodes to the cloud, gathering statistical data, training new AI algorithms, and updating the existing ones. It is an integrated ecosystem, where every component plays its role.</p>\n<h2>What are we going to call this new and exciting ecosystem?</h2>\n<p>IoT 2.0? Cyber-physical edge computing-enabled objects? The terms itself matters little, while we understand what stands behind it. These objects will have the ability to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/13/top-25-podcasts-designed-to-make-you-think-and-grow/\">connect the physical and digital worlds</a>, gather the data with sensors, process it in context with other input, and take actions based on this analysis.</p>\n<p>While this ecosystem works and is feasible, it matters little what we call it.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, connectivity is still crucial for <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/28/introducing-the-technologies-set-to-redefine-cloud-computing/\">connecting edge computing</a> nodes to the cloud, so connectivity will never die.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the future of IoT and the importance of connectivity?

IIoT is sometimes referred to as Industry 4.0, though the latter primarily focuses on the manufacturing sector, using upgraded technologies to reduce waste and increase value in this field. Here are the IIoT trends and challenges to watch.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">IIoT encompasses all areas in which industrial equipment is used.<br />\n</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/how-iot-reshapes-industry-4-0-and-the-effects-of-iot-on-smes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Industry 4.0</a>, IIoT will revolutionize processes through connected machines that can optimize productivity and revenue. IIoT can be seen in a variety of industries, from transportation to public safety and from energy to, of course, manufacturing. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are new trends in this space and we need to see why challenges leaders are trying to manage these trends.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Solving for the Influx of data from disparate systems</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More and more data is coming in for anyone using IoT, but this is especially true in the world of IIoT. Operators have become overwhelmed by the massive amount of data, making it difficult to harness its power for decision-making. One reason why it&#8217;s so difficult to make sense of the data is that it comes from so many disparate systems.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Angie Sticher, COO/CPO of UrsaLeo</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, the only company to offer photorealistic 3D digital twins combined with live sensor data, asset data, maintenance data, notes, &#8220;the varying types of data streams from different systems that don&#8217;t connect to one another and can&#8217;t give a realistic view of what&#8217;s happening in a given environment. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To help manage the deluge of data, technology is being deployed and creating a workflow that moves between these systems giving employees and managers the tools to triage issues quickly and get to problem-solving.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ultimately this also helps in getting to the resolution phase of an incident more quickly.&#8221;</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Manufacturing Success in IIoT</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Though current trends do not indicate an uptick in US manufacturing, some in the IIoT industry think this may change. <em><strong>Joy Weiss, President, and CEO of </strong></em></span><em><strong>Tempo Automation</strong></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a smart factory startup for printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), has seen this trend come to light. &#8220;We have seen a growing trend among companies preferring to switch to US-based manufacturing partners. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Using these partners instead of contracting overseas for a number of reasons, including the recent global health crisis due to Coronavirus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some of these advantages include geographic proximity, added IP and security certifications and standards, as well as the use of US-sourced, authentic components, and parts.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Christine Kyle-Remmert, CEO and Founder of LoneStarTracking</strong></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a company that provides telematics solutions that include the latest Cat-M1 cellular technology and cellular-free LoRaWan deployments across North America, explains that power consumption, transmission distance, and price are three factors that play a role in the successful deployment of this technology.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;As technology progresses, sensors are getting smaller, more lightweight, and more affordable. However, no one has time to run around and replace batteries. Just a couple years ago, IoT sensors would only last 1-2 years; however, today, we are deploying sensors that can last 10+ years on a single coin cell battery,&#8221; Kyle-Remmert explains. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;Using technology like LoRaWAN, IoT sensors can now communicate 10+km and even further, with very little power. If you can develop a sensor that is a low cost, then there is nothing restricting you from deploying more sensors to get denser coverage.&#8221;</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Skills Gap in the World of IIoT</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like many new technologies, a skills gap permeates through this industry. <em><strong>Ekaterina Lyapina, Solutions Architect and AI and IIoT Consultant at </strong></em></span><em><strong>Zyfra</strong></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a company that develops industrial digitalization technologies for machinery, metallurgy, mining, and oil and gas notes, &#8220;The qualifications needed to install new smart robots in production lines are often not available in most companies. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Facilities and factories lack free time and robot technicians to update their ongoing production. This leads them to a fall behind AI and IIoT trends, as they are not capable of using the latest robotics technology. They are missing skills in integration, implementation, and debugging artificial intelligence enhanced systems. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, the hindering factor in AI automation is workers&#8217; qualifications at the foremost front. Especially the training and customization of neural networks require deep specialists&#8217; knowledge to dig the treasures of AI.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sticher offers a potential solution to this skills gap, noting, &#8220;virtualization is driving cost reduction for training in a number of sectors. Digital Twins and 3D Models make it easier to train staff because they mirror real-world environments and shorten the learning curve. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coupled with combining and scaling data from many systems, digital twins also offer a realistic and readily accessible information hub to an environment&#8217;s current status.&#8221;</span></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Especially with the new order of the world, due to new restrictions and regulations brought on by Covid-19, it will be interesting to see where IIoT stands at the end of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While innovation in this industry continues, companies are grappling with the changes and safety precautions that need more immediate attention.</span></p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Pexels</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/iiot-trends-and-challenges-to-watch/\">IIoT Trends and Challenges to Watch</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 21:00:49 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IIoT-Trends-and-Challenges-to-Watch.jpg","linkMd5":"f8be7438210797f10650c0dbe1e81f27","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-18-905_a6c2e90b2b03fe58.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IIoT-Trends-and-Challenges-to-Watch.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":54721,"destBytes":47080,"author":"Nora Leary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IIoT-Trends-and-Challenges-to-Watch-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-16-432_55d58e4c1fbe8fd6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874872},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:07","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:07","title":"Bevy.com raises $15M Series B from Accel for Virtual Event Community Platform","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171577","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/19/bevy-com-raises-15m-series-b-from-accel-for-virtual-event-community-platform/\" title=\"Bevy.com raises $15M Series B from Accel for Virtual Event Community Platform\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"62\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-300x62.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Bevy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-300x62.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-900x186.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-260x54.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-1536x317.png 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Bevy.com                                                                               <strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: </strong> <strong>5/19/2020</strong>    Palo Alto, CA</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><strong>BEVY.COM RAISES $15M SERIES B FROM ACCEL FOR VIRTUAL EVENT COMMUNITY PLATFORM</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171603 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-900x502.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-900x502.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-300x167.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-260x145.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-1536x856.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Palo Alto, California, May 19, 2020</em>. &#8211;In February 2020, Startup Grind’s global in-person community hosted just one virtual event hosted by the Beijing China chapter and broadcast across 30 other Chapters in mainland China.

Ryan Smith and Accel’s Ryan Sweeney have joined Bevy’s Board of Directors as part of the funding.</p>\n<p>“It’s been incredible to see how quickly communities adjusted to the virtual explosion we’ve all experienced,” said Derek Andersen, co-founder, and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.bevy.com\">Bevy.com</a>. “Communities that were once focused on in-person events are now only weeks later exploding in a virtual format at an unprecedented scale.”</p>\n<p>Bevy also announced today it released a new end to end virtual product that allows organizers to build, create, and run a virtual event registration and experience all contained in the product. &#8220;Having an end-to-end solution,&#8221; Andersen said, &#8220;allows enterprises to give its community a full experience from inside the browser while still owning the data and maintaining a high level of security.&#8221; The product also supports any other video solution and has a deep integration with Zoom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171606 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-900x502.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-900x502.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-300x167.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-260x145.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-1536x856.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;From our experience as early investors in companies that defined the future of work like Atlassian, Slack, and Dropbox, we believe that the team behind Bevy has created a platform that is unmatched in building and growing virtual communities and events at scale,&#8221; said Ryan Sweeney, partner at Accel.</p>\n<p>In the past six weeks, Salesforce’s <a href=\"https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/\">Trailblazer community</a> hosted 650 virtual events for more than 20,000 people. Duolingo hosted 1,000 over the same period. These virtual events are hosted and led by customers in what is called Customer to Customer (C2C) marketing. Marketers have long tried to harness and unlock word of mouth marketing. “But before Bevy,” Andersen said, “Creating word of mouth in repeatable and scalable ways has always been very expensive, and sometimes impossible. C2C community marketing can generate millions of customer conversations, and is the cheapest and highest quality marketing you can do to build your sales pipeline or increase retention.”</p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://stateofstartups2019.firstround.com/#10-community-moat\">First Round Capital study</a> showed that 80% of founders said building a community is important, and 28% said it was their moat and critical to their success. With Covid-19 forcing people to quarantine around the world, Bevy says they have experienced explosive demand for their virtual event community product.</p>\n<p>“In less than three years, Bevy has built a roster of customers that would take most other enterprise SaaS companies 10+ years to develop.” Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith said. “Bevy lets companies host a user conference all year long in cities around the world. Building a virtual community with Bevy is the future of field marketing.”</p>\n<p>The new funding is being used to double the <a href=\"https://bevy.com/about/\">distributed company’s team</a> and invest in building and educating the industry via the <a href=\"http://cmxhub.com\">CMX</a> community it acquired in 2019.</p>\n<p>Bevy also recently launched <a href=\"https://bevy.com/bevy4good\">Bevy4Good</a> giving access to Bevy’s platform, at no cost, to health care workers and organizations fighting Covid-19. Recently they publicly shared a program called #give100 where team members were encouraged to give $100 to a friend affected by Covid-19. The only conditions were that it needed to help a friend and they needed to share it publically to encourage more people to give. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DerekjAndersen/status/1253090492553674752?s=20\">The tweets</a> generated over 100,000 impressions and dozens of stories of more people being helped in the same way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171609 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1.png\" alt=\"Derek Andersen\" width=\"900\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1-300x127.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1-260x110.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>“Bevy’s team understands how fortunate we are to have jobs in a growing and thriving industry, and in that position, we have a responsibility to help others,” Andersen said. “Bevy helps bring purpose to over 7 million people through building community. Doing good is uniquely tied to our core mission. As Bevy grows, I hope our capacity to do good outside the company outpaces the growth we see inside. Helping others is what community building is all about, and we hope to do as much good as possible in the years to come.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/19/bevy-com-raises-15m-series-b-from-accel-for-virtual-event-community-platform/\">Bevy.com raises $15M Series B from Accel for Virtual Event Community Platform</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 May 2020 14:00:58 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed.png","linkMd5":"88d44e35500635244daddd2d456a1e6d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-948_fa2bf4436c60842f.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed.png","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":330,"sourceBytes":38932,"destBytes":10734,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed-300x62.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-18-486_3662e41b5bf39aea.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed2-900x502.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-09-619_ba9eed5cb4b6c957.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed3-900x502.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-10-527_7870f895103c3bc2.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/unnamed4-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-21-931_0188a4aca8ad33c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195887484},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"How to Build Your Community with Live Video","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171214","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/08/how-to-build-your-community-with-live-video/\" title=\"How to Build Your Community with Live Video\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video-300x279.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"live video\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video-300x279.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video-172x160.png 172w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video.png 665w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Members of a community share a set of views. They think the same way about at least one thing, whether that’s politics, a football team, a cause, or a favorite choice of toothpaste. A community has at least one thought, issue, feeling, concern, or a goal in common.</p>\n<p>But having and maintaining only one thing is a pretty weak link to bond members of a community together. Communities are stronger when they share not just views but experiences. People who share a political view come together at rallies. Football fans bond when they cheer on their team together. Campaigners make friends at demonstrations and marches. The shared <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/09/19/increasing-customer-engagement-five-tactics-to-use/\">bonding experiences</a> are the types of connection we want to encourage in ourselves and others.</p>\n<h2>For online communities, the issues are deeper and harder to understand and identify.</h2>\n<p>Online, the community members take part in group activities alone. They read and comment on posts in their own time and in isolation. The individuals don’t get to meet, let alone interact with other community members to share an experience.</p>\n<h3>Live video has changed the online experience.</h3>\n<p>Now available on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a host of other platforms is live video that ensures members of a community can share the same experience at the same time.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;group and fan-base&#8221; might be sitting in different places, but they’re all looking at the same event simultaneously. The viewers can even interact with the broadcaster and with each other. It’s the closest that an online community comes to sharing a common experience.</p>\n<p>There are lots of different ways for communities to make use of these live videos, but three options stand out the best.</p>\n<h4><strong>Interview an Expert</strong></h4>\n<p>One great connection is a live interview with an expert. Your live interview is like running a talk show &#8212; and there are even <a href=\"http://be.live\">tools</a> that allow you to interview someone in a different location. The organizer of a community for people who like Harry Potter, for example, could interview the author of popular Harry Potter fanfiction. As audience members watch, they can use the comment stream to ask questions and talk to each other.</p>\n<p>The chat shows up on the right side of the live streaming &#8212; everyone sees it and can make comments. The live stream then becomes more than an interview. Right there in real-time, the interview turns into a live discussion that’s closer to a book reading than a television show. Because the interview with an expert is interactive &#8212; it&#8217;s even more valued as a personal shared experience.</p>\n<h4><strong>Instructional Videos</strong></h4>\n<p>Interviews require a little preparation. You have to find someone willing to talk and answer questions and arrange a time that suits you, them, and your audience. Finding a bookable timeframe is not a big challenge, but it will require collaboration. Hop on a good Calendar site and coordinate with everyone for a higher participation rate.</p>\n<p>Live instructional videos don’t require the co-operation of others, though they will demand some thought. You’ll need to plan what you’re going to show, and have the ability to walk people through the steps of what you are saying without getting confused or losing your place.</p>\n<p>The result, though, will be the sharing of information with people who value that information. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/TriangleNurseryUK/videos/\">Triangle Nursery</a>, for example, is a flower and event business in the UK. The company broadcasts regular live videos that show people, keen on flower arrangements, how to make cool bouquets.</p>\n<p>You can see from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TriangleNurseryUK/videos/vl.813003639063896/680884795662686/?type=1\">comments</a> in the videos how well the comments are received, and how classy the interviewers respond. The vid shows how to conduct a great forum for live interaction. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/NationalQuiltersCircle/videos\">National Quilters Circle</a> does something similar, bringing together hobbyists to learn and interact with each online.</p>\n<h4><strong>Live Events</strong></h4>\n<p>The third kind of live video is probably the most popular. One of the most common broadcasts on Facebook Live comes from churches that use the feature to bring congregations to their places of worship.</p>\n<p>But a church certainly isn&#8217;t the only event that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/14/in-the-age-of-tech-community-matters-more-than-ever/\">community organizers</a> can use to cement relationships between members of an online community. Even industry events, such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NewBedfordGuide/videos/1283280185161527/\">car shows</a>, can use live broadcasts to show people who can’t attend what they’re missing and let them communicate with the people who are there.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen significant use of live vid for business teammate connections. There have been some great book groups on Facebook and elsewhere for individuals with all kinds of differing tastes from Business and Self-Help to Sci-Fi. Find one that fits what you are looking for. At this time of the COVID-19 issues &#8212; many teachers and schools are using this same live-stream format or instructional videos to stay in touch with their students.</p>\n<p>Firms as big as Apple have been live-streaming their events for years but live video takes that reach even further by enabling interaction. The organizer of an art fair, for example, can alert members of an art community that they’ll be broadcasting from the event live.</p>\n<p>During the show, the organizers can walk the booths and interview the exhibitors. Inviting viewers to ask questions as they watch the walk-through is the icing on the cake. Exhibitors themselves could broadcast their own videos.</p>\n<p>Art Sherpa, who <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/craft-teams-can-ensure-your-people-keep-the-skill-sets-sharp/\">teaches acrylic painting</a>, teamed up with Pix Brix at the New York Toy Fair to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheArtSherpa/videos/612020732968513/\">talk about the company’s new construction toys</a>. You can see how the live audience interaction adds a new degree of depth to what would otherwise be a typical marketing pitch.</p>\n<p>Online communities have always had weaker bonds than real-life communities. Live video has helped to make those bonds much stronger.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/08/how-to-build-your-community-with-live-video/\">How to Build Your Community with Live Video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 08 May 2020 21:00:04 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video-300x279.png","linkMd5":"b1edb68edf06589be4f021ccf6a6b4fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn18@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-844_0085f5b66ec44d06.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":279,"sourceBytes":129359,"destBytes":11182,"author":"Joel Comm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Build-Your-Community-with-Live-Video-300x279.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn18@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-07-844_0085f5b66ec44d06.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877014},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"6 Skills You Need to Become a Data Analyst","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=170489","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/10/6-skills-you-need-to-become-a-data-analyst/\" title=\"6 Skills You Need to Become a Data Analyst\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"become data analyst\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst-900x601.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-Skills-You-Need-to-Become-a-Data-Analyst.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Data analyst is the process in which the judgment, refining, changing, and modeling data takes place with the aim of making a better conclusion.

Analytical skills help in viewing a challenge or situation from different perspectives. It is one of the most important and efficient parts of the skill you need to become a data analyst.</p>\n<p><strong>3. TECHNICAL SKILLS </strong></p>\n<p>Good computer and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/04/26/the-problem-with-believing-coding-is-no-longer-important/\">technical skills are very important</a>. The main knowledge of statistics is quite helpful as well as producing languages like python or Mat Lab, and analytical languages like R and SAS are very favorable to know as a data analyst.</p>\n<p>The more language you know, the faster and better for you to get your dream job. Examples of technical skills you need to know are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming languages.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common operating systems.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software proficiency.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technical writing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. DETAILS SKILLS<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Data analyst is all about details, It helps a data analyst to be able to find and see any basic unseen errors and links, that is especially important at the point of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/best-business-intelligence-software-and-business-operating-system-options-for-2020/\">solving problems and making decisions</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-170494\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/data-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/data-3-1.jpg 400w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/data-3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/data-3-1-240x160.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<h4><b>5. BUSINESS SKILLS<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p>Aside from the technical skills, there are some business skills that one should acquire to function as a Data analyst. Some of which are:</p>\n<p><b>Communication Skills:</b></p>\n<p>As a data analyst, you are expected to work with different sets of people in your team which makes your communication a really important part of your job. Working well together as a team for the benefit of your organization is also one of your main responsibilities and skill.</p>\n<p>You should be able to communicate effectively with the teammates to prepare, present, and explain data. Communication is key in collaborating with your colleagues. For example, in a kickoff meeting with business stakeholders, careful listening skills are needed to understand the analyses they require.</p>\n<p>Similarly, during your project, you may need to be able to explain a complex topic to non-technical teammates.</p>\n<p><b>Time Management and Organizational Skills:</b></p>\n<p>As it is expected of you to work with different people in your team. You should be able to manage your time including your responsibilities, as well as meet your deadlines.</p>\n<p><b> Decision-making and Problem-solving:</b></p>\n<p>These skills are the bottom line of data analysis. The main job of a data analyst is to give the right information for decision-making and problem-solving process. Which is why it occurs to be a perfect skill required to be a data analyst.</p>\n<p>You might need to research a quirk of some software or coding language that you&#8217;re using. Your company might have resource constraints that force you to be innovative in how you approach a problem.</p>\n<p>The data you&#8217;re using might be incomplete. Or you might need to perform some “good enough” analysis to meet a looming deadline.</p>\n<h4><b>6. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE</b></h4>\n<p>Domain knowledge is understanding things that are specific to the particular industry and company that you work for. For example, if you&#8217;re working for a company with an online store, you might need to understand the nuances of e-commerce. In contrast, if you&#8217;re analyzing data about mechanical systems, you might need to understand those systems and how they work.</p>\n<p>Domain knowledge changes from industry to industry, so you may find yourself needing to research and learn quickly.

Recently, I reviewed the Gozney Roccbox, which did a great job. However, it was during the research that I discovered another popular gas-powered portable pizza oven from Ooni Koda.</p>\n<p>Since we are a pizza-loving family and are somewhat limited to going out and picking up one of our favorite restaurant pies, I grabbed the <a href=\"https://ooni.com/products/ooni-koda\">Ooni Koda pizza oven</a> to do a comparison. Here&#8217;s what I found out.</p>\n<h2>About the Ooni Koda Pizza Oven</h2>\n<p>The Ooni Koda delivers pizzas in a minute. There is no assembly required straight from the box. The gas-tank can also cook other things like fish, meat, and vegetables.</p>\n<p><span id=\"mntl-external-component_1-0\" class=\"comp mntl-external-component\">It&#8217;s important to note that the Ooni Koda is not compatible with natural gas. The oven works with a large propane tank &#8212; (the kind you use with your BBQ grill). This oven also works with the one-pound propane tanks you can grab at a convenience store &#8212; but you will need to have an adapter. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"mntl-external-component_1-0\" class=\"comp mntl-external-component\">Ooni’s designs are unique &#8212; the Koda resembles a cool looking drone or small flying saucer, so it&#8217;s got the awe-factor working for it.  I particularly like the matte black powder-coated steel shell with silver trim (classy) as well as the aerodynamic feel.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_173826\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-173826\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-173826\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Ooni Koda Pizza Oven\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview-900x601.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-173826\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>Ooni Koda Pizza Oven</strong></em></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Different?</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest differences compared to the Gozney Roccbox is that the Ooni Koda has a much lower price &#8212; nearly $150 less. However, the Roccbox does come with a couple of unique pizza tools.</p>\n<p>Another difference is the weight and portability. The Ooni Koda is much easier to carry around, lift, and work with, as it only weighs 20 pounds.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p><span class=\"comp mntl-external-component\"><span class=\"commerce-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading\">There are many pros about the Ooni Koda pizza oven. The oven heats up so quickly to its top cooking temperature of </span></span> 932 degrees and cooks your pizza in only 60 seconds. Another positive is that there is nothing that needs to be assembled &#8212; it looks great and is highly portable &#8212; right now!</p>\n<p>However, the cooking part was a bit tricky and took some time to master, especially at such high heat. It was also a little difficult to rotate the pizza to cook evenly.</p>\n<p>After a few tries, the pizzas came out just like we wanted. I tried cooking other items in the oven, too &#8212; like steak and corn. Again &#8212; it took a few attempts but it worked well after that. I realized that the ability to cook a variety of menus and the portability &#8212; made this ideal for taking on camping trips. A big help was adding their infrared thermometer for $20.</p>\n<p>The Ooni Koda didn&#8217;t have a protective silicon cover like the Gozney, which made me feel more comfortable having the kids near it. Also, the appliance is not fully weatherproof so it&#8217;s important to remember to bring the oven indoors to clean and store when not in use.</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>The Ooni Koda gas-powered pizza oven also comes with a stone baking board, manual, Ooni Essentials Guide with tips and recipes, and propane tank gas regulator and hose. There is also a three-year warranty.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173827\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-719x719.jpg 719w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-160x160.jpg 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Where to Buy</h2>\n<p>The pizza oven is available from the Ooni Koda website along with its other pizza oven models for $329 along with free delivery. Williams-Sonoma also has this model in their stores and on its website.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Although the Ooni Koda portable pizza oven is still not the lowest-priced portable pizza oven, it is still a good value and more in the targeted price point range for a special cooking appliance.</p>\n<p>If I had tried this oven first &#8212; I would have chosen The Ooni Koda over the Gozney Roccbox. The Ooni Koda is so much more lightweight and easy to take with us whether that is to the backyard, park, campsite, or beach.</p>\n<p>However, I did purchase the pizza peel, thermometer, and a cover as beneficial accessories to have &#8212; which then pushed the price up closer to the Gozney.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/02/ooni-koda-pizza-oven-restaurant-quality-pizza-at-home/\">Ooni Koda Pizza Oven: Restaurant-Quality Pizza at Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 23:48:53 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOven.jpg","linkMd5":"f66e8fd921498e3e40596ab9d663bd57","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-25-732_df5904c309a95a63.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOven.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1281,"sourceBytes":188349,"destBytes":134618,"author":"Deanna Ritchie","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOven-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-16-842_e2fc18242ca89b7d.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPizzaOvenReview-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-10-954_74505e85fdb91982.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OoniKodaPortablePIzzaOven-300x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-12-308_ecf2c7a1bcfddf4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874282},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"Microsoft Aims to Kill Chrome Using Chromium with its New Edge Browser","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168177","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/microsoft-aims-to-kill-chrome-using-chromium-with-its-new-edge-browser/\" title=\"Microsoft Aims to Kill Chrome Using Chromium with its New Edge Browser\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"microsoft edge\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p class=\"graf graf--p\">Microsoft released its new Chromium-based browser earlier this year, but what does this new browser mean for the general users and should they give it a try? <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/29/evaluating-popular-web-browsers-in-terms-of-security-and-privacy/\">Yes</a>, if you spend a good amount of time browsing the Internet and if you’re a little concerned about your privacy.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A web browser amongst others is your gateway to the Internet and thus it knows a lot about you and your habits. Every bit of information you exchange on the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/04/25/forget-searching-for-content-soon-content-will-be-searching-for-you/\">Internet parses through the web browser</a>. Having a certain degree of control and transparency over your browsing data and its usage must be appreciated.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The new Edge browser provides you with a simple to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/06/how-iot-monitoring-is-going-to-change-how-we-think-about-privacy-and-security/\">find 3 level privacy management tab</a>: Basic, Balanced and Strict to choose from, depending on how comfortable you are with marketers being able to target you with ads. Unsurprisingly, it is much more difficult to get to this setting tab on Chrome.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It is much easier for tracking companies to access your information and make money off it if you’re a Chrome user. Even Firefox provides anti-tracking features but Chrome doesn’t.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">With the new Chromium-based Edge browser, Microsoft attempts to revive itself in a space it has been losing for almost a decade. With all the new features and advantages over Chrome, it still faces an uphill battle of winning back its long lost users.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\">\n<p><figure style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xdge0qiSgpyhqg4KSn0H3A.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"441\" data-image-id=\"1*xdge0qiSgpyhqg4KSn0H3A.png\" data-width=\"1685\" data-height=\"929\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Microsoft edge.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">We should not forget that Google is an Ad company. It invests substantially to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/11/16/how-to-build-an-api-amazon-lambda/\">build and maintain a browser</a> which is the most widely used on the planet. But since it relies on your data for revenue, it almost does next to nothing to prevent tracking of your data even by third parties.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Chrome is and has been <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\">the undisputed king</a> in the browser space with a solid engineering team behind the wheels and a loyal user base.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">But The Chrome Experience</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">67 percent of all computer-based browsing is done on Chrome as of January 2020. Google leverages this overwhelming lead to its advantage by selling your data while providing you with free personalized apps and services that use this data extensively.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">More than 40 percent of people who buy a Windows machine download Chrome using Internet Explorer as their first major activity on their machine. One of the biggest and less talked about the reason why people switch to Chrome is that they have become used to the look and feel of it and reject anything that feels even scantily different. Kudos to the engineering team at Chrome to manage such patronage.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This is probably why the previous feature-rich Edge with Microsoft’s edge HTML rendering engine failed miserably. It could also be attributed to Chrome beating Firefox substantially with the later having only 4.7 percent market share globally.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With the new Edge, Microsoft acknowledges its boo-boo and looks to get back in the browser space albeit some obscurity.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Living on the Edge</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Since the new Edge is based on Google’s Chromium engine, you get the Chrome browsing experience annulling a major reason for losing users.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In testing, the rendering time of Edge is found to be faster than Chrome. The RAM consumption of Edge is found to be less than 14 percent of that of Chrome which could be a major respite for a lot of users as Chrome is known for eating up RAM.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With the seemingly <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/04/30/microsoft-edge-annotation-awesome/\">right steps</a> taken by Microsoft using its engineering prowess, it has to win back the users it has lost since the inception of Chromium. The new Edge browser has to outdo Chrome consistently in the time to come and create an ardent user base like it has done recently in a very short time with Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/04/is-the-iot-market-maturing-microsoft-report-and-partners-share-new-trends-opportunities/\">Microsoft uses Windows</a> which accounts for almost 80% of the operating system market to prompt users to switch to Edge. It has done this previously with aggression at times but has come to no avail.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Interesting times ahead</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">By moving to Chromium, Microsoft interestingly <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/25/how-to-create-top-performing-content-on-google-according-to-science/\">plays it in the hands of Google</a>, the owner of the Chromium repository, and hence decides the engineering direction the project takes. It might surprise a few but Microsoft is already invested in Chromium with Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Teams which are based on Electron, a Chromium-based framework.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">While Microsoft would again use Windows alongside other marketing strategies to push its baby in the hands of users, Google has the stewardship on the engineering decisions and a throng of lawyers to monitor any wrong practice by MSFT.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It would be <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2016/04/26/iot-edge-delivery-dl2/\">interesting</a> to see Microsoft market Edge and leverage it for its consumer products while Google tackles this push offering a successful but virtually identical product.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/23/microsoft-aims-to-kill-chrome-using-chromium-with-its-new-edge-browser/\">Microsoft Aims to Kill Chrome Using Chromium with its New Edge Browser</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 15:00:03 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium.png","linkMd5":"5332d53f8e776c722ee4e5dd6f3d4871","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-25-794_865f62385cd70e32.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":212003,"destBytes":11242,"author":"Faisal Khan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Microsoft-Aims-to-Kill-Chrome-Using-Chromium-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-20-339_4bb97f6d93ea2720.webp","https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xdge0qiSgpyhqg4KSn0H3A.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-23-723_124f3d298cfd7c86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878214},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:58","title":"The Pros and Cons of Founding a Startup During a Recession","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=169266","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/01/recession-startup/\" title=\"The Pros and Cons of Founding a Startup During a Recession\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-300x200.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-900x600.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>With the economy in an inevitable tailspin toward the first recession in over a decade, there remains ample click bait apocalyptic article titles touting the economy&#8217;s inevitable downfall. The most alarming recent data is the millions that filed for unemployment in a single week&#8211;the largest such black swan event in the history of the country. Further still are the discussions that we may eventually be stuck&#8211;similar to the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;in a recovery that excludes jobs as we emerge from this cluster.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-169268 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jobless-recovery.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"281\" /></p>\n<p>Touting numbers from the last recession, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/after-the-recession-beware-the-jobless-recovery-202600519.html\">some have opined</a> we are headed into similar waters this time. Alarming indeed.</p>\n<p>If there is a silver lining to all of this, it is that such events are often breeding grounds for innovation, pivots, startups and the birth of new companies. Truly, necessity is the mother of [fill in the blank] in situations like these. <a href=\"https://www.strategy-business.com/article/re00240?gko=c9bcf\">Such was the case during the Great Recession</a>, when startups emerged to fill the employment vacuum.</p>\n<p>But, as any founding entrepreneur will tell you, starting a business in a good economy is tough enough. Starting one on the heels of a major market dip can be more than difficult.

Sometimes the dip can be a catalyst for the next big thing.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Founding a Company During a Recession</h2>\n<p>With millions of displaced workers struggling without a paycheck and unemployment benefits drying up, entrepreneurs often emerge to complete tasks as contractors during periods of economic uncertainty. It is true that larger firms tend to lay-off and/or furlough full-time W2 employees during times of uncertainty, but they also need work done. Large layoffs are typically used as a preservation mechanism for large companies wanting to shield themselves from ultimate demise, but that does not mean the work has dried-up.</p>\n<p>On the contrary. Massive layoffs often create a void in critical task completions internally that still need completed without the workers to engage. In such circumstances, many new or former employees have turned to 1099 contract relationships with new or former employers to complete such projects.</p>\n<p>Such a relationship has a benefit to both the contract laborer and the employer. The employer can rely on the contractor to complete operational tasks that are still critical to the company&#8217;s survival, but do so without the hassle, chains and liability of a full-time W2 staff. It&#8217;s this very &#8220;gig&#8221; type model that made the likes of Upwork and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2015/10/06/uber-employee-contractors-startups/\">Uber so successful</a>. It also de-risked their operational expenses by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/17/the-diminishing-returns-of-outsourcing-and-the-fallacy-of-automation/\">moving employers to contractors</a>, making the relationship much more flexible. Employers prefer such relationships as they can turn them on and off as-needed without the requirement of a long-term commitment to a salary.</p>\n<p>Founders can often use this to their advantage by slipping back in to former organizations in which they were a part and charging more per hour for tasks they are already comfortable performing, while still looking for other similar gigs and opportunities elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Recessions also fuel opportunity. Where there is pain, there are opportunities for a fix. New startups can quickly arrive to fix real or perceived issues in the economy. Recessions can often change shopping behaviors. In today&#8217;s environment, we&#8217;re not more dependent on Amazon than ever before, shifting us further away from brick-and-mortar reliance.</p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s environment companies, including healthcare related entities, are profiting from medical supplies, remote patient monitoring and similar businesses that immediately service the current crisis. Such businesses will likely emerge as leaders that will help prepare for the &#8220;next big issue&#8221; due to their flash-in-the-pan revenues and quick notoriety.</p>\n<p>In addition, frugal corporate and personal trends in the last recession, fueled the the founding of both Groupon and Uber. Groupon offered regular discounts to commodity-type products and services, driving foot traffic to local businesses while still saving consumers money. Similarly, Uber offered greater efficiency in transportation at a lower cost, while still benefiting its own bottom-line by avoiding a W2 workforce.</p>\n<p>When it comes to founding a startup during a recession, finding and fixing a pain&#8211;including the immediate consumer and corporate pains of cost-savings&#8211;can be perhaps the biggest boon for successfully navigating the difficult waters of a recession-era entrepreneurship.</p>\n<h2>Downsides of Recession-Era Startups</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest downside risk of founding a business during a downturn is the fact that the very budgets a founding entrepreneur may be seeking to tap, simply no longer exist. This lack of budget due to the tightening of the proverbial purse-strings is one of the very definitions of a recession. Both companies and families tend to reduce spending, hunker down and hold-out for larger budgets in the form of corporate spending or a consistent paycheck.</p>\n<p>This is problematic for both self-funded startups looking to grow organically from client/customer revenue as well as<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/how-to-bootstrap-your-startup-for-years-without-funding/\"> those seeking private equity or venture capital support to scale</a> a promising, novel concept. With tightened budgets on the corporate side, companies will be less likely to invest in products and services where they don&#8217;t see immediate value. And, if a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/31/vc-funding-in-2020-what-investors-look-for-in-startups/\">founder is seeking investor financing</a>, the probability of investor funding is significantly lower and investors become much more pitch-picky.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recession-bread startups also have a unique disadvantage to established firms when it comes to branding and marketing. Establishing a brand for organic inbound interest from either the internet or on-going referrals can take a lot of time. As a coworker is wont to say,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the world of digital and online marketing, the best time to start your website and perform SEO was two to three years ago. The second best time is certainly today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t an uphill battle.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for startups with smaller budgets both paid and organic search marketing is less likely to move the needle, at least initially. On the organic online marketing side, <a href=\"https://podcast.seo.co/what-is-the-difference-between-enterprise-seo-and-startup-seo\">startups should not expect to see results</a> (even when they are pushing hard) for at least 6 to 12 months, with major results not hitting until deep into year number two.</p>\n<p>Worse still, pushing too hard can get startups in the equivalent of search engine hot water. Those performing <a href=\"https://seo.co/enterprise/\">enterprise SEO</a> definitely have the advantage over startups. With established websites, large corporations can immediately push harder on SEO campaigns, thereby seeing more rapid results in shorter periods. Be aware that as a startup, unless you have an established website, you are less likely to receive a huge influx of organic interest at the outset unless you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Solve an immediate, real problem in the market</li>\n<li>Become a viral success</li>\n<li>Have a unique value proposition</li>\n<li>Partner with a large corporation for distribution and marketing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As someone who has established and run startups, the biggest problem with startups is not a lack of funding: it&#8217;s a lack of time. Startups tend to run out of runway. Speed to market and speed to revenue are <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/how-are-sustainable-startups-like-pela-fighting-plastic-waste/\">critical for startup sustainability</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/20/why-we-shouldnt-be-in-love-with-startups/\">establishing a brand-new company is extremely difficult</a> even in the best economic environment. Doing so during a recession further dampens the likelihood of success. But, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not possible and that massive opportunities don&#8217;t exist. It just means greater savvy-ness and scrappy-ness may be required.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/01/recession-startup/\">The Pros and Cons of Founding a Startup During a Recession</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 15:15:49 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups.jpg","linkMd5":"c25677148c3be02923381b938e336099","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-21-316_34817650ee557309.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups.jpg","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":422583,"destBytes":373076,"author":"Nate Nead","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/recession-startups-300x200.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn83@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-23-782_f71fc7f7428307f6.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jobless-recovery.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn78@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-22-966_7e665a069f5fad02.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195878980},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"What the Next Generation of Smartphones Look Like","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173999","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/11/what-the-next-generation-of-smartphones-look-like/\" title=\"What the Next Generation of Smartphones Look Like\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/What-the-Next-Generation-of-Smartphones-Look-Like-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"next generation of smartphones\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/What-the-Next-Generation-of-Smartphones-Look-Like-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/What-the-Next-Generation-of-Smartphones-Look-Like-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/What-the-Next-Generation-of-Smartphones-Look-Like.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ask a computer hardware specialist, &#8220;What is the future of computer hardware?&#8221; the answer for the half century past has been Moore’s Law. But what does the next generation of smartphones look like?<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel predicted that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits would double every two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devices that have occupied all our daily life. With no doubts, talking about the next generation of smartphones requires considering both hardware and software.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simpler words, every two years you can pack two times more processing power in a square inch of a processor. This is all good news for smartphones because smartphones are smaller and lighter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meaning that you can have faster and more powerful smartphones (two times faster in fact) every 2 years. Comparing to a supercomputer the size of a room 30 years ago, your smartphone is really smarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, as they say, nothing lasts forever. Actually, Moore&#8217;s law has been a prediction, not a law of the universe. He was a genius who well thought out about this and it happened over the last 50 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the rate of our processing power being doubled slowed down to once every 2.5 years. Insights do not show an exception for going back to the 2 years rate again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s all about the possibility limit. The current way of creating processors has come to a limit and it&#8217;s time for something new such as quantum computers.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old phones and current smartphones </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to the days when phones were only being used for contacting other people doesn&#8217;t need you to be an aged person. I can still remember those days when we had those kinds of phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nokia first generations had a keyboard full of buttons both numbers and arrows. Having a phone was considered a sign of being a wealthy person those days. You had the ability to contact almost everybody who had a phone wherever you are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time passed more and more companies started producing mobile phones and the prices started falling down. On the other hand, the rate in which the technology of those mobile phones advanced, started to get a pace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more engineers started working on mobile devices so we could have more and more functionalities aka features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below you see a list the things that have changed during the evolution of phones in the last 20 years:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Size</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thickness</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screen size</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screen resolution</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No of buttons</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Touch technologies</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sensors being used in the phone</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet generation (3G, 4G, 5G)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connectivity to other devices (Bluetooth, Infrared)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battery capacity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charging speed</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameras (revolutionary)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storage</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound volume and quality</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating System</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software-wise</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about the latest changes?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you follow the mobile industry and watch what the flagship phones have inside, you&#8217;ll notice a different strategy compared to the past. There is no more revolutionary thing inside new phones.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see the new camera is 5x better than the previous one.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see the new screen has more pixels per inch.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see the new battery power improved by 20%.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see the new internet generation (5G) support being integrated.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see the new OS being more powerful than before.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, I know, you are not expecting a brand-new thing to appear in the phones anymore compared to 5 years ago. You guess that this is all we can have or in fact we currently need to have in a smartphone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you are always expecting the OS or software inside to be improved over time.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s just compare the new iPhone 11 Pro with its preview generation iPhone X.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you read the specifications, you&#8217;ll see that the differences are as below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little bit bigger than iPhone X</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newer CPU</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More RAM</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhanced brand-new camera</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better front camera</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12% more battery capacity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More water resistance</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is all the things you&#8217;ll get if you buy an iPhone 11 Pro. You see the changes are not noticeable and if you work with them, you&#8217;ll literally feel nothing except the camera. What I believe is that the revolution for smartphones has just stopped and here we are with only tiny improvements from time to time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what is going to happen? Are we going to be happy with just tiny improvements? Did it stop going further? I believe there is going to be a revolutionary thing in the near future and I guess it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to tell you now.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of mobile phones is at first about the hardware then only about the software in the long run. What do I mean by this then?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s consider the current buying behavior of people closely.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samsung/ Apple introduces its new device.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a long queue waiting to be the first people to own that device.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People sell their old devices and buy the new device.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They keep each phone for a few years then buy a new one.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what the mobile producers want you to do. They need to sell more and more devices so they introduce new phones each year even if there is nothing extraordinary about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if it fails or explodes after a few months. It&#8217;s all about making more money. I&#8217;m not against making more money. I&#8217;m a fan of it in fact. What I believe is that there is not going to be a breakthrough technology in smartphones so that we need to change our phones every year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current revolutions are more on software than hardware.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibility limit of hardware</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardware industry still has a lot to go but it&#8217;ll end soon. I mean we&#8217;ll get to the finest particle size used in a CPU or capacity in a battery. Hardware will block us one day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s the matter of possibility. It might not be possible to go deeper from a point; it might not be possible to create smaller cells from a point and that point is not far from current situations. Let me give you an example: If we want to have more storage in our phones, we should go create smaller storage blocks so that we can put more blocks in the same space and have more capacity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is a possibility limit, we can&#8217;t go smaller than a cell, can we? Now expand this example to other aspects of a phone. There is finally a possibility limit on our way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses life cycle has 4 phases (introduction, growth, maturity, decline) as they grow. Some of the technologies inside smartphones might have come to their growth phase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, CPUs. They have passed the era of experience of doubling the processing power in the same space and it&#8217;s their maturity phase now. Usually businesses that reach their maturity level will fall into the decline phase if do not make new decisions specially innovations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovations are one rescue for businesses in the decline phase. Maybe the innovation for the next generation of CPUs are quantum processors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know how early it could happen but it is going to be the basis of new generation of smartphones that revolutionizes the current devices. This is how this we can overtake this possibility limit theory. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need for a new smartphone</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another topic to consider is the real need of people for having a phone with more capacity. Having a phone with more calculation power. Having a phone with more battery power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though it&#8217;s great to have more of everything as a human (we are never satisfied with having more of a thing), do we really need it? Just look at your way of using your new iPhone 11 Pro. Do you use all its performance power? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel a difference in the camera? Researchers say that our eyes are equal to a 10-megapixel camera. This means that we cannot understand the difference between a 10 and a 20-megapixel camera by our eyes. Do you really need wide cameras?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repeating, it’s great to have a better camera but the previous one is also great for me. This is more of a business thing because those brands create the demand even if there is no need for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are just part of a game. The game of seeing a new thing, thinking we need it and buying it eventually.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174004 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929-900x675.jpg\" alt=\"next generation of smartphones\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929-900x675.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929-213x160.jpg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/turned-on-black-iphone-7-displaying-hello-1275929.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the next generation of smartphones?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of smartphones will likely look like this:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; You go to a store, buy a white labeled phone with satisfying hardware without any OS on it. You then go home and buy your desired OS and install it on the device.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly you&#8217;ll no longer pay for a brand-new device &#8212; but you&#8217;ll just order your desired OS and enjoy the software functionalities created for you by the OS.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There might be several questions in your head about cameras, storage, RAM, processors, etc. Let&#8217;s see what happens to each of them in this new world.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameras in next generations of smartphones</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that having a good photo quality is not just about the hardware. Software matters too. Processors do a lot on the photo taken by a camera to make it better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the new generation software owns more accountability for the quality than the hardware. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, we&#8217;ll be able to improve image quality in a matter of a second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t always need to upgrade our camera hardware. Software can do it all for us. Meaning that you have a normal camera but the photo quality is way more than the ability of that hardware because AI is working on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same goes for video. We talked about how mobile phones can help you do better</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/12/how-these-apps-will-make-you-a-better-photographer/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">photography with a phone</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which might be interesting for you.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> AI and cameras in next generation of smartphones</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is the new buzzword not only in photography but also in every sector of the tech industry that has a software related part. A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rtificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. You might not know but without doubts one of your applications on your smartphone is using AI in such a way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the AI is the camera, maybe your voice</span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2013/01/15/virtual-personal-assistants-the-future-of-your-smartphone-infographic/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, maybe your anti-virus, etc. For example, when you are taking a photo and it detects the faces in your photo, this is what AI is understanding. Or when you are talking to Siri on your iPhone, it’s an intensive use of AI that can handle your requests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, when you are typing and the keyboard is suggesting words to complete your sentences, it’s AI that understands, interprets and predicts the rest of your sentence. Believe it or not AI is everywhere in your smartphone now. Cameras are also no exception and they are already using it a lot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of using AI in photos is the photo editing tools that help you edit extensively. You can easily repair skin colors/ shadows, replace colors, remove backgrounds and so many other things by just using an application.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good reason for using AI in the next generation of smartphones is the hardware gap. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all the cameras on smartphones have several lenses, not all of them have zoom lenses. That’s where you need a software to handle the zooming. “Software is becoming more and more important for smartphones because they have a physical lack of optics, so we’ve seen the rise of computational photography that tries to replicate an optical zoom,” says imaging analyst Arun Gill, Senior Market Analyst at Future Source Consulting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the examples is Google Pixel 3 which uses a single camera lens with huge computational photography in order to replicate an optical zoom and also adds various effects. To let you know more, AI has a lot to offer not just in photography but also in </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/26/ai-can-impact-mobile-app-development-and-user-experience/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improving user experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storage </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next generation of smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody has heard about Google drive or iCloud. These guys have been around for a while and more and more people are using them nowadays compared to a few years ago when everybody needed to have all his files, photos and videos on their device. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going beyond the personal files, comes the applications. We are using a lot of applications in the </span><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2009/08/04/why_cloud_computing_is_the_future_of_mobile/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cloud</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every day and we are getting used to it. Meaning that we no longer need to have all the applications installed in our smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We just open the URL and boom, it&#8217;s there. This decreases the need for a big storage on our devices. So, the new devices come with small storage because you are going to have everything on a cloud somewhere in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is all because of cloud technology which is becoming cheaper and cheaper every day. More and more companies and products are fully migrating to clouds or connected to clouds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A major advantage of cloud storage is the ability to access your files on any device and not needing to transfer them manually every time you switch to a new phone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You just upload once and every time you get a new phone or go on a new device regardless of being a smartphone or personal computer, you’ll have all the files there in a second.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some smartphones that offer cloud storage as you buy them. Google Pixel is one of the few smartphones that benefit from cloud storage by default. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It offers just 32GB internal storage and it doesn’t have a micro card slot. Google Pixel offers unlimited storage on Google Drive for high-resolution photos and videos for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It has already started being the next generation of smartphones where you are migrating to cloud faster than other phones.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RAM </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next generation of smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application of a RAM is to keep enough data you need handy when opening an application on your phone. This means that if you want to have more applications working at the same time and you don&#8217;t want to experience lag in your device, you need more RAM. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let&#8217;s think about having all your applications on clouds. You no longer need to have a big RAM. You just need enough RAM to launch your OS. That&#8217;s why the next generation of phones do not need a huge RAM. Thanks to cloud technology again and again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, there are a number of smartphones that have 8GB of RAM inside. In fact, 8GB of RAM is not vital for a smartphone. This much RAM is more than enough for almost all computing tasks on a standard work machine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There aren’t enough tasks you can put into your smartphone to make the most use of all 8GB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you are thinking about future proofing your device with this 8GB of RAM, but unfortunately</span> smartphone hardware degrades pretty quickly<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So never try to buy a smartphone with 8GB of RAM solely for that purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are smartphones with 12GB of RAM such as Samsung Galaxy S20. But</span><a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-much-ram-does-my-smartphone-really-need\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tests</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that phones with more RAM do not necessarily perform better than those with lower RAM. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Apple’s iPhones have 4GB of RAM and perform very well compared to their competitors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is not a big deal to have more RAM on your device. In the next generations of smartphones, you’ll have the required amount of RAM in your hardware and leave the rest to software to handle it perfectly.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next generation of smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processors are not an exception. When you don&#8217;t have any applications on your phone, processing is not a big deal because you are leaving all the processes to the cloud.You no longer own a processing unit. All the processes are done in the cloud because all your data is there and all your applications are launched there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I know based on my research is that we are not using all the power inside the CPU of our smartphone and there is still a lot to do with them. This doesn’t mean the improvement and advancement in CPU technologies would stop while it means software has a lot to consume yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more powerful CPUs, applications are able to perform better and do more complex tasks. Improvement of CPUs creates the space for artificial intelligence works to be done by applications on smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, there is a direct connection between type of CPU and 5G internet. Not all CPUs are able to support 5G at the moment and they should gradually adapt to the new conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of having all our data and applications on the cloud requires a big support of internet bandwidth and computational power which are achievable through a cutting-edge CPU. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CPU that supports them both. Considering the next generation smartphones have one of those CPUs with minimum functionality of supporting both 5G and enough computational power for the times there are calculations and computations needed to be run on the device locally.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ports in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next generation of smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing we always had in mind when buying a new device was connectivity functionality. What I mean by that is how many other devices can be connected to this computer or laptop? This also used to be an important matter when buying a new phone until smartphones came by. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good point about them is that you can connect almost anything via Bluetooth and Wifi. Apple has its own Airdrop which enables you to connect to all Apple devices and share files with them. You can connect Bluetooth handsfree, Bluetooth speakers, external hard drives, selfie sticks, etc. to your smartphone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some phones are now supporting wireless charging and you no longer need to connect a cable for charging your phone. This means that we no longer need the charger hole beneath our smartphones because we can just do it wirelessly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently Apple announced that there would be no charger and ear pods in the iPhone package for the next iPhones anymore. I believe it’s the beginning of removing the current charger port as well. The same as they did with the 3.5mm jack for handsfree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what about the next generation of smartphones? I can guess that there wouldn’t be any ports anymore because everything could be done wirelessly through different technologies. Therefore, do not expect a hole in your next generation of smartphone.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trends of purchasing new smartphones</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple and other smartphone makers have attributed falling revenues to customers not upgrading their handsets. That’s a growing problem for the industry, but it’s felt more acutely in some regions than others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the U.S. and Europe, especially, the life cycle of a smartphone has been steadily increasing, according to data from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that people are keeping their old phones more than before. In 2016, American smartphone owners used their phones for 22.7 months on average before upgrading. By 2018, that number had increased to 24.7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users in five European countries tracked by Kantar Worldpanel — France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain — are keeping their phones for even longer. From 2016 to 2018, the life cycle of a smartphone was extended by nearly three months, from 23.4 to 26.2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users in Great Britain logged the longest average of 27.7 months in 2018. This change in behavior is not only due to price-related matters (majority of smartphones prices has increased over the last years) but also due to the fact that people are satisfied with their smartphones and new phones do not have something special to offer.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next generation of smartphones, you won&#8217;t go and buy a branded phone. You&#8217;ll only buy a white label hardware then choose your desired OS software to install on that hardware.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; You go to a store, buy a white labeled phone with satisfying hardware without any OS on it. You then go home and buy your desired OS and install it on the device.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key here is advancement of technologies in the internet (5G), cloud computing, cloud storage and artificial intelligence which are all revolutionizing the tech industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are at a point in history when infrastructure is no big deal anymore and everything is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/08/customer-relationships-the-benefits-of-using-crm-software-for-startups/\">going to rely on software</a> because there is not going to be any limitations in terms of hardware.

Podcasting</b></h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CpQhPVE6ZrZ5ZmjsZ1y1yeQBSPFC16EpJ6_FcPLieNeUogg1qbcDEamfaSwbZVwDpjR8o6U5Nh_3U_zt6ysy3qKO70Ec9pQsgybLn7O1uMVE5oOHD0gA4N2cbE-f9jTO3CHWhfs\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"723\" /></p>\n<p><b>Image: Podcasting-Example.png</b><b><br />\n</b><b>Image Source: </b><a href=\"https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/listen/\"><b>https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/listen/</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podcasts have exploded in popularity in the past decade.

Even if there are already big players in your niche or no podcasts are covering your niche at all—you must put up an informational podcast episode regularly.</span></p>\n<p><b>Similar to blogging, consistency is key to thriving in the podcasting space.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also crucial that you create a podcast intentionally. Creating a podcast only for the sake of marketing isn’t going to be effective. You’ll lose traction and plateau at times, and only being passionate about your niche will keep you going. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, sticking to a particular facet of your niche is essential—since switching subjects will confuse your listeners regarding your area of expertise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opined Brendan Hufford of </span><a href=\"http://100daysofseo.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100 Days of SEO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h4><b>#2.

The brand does not promote itself. You can find user-generated content on social media, blogs, and forums as comments, images, or testimonials.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One good example of marketing using user-generated content is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. Users would find a Coke with their name on it and share a picture of it on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it may not seem like a huge deal, you must realize that with this campaign, the company managed to create a source of free viral content for the brand—since people were essentially showing off images with their drink.</span></p>\n<p><b>You can leverage user-generated content from the ratings, reviews, and comments from e-commerce sites, blog posts, and social media depending on what suits your business model and niche best.</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.expertvoice.com/the-psychology-of-brand-trust-influencer-marketing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 90%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of consumers trust the recommendation of another person, even someone they don’t know, over branded content—which is why you must find ways to leverage user-generated content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opined Brent Trotter of </span><a href=\"http://cliquestudios.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clique Studios</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h4><b>#3. Voice-Activated Content</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the adoption of smart devices proliferating, there is an upsurge in demand for content optimized for voice-activated devices. Voice-activated content</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opens up a wealth of opportunities for you to intervene and leverage the newly popular platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many marketers are only now starting to realize the potential for profits of this trend, it is vital that you begin curating voice-optimized content right away, while you still have the upper hand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is only one thing you must discern to make the most out of the opportunity you have now. </span></p>\n<p><b>You must understand the nuances between how users search for content when they type and when they speak. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaining mastery over these subtle differences will enable you to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/07/steps-to-building-a-successful-and-scalable-sales-process/\">craft better headlines</a> and focus on including specific long-tail keywords in your content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although voice-optimized content must be informative and engaging (just like blog content), the style of writing must be much simpler.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analyzing patterns and trends in voice searches—similar to what you practice when looking for keywords and content in demand—can potentially amplify your exposure.</span></p>\n<h4><b>#4.

However, throughout all changes in the SEO field, the one thing that remains constant is content. Here are five SEO writing tools for optimizing your content.</p>\n<p>Content and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/24/l1ght-spotlights-the-shortfalls-of-manual-and-automated-content-moderation/\">search engine optimization go hand in hand</a> because people use search engines to find content that meets them at their points of need.</p>\n<p>When you’re creating content, you should focus on how well you’re conveying the message to your audience. Another thing to make sure of is that your content is actually easy to find. You cannot achieve the outcome you desire if your target audience has a hard time finding your website.</p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/04/managed-wordpress-hosting/\">content creator or blogger</a>, ensure that your content offers value to the audience as well. No one wants to read irrelevant content no matter how readily available it is. Take your time to research your audience and ensure you write on topics they’re interested in.</p>\n<p>To top it off, your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/27/how-will-ai-change-the-future-of-seo/\">article should be SEO-friendly</a>. Friendly means it gives Google and other search engines an easy time. You should understand that there is a very big difference between creating relevant content for your audience, and optimizing your articles for SEO.</p>\n<p>A search engine complaint article is one that can be ranked on the first page of Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). After all, when you rank high, you have an easy time reaching your audience. This guide will look at everything you need to know about SEO and content creation.</p>\n<h2><b>Understanding the Meaning of SEO-Friendly Content</b></h2>\n<p>Before you can write impressive content that is optimized for SEO, you first need to understand the meaning of SEO-friendly content. We’ve already established that creating such content gives search engines an easy time in ranking your website.</p>\n<p>Ranking means that search engines can easily locate, interpret information from your website. Search engines have algorithms that help them decide the chronological order in the content ranking.</p>\n<p>When your article checks more boxes based on the algorithms, you rank higher and vice versa.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/10/4-ways-to-optimize-your-site-to-rank-on-google-in-2019/\">Optimizing content for search engines</a> is not a complex endeavor as many might assume. All you have to do is ensure your articles meet your target audience at their point of need. Search engines rank articles based on how well they address the issues readers are trying to solve.</p>\n<p>Google will first establish how important your site is, and then estimate your website authority based on how made sites have linked back to you. On the internet, links work the same way as ballots during elections. The more sites that link back to you, the more authority your site has.</p>\n<h3><b>Finding Interesting and Effective Topics to Write About</b></h3>\n<p>People with no blogs might think that finding something to write about is as easy as picking a card at a Tarot reader’s place. Well, it’s not as easy, especially when you’ve been blogging for a while.</p>\n<p>Since there are so many blogs today talking about the same thing, you might find yourself repeating something that another blogger had addressed. Blogging is like a comedy scene; you can reuse a joke. Just make sure that you recreate it and make it more interesting.</p>\n<p>You should strive to have a list of significant topics to write about so you’re consistent in uploading blogs on your site. Remember that frequency matters in keeping your blog relevant and having a solid online presence.</p>\n<p>Here are useful ways to help you come up with ideal topics to discuss;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use of<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/01/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo/\"> keywords</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Address trending topics</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make use of blog topic generators</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewriting old blog posts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Search Engine Optimization Tools </b></h3>\n<p>Well, to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/01/important-keyword-research/\">create SEO-friendly content</a>, you need to arm yourself with the right tools.

Businesses have moved operations <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/30/best-collaboration-tools-to-manage-remote-workers/\">remotely</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-wellbeing-high.aspx\">43% of U.S. workers working off-site</a> some or all of the time. However, many are experiencing major disruptions due to the unexpected and forced adoption of remote work, as they must quickly scale to meet the demands of customers and a decentralized workforce. Here is how COVID-19 is kicking digital transformation into overdrive.</p>\n<h4>Many businesses are now realizing that investments into digital transformation are no longer simply an option; it’s vital to survival.</h4>\n<p>While digital adoption or moving to remote working conditions typically takes months or even years to implement &#8212; businesses of all sizes have been thrust into digital transformation whether they planned for it or not.</p>\n<p>Businesses should devise contingency plans and strive to continually innovate to improve customer experiences and ensure steady growth. As remote work and reformed social practices are forced upon us, digital transformation is the solution to changed employee and customer expectations across all industries.</p>\n<h2><strong>The New Digital Normal</strong></h2>\n<p>In the new normal, digital will rule as the world operates with significantly less physical interaction. To sustain remote work, companies need to modernize outdated, overwhelmed tech stacks. Busines and equip themselves with a digital toolbox that facilitates communication, scheduling, project management, file sharing, and storage to drive success.</p>\n<h4>Cloud infrastructure and apps.</h4>\n<p>Remote work is largely enabled by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/05/the-cloud-is-the-future-of-software-delivery/\">cloud infrastructure</a> and apps such as Teams, Slack, or Chanty for messaging. You&#8217;ll need a platform for your calls and digital meetings like Hangouts, Zoom, or Skype for video calls. What will you do for contracts? Get that set it up &#8212; Formstack Sign, HelloSign, or DocuSign for closing contracts digitally.</p>\n<p>For companies that have not already established a system for digital work, this can be an enormous overhaul for operations and can significantly impede, and even halt workflow. It&#8217;s essential that you make your solutions easy-to-use and easy to understand and adopt. Help your team with any required technical skills &#8212; and use platforms and apps so even non-tech savvy users can learn and adapt quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Use simple, practical solutions so your organization can quickly scale to meet the demands of a remote workforce and changing customer behaviors.</strong></p>\n<p>Some vital digital transformation steps include moving all paper processes to digital, automating workflows, and digitizing every customer and supplier interaction.</p>\n<p>For example, business leaders looking to transition back into physical offices are monitoring cases of coronavirus across their organizations with a digital COVID-19 self-declaration form. Healthcare workers are using online forms and routing to streamline the drastic spike in COVID-19-related requests, prioritize those most at risk, and routing them to the appropriate people to triage.</p>\n<p>Higher education administrations are using digital surveys to collect student concerns on the transition to remote learning and apply that feedback to upcoming school year planning.</p>\n<p>Businesses are also re-evaluating what is essential travel and what can be accomplished through virtual meetings. In lieu of annual in-person conventions previously used as touchpoints and opportunities for networking and new business, companies will have to connect virtually.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Shift in Customer Expectations</strong></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, organizations that refuse to digitize or believe they can “switch back to normal” after the crisis is over will be left in the dust. Companies that made the investments in automation and moving work to the cloud are meeting the touchless, digital customer’s needs and will ultimately earn the trust and loyalty beyond the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>Conversely, businesses that require in-person transactions will lose out to competitors that are making it easier for customers to transact digitally from anywhere.</strong></p>\n<p>Reduced in-person customer interactions are significantly impacting brick-and-mortar businesses. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/how-businesses-are-planning-to-bring-workers-back-after-coronavirus.html\">CNBC</a> shared that U.S. retailers expect an enduring shift to ecommerce, meaning brick-and-mortar stores should prepare for potentially continued lower foot traffic.</p>\n<p>But retailers aren’t alone. Businesses across all sectors – from healthcare to retail – must invest in digital, contactless experiences or services to continue to engage with customers. Smart restaurants are pivoting to offer take-out and delivery.</p>\n<p>Healthcare organizations are turning to telehealth and virtual consultations. They’re doing what is necessary to respond rapidly to changing business circumstances and increased operations, and simultaneously changing customer expectations.</p>\n<p>Now that customers are experiencing what is possible through digital offerings, they will expect these convenient services to continue long into the future. Organizations that fail to shift to digital or cease supporting digital processes post-pandemic will ultimately lose value to their customers.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Future of the Workplace is Hybrid</strong></h2>\n<p>Even after the world emerges from the pandemic, digitization and remote work are here to stay. Employees and customers will have experienced new digital processes and services and want to continue enjoying the benefits. Though physical interactions will always be valuable, all stakeholders are learning the value of digital transformation through this crisis.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, it will be key for organizations to provide a hybrid offering that prioritizes efficiency, convenience and safety across in-person and digital services.</p>\n<h4>Digitization is necessary for businesses to quickly adapt to remote work, it will also play an important role in helping return employees to the office.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Returning+To+Work+How+To+Prepare+For+Pandemic+Recovery/-/E-RES160660?objectid=res160660\">Forrester Research</a> reported that businesses will be turning to technology to make the employee transition back to the office as seamless and safe as possible. With the delayed return to in-person education and child-care services, parents will be required to continue working from home, even as others may begin to return to workplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Working outside of a secured office setting underscores the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/05/securing-the-digital-workplace-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">need to adopt secure</a> and efficient digital solutions to support a partial, if not continued, remote workforce.</strong></p>\n<p>To optimize safety, businesses will likely reconsider office layouts to increase space between workers and install devices that scan temperatures. They’ll also need to monitor cases of coronavirus across their organization with a digital self-reporting system &#8212; and control the number of people in an office at once through staggered work schedules.</p>\n<h3>Another factor to be considered is how workers commute.</h3>\n<p>Those employees that rely on public transit may need additional flexibility to work from home to decrease exposure to high traffic areas.</p>\n<p>Through all of these transitions &#8212; companies have learned that workers can work productively from home to sustain businesses. Businesses can use digital transformations and they are offering the most holistic solutions to address the multitude of issues the world is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/16/thanks-covid-remote-work-is-now-mandatory/\">facing in this evolving environment</a>.</p>\n<p>An investment in digital will be the strongest way organizations can arm themselves to not only persevere the pandemic but also continue thriving into the future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/17/covid-19-kicking-digital-transformation-into-overdrive/\">COVID-19: Kicking Digital Transformation into Overdrive</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:01:02 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kicking-Digital-Transformation-into-Overdrive.jpg","linkMd5":"129497618074e6b065c60f1fc3b1185b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-25-681_149f9d2238f053a4.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kicking-Digital-Transformation-into-Overdrive.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":35878,"destBytes":21782,"author":"Chris Byers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kicking-Digital-Transformation-into-Overdrive-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-12-099_d345d5a7eb43aba5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875352},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:52","title":"Playing “Whack a Mole”: Law Enforcement Response to DDoS as a Service","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172301","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/18/playing-whack-a-mole-law-enforcement-response-to-ddos-as-a-service/\" title=\"Playing “Whack a Mole”: Law Enforcement Response to DDoS as a Service\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"law enfrocement to DDoS\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to an organization’s ability to serve its customers. A DDoS attack can knock a company’s web presence offline, making it incapable of responding to legitimate requests from customers. And as DDoS attacks become cheaper and easier to perform &#8212; an attack or threat of this type &#8212; is growing. Here is law enforcement response to DDoS as a service.</p>\n<p><strong>Cybercriminals are increasingly offering DDoS attacks for hire, expanding the number and types of businesses that could be targeted by these attacks.</strong></p>\n<p>Law enforcement has acknowledged the problem, and some organizations are actively working to take down DDoS marketplaces. However, they are fighting a losing battle as new sites are created when others are taken down. Companies must protect themselves from this threat by deploying DDoS protection (imperva dot com). solutions.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Growing Threat of DDoS Attacks</strong></h2>\n<p>DDoS attacks are relatively easy for an attacker to perform. Unlike many types of cyberattacks, they require no vulnerabilities or security errors on the victim’s systems.</p>\n<p>Instead, DDoS attacks take advantage of the fact that all systems have a finite maximum number of requests that they can process or data that they can store, transmit, and process. A DDoS attack involves sending more data or requests than this maximum number, either degrading the system’s ability to respond to legitimate requests or knocking it completely offline.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve the amount of traffic needed for these attacks, DDoS attackers use multiple Internet-connected systems. These often include Internet of Things (IoT) devices (known for their poor security), cloud computing instances (which offer computational power for lease), and mobile devices (infected via malicious apps).</p>\n<p>As the adoption of these new technologies grows, so does the potential threat of DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>In recent years, attacks have grown in number, scale, and sophistication as cybercriminals take advantage of the ability to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/05/27/5-threats-smart-devices-and-the-iot-could-pose/\">transform a simple vulnerability</a> (like the use of weak passwords on IoT devices) into a chance to impact an organization’s operations and potentially demand a ransom to stop an attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Cybercriminals operating DDoS botnets have also taken advantage of another opportunity to monetize their attacks by offering DDoS as a Service.</strong></p>\n<p>The low cost associated with performing a DDoS attack (thanks to modern technology) means that cybercriminals can offer attacks at a very reasonable price while still making a tidy profit.</p>\n<p>As a result, the range of organizations potentially targeted by DDoS attacks has expanded dramatically as anyone with a grievance and the willingness to break the law can target an organization of their choice.</p>\n<h2><strong>Law Enforcement Takedowns Aren’t Enough</strong></h2>\n<p>DDoS attackers’ pivot to offering attacks “as a Service” provides some advantages to law enforcement. With a cybercriminal operating completely on their own and pursuing their own goals, there may be little or no opportunity for law enforcement to target their infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While a DDoS botnet requires command and control (C2) servers, the use of domain generation algorithms (DGAs) and similar tools could allow an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/20/whats-video-phishing-and-how-do-you-protect-yourself/\">attacker to move their infrastructure faster</a> than law enforcement could identify it and take it down.</p>\n<p>With DDoS as a service, on the other hand, law enforcement can take advantage of single points of failure in the business model. For customers to be able to engage with a DDoS service provider, they need a means of contacting them and providing payment. These marketplaces provide a target for law enforcement takedowns.</p>\n<p>Some law enforcement agencies have worked to address the DDoS threat by shutting down “booter” sites and arresting their operators. The Dutch police have made multiple efforts to take down booter sites, including <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/dutch-police-shut-down-15-ddos-for-hire-services/d/d-id/1337551\">shutting down 15 sites and making an arrest in April 2020</a>, and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/fbi-ddos-booter-sites-offline/\">FBI made a similar effort in December 2018</a>.</p>\n<h3>Despite all these efforts, the DDoS as a Service industry is still going strong.</h3>\n<p>The reason for this is that the targets that law enforcement can access (i.e., the booter sites and the people that operate them) are not essential to the service. Service providers can easily set up a new website when needed. Arrests and incarceration are intended to be a deterrent, but the poor track record of convictions for cybercrimes (and the jurisdictional issues) mean that many DDoS service providers are undeterred.</p>\n<p>These takedowns rarely impact the actual botnets used in the attack, making it easy for the cybercriminal (or another one who compromises the same devices) to continue operations with a new domain.</p>\n<h4><strong>Protecting Against the DDoS Threat</strong></h4>\n<p>DDoS attacks are an ever-growing threat to organizations’ ability to <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/08/detecting-and-protecting-against-ransomware-best-practice-for-2020/\">maintain the availability of their web services</a> and maintain “business as usual.”</p>\n<p>The pace of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/29/12-lesser-known-iot-protocols-you-wished-you-knew-about-earlier/\">adoption of new technology</a>, such as IoT, mobile, and the cloud, is outpacing the ability (and potential willingness) of their manufacturers to properly secure them against exploitation. As a result, the number and size of DDoS botnets in operation continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement organizations, such as the Dutch police and the FBI, are making an effort to fight DDoS attacks, but trying to stop DDoS attacks via booter site takedowns and arrests is a losing battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Attribution is difficult, and websites are easy to replace, making it possible for attackers to quickly continue business as usual.</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations must take protection against DDoS attacks into their own hands. As DDoS attacks become more well-known, widespread, and affordable, the range of organizations targeted by them is likely to continue to expand.</p>\n<p>Deploying a DDoS protection solution that is capable of identifying and blocking attacks with extremely high traffic and data volumes, is an essential component of any <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/04/cyber-security-modern-technology-and-business-threats/\">organization’s cybersecurity strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/07/18/playing-whack-a-mole-law-enforcement-response-to-ddos-as-a-service/\">Playing “Whack a Mole”: Law Enforcement Response to DDoS as a Service</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 15:01:03 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service.jpg","linkMd5":"186db8b60b5cb0931ac41eab956ffa16","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-26-858_dd4365a7dce52838.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":64238,"destBytes":56938,"author":"Richard Parker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Law-Enforcement-Response-to-DDoS-as-a-Service-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-10-921_15d2241d8ab36ca2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195872187},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Omni Pixel Eyewear: Designer Computer Glasses","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168170","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/17/omni-pixel-eyewear-designer-computeglasses/\" title=\"Omni Pixel Eyewear: Designer Computer Glasses\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Omni Pixel Eyewear\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Computer glasses have provided many computer users with welcome relief for their eyes after spending countless hours on the computer for work or gaming. During optometry visits, I would inquire about the cost of purchasing an additional pair of prescription glasses just to use while I worked on the computer.  The costly price was a deterrent.</p>\n<p>Then, I found Pixel Eyewear, which are glasses designed to help minimize eye strain while working on the computer or other electronic devices. Here&#8217;s my review of the <a href=\"https://www.pixeleyewear.com/collections/amber-glasses/products/omni-amber?variant=30701952860244\">Omni Pixel glasses</a>.</p>\n<h2>Issues With Blue Light</h2>\n<p>To understand how Pixel glasses help, it&#8217;s important to first understand the health issues caused by our dependence on electronic devices. These digital devices, including computer screens, mobile devices, and television, continuously emit a blue light. Over an extended time, this blue light can cause eye fatigue, blurred vision, and headaches. The blue light can also cause problems with our circadian rhythm, which regulates melatonin, and therefore tends to disrupt sleep quantity and quality.</p>\n<h2>What Makes Pixel Glasses Different?</h2>\n<p>To help ease eye strain from exposure to blue light, Pixel created lens technology that it uses in all of its eyeglasses. Pixel lenses filter 50% of blue light, including as much as 95% at the strongest wavelengths without the yellow tint. The lenses help do this through an anti-reflective coating. In contrast, other computer glasses are typically yellow and offer low transparency. The glasses also have UV protection</p>\n<p>What also sets Pixel apart is that the glasses have a combination of the latest coating technologies. There is a super-hydrophobic outer layer, which is nanotechnology made to reduce smudges and repels water and dust. The coating technologies also remove color and image distortion.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-168173 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-900x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-900x450.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-260x130.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<h2>About Omni Pixel Glasses</h2>\n<p>The Omni style is made for men or women. It has a straight brow and keyhole bridge, offering a medium-wide width. Two-color choices include Smolder (tortoiseshell color) and Crystal (clear plastic look).</p>\n<h2>What I Like and What Could Be Better</h2>\n<p>All of the Pixel glasses have a clear lens, so they look like a standard pair of glasses. The frames used by Pixel contain cellulose acetate, which is used by most high-end eyewear brands. If you don&#8217;t like the Omni style, you can also choose from a wide selection of other eyeglass frame styles. They have an online size guide to help you pick the right size.</p>\n<p>The Pixel glasses are now also available as part of getting your prescription glasses. The company gives you a 30-day risk-free trip for its regular computer glasses. It also offers free U.S. shipping, returns, and exchanges. Another positive about Pixel is that they are affordably priced, making them accessible to a larger group of computer users.</p>\n<p>The glasses arrived quickly and were carefully packaged. I checked their customer service response and found them to be quick, friendly, and knowledgeable. It was good to know that they were available should I need assistance.</p>\n<p>Other than feeling a bit heavier on my face than my other prescription eyeglasses, it is difficult to find fault with these computer and gaming glasses.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-168182 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-404x719.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-404x719.jpg 404w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-169x300.jpg 169w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-90x160.jpg 90w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2>In the Box</h2>\n<p>Each pair of Pixel glasses comes with a cleaning cloth, a soft pouch, and a case.</p>\n<h2>Purchase Options</h2>\n<p>You can purchase these glasses through the Pixel website or through most optometrists and eyeglass retailers. Some styles are also available on Amazon.</p>\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Since purchasing and wearing my Omni Smolder prescription glasses, I have not experienced eye strain or headaches, nor have I required eye drops to help with dry eyes. They are comfortable, stylish, and fairly priced. I would recommend Pixel glasses, including the Omni style, to anyone that spends countless hours on their laptop, smartphone, and/or gaming device.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/17/omni-pixel-eyewear-designer-computeglasses/\">Omni Pixel Eyewear: Designer Computer Glasses</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:00:18 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear.jpg","linkMd5":"d8a384d608d9d5a051997060d0a110e5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-21-683_78111a145f561951.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":16827,"destBytes":12812,"author":"Brad Anderson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omni-Pixel-Eyewear-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-14-768_996b004080b200f0.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Omniprescriptionglasses-900x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-27-986_3f15258d997d9b9f.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pixeleyeglasses-404x719.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-15-977_9c675aa1a2a2844f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880351},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:55","title":"5 Product Discovery Tips for Building Solutions Customers Will Buy","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=172308","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/5-product-discovery-tips-for-building-solutions-customers-will-buy/\" title=\"5 Product Discovery Tips for Building Solutions Customers Will Buy\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy-300x179.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"solutions customers buy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy-300x179.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy-900x536.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy-260x155.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Products aren’t made… They’re discovered.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you <em>think</em> you have a “brilliant” idea &#8211; what matters is if the <em>customer</em> thinks so, too, and is willing to pay for it.</p>\n<p>You see, customers don’t buy anything they don’t want. So the question is, how do you figure out what customers want and give it to them? <strong>Product discovery.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how product discovery works, why it matters, and some tips for pumping out products your customers are virtually guaranteed to buy.</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s start with a brief explanation.</p>\n<h2>&#x200d;What Is Product Discovery?</h2>\n<p>Product discovery is a process of rooting into the mind and emotions of your target market to understand exactly who they are, what they care about, and all of the problems they wished they could solve.</p>\n<p>Those problems will lead you to discover the solutions they require and the products that must be created to deliver them.</p>\n<h2>&#x200d;Why Does Product Discovery Matter?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-170273 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business.jpg\" alt=\"visual technology and business\" width=\"626\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business.jpg 626w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business-300x170.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business-260x147.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Product discovery matters because creating products that don’t serve customers will ruin a business. And so do products that make customers say “meh.”</p>\n<p>Businesses don’t survive that long with apathetic customers settling for 10th best in a competitive market.</p>\n<h4>What you should be aiming for is to hear the customer say, “This is what I&#8217;ve been waiting for!”</h4>\n<p>And the only way to get that kind of reaction is by identifying your markets’ genuine needs. Too often, products are built on assumptions made by your team and company &#8211; instead of your customers’ preferences.</p>\n<p>Products should be evidence-based and informed by listening to customer desires, which is the process behind product discovery.</p>\n<h2>&#x200d;How Does Product Discovery Work?</h2>\n<p>The “what” of product discovery is straightforward, but the “how” is a little trickier to grasp.</p>\n<p>The first step is challenging your assumptions as we mentioned in the last section. If your executive team pushes product initiatives forward, then you have to challenge the assumptions they’re making about customers’ likes and dislikes. If your product team suggests features based on past experiences, they need to be closely examined.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where product ideas come from, they must be weighed against fresh customer insights and reliable data.</p>\n<p>What you think you “know” about your customers should be rephrased as what you “hypothesize” about your customers. And then move to the next step:</p>\n<h3>Conduct empirical research.</h3>\n<p>There are 2 types of data you can collect for empirical research:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li>Qualitative</li>\n<li>Quantitative</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Qualitative data is subject and is all about how your customers and prospects feel about your brand and products.</h3>\n<p>Customer surveys such as <a href=\"https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/net-promoter-score\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/customer-satisfaction-score-csat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</a> help you understand the way customers <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/startup-essentials-stop-overcomplicating-your-processes/\">currently view you and your solutions</a>. It helps you empathize with your customers and see their journey through their eyes &#8211; allowing you to develop better customer experiences and products.</p>\n<h3>Quantitative data is all about the numbers.</h3>\n<p>Did customers <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/11/28/increase-ecommerce-sales-with-adaptive-ecommerce/\">open the onboarding emails</a> after they subscribed to your app? Did you get more sales from customers who bought products in the last 6 months or the last 12 months? How many customer complaints have you received after rolling out a new feature?</p>\n<p>This kind of data and much more like it will give you direct insights into customer behavior, and when cross-checked with qualitative data, will begin to form a clear picture of who your customer is and exactly what they want.</p>\n<p>Again, every assumption must be challenged and compared to real data.</p>\n<p>Once armed with this data, you can create “living” documents that are updated as you learn more about your customers.</p>\n<p>The first document we recommend creating is a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/30/personalizing-your-customer-service-with-6-strategies/\">customer persona</a>. This is a list of demographics, psychographics, and verified behavior of your customers.</p>\n<p>Another worthwhile document to have is the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/11/how-do-you-create-an-effective-journey-map-for-your-customers/\">customer journey map</a>. It documents the path prospects follow to become customers. It usually starts with some kind of &#8220;first contact&#8221; and ends in a renewal of service or another purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>And then there’s the empathy map.</strong></p>\n<p>It helps you to visualize the behaviors and attitudes of the user in a way UX teams can follow and reference when thinking about how and why a user interacts with their products.</p>\n<p><strong>Create those three documents to give you and your company the best progression-growth-map to follow.</strong></p>\n<p>There are plenty more progression-growth-map-docs you may wish to produce as you go through the product discovery process.</p>\n<h2>&#x200d;5 Tips for Effective Product Discovery</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-172205 size-full\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement.png 750w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement-300x160.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement-260x139.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The product discovery process is messy, sometimes confusing, and different for every business and market. That doesn’t mean there aren’t a few fundamentals you can use to make it easier and more effective.</p>\n<h3>&#x200d;Begin by Empathizing With Your Audience</h3>\n<p>Empathy should always be the starting point in product discovery. It forces you to look through your customers’ eyes and see the world as they do. The goal is to eliminate projection, assumption, and “intuition” and replace them with accurate observation and genuine understanding.</p>\n<h4>The key is to get specific.</h4>\n<p>Imagine just one customer. Describe everything you know about that one customer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What’s their perspective?</li>\n<li>What are their hopes and dreams, needs and desires?</li>\n<li>What are the fears and pains tormenting them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fill this one customer with all the attributes and characteristics you’ve discovered about your real customers.</p>\n<p>The process will give you a robust image you can use to pinpoint the problem they need to be solved, the solution they require, and the right way to package it into a product they would buy.</p>\n<h3>&#x200d;Constantly Uncover Customer Problems</h3>\n<p>Product discovery isn’t linear, neat, or tidy. It’s chaotic.</p>\n<p>The only way to get the data you’re looking for is to embrace the mayhem. This is especially true when it comes to discovering your customers’ problems.</p>\n<p>There is always more to learn, and the day you stop is the day new products won’t be discovered. You have to remain hyper-curious about all the challenges your customers want to overcome because if you don’t, your competitors will.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Survey your customers.</li>\n<li>Conduct customer interviews.</li>\n<li>Monitor social media.</li>\n<li>Collect reviews.</li>\n<li>Listen to customer complaints.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&#x200d;Map Everything</h3>\n<p>We already mentioned empathy and customer journey maps, but you can map virtually anything to help you visualize each step and how they fit together.</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li>A customers typical day.</li>\n<li>Specific customer experience.</li>\n<li>The Customer’s journey to discovering your product and using it.</li>\n<li>Map out your own processes running behind the scenes that support your customer’s journey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawing visual maps <a href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2016/01/why-drawing-maps-sharpens-your-thinking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help you think</a>. The visual map externalizes complex and abstract mental concepts and makes them concrete, easily understood, and more “real.”</p>\n<p>The added benefit is that once it’s out of your head, you’re not spending time thinking of the map while maintaining it in your mind &#8211; you can just think about the map you’re looking at, freeing up critical mental energy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone on your team to draw maps of processes, strategies, concepts, and ideas. If you want to see an explosion of growth &#8212; at the very least, have managers and decision-makers draw this visual map.</p>\n<h3>&#x200d;Don’t Settle for the First Solution You Devise</h3>\n<p>Coming up with an idea to solve your customer’s problem is easy… The first time.</p>\n<p>But that initial idea is probably not the right one to make into a product. It’s really easy and feels really good to move forward on the first idea presented (especially if it’s yours), but you have to verify that it matches more than one dimension of what the customer wants.</p>\n<p>Map your solution idea to the opportunities you find by analyzing the market and your customers. The act of identifying and drawing the map is a reminder of the customer’s actual needs and mitigates the risk of teams running with an idea and forgetting about the preferences of the people they’re building the solution for in the first place.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Map many solutions.</li>\n<li>Generate tons of ideas.</li>\n<li>Mash them together and pull them apart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s how you find the idea that sticks out as the true solution and the viable product for your customers.</p>\n<h3>&#x200d;Break Your Team out of Their Silos</h3>\n<p>Everyone on your team specializes in something:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li>Marketing</li>\n<li>Designing</li>\n<li>Coding</li>\n<li>Selling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your team&#8217;s specializations, they’re expected to perform the function of their role without assuming the tasks or responsibilities of anyone else’s role &#8211; a buzzing hive of perfectly divided labor. You’ll need all hands on deck when figuring out which product to make.</p>\n<p>Encourage teams to pull everyone out of their silos and come together during product discovery to leverage each other’s perspectives and unique knowledge.</p>\n<p>It’s also helpful to get everyone’s opinion on what product to move forward with building, first. The type of heavy collaboration this involves isn’t easy.</p>\n<p>There will be plenty of disagreements and arguments, but if you can work past them, you’ll tend to develop better products that your entire organization believes in &#8211; inspiring them to work even harder to make the product as perfect for the customer as they can.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/24/5-product-discovery-tips-for-building-solutions-customers-will-buy/\">5 Product Discovery Tips for Building Solutions Customers Will Buy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:01:05 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy.jpg","linkMd5":"2e7389a661b494968a1eb3514502e572","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-24-324_8689c06fc00920ca.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy.jpg","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":762,"sourceBytes":175820,"destBytes":87526,"author":"Joe Martin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tips-for-Building-Solutions-Customers-Will-Buy-300x179.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-11-583_15ba9c7ee7ebc22b.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/technology-and-business.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-14-988_da049279b80d6e6c.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/employee-engagement.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-21-519_ce8f2b217c4f65cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195875109},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:57","title":"Can AI Be Fairer Than a Human Judge in the Judicial System?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171218","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/14/can-ai-be-fairer-than-a-human-judge-in-the-judicial-system/\" title=\"Can AI Be Fairer Than a Human Judge in the Judicial System?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge--300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"AI as a robot judge\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge--300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge--260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge-.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Artificial intelligence has become an integral part of everything from <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/23/can-artificial-intelligence-replace-the-role-of-doctors/\">medical diagnostics</a> technology to systems that analyze electoral candidates and provide accurate information to voters.</p>\n<p>However, there are still many AI skeptics, and especially those who question <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/03/07/ais-role-driving-sales-experience/\">the role of AI</a> in the justice system. Many legal leaders and institutions are curious about the efficiency benefits AI brings to the field. But the big question is: can AI help make the judicial system fairer?</p>\n<h2>The current landscape.</h2>\n<p>Many claim that the <a href=\"https://home.ubalt.edu/shapiro/rights_course/Chapter2text.htm\">United States&#8217; judicial system</a> is one of the most robust in the world. It has a Judicial Commission responsible for dictating policies to other federal courts.</p>\n<p>The Judicial body is made up of the president of the Supreme Court and 26 judges who represent the authority figures in courts, corresponding to courts of the first instance and the federal courts of appeal.</p>\n<p>The U.S also has a state judicial system so that each state can focus on its own cases based on state law.</p>\n<p>Each of these structures has a role in the United States judicial system, and each player knows what he or she has to do within it. However, due to the vastness of these systems, information management is cumbersome, especially when judges must decide which cases to attend and which aspects of the law they must take into account.</p>\n<h2>Error cases.</h2>\n<p>The American justice system is not without flaws, and a number of cases have exposed them.  Judges have condemned innocent people because the information used to convict them was imprecise and poorly analyzed.</p>\n<p>One such case concerns a man named Richard Anthony Jones, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/kansas-doppelganger-richard-jones.html\">who spent almost two decades in jail for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit. </a>His crime: having facial features similar to those of a criminal. Despite finding no evidence or DNA matches that conclusively identified Jones as the robber, several witnesses identified him after police showed them a series of photographs.</p>\n<h2>The failure of the judicial system.</h2>\n<p>Seventeen years later, the justice system managed to identify Anthony&#8217;s “double,” a man who actually committed the robbery that Jones served time for. The &#8220;other&#8221; man, nicknamed &#8220;Ricky,&#8221; fled, but witnesses identified Jones &#8212; who bore an incredible resemblance to Ricky &#8212; as the guilty party.</p>\n<p>Once it was proven that the wrong man had been imprisoned, the judge confirmed that the procedures used in the original trial had not been the best. Jones was released, and as a &#8220;refund of his freedom,&#8221; he was offered a million dollars.</p>\n<h2>Will that money pay for 17 years of life in prison?</h2>\n<p>Craig Coley, 71, of Simi Valley, California, was also a victim of judicial inaccuracy and remained in jail for 38 years after he was mistakenly accused of the murder of his former partner and son in 1978.</p>\n<p>Coley was released in November 2017 after DNA tests showed that he was not linked to the case. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47355907\">He received $21 million in compensation</a>.</p>\n<h2>What can AI do for the judicial system?</h2>\n<p>As we can see, weaknesses in both human memory and the judicial system can lead to a person being wrongly imprisoned for decades on the basis of flimsy evidence.</p>\n<p>These obvious weaknesses <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/03/ais-man-behind-the-curtain/\">are where AI comes in</a>. Algorithms and machine learning-based tools can collect any volume of information, analyze evidence, and help identify people. Thanks to AI technology, patterns, and anomalies &#8212; such as the inconsistencies in the DNA of Jones and Coleigh – might have been quickly and accurately identified. The cases could have been classified and written sooner.</p>\n<p>Likewise, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/11/evolving-relationship-between-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data/\">big data</a> can also help analyze crimes, since data can come not only from private sources such as the police but also from public sources on the web. Algorithms can detect various correlations and patterns, and meticulously analyze extensive data sets.</p>\n<p>Big data can be a great help in court trials all over the country in real-time and help assess the individual performance of judges.</p>\n<p>But not everything about AI is rosy.</p>\n<h2>AI error biases.</h2>\n<p>AI-based <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/12/history-of-facial-recognition-technology-and-its-bright-future/\">facial recognition systems</a> can monitor and recognize defendants. AI can support sentencing and bail decisions, and train <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/12/when-it-comes-to-neural-networks-weve-only-scratched-the-surface/\">neural networks</a> to help better assess the evidence.</p>\n<p>However, AI technology is constantly evolving, and some judicial entities have applied facial recognition systems that proved to be less-than-precise identity verification tools.</p>\n<p>Details such as skin color, facial features can wrongly identify an innocent person as guilty. This has happened in recent tests of Rekognition, Amazon&#8217;s facial recognition technology, which is being used by official entities in the United States.</p>\n<h2>The future of AI in the judicial system.</h2>\n<p>Although there is still a long way to go before the U.S. has a model judicial system that incorporates artificial intelligence, some observers believe that goal is getting closer.</p>\n<p>In Australia, a team of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/25/is-artificial-intelligence-racial-bias-being-suppressed/\">artificial intelligence experts</a> and lawyers has begun to develop the Split-Up system, which uses use rule-based reasoning and neural networks to predict the results of property disputes in divorces and other family law cases.</p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is implementing a &#8220;Predictive Crime Map,&#8221; which uses Big Data to pinpoint <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/11/online-id-verification-a-primer-for-fintech-businesses/\">areas that are most prone to crime</a>.</p>\n<p>The United States has also applied the power of Big Data in several cities. In Los Angeles, it helped reduce robberies and violent crimes by 10% to 30%.</p>\n<h2>In Estonia, the future is already here.</h2>\n<p>Estonia is one of the most innovative countries in the field of AI. There, artificial intelligence is much more than a tool that will help optimize and improve the judicial system. The country is betting on making AI the judge, and not just the tool.</p>\n<p>The Estonian case raises and develops the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/can-ai-be-fair-judge-court-estonia-thinks-so/\">idea that robots can act as virtual judges</a>.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that this AI program raises robot judges who can make decisions in minor cases. A <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/11/ai-startups-need-data-and-the-government-needs-help/\">robot judge for small cases</a> would undoubtedly help manage paperwork, decision-making and make judicial services much more efficient.</p>\n<p>Ott Velsberg, the Estonian government’s Chief Data Officer, was tasked with designing an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/21/3-tech-solutions-that-will-help-you-survive-baby-boomer-brain-drain/\">AI tool to deal with backlogged</a> court cases. The tool he came up with analyses the documentation presented by the parties and issues a judgment.</p>\n<p>In this way, Estonia seeks to deal with dozens of cases that judges and court clerks cannot currently deal with.</p>\n<p>Despite being a country of 1.3 million people, Estonia has made great advances in AI that are helping to automate government functions. Maybe other countries will follow suit if Estonia has success in this area.</p>\n<p>As expected, advances in AI have reduced the number of government jobs. However, Estonia has also developed an application that feeds the CVs of laid-off workers into a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/10/why-multicultural-marketing-needs-machine-learning-and-facial-tracking/\">machine learning system</a> that matches their skills with employers’ needs.</p>\n<p>Using AI and Machine Learning together is a great tool to help workers to land new jobs that align with their skill set.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/14/can-ai-be-fairer-than-a-human-judge-in-the-judicial-system/\">Can AI Be Fairer Than a Human Judge in the Judicial System?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 14 May 2020 21:00:38 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge-.jpg","linkMd5":"a88e65f9e7045d643838cfaea01a3711","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-19-466_224676644cbfae30.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge-.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":44700,"destBytes":39148,"author":"Rana Rajput","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Can-AI-Be-Fairer-Than-a-Human-Judge--300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-18-910_b11d417f37e7b2d4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195877196},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"What Can Your Company Learn from Fast-Growing Startups?","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=168052","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/11/what-can-your-company-learn-from-fast-growing-startups/\" title=\"What Can Your Company Learn from Fast-Growing Startups?\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"fast growing companies\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Startup businesses continue to find creative ways to evolve rapidly and <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/10/why-multicultural-marketing-needs-machine-learning-and-facial-tracking/\">adapt to market changes</a> with limited resources.

Such ways allow them to spread out their <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/18/how-to-bootstrap-your-startup-for-years-without-funding/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">already limited resources</a> without sacrificing overall growth.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will discuss the top five ways that your company can learn from fast-growing startups, companies as well as some actionable tips to take them to the next level.</p>\n<h2><b>5 Innovative Tips from Startups for Growing Companies</b></h2>\n<h3><b>1. Streamline Communications</b></h3>\n<p>High-profile startups like GitLab, InVision, Zapier, Buffer, and Basecamp are choosing to build remote-first teams. The number of people working remotely in the United States has risen by nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80 percent</a> between 2005 and 2012. And the trend continues to grow.</p>\n<p>The benefits of a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/05/remote-working-culture-the-facts-business-owners-need-to-know/\">remote-first workforce</a> are clear. Although there’s one huge caveat. For a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/22/the-boundaryless-era-the-time-for-distributed-teams/\">distributed team</a> to be successful, you must streamline communications.</p>\n<p>Streamlining communications includes internal communication with team members and external communication with clients, suppliers, and stakeholders. Businesses that don’t have a solid communication plan and tools to streamline it will struggle with growing and scaling.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the risks of miscommunication and misinterpretation can result in project delays. They can even hurt sales and customer relationships over the long term.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you can keep the lines of communication open and even streamline communication across multiple channels and applications.</p>\n<p>For the majority of companies, email remains the main source of external communications. With the right tools in hand, you can turn email into the teamwork hub. While bringing together internal and external communications, you can also let each team member work from a preferred platform, whether it’s Gmail, Slack, or Trello.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Minimize Resource Waste</b></h3>\n<p>Many larger businesses make the all-too-common mistake of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/29/the-5-most-common-pr-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/\">wasting resources</a>. Mainly time, money, tools, and even talent. Proper resource allocation is a common challenge among many businesses today.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, many businesses purchase software or subscribe to the newest, shiniest platform or tool only to discover that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/13/startup-essentials-stop-overcomplicating-your-processes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">communication and processes became more complicated</a> rather than easier. Many businesses don’t end up using those tools to the full extent, which ends up being a waste of money.</p>\n<p>Large companies can learn from <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/17/teach-me-10-things-about-running-a-successful-crowdfunding-campaign/\">fast-growing startups</a> too. Let’s take Buffer, for example, the San Francisco-based social media analytics and scheduling services company. It’s a small tech startup with a remarkable open-book policy. It has published its financial data since its inception in <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/magazine/201602/victoria-finkle/buffer-startup-spending-analysis.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2010</a>.</p>\n<p>To cut costs, Buffer closed its offices and moved to a distributed workforce. While it still pays for co-working space for the employees that want it, it’s still a significant saving to a physical office.</p>\n<p>Savings can be found throughout your business. For instance, before you sign up for the next latest and greatest software, consider your organizational goals. What are you trying to achieve?</p>\n<p>Then, find the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/19/software-pre-launch-checklist-6-things-you-have-to-do/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tools and resources that help you achieve those goals</a>. In the easiest and most cost-effective way possible. Remember, tools and platforms are designed to help support your existing workflow. And not to find workarounds to fit the tool.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Build an Agile Culture</b></h3>\n<p>Many companies today—both small and large—are realizing the benefits of organizational agility. Building an agile organizational culture has proven to help improve collaboration, encourage design thinking, and spark innovation.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.stateofagile.com/#ufh-i-521251909-13th-annual-state-of-agile-report/473508\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">State of Agile Report</a>, the reasons cited for adopting an agile culture include accelerating software delivery, increased productivity, and a reduction in costs.</p>\n<p>The adoption of an agile culture is the secret to adapting, evolving, and maintaining a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced market. And more and more companies of various shapes, sizes, scope, and industries are beginning to understand that.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/project-managers-playing-larger-role-in-organizational-agility/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">53 percent</a> of executives claim that they are hyper-focused on building organizations that embrace change.</p>\n<p>Building an agile culture involves adopting innovative techniques and practices. Specific standards will encourage and support collaboration, new ideas, creative thinking and problem-solving, adaptable work styles, and flexible work environments.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Break Down Silos</b></h3>\n<p>Silos are by-products of a working model far less cross-functional than today’s needs. The individual work structures pose many risks to companies, including increasing work, decreasing productivity, and even duplicating work efforts.</p>\n<p>However, startups have worked to break down work silos. Instead of working individually, teams can work together on similar projects and initiatives, by <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/09/the-top-work-operating-systems-of-2020/\">adopting a more collaborative</a>, agile work environment and atmosphere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/7-teamwork-trends-that-will-impact-your-business/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cultivating a collaborative work environment</a> can help ensure that all team members are aware of what others are working on. It can also help complete tasks and projects faster to grow further and even speed up the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Leveraging certain communication tools and project management platforms can allow companies to break down work silos and improve collaboration. Regular project iterations or “sprints” are also helpful.</p>\n<h3><b>5. Leverage Automation</b></h3>\n<p>Time is another limited resource for businesses. Therefore, any technique or tool that can be implemented to make performing tasks easier will help minimize the amount of resource waste.</p>\n<p>The best way to do this is to build automation or leverage AI capabilities. Like those specific tasks and projects can function on “autopilot.” Taking a few minutes to set up automation to streamline certain tasks can save hours of time.</p>\n<p>Leveraging automation can be a massive time-saver for companies. Automated tools can save team members time, reduce labor costs, reduce risks, increase efficiency and productivity, and reduce waste.</p>\n<p>The good news is that automation-powered tools don’t require having a full-time tech department or a team of developers to implement and support.</p>\n<p>For example, Gmelius offers a wide range of tools that can continue with other tools to help build automation. The tools are a way each member of a team can get work done without constantly switching from platform to platform to perform tasks.</p>\n<h2><b>Growth Is a Mindset</b></h2>\n<p>As an established business, you might have a plan for how to grow your company. However, it is likely that by learning from fast-growing startups there is some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/04/startups-dont-need-to-be-revolutionary-they-need-to-be-different/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">room for change</a> that just might make growth much more achievable.</p>\n<p>All in all, many small businesses and startups have gotten creative in how they <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/15/it-project-management-a-love-affair/\">manage teams</a>, projects, and processes. It ensures that they extend all their resources as much as possible without incurring budget overruns.</p>\n<p>Many have also adopted new leadership and management techniques to encourage high-level innovative thinking that allows them to further grow, scale, and reach their goals.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/11/what-can-your-company-learn-from-fast-growing-startups/\">What Can Your Company Learn from Fast-Growing Startups?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 18:00:29 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups.jpg","linkMd5":"f637479c1f5b43fa2912d7147d71fbfe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-09-662_1b049e298bb9e85a.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":51181,"destBytes":43312,"author":"Ermias Giovanni","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/What-Can-Your-Company-Learn-from-Fast-Growing-Startups-300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-10-737_b508bcaecf7f963b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195880667},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:49","title":"The 7 Best Treadmills for Home (2020)","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=173781","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/08/the-7-best-treadmills-for-home-2020/\" title=\"The 7 Best Treadmills for Home (2020)\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020-300x185.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"best treadmills\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020-300x185.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020-260x160.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020.png 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Hopefully, you are here it is because you are aware of the importance of exercise for your health, both current and future. You also probably know that in addition to moving around a lot and doing some cardio, it&#8217;s essential that you train with strength exercises. Here are the seven best treadmills for your home in 2020.</p>\n<h2>One of the best selling fitness gadgets for home: the treadmill.</h2>\n<p>Why is a treadmill so popular? Because it allows you to have the mobility that your body needs without leaving the house, and it enables intense training when the weather abroad is not adequate. With the advent of COVID-19, this gadget could be one of the best purchases you can do for yourself.</p>\n<p>If you are also thinking about buying one, then don’t forget to use <a href=\"https://mesheble.com/amazon-promo-code-20-off/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener noreferrer\">Amazon coupon codes</a> to save more on your purchase, you probably have these concerns right now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The treadmill you choose is of the highest quality and does not give problems in a few days.</li>\n<li>How to know what things to look for to choose the best treadmill for the use you are going to give it.</li>\n<li>Find the latest technology to take advantage of the power of Apps so fashionable.</li>\n<li>Get a design is integrated as one more element in your house.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>4 things to consider before choosing the best treadmill</b></h2>\n<p><b>Size and density of the running area</b></p>\n<p>The density running area is the place where you step every time you walk or run. If you are a tall person, you want it to be as large as possible so that it contains your stride when running.</p>\n<p>Also, you must have a cushioning system so that your joints do not suffer.</p>\n<h4><b>Speed and slope</b></h4>\n<p>Depending on the intensity at which you are going to train, you want it to reach more or less speed. Some tapes go up to 20 km/h, although the normal speed is about 15 km/h.</p>\n<p>It is also vital to increase the difficulty of the training that you can vary the slope. Some allow it electronically and others manually.</p>\n<h4><b>Maximum weight</b></h4>\n<p>Find yourself a tape that has a maximum weight that they support. Most of them reach 120 Kg. That number may seem like a lot to you, but sometimes it is good for them to support that weight or more if we want to complicate the training with load (weight).</p>\n<p>If your weight is close to 100 Kg, I recommend that you choose one that supports at least 110 Kg.</p>\n<h4><b>Integration with Apps</b></h4>\n<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that Apps help improve performance by monitoring your progress.</p>\n<p>If you have the option to measure your workouts, you will likely improve and force yourself to train. Also, many current Apps allow you to compete in real-time with other users or run while watching the recording of a popular race, elements that serve to motivate you more.</p>\n<h2><b>Review of the seven best treadmills</b></h2>\n<p>After analyzing all the models and comparing information from all kinds of users, these are the seven best treadmills I have found.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><b> Sportstech F10</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173791 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7t-297x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7t-297x300.png 297w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7t-158x160.png 158w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7t.png 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" /></p>\n<p>If you are not a tall or heavy person, you want a treadmill or jogging at moderate intensity, and you like technology, the Sportstech F10 interests you.</p>\n<p>This model is designed for people who want to do maintenance workouts at moderate or low intensities. However, it is capable of daily use.</p>\n<p>According to the users who use it, its motor is silent, so you could use it at any time without fear of disturbing the neighbors.</p>\n<p>Its power of 750 W is rather low, but it allows it to reach 10 Km / h. Although the manufacturer specifies a maximum weight of 120 Kg, I recommend that you do not exceed 90 Kg, since you would notice some vibration.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, because its running surface is relatively small (101 x 34.5 cm), it is intended for people not too tall (&#60;175 cm). Of course, the five layers of padding of this surface stand out for the protection of joints and knees.</p>\n<p>It has a front panel with an LCD screen that shows the time, distance, speed, calories, and heart rate. It also includes a tablet holder and two bottle holders.</p>\n<p>Lastly, like other Sportstech models, it supports Kinomap technology to simulate real racing through a Smart TV, which tends to motivate you to train more often.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p><b>The best</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kinomap technology to simulate real racing.</li>\n<li>Silent, ideal to run at any time without disturbing.</li>\n<li>Multi-layered running surface to protect joints.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Worst</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not suitable for intense daily use.</li>\n<li>Not recommended for tall and heavy people.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><b> DeskFit DFT200</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173790 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6t-300x273.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6t-300x273.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6t-176x160.png 176w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6t.png 444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>The DeskFit DFT200 is for you if you are looking for a stylish treadmill for walking or running at very low speed, that you can easily store, for low-intensity use or to walk while working.</p>\n<p>Its running surface is not very large, so it is designed for people with small strides. It is one of the most compact on the market, 17 cm wide when folded. You can store it under the sofa, bed, or even leaning against the wall, with a bracket that includes.</p>\n<p>Think that it is not designed for big races? The treadmill reaches a maximum speed of 7.1 Km/h &#8212; so its use is more in line with fast walking than running.</p>\n<p>It does not have an LCD screen, but you can connect a tablet with a specific App to see distance, calories, speed, and other data in real-time. You can place the tablet on plastic support that includes the machine.</p>\n<p>In short, it is a machine that can come in handy to use in confined spaces and to store very quickly when you finish using it.</p>\n<p><b>The best</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perfect if you have little space and want to save the tape when finished using it.</li>\n<li>Modern and elegant design.</li>\n<li>Advisable to walk while you work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Worst</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Somewhat high price for the benefits it has.</li>\n<li>Not recommended for running at high speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><b> Fit-Force </b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173789 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5t-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5t-300x300.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5t-160x160.png 160w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5t.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>The Fit Force is for you if you want an inexpensive treadmill for daily use at a maintenance-free rate without high pretenses.</p>\n<p>The treadmill has more than adequate power and an excellent running speed (15 km/h). The running surface is enough for you to use, even if you are a tall person (&#62; 180 cm).</p>\n<p>One of the features that most highlight the users who have tried it is the low noise it emits when using it. It is ideal if you want to run very early or at night so as not to disturb.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a foldable treadmill, although don&#8217;t expect miracles. Its folding position is not too compact; it can be used to leave it in a corner so that it does not disturb but not under a bed or in a closet (unless it is very large).</p>\n<p>Its LCD screen is made of rather basic materials and measures: calories, running time, distance traveled, heart rate and running speed. Pulsations are measured by sensors on the grip horns.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind something: it is not a high-end treadmill, far from it.

It is true that its engine does not make as much noise as others in the same range, but do not expect something extremely quiet.</p>\n<p>Its running surface is one of the widest on the market, which will make running comfortable regardless of your height. In addition to having 5 layers of padding to cushion the impact of the joints.</p>\n<p>It is a tape to use every day and gives it a smooth start. Although its motor is not as powerful as the F31 (it is 1500 W), it reaches the same speed of 16 km / h.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for something that makes you work at a high intensity, you have to know that this model has no option to vary the slope. This limitation has a purpose: that it is easy to fold and compact.</p>\n<p>What leaves this treadmill open-mouthed is its folding, being one of the most compact on the market (159.5 x 74.5 x 21 cm). You can store it in tight places like inside a closet, under a table, or behind the door.</p>\n<p>How about your maintenance? You have to lubricate it yourself with a bottle of Vaseline that it brings (like this one ), it is not done automatically as it happens with other models. It is applied to the sides under the tape (check the manual to make sure you do it right).</p>\n<p>As it could not be otherwise, it is also compatible with Kinomap, so you can run watching real racing simulations and even compete with other users.</p>\n<p>It is true that it is a heavy belt (about 55 Kg), but it has wheels that facilitate its movement.</p>\n<p><b>The best</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super compact, ideal for storing and taking up little space.</li>\n<li>Kinomap technology to simulate real racing.</li>\n<li>5-layer running surface to protect joints.</li>\n<li>Wide running surface, ideal for any height.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Worst</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slope adjustment is missing.</li>\n<li>Price not suitable for all budgets.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b>Sportstech F31</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173787 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3t-300x219.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3t-300x219.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3t-219x160.png 219w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3t.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want a high-end treadmill for daily use, with variable slope, with technology to simulate real environments and you have no budget problems, the Sportstech F31 is a perfect option.</p>\n<p>The F31 is one of the queen ribbons in its category. The reason is that it works for almost all users (tall, short, heavy, or lighter) who want exceptional performance.</p>\n<p>The machine is prepared to give you a lot of cane (about 3000 W of power), but you will not notice excessive noise to have so much power.</p>\n<p>You can use it daily without problems at a high intensity. It allows you to reach 16 km/h, but what makes the difference isIts tilting slope! You can regulate it up to a 15% slope, ideal if you want to add extra difficulty to your career.</p>\n<p>One of the things you love the most about the tape is its Kinomap compatible App, where you can make real routes and watch recordings of other routes on a TV to do them from home.</p>\n<p>Also, for Android and IOs, you have the SmartTreadmill App with which you will collect your training data (time, calories, duration, etc.).</p>\n<p>It is not a compact machine, so there would be no point in buying it if you plan to move it around often. Dimensions are 153 x 72 x 130 cm in use and 96 x 72 x 130.4 cm folded.</p>\n<p>Another differential point is its 6-layer padding: the running area has different layers of padding to protect the joints and knees.</p>\n<p>Its 5.5-inch screen and high-quality speakers are the icing on the cake for a machine with many positive points. It measures the usual, but, in addition, the tape comes with a band to measure the pulsations.</p>\n<p>The installation is quite simple, and it will not take you more than one hour.</p>\n<p>What maintenance does it have? You just have to add a liquid that the manufacturer will give you before starting to use the tape, in case it had not been shipped from the factory. And then you should replace it every 50 hours approx.</p>\n<p>The price is considerable and not suitable for all budgets, which is why it has the benefits it has, and its after-sales service is so impeccable, they go out of their way to solve any problem.</p>\n<p><b>The best</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-quality LCD screen.</li>\n<li>Kinomap technology to simulate real racing.</li>\n<li>Very quiet for the power it has.</li>\n<li>Good running surface, ideal for tall people.</li>\n<li>Impeccable after-sales service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Worst</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price suitable for few pockets.</li>\n<li>Not recommended if you want to move it from one side to another often.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b> BH Fitness iBoxter</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173786 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2t-300x294.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2t-300x294.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2t-164x160.jpg 164w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2t.jpg 697w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>If you are looking for a professional treadmill (lose fat, prepare a marathon), that reaches high speeds to give it intense daily use, the BH Fitness iBoxter is a candidate to consider.</p>\n<p>The BH brand is one of the most recognized in terms of gym equipment, both for stationary bikes and treadmills. Buying a BH brand tape is usually synonymous with quality and durability.</p>\n<p>If you need a top-quality treadmill and you are sure that you will give it full daily use, the BH is among the most reliable. It has an extra-wide running surface so that you can run very comfortably regardless of your height or weight.</p>\n<p>It is one of the fastest speeds (up to 20 km / h) and has an electronic slope regulation system that reaches up to 12%.

Nowadays and more with so many things that we see on the Internet it is easy for us to fall into a sedentary life that keeps us glued to a sofa and even that we hardly go out on the street for another walk that is not going to work, class or responsibilities of daily life, a treadmill is an ideal device that helps us break that habit and acquire another that will give us health and good quality of life, but what exactly benefits does the treadmill give us ? .</p>\n<p><b>It makes us feel good and motivate us to improve ourselves.</b></p>\n<p>After exercising, we secrete three hormones, among them dopamine, a hormone linked to addictions that makes us experience a pleasant sensation after exercise. It is the one that makes us begin a habit &#8212; our body becomes addicted to this substance, and we drive to do more and more.</p>\n<p>The faster we gain an actual habit, the better and the activity will hook us. By segregating dopamine, we also reduce the concentration of tobacco, drugs, and sugar that even causes dental caries with the additional expense.</p>\n<p><b>It gives us a feeling of happiness.</b></p>\n<p>The second hormone that we secrete called endorphin, the best known of all, makes us feel happy, happy and in certain euphoric cases, it works as a natural pain reliever that reduces anxiety and stress.</p>\n<p>The release comes as soon as the exercise is finished, and it is gradually lost, it also acts as the dopamine that motivates us to want more and get on the treadmill another day.</p>\n<p><b>It helps us sleep better.</b></p>\n<p>The third is serotonin, a substance that influences our mood after exercising; it gives us a feeling of calm that makes us feel happier and helps especially against depressive states, it is <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/01/how-exercise-can-help-you-sleep-better/\">what makes us sleep better</a>, and let&#8217;s eat better.</p>\n<p>We have to keep in mind that you have to practice exercise a few hours before the time we go to sleep since first, we will feel a tremendous high of well-being and later our muscles will relax, the hormones will be lost, and then It is when we will notice the fatigue of the exercise that will help us sleep much better.</p>\n<p><b>It is a perfect way to lose weight and control it.</b></p>\n<p>The treadmill is very comfortable to exercise, we have it at home, and it is easy to find some free time a day to walk or run, perhaps at first, it will cost us, and some may hurt the whole body (pay attention to the warm-up).</p>\n<p>But then little by little our body will begin to segregate the three hormones mentioned in greater proportion, and it will get used to the movements, to the point that it will be a routine for us and at times we cannot do it because we are busy or not be at home and we have that monkey to be able to do some exercise.</p>\n<p>If we propose it and take a routine continuously taking care of our diet, especially avoiding binging to eat after getting off the treadmill, it is easy to lose weight naturally so that the body is able to stylize our It figures as you burn fat, thus avoiding that loose meat.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, we can increase the time or the difficulty to gain more muscle mass or maintain ourselves. The most recommended is to do it before a meal of the day, because after exercising, even if we feel more hungry, our body will be full of energy, which makes our metabolism work much faster and the body absorbs less fat.</p>\n<p><b>We will feel that we have more energy.</b></p>\n<p>One of the problems of sedentary life is feeling tired, no matter how little we do our body feels tired due to little activity, and it is something that must be stopped as it is responsible for more deaths than the overweight itself, imagine in the case of both!</p>\n<p>By developing more muscles and keeping them active, our body will have much more resistance and strength, we will tire much less, and therefore we will take better advantage of the day to do everything.</p>\n<p>They say that life is short and spending it sitting is a shame when we can do everything we like but also in a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/12/how-health-literacy-is-decoding-the-human-longevity-mystery/\">healthier way and making more use of time</a>.</p>\n<p><b>It helps us prevent diseases and ailments.</b></p>\n<p>Actions such as walking on the treadmill help our body to have a much stronger immune system, which will prevent diseases, and it is enough to have a cold in the winter or every two by three, make your body more resistant.</p>\n<p>By producing <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/17/4-effective-ways-to-manage-work-stress/\">endorphins, we will better control stress and anxiety</a>, in addition to taking away feelings like depression. It helps us to have stronger joints and bones to avoid osteoporosis and tendinitis, in addition to preventing diabetes and heart disease by improving blood pressure and reducing cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p>Customs such as <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/10/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-overworking-pain-with-backmate/\">sitting all day in front of the computer</a>, watching television or using overlockers or sewing machines, make the legs wear out due to the lack of movement and can lead to more ailments or problems even walking.</p>\n<p><b>We concentrate better.</b></p>\n<p>By giving us that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/01/goplus-treadmill-foldable-smart-exercise-equipment/\">feeling of general well-being</a> and avoiding feelings such as stress or anxiety, our brain is also rewarded in a secondary way. The activity will make us be able to concentrate better on the tasks to be carried out.</p>\n<p>If a person is carrying on poor quality of life and a poor diet, it is more difficult for them to remember certain things or study and think. Generally, an athlete is rewarded with a clear mind and strong body, which will help all throughout life.</p>\n<p><b>Healthy persons like to remember to keep a healthy body to have a healthy mind.</b></p>\n<p>There are runners who do not mind going out to train in adverse weather conditions, they are always ready to go running to get fresh air.</p>\n<p>For other people, it is not so easy, so they decide not to run, preferring to run comfortably on the treadmill undercover of their homes. Many people run at home, while others prefer to go to the gym to run on a treadmill.</p>\n<p><b>CORRECT USE OF THE TREADMILL</b></p>\n<p>Did you just buy a treadmill, and before you start practicing wondering how to use it correctly? Discover the benefits of this device and follow our tips to start the practice.</p>\n<p><b>WHY USE A TREADMILL?</b></p>\n<p>The treadmill is an effective calorie-burning device. You practice at home all year round, without depending on the weather. The treadmill is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A not inconsiderable advantage: running &#8230; at home and at your own pace!</li>\n<li>A long-term, lasting investment</li>\n<li>A solid material accessible to all to practice in complete safety, also recommended for re-education</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>THE RIGHT FIT</b></p>\n<p>A treadmill requires no specific adjustments other than speed and incline.</p>\n<p><b>THE CORRECT POSTURE</b></p>\n<p>To get off to a good start, focus on keeping your back straight or slightly leaning forward, reinforcing your abdominal waist. Indeed, strong and reinforced abs limit low back problems.</p>\n<p><b>THE RIGHT EXERCISE</b></p>\n<p>The treadmill offers a multitude of exercises: work as possible from the march, run at a moderate pace (jogging), or faster.</p>\n<p>The use of the incline also allows modifying the difficulty of the effort and makes some muscles work more, especially the glutes and thighs. The walk with a high incline provides greater comfort in the joints and in the back, burning up to four times more calories.</p>\n<p><b>THE TYPICAL SESSION</b></p>\n<p>To warm-up, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2009/10/05/healthywage-get-paid-to-jog-an/\">do some leg curls and stretches</a> (quads, hamstrings, calves).</p>\n<p>The first session begins with the march at the pace (between 4 and 6 km/h) that suits you best to familiarize yourself with the treadmill, then gradually increases speed.</p>\n<p>If you want to run, always think about lengthening the stride forward of the treadmill and especially adapting the speed of the treadmill to your rhythm and not the other way around.</p>\n<p><strong>THE FIRST FEW WEEKS, START WITH A 40 TO 60 MINUTE SESSION:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>10-15 minutes: warm up in fast gear or light race</li>\n<li>25-35 minutes: session body at a regular pace (approx. 70% of maximum heart rate)</li>\n<li>5-10 minutes: return to calm in fast gear or light race</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will gradually find a comfortable rhythm and sufficient resistance.</p>\n<p>THE FOLLOWING WEEKS, CHOOSE THE VARIATION (S) THAT SUITS YOU BEST:</p>\n<p>Progressively lengthens the duration of the session body to increase the duration.</p>\n<p>Reduce the warm-up phase to 5-10 min.</p>\n<p><b>Increase running speed</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the session body fractionation method: alternation of 6-12 blocks from 30 to 60 seconds varying the running speed (running or light/moderate or fast = higher than the normal running speed)</li>\n<li>Gradually increases the number of blocks</li>\n<li>Perform two to three sessions per week with a day of rest between the two.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>\n<p><b>Running on a treadmill, for or against?</b></p>\n<p>In order to determine whether the treadmill is good or bad, the evaluated runner&#8217;s technique must be taken into account, since such a thing cannot be said in general.</p>\n<p>If it is a runner with good technique in the race, the fact of running on the treadmill is not the best, since the impact that occurs is repetitive and on a completely smooth surface, so it is better not to use the tape if your running technique is really good. Unless there is no other option.</p>\n<p>Of course, running outdoors doesn&#8217;t compare to running on a treadmill. Outdoors the influence of the friction of the wind, the change in the terrain and the distractions are not the same, which varies the technique of every cyclist.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the running position is completely uniform throughout the treadmill workout. But in the case of not having a good running technique, it is not inadvisable to run on the treadmill to train, since training on these types of platforms also has its advantages.</p>\n<p>Among them is the ability to follow a constant rhythm, the scheduling of breaks, etc. Working with an incline and time is not a problem.</p>\n<p>There are many machines that exist in the current market that allow the athlete to create their own workouts, which can be an advantage for the runner. It also allows programming of the outputs, resulting in an improvement in technique.</p>\n<p><b>Does it have health consequences?</b></p>\n<p>The answer to this will depend on the technique and the physical condition of the athlete. Of course, the effort it takes to run on the treadmill is significantly less than that done outdoors.</p>\n<p>If a person starting to run has a running technique, the use of the treadmill is not recommended. That is, what is recommended in athletes who start in the race, must first work their technique and the force applied in the race. This is essential, but unfortunately, it is not common.</p>\n<p>When we start running and seek to improve the technique, it is frequent that the cufflinks and the soleus are heavily loaded, since the correct thing is that they do not come into contact with the ground and the heel, but with the forefoot.</p>\n<p>If it is the heel that makes contact, it has been shown in the different biomechanical studies that the impact on the knees is very high.</p>\n<p>The opposite occurs with the support in the metatarsal, in the forefoot or midfoot area that does not cause an overload in the joints, which also improves the race.</p>\n<p>However, at first, you are not used to it, and you usually load the lower part of the leg, as we have already mentioned. This will happen on the tape too. Keep in mind that the tape partially prevents reverse displacement, which causes some muscles to be used, such as the buttocks.</p>\n<p><b>Can running on the treadmill lead to injuries?</b></p>\n<p>This does not have to happen. Anyone who goes for a run if they do it with the correct technique should not be injured, both on a treadmill and on asphalt. Ideally, run on a surface that provides a certain level of cushioning, such as dirt or grass. Although not all people have this option, it would be the most recommended.</p>\n<p><b>How long should the training be on the treadmill?</b></p>\n<p>The maximum time has not been established, but the ideal is that the tape is not used for a long time, although it will depend on the needs of each one. Keep in mind that races are not on treadmills, the ideal thing is to go running and only do it on a treadmill when it is strictly necessary.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right training is necessary to achieve success in the races, establishing an adequate technique is essential. After that, it will be possible to know exactly whether or not it is advisable to run on the treadmill and, while the weather does not prevent it, the outdoor terrain is better.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/08/08/the-7-best-treadmills-for-home-2020/\">The 7 Best Treadmills for Home (2020)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 08 Aug 2020 15:00:10 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020.png","linkMd5":"949d055ece95e2ae4631c764dfc2ce8d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-23-884_0db5fc6e3990a356.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020.png","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":192711,"destBytes":14018,"author":"Selena Richard","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-7-Best-Treadmills-for-Home-2020-300x185.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-12-208_1650829e7df09838.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7t-297x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn88@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-16-160_4eb22c98c8133588.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/23/15-18-14-487_80ba72b7642bafbb.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6t-300x273.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-23-256_013644a041a98129.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5t-300x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/23/15-18-14-450_c563c67640cfca93.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4t-300x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-12-194_bcdf4cc3e25b11a8.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3t-300x219.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-16-055_8185f72c0e2501c4.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2t-300x294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/23/15-18-23-544_3f5543675bdcd600.webp","https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1t-300x287.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn32@2020_3/2020/08/23/15-18-19-993_59f61d644c41f836.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195869566},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:17:54","title":"Crisis versus Opportunity: 6 Ways to Bootstrap a Startup in a Post-COVID-19 World While Navigating the New Normal","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=171240","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/29/crisis-versus-opportunity-6-ways-to-bootstrap-a-startup-in-a-post-covid-19-world-while-navigating-the-new-normal/\" title=\"Crisis versus Opportunity: 6 Ways to Bootstrap a Startup in a Post-COVID-19 World While Navigating the New Normal\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup--300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"crises opportunity\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup--300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup--260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup-.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>Are you considering starting up your own business? The reality is that the world as we know it has changed. And, no one really knows what the future holds. Consequently, it is understandable that people, especially those who have either had to take a pay cut or have been furloughed. Therefore, the biggest challenge, apart from not contracting the virus, is how to generate enough money to meet your monthly budget during these tough times.</p>\n<p><em>                                    <strong>  “In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity.” – Albert Einstein</strong></em></p>\n<p>As the quotation highlighted above by Albert Einstein states, “in the middle of every crisis, lies an opportunity.” Thus, let’s start this discussion by defining the global crisis caused by the new coronavirus, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/05/11/5-digital-health-technologies-helping-to-stop-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">COVID-19</a>, so that we can look forward to finding the opportunity in the crisis.</p>\n<h2>Crisis versus opportunity: Setting the Scene</h2>\n<p>It is generally accepted that <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/22/how-to-ensure-data-privacy-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/\">the novel coronavirus, COVID-19</a>, was first seen in Wuhan, China, during the last days of 2019. This virus is a zoonotic virus. In other words, it was first seen in an animal like a bat, and it consequently jumped from an animal host to a human host. Once in its human host, COVID-19 mutated so that it could spread via person-to-person transmission.</p>\n<p>As an aside, there are instances where it seems as though the virus has jumped back to an animal host in the form of pet dogs and cats. However, it is believed that this occurred because the pet’s owner was infected with the virus. And, this scenario is really nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>Four months later, since the first cases observed as a consequence of human-to-human transmission, the virus has swept across the globe, causing untold health and economic damage in its wake. Current worldwide statistics as of 10 May 2020, (from gisanddata.maps) show that there are over 10 million people infected with this virus and just over 503, 500 deaths. Unfortunately, these numbers seem to be increasing rapidly without an end in sight.</p>\n<h4>One of the many challenges facing the world’s governments is the fact that no one really knows how this virus behaves.</h4>\n<p>There has never been a viral outbreak of such magnitude before. Thus, the world’s scientists, medical experts, and governments are in new territory, determining what works and what doesn’t work as each country moves through the peaks and troughs of this pandemic.</p>\n<p>There are, however, a few behaviors that the world’s scientists and medical experts have observed. The most important being that because this virus is spread via droplet infection from person to person, the best way of controlling and eradicating it is through social distancing or social isolation. In simple terms, people need to stay away from one another. Therefore, the world’s governments have issued varying degrees of lockdown or stay-at-home orders.</p>\n<h4>What this means is that the global economy has been paused while we wait for the virus to burn itself out.</h4>\n<p><strong>Secondly,</strong> this virus is highly contagious and causes a respiratory illness similar to pneumonia, resulting in the death of people who fall in the high-risk category.</p>\n<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, people can be asymptomatic carriers. In other words, they are infected with the virus but have no symptoms, so they spread the virus to other people without knowing they are infected.</p>\n<p><strong>Consequently, this pandemic has had and continues to have a negative impact on a macro-economic and microeconomic level.</strong></p>\n<p>It has also affected people’s mental, emotional, and physical health.</p>\n<p>Governor Cuomo, governor of New York State, USA, highlighted the quintessential issue with the coronavirus pandemic in his conversation with <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-guest-howard-stern-show\">Howard Stern on 13 April 2020</a>. He stated that not only are we fighting a virus, <em>&#8220;but we&#8217;re also fighting emotions on an individual level, on a collective level. People are frightened, they&#8217;re anxious, they&#8217;re stressed.&#8221;</em> This virus is unmatched. People are trapped at home, they are not getting a salary, and they are afraid to touch another person because no one knows who is and isn&#8217;t infected with the virus.</p>\n<p>As stated above, the economic impact across the globe has been devastating. The <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/05/10/a-devastating-jobs-report-for-older-workers/#3fbcc79c1e43\">US jobs report</a> released on Friday 8 May 2020 showed that the US has hit a depression-era unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/838085670/europes-economy-was-hit-hard-too-but-jobs-didn-t-disappear-like-in-the-u-s\">npr.org</a> website stated that 26 million people in the US have lost their jobs since early March 2020. The fundamental difference between the US, EU, and the UK is that the EU and the UK governments are paying a percentage of their workers’ salaries and their jobs will be available once the respective country’s economies start up again.</p>\n<h2>Finding the opportunity amidst the crisis</h2>\n<p>Therefore, the questions that must be asked and answered are what is the new normal and how do you utilize the “new normal” to earn an income? In summary, the biggest part of this answer is to find the opportunity in the crisis.</p>\n<p>Most of this discussion up till this point has been about the crisis caused by the global pandemic. And, while the socioeconomic devastation must not be underestimated, the question that begs is, how do people find the opportunity within the crisis.</p>\n<p>The first step in finding the opportunity within the crisis is to put measures into place to survive the crisis. The next step is to position yourself for economic sustainability (openminds.com &#8212; opportunity in adversity).</p>\n<h4>Following the government’s stay-at-home orders to the letter &#8212; practicing extreme social-distancing measures.</h4>\n<p>When you have to venture out to the shops, seek medical care, or to exercise once or twice daily &#8212; follow the guidelines. The guidelines are the way to survive this bizarre crisis. Together with these measures, it is vital to apply for any unemployment benefits that the government is offering.</p>\n<p>Once you have implemented these measures, the next step is to start investigating ways to “position yourself for economic sustainability.” In other words, you must start bootstrapping an <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/10/a-startup-guide-to-creating-an-ideal-customer-profile/\">online startup</a>, because the future of the global business world is online.</p>\n<p>The companies that have the greatest chance of surviving the global economic shutdown are the ones that have pivoted their business processes from the brick-and-mortar model to an online model. While it is true that this statement can be seen as a generalization, it is only relevant to companies that form part of the essential services industry. Otherwise, this statement is accurate for almost all of the other business organizations.</p>\n<h3>What is a startup?</h3>\n<p>Before we look at ways to bootstrap a startup, let’s consider a comprehensive definition of what a startup is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company\">Wikipedia.com</a> defines a <em>“startup company (startup or startup) is an entrepreneurial venture which is typically a newly emerged, fast-growing business that aims to meet a marketplace need by developing a viable business model around an innovative product, service, process, or a platform.”</em></p>\n<p>Additionally, <em>“a startup is usually a company designed to effectively develop and validate a scalable business model. Startups have high rates of failure, but the minority of successes include companies that have become large and influential.”</em></p>\n<h3>Ways to bootstrap a startup</h3>\n<p>Most importantly, the phrase “<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/bootstrap-startup/\">bootstrapping a startup</a>” translates into “growing your business with little or no venture capital or outside investment. It means relying on your own savings and revenue to operate and expand.”</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that while this is challenging to achieve, it is incredibly rewarding to do so. It is also important to realize that, statistically speaking, most startups become operational without any venture capital or external funding sources. And, most startup owners are also solopreneurs.</p>\n<p>Therefore, as a solopreneur (see: solopreneur institute dot com) let’s consider a case study as an example of the ways to get your startup up and running and into a profitable operation.</p>\n<h4>Let’s assume, for this article, that you are a part-time social media expert.</h4>\n<p>Consequently, you’ve decided to utilize this passion and expertise to collect and aggregate social media data from some of the popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, CrunchBase, and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Your data will be ordered and structured into information based on specific niches like engineering and construction, finance, technology, and business. The &#8220;raison d’etre&#8221; (the most important reason or the purpose for someone or something&#8217;s existence&#8230;) for your startup is to track consumer behavior based on their digital footprint, including likes and shares.</p>\n<h3>Partner with a professional business services company</h3>\n<p>A solopreneur is essentially an entrepreneur who does not hire any staff. All essential business services that are not part of the startup’s core function are usually subcontracted out. Thus, in our case study, the first step is to consult with a professional business services organization that specializes in company formation in Hungary to help you register a legal company.</p>\n<h3>Seek help from a mentor or advisor</h3>\n<p>The good news is that you are not the first solopreneur, nor will you be the last person to bootstrap a startup. Many experts in this field have developed tried and trusted methods and mechanisms to succeed at an entrepreneurial venture. And, they are often very willing to mentor or advise new entrepreneurs to ensure that they do not make the same mistakes and to ensure that their ventures are successful the first time around.</p>\n<h3>Draw up a budget</h3>\n<p>As highlighted above, the financial side of bootstrapping a business can be challenging. Thus, you must manage your available finances wisely. And, drawing up a budget that contains all of your fixed expenses, will help you keep a handle on your finances and assist in stripping out any non-essential costs.</p>\n<h3>Implement the “lean startup” philosophy</h3>\n<p>Eric Ries, the founder of <a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/principles\">theleanstartup.com</a>, states that the lean startup philosophy“provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get the desired product to customers&#8217; hands faster.”</p>\n<p>It is an agile principle, with an iterative method that gets a product or service to market without spending months or years in product development without consumer approval or disapproval. Product development also occurs in small iterations or changes. It starts with a base model and then evolves into the final edition or one that gains traction amongst its target audience.</p>\n<p>It’s vital to be aware of the fact that agile iterations are not random and haphazard. They are based on a combination of customer feedback and the startup’s core mission and aim.</p>\n<h3>Invest in your brand</h3>\n<p>Brand development is one of the most significant aspects of running a successful business. <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/06/20/how-to-brand-yourself-through-your-dedication-and-value/\">Your brand</a> is what attracts your target audience and helps convert them into returning customers. One of the most challenging things for any company, irrespective of whether it is an established business or a startup, is to convert consumers into loyal, returning customers. Consequently, it is essential not to skimp on brand development, for your brand is your startup’s voice.</p>\n<p>The good news is that, in the digital world, brand development does not have to cost an insane amount of money. The essential starting point is a good website that is usable and user-friendly, for this is where visitors to your site will answer the site’s Call-To-Action and convert.</p>\n<h3>Attract customers through content marketing</h3>\n<p>The Content Marketing Institute defines content marketing as the“<a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/09/digital-marketing-coronavirus/\">strategic marketing approach</a> focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience &#8211; and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.”</p>\n<h5>The following statistics show the value that brand marketers place on content marketing:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li> 42% of brand marketers report that their content marketing efforts are successful.</li>\n<li> 60% of all marketers create or contract a content writer to create at least one article per day.</li>\n<li> Year-on-year growth metrics in unique site traffic is 7.8 times higher for content market leaders than it is for followers. Therefore, it is vital to becoming a content marketing leader, not a follower.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By way of an example, guest post blogging &#8212; see my blog &#8212; snchatterjee.com/start-guest-blogging. My blog has some useful marketing strategies &#8211;that are designed to drive unique, authoritative traffic to the brand’s website.</p>\n<p>Your new increase in authority is one of the most highly rated signals that Google uses when ranking and indexing websites on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Therefore, when a consumer searches for the products and services that you offer, Google will return your brand’s website in the top three to five results on the SERP.</p>\n<h4>Final thoughts</h4>\n<p>One of the most challenging aspects of the post-COVID-19 world is that no one really knows what it will look like. There are several givens regarding the way forward. The global economy has simultaneously come to a halt. And no one is quite sure how and when the global corporate world will reopen for business.</p>\n<p>As Aswath Damodaran noted, in his YouTube chat with Noah Kagan titled, “NYU Finance Professor Explains This Financial Crisis,” the world has never been in this situation, so no one knows how easily the global economy will reboot.</p>\n<p>We will just have to wait and see what happens. Please don&#8217;t take the uncertainty as an excuse to sit back and do nothing.</p>\n<p>The takeaway phrase here should be &#8220;Carpe Diem&#8221; or &#8220;Seize the Day&#8221; and make the most of the opportunities found within the current crisis.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/06/29/crisis-versus-opportunity-6-ways-to-bootstrap-a-startup-in-a-post-covid-19-world-while-navigating-the-new-normal/\">Crisis versus Opportunity: 6 Ways to Bootstrap a Startup in a Post-COVID-19 World While Navigating the New Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 17:30:08 +0000","feedId":271,"bgimg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup-.jpg","linkMd5":"ef7a37d7ad6ca98fef99bea2ad18e0a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn92@2020_4/2020/08/23/15-18-09-698_34a537b20dbefe9c.webp","metaImg":"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup-.jpg","destWidth":825,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":36882,"destBytes":26728,"author":"Debraj Chatterjee","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Crisis-versus-Opportunity-6-Ways-to-Bootstrap-a-Startup--300x185.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/23/15-18-23-589_07f8c2a3e43be461.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598195874158},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 23:18:00","title":"Software Pre-Launch Checklist: 6 Things You Have to Do","link":"https://readwrite.com/?p=164821","description":"<div><a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/02/19/software-pre-launch-checklist-6-things-you-have-to-do/\" title=\"Software Pre-Launch Checklist: 6 Things You Have to Do\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do-300x214.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"software pre-launch checklist\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do-300x214.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do-900x643.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do-224x160.jpg 224w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Software-Pre-Launch-Checklist-6-Things-You-Have-to-Do.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></div><p>You’ve got a great idea, and you’re hoping to get the most money out of it. However, even with the best software package in the world, you won’t be earning much if you don’t follow a few basic pre-launch steps. Here is a software pre-launch checklist — six things you have to do.</p>\n<p>In today’s world, being well-prepared is everything.</p>\n<h3>Here is what you need to take care of in order to get the big bucks.</h3>\n<h2>Who’s Who</h2>\n<p>There are three factors you have to define:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/02/23/ai-learning-algorithms-find-your-new-target-groups/\">target audience</a> &#8212; who is the product for? How old are they? What do they do? Why do they want it? How is it going to satisfy their biggest need?</li>\n<li>Your competition &#8212; can you learn something from them? What do you have that they don’t?</li>\n<li>Yourself &#8212; define your image and your brand. Today, a well-defined brand makes or breaks a business. <a href=\"https://articles.bplans.com/the-4-keys-to-building-brand-loyalty-with-millennials/\">Millennials</a> are the most brand-loyal generation we&#8217;ve seen so far. Sure, the quality of the product is what makes the customers stay, but you have to attract them first.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Early Domain Bird</h2>\n<p>Think about the ideal name for your software and reduce the options to a couple. Conduct some <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/26/iot-the-buzzword-for-market-researchers/\">market research</a> to find out which name resonates best with your audience. Once that is done, hurry up and get your domain and site ready and working online.</p>\n<p>You should have your domain secured and be checking it off the list &#8212; even if the official launching day is still far away.</p>\n<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>\n<p>Quality assessment can be done in several ways. For example, you can outsource to a <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/29/qa-testing-manual-automated-or-crowdsourced/\">software testing</a> company to conduct manual testing of your product. You might discover that you’ve overlooked some details &#8212; or your targets may praise some qualities you didn’t think of promoting in your marketing campaigns. After testing, you&#8217;ll know the right things to put in your software.</p>\n<p>Testing is just one of many <a href=\"https://www.globalapptesting.com/blog/how-to-build-the-ultimate-qa-strategy\">QA strategies</a> that you could employ, and it’s not all about the customers or parts of your software. You should establish a <a href=\"https://www.globalapptesting.com/blog/4-ways-to-create-a-quality-culture-in-your-company\">quality culture</a> among your workers as well. Find ways how to motivate the employees to dedicate to delivering the highest quality.</p>\n<h2>Train the Team</h2>\n<p>Depending on the software you’re creating, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/ai-customer-service-will-save-you-money-but-it-might-cost-you-customers/\">informative client support </a>can represent the turning point. Some software options are taken for granted and customers mainly decide on the price and a couple of features offered.</p>\n<p>The big players, however, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/13/top-25-podcasts-designed-to-make-you-think-and-grow/\">wish to know much, much more</a>. Educate your team to be able to answer all the<em> impossible</em> questions. Your team deserves to know all the details, advantages, and downsides, in order to be able to provide the best arguments.</p>\n<h2>Marketing Matters</h2>\n<p>How can you attract new clients?</p>\n<p>Think <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/11/21/best-data-visualization-tools-for-2020-reviewed/\">special offers and free trials</a> to get the word out. But first, your software package must seem appealing. Work on your logo and employ the best designers. As we have said before, branding is extremely important. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/06/opinion/apple-logo/index.html\">Apple’s logo</a> is not just a lucky coincidence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fabrikbrands.com/font-psychology-and-typography-inspiration-in-logo-design/\">Font psychology</a> is nothing to be sneezed at. The shapes and colors send irrevocable messages.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Plan</h2>\n<p>Don’t wait to see how things turn out for you. Just like <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/10/16/design-product-with-consumer-privacy-in-mind/\">planning the launch</a>, you should also have a plan ready for everything that follows. Whether the sales go up or down, you should know how to react.</p>\n<p>For instance, if the sales are doing extremely well, how are you going to invest the money? Conversely, if the sales are down, you must have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/biggest-ways-technology-has-transformed-sales\">new sale techniques</a> ready in advance, or perhaps calculate the time needed to make alterations to the software package.</p>\n<h4>Final Words</h4>\n<p>As you can see, there’s a lot of work ahead of you. Get down to it, and start checking things off our list as soon as possible. Make sure you check all of the items on your list. Ask other people&#8217;s opinions and consider them.</p>\n<p>Have a solid business plan and follow it. Skipping a step can only backfire.

A technology that is one for the present and future, AI is playing a massive role in shaping businesses to the core. From healthcare and entertainment to commerce and sports, <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/12/23/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-transforming-the-financial-markets/\">Artificial Intelligence</a> is transforming every industrial vertical for good. Here is how artificial intelligence will change the world of sports.</p>\n<h3>Sports and Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Speaking of the sports industry itself, the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/04/artificial-intelligence-forecasts-for-2020/\">presence of AI today is to be seen</a> in just about every major league around the world. From NHL and NFL to NASCAR and NBA, AI has changed the way we think of the sports world today. Take an example of Northern Sports only, for instance. The industry crossed a staggering figure of $73.5 billion by the end of the year 2019.</p>\n<p>Okay &#8212; so, COVID-19 has caused a dent in the sports system &#8212; and a problem for sports. But we&#8217;ll get back on track! And, if you long to know more about how AI has impacted the sports world, here is a compiled, detailed list.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fun and interesting to understand how <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/11/evolving-relationship-between-artificial-intelligence-and-big-data/\">Artificial Intelligence will shape or change</a> the world sporting ecosystem around the world.</p>\n<h2>Ways AI will Change the Sports World</h2>\n<p>AI is changing the Sports world for good.</p>\n<h3>1. Enhancements in Recruitment Analysis</h3>\n<p>Be it soccer, basketball, baseball, or any other game, analyzing the performance data of players has been an age-long factor in determining whether a particular player will be successful at the club or not. Not only is the performance data analyzed for the recruitment of the players but also to determine the impact of a player mid-season.</p>\n<p>Now while these performance data aren’t as accurate and contain numerous loopholes, the integration of AI into this process is making it more reliable and easy. AI can now analyze all the historical data about a particular player in order to come with a conclusion about whether or not a player would have an impact on the club. This even helps in determining what should be the market value of the player in the transfer window.</p>\n<h3>2. Use of Deep Learning by AI in NASCAR</h3>\n<p>Nascar is one of the famed sports around the world watched by millions of people in the US alone. However, there’s a dark side to this sport. Since the year 1950, NASCAR has recorded an average of more than one death annually. So <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/03/10/is-ai-just-as-biased-as-the-humans-creating-it/\">in order to counter this problem</a>, AI has a vital role to play.</p>\n<p>With the help of deep learning, Artificial Intelligence is making use of the neural network that can identify a malfunction or kind of issue in the car much before the driver is at risk. Car AI is a technology that has been trained on a dataset to identify more than a thousand images of cars in multiple conditions and can be a boon in the world of NASCAR by making sure that the drivers are safe.</p>\n<h3>3. The Rise of Automated Journalism</h3>\n<p>Automated Journalism in the world of sports is now becoming a reality. Thanks to AI, an associated press like Minor League Baseball (MiLB) is now expanding its reach in journalism.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/01/10/how-ai-is-transforming-the-entertainment-industry/\">help of a platform called Wordsmith</a> that uses statistics and data to come with narratives using the natural language, the press is now able to cover 13 leagues and more than 140 teams affiliated with MLB.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;sporty&#8221; platform has brought a significant rise in the number of stories that the press is now able to cover. As per a report, this rise is a nearly 12-fold increase as compared to the press’ manual ways of reporting. Today, MiLB has covered more than 1500 such stories with the help of Wordsmith and AI. If you are a sports fan, like we all are &#8212; try it out.</p>\n<h3>4. The Role of AI in Coaching</h3>\n<p>Not only is AI transforming the way we play and cover sports, but it is also transforming the way the players are trained to play on the pitch. Coaches have now begun the use of AI in analyzing the areas where a particular player or the whole team lags behind.</p>\n<p>With the help of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/04/3-areas-of-your-business-where-deep-learning-can-make-a-difference/\">Artificial Intelligence, coaches around the world</a> can now analyze their own weaknesses as well. This has brought a drastic change in the way we think of traditional coaching methods. Today, there are minimal chances of any issues regarding the playing style of a team being overlooked by a coach.</p>\n<h3>5. Optimization of Fan’s Experience</h3>\n<p>Keeping the fans happy is one of the vital things for a league or club to do, and with the help of AI now, the experience of fans is bound to get better. Various teams from different leagues around the world have begun the use of <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/30/artificial-intelligence-can-improve-business-growth/\">AI-based chatbots</a> to answer the queries of fans.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Artificial Intelligence is being integrated to build algorithms that can customize the match highlights in different forms and lengths as per user preferences.</p>\n<h4>Summing Up</h4>\n<p>The world of sports offers ample <a href=\"https://readwrite.com/2020/04/18/growth-opportunities-available-during-and-after-pandemic-times/\">opportunities for technology to expand</a> its horizon. From deep learning systems ensuring the safety of players to a sports app development company (called appinventive dot com) creating apps that optimize fans’ experience. There is a lot to look forward to from Artificial Intelligence in the sports world.</p>\n<p>If you like this article and wish to share your views on the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence in
