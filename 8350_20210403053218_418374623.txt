During an outage, the Teams client switches to the SBA automatically and ongoing calls continue without interruptions and no user action is required. Once the Teams client identifies that network connectivity has been restored, normal call functionality is resumed, and any call data records are uploaded to the cloud. Organizations can now take advantage of Survivable Branch Appliance capabilities by following the step-by-step configuration guidance provided by their SBC vendor. \n   <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/direct-routing-survivable-branch-appliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Learn more\n   </A>\n  </P> \n  <P>\n   <span class=\"lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline\" image-alt=\"Survivable Branch Appliance 1.png\" style=\"width: 999px;\"><img src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/268524iC61205B743FEACCF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999\" role=\"button\" title=\"Survivable Branch Appliance 1.png\" alt=\"Survivable Branch Appliance 1.png\" /></span>\n  </P> \n  <DIV id=\"devices\"> \n   <P>\n    &nbsp;\n   </P> \n   <P>\n    <FONT size=\"5\">\n     <STRONG>\n      Devices\n     </STRONG>\n    </FONT>\n    <BR />We've have newly certified devices for Microsoft Teams this month from EPOS and Poly.\n   </P> \n   <P>\n    <BR />\n    <STRONG>\n     EPOS ADAPT 100 Series\n    </STRONG>\n    <BR />Headsets from EPOS help meet the need for increased collaboration and seamless user workflows as they transition from tasks to meetings.
