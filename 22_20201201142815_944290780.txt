I was in my early 20s with very little business experience, but I was inspired by the hardworking women who are the backbone of the global shea butter supply chain. I'm a first generation Ghanaian-American, so the lives of women in rural Ghana reflect the life of my mother, who immigrated to the US in the 1980s to give her kids a better future.&#160;</p><p>Every day, through my business, I challenge the societal limitations put on African women by connecting the producers of this amazing skin care product directly to our customers. Through ethically sourcing shea butter, cooperative members have the financial resources to invest in household needs, education for their kids, and other income-generating activities. Shea Yeleen is proof that women, when given access to the right opportunities, can become respected leaders in their families and their communities.</p>\n\t3.

I've been a journalist for a decade writing for publications like Forbes, Travel + Leisure, Men's Journal, and more. I realized there was no publication catering specifically to women of color and wanted to build an editorial platform that would represent us and tell our stories. In the future we will launch products in our categories (beauty, travel, style, and culture) that will also cater specifically to our audience to further fill a void.</p>\n\t7.

That failed before it even got off the ground.&#160;</p><p>While I was figuring out what to do next, I kept receiving calls from former coworkers asking me to come in and teach their companies how to do product management. I saw more and more companies struggling with how to do product well. I soon realized that this was a problem worth starting a company to solve. There was a problem in the market, and I knew how to solve it. Produx Labs was born six years ago, and now we're a team of over 15 people, with consulting services and online education.</p>\n\t8.

Getting free product placed on celebrities or panicking over a button emergency wasn't curing cancer.&#160;</p><p>On a life-changing trip to Africa, I was deeply impacted by the joyful, generous, hardworking people of Zimbabwe, but I was saddened by how little job opportunity there was for them to provide for their families. That set me on a mission to find a way to use fashion to create sustainable employment around the world, and now that is what we do by helping apparel and accessory brands find ethical factories for their manufacturing.</p><p>By shifting the supply chain in an ethical direction, we can grow those factories, and in turn grow dignified, sustainable job opportunities. I believe it is possible to create a 100% ethically-made fashion industry, and that is what drives me every day.</p>\n\t10.

I travel often, and while I love experiencing new places and cultures, I've found that trip planning is time-consuming and frustrating. Finding relevant, trustworthy recommendations is especially challenging. And I just thought, why is this process so broken? Travel planning should be a positive experience: you're getting ready to do something exciting!&#160;</p><p>After doing some research, I realized the current solutions are failing to meet the needs of today's modern traveler. I saw a gap in the market and the opportunity to build something better, so I decided to do something about it.</p>\n\t11.

My passion over the last decade has always been reading and helping authors share their stories with readers and people. I find that both fiction and nonfiction stories create positive change and a deeper understanding of our reality. A lot of our reality is shaped by the stories we read, from books to news articles to a friend's Facebook posts.</p><p>Stories in all of their forms are inspirational and can generate change. Throughout my career, authors kept following me online and asking for advice. Slowly I built up a following and decided to make the leap and start my own self-publishing company. I love what I do! My favorite part is helping authors develop their story into a book that sells, and I love hearing where their inspiration came from.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\t12.

Interestingly, Indonesia has seen growth in female-led businesses. Out of 60 million small-to-medium businesses in Indonesia, about 14 million were founded by women in 2019.&#160;</p><p>I kept pushing to make my dream happen. After about four years, I finally got a chance to finish my graduate degree and work in New York City. There I found like-minded females who weren't afraid or ashamed of pursuing their goals. Even though I started my life from zero, the 3.5 years of experience equal 10 years of knowledge at home. Right now I'm back in Indonesia, because I want to give back to other Indonesian women by helping them become the best version of themselves and achieve freedom &#8212; financial and/or speaking up &#8212; faster. I believe that having more women change-makers can contribute to the economy. It can give them the confidence to start something again.</p>\n\t14.

My grandmother was an amazing mogul of her time. She ran businesses across multiple industries in Asia and provided others in need with opportunities and resources. I wanted to be like her, and I made a promise to her that I would follow in her footsteps. I envisioned building a platform that would help people grow to their greatest potential.&#160;</p><p>The second \"aha\" moment came when several magazines had written about my unique and unusual jobs. My email address was available online, and I woke up to a flooded inbox from so many young women and men from around the world asking for help, advice, and what resources I was accessing to receive these opportunities at such a young age. I started sharing this information one on one. That's when I realized what if we could have a platform where millions of people could share obstacles, challenges, ideas, insights, and opportunities to help each other become the best versions of ourselves. I then taught myself how to code and created the first version of Mogul.&#160;</p>\n\t15.

We shared stories of friends overly stressed at work, feeling lonely, or dealing with severe anxiety or depression. I heard the same narrative over and over again &#8212; we feel stuck and alone.</p><p>The biggest takeaway was that most of our friends heavily invested in their physical health to give them a temporary release, but that same investment wasn't going towards their mental health. As someone who practices solo meditation to deal with anxiety, I realized there wasn't a place where mental health, physical movement, and community worked together as one. I needed to create that space.</p>\n\t16.

I had always loved interior design, and in India I discovered the beauty and authenticity of their crafts, so my dream was to share them with the world in an ethical way. I honestly believe that a better world starts in a slow home! Caeli was spontaneous and passion-driven, but I learned a lot about starting a business that I could use for a second business, an innovation consultancy firm. I founded my second business because I wanted to create my own path. Having worked in Fortune 500 companies, I always felt like I was walking someone else's road, so I decided to take control and build the road my way.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-in-venture-capital-break-glass-ceiling\">Less than 10% of decision makers in venture capital are women.

What I saw in myself as the CEO of a girls' self-organization was that I ironically had the lowest self-worth that year. It was also not the professional skills that got in the way of my and the organization's success; it was my personal beliefs, patterns, and habits. I saw this same personal limitation in the founders and leaders I believed in as well, so I knew I had to make the thing that wasn't my job, my job.

Those churn numbers were HIGH! I constantly questioned it. How was it that we spent so much time and money recruiting candidates that we were so excited about, but six to 12 months later, voluntarily or involuntarily, they were leaving the company? What a waste!&#160;</p><p>I thought that there must be something we can do to make people more successful at these fast-moving, innovative, challenging companies. That's why I started I/O Coaching. My goal with I/O Coaching is to put the onus to ensure that employees thrive back on the company. I believe it's the employers' job to invest in their people to optimize for their success. We now partner with forward-thinking companies to do just that, and in turn, reduce their churn.</p>\n\t19.

We no longer had to worry about our outfits. We no longer had to figure out the logistics for getting to work, dropping the kids off, and making plans with friends. Our calendars were wiped clean.</p><p>But even though everything was stripped to its most bare-boned form, we still found things to worry about.</p><p>We started getting on Zoom calls, and suddenly, we began obsessing over our pixelated appearance. This has led to \"perceptual distortion,\" which occurs when we \"highlight a fault, then focus disproportionately on it until it becomes magnified\" in our perception. Our smartphones can further alter body image, due to the angles at which we hold them. As a result, the plastic surgery industry has&#160;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200909-why-plastic-surgery-demand-is-booming-amid-lockdown\">exploded in popularity</a>&#160;over recent months.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-help-small-business-owners-entrepreneurs-have-good-mental-health\">7 ways entrepreneurs and business owners can better manage their mental health and wellbeing</a></em></p><p>\"Celebrities have to look good in front of people,\"&#160;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200909-why-plastic-surgery-demand-is-booming-amid-lockdown\">said Gordon Lee</a>, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. And now, for many who are living through the Zoom Boom, \"so do regular people\".</p><p>One of life's great ironies is that simplicity has become pretty complicated. Technology was supposed to make our lives easier — and it has, in many ways — except it hasn't made them&#160;<em>simpler</em>.</p><p>There's always a notification here, an email that needs responding there. Things compete for your attention at all hours in the night. In turn, this \"easy\" world has made us reactive, defensive, worried, and distracted.</p><p>As a result of the pandemic, we now&#160;<em>live</em>&#160;online. We've begun to over-identify with our virtual selves more so than with our un-filtered regular selves.</p><h2>Happiness has never felt more elusive. That's because we think happiness stems from success and appearance and money and&#160;<em>stuff</em>. That's not happiness; that's excess.</h2><p>I've written about&#160;<a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-the-man-cleaning-up-facebook\">minimalism</a>&#160;before, and noted that the worst form of excess is to achieve everything you've ever dreamed of and realize that somehow you're&#160;<em>still</em>&#160;not happy and that something is&#160;<em>still</em>&#160;missing. And that, my friends, sucks.</p><p>There's this famous passage from Matt Haig's memoir \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733573-reasons-to-stay-alive\">Reasons to Stay Alive\"</a>:</p><p>\"The world is increasingly designed to depress us. Happiness isn't very good for the economy. If we were happy with what we had, why would we need more?</p><p>\"How do you sell an anti-aging moisturizer? You make someone worry about aging. How do you get people to vote for a political party? You make them worry about immigration. How do you get them to buy insurance? By making them worry about everything. How do you get them to have plastic surgery? By highlighting their physical flaws. How do you get them to watch a TV show? By making them worry about missing out. How do you get them to buy a new smartphone? By making them feel like they are being left behind.</p><p>\"To be calm becomes a kind of revolutionary act. To be happy with your own non-upgraded existence. To be comfortable with our messy, human selves, would not be good for business.\"</p><p>So this leads me to my grandmother's neighbor Ivan. He lives in a small town near the Rila mountains in Bulgaria where it's not uncommon to see sheep, chickens, and cows just casually wandering around.</p><p>Ivan has animals, he does a ton of physical work every day, and he seems genuinely happy. His biggest worry the last time I saw him was how horrible airplanes are for the environment and how he sees them in the sky every day now.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc2c195037cbd0018612bdc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ivan Polina Marinova\" height=\"1092\" width=\"1456\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Polina Marinova&#39;s grandmother&#39;s neighbor Ivan.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Polina Marinova</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/former-chef-restaurateur-founded-snack-brand-split-overcame-addiction-2020-11\">A chef and restaurateur founded a successful snack brand after overcoming addiction. He shared how investing in his self-care made him a better leader and entrepreneur.</a></em></p><p>He couldn't care less about anti-aging moisturizer, plastic surgery, or smartphones. He may lead a simple life, according to our standards, but it's not in any way less busy or fulfilling.</p><p>It's not that Ivan doesn't have problems in his life, it's that he's learned how to find beauty in the mundane. For example, he loved this picture so much, he asked my grandmother to get it printed so he could frame it. He had never had a picture with his sheep before. It's a life of minimalism, but it's also a life of deliberately finding small, daily moments of joy.</p><p>So here's one thing we can all take away: Rather than obsessing over what we perceive as flaws, maybe for once we could appreciate the wrinkle or the gray hair that we see on our Zoom screens. It's a revolutionary act to notice those tiny moments of beauty so we can stop stuffing the pockets of beauty brands and plastic surgeons.</p><p>As Haig wrote, \"Wherever you are, at any moment, try and find something beautiful. A face, a line out of a poem, the clouds out of a window, some graffiti, a wind farm. Beauty cleans the mind.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-rediscover-happiness-in-world-designed-to-depress-us-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/I_u8s905lSA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:05:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f6bbbd6c4049200115cb46b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b521b2a0d6a27033877ed5453549ea4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn91@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-28-12-762_ba64f4b5c212ba23.webp","destWidth":2349,"destHeight":1762,"sourceBytes":121794,"destBytes":121794,"author":"insider@insider.com (Polina Marinova)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f6bbbd1e3e7670011716360?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn86@2020_2/2020/12/01/14-28-04-975_cb96858a3d8623d9.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fc2c195037cbd0018612bdc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn79@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-28-10-927_b8eef558bc4c77e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn19@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-28-10-417_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-28-04-937_fa0303445f78d433.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-28-10-617_dd9281668a987fe4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-28-08-006_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=I_u8s905lSA:IJt_lHDhLw4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn67@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-28-06-105_04d296955980585a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/I_u8s905lSA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn100@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-28-07-101_d0149d47adcf805c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832862960},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:43","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:43","title":"Trump keeps retweeting the anonymous account 'Catturd2' which backs his baseless election-fraud claims.

including HSBC, American Apparel, the National Retail Federation, and the US Chamber of Commerce also lobbied on the bill, according to lobbying disclosure forms.&#160;</p><p>None of the above organizations responded to a request for comment on this story.</p><p>Apple took issue with the claim that it tried to water down the bill in a statement to The Times.</p><p>Nike's global communications director, Greg Rossiter, told The Times that the company \"did not lobby against\" the bill but rather had \"constructive discussions\" with congressional staffers.</p><p>Coca-Cola told The Times in a statement that it \"strictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce declined to comment to The Times. It instead referred it to a letter it and other groups wrote in November, saying they supported addressing forced labor.</p><p>Human rights groups, media reports, and other independent researchers have extensively documented China's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-ijop-app-classifies-muslims-into-36-personality-types-xinjiang-uighurs-human-rights-watch-2019-5?r=ts-sub\">mass surveillance</a> and detainment of as many as one million Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minority groups in internment camps, where reports allege they are subjected to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/life-inside-china-internment-camps-for-uighur-minority-in-xinjiang-bbc-report-2018-8?r=ts-sub\">torture</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uighur-activists-mass-rape-chinese-men-xinjiang-2019-12?r=ts-sub\">sexual abuse</a>, and forced labor for little or no pay.</p><p>In March, a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which estimated that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-forced-uighur-labor-iphone-factory-2020-3?r=ts-sub\">80,000 Uighurs have been forcibly relocated to factories across China</a>, found evidence of forced Uighur labor at four separate factories in Apple's supply chain as well as the supply chains of Nike, BMW, and Amazon.</p><p>Also in March, the Congressional-Executive Commission <a href=\"https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/CECC%20Staff%20Report%20March%202020%20-%20Global%20Supply%20Chains%2C%20Forced%20Labor%2C%20and%20the%20Xinjiang%20Uyghur%20Autonomous%20Region.pdf\">said in a report</a> that Nike and Coca-Cola, as well as major brands such as Adidas, Campbell Soup, Costco, H&#38;M, Kraft Heinz, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger, were suspected of relying on forced Chinese labor.</p><p>Nike claimed in a <a href=\"https://purpose.nike.com/statement-on-xinjiang\">March statement</a> that it \"does not source products\" from Xinjiang and that it \"confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.\" Nike also told The&#160;Times that a factory in Qingdao that makes its shoes stopped using Uighur labor in 2019, though the ASPI report, citing Chinese state media, found that 800 Uighurs were still forced to work there as of November 2019.</p><p>Coca-Cola told The Times that a COFCO Tunhe plant in Xinjiang — that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/western-companies-get-tangled-in-chinas-muslim-clampdown-11558017472\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported last year was using forced labor — passed an independent audit in 2019 as well.</p><p>Amid growing bipartisan support for punishing China over the alleged human rights abuses, as well as holding companies accountable for exploiting it, US lawmakers introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act earlier this year. The bill could force companies — especially those with substantial supply chains in China, such as Nike, Coca-Cola, and Apple — to make major changes to how and where they manufacture their products, and is viewed as having more teeth than current laws.</p><p>In response, many companies have sought to weaken the disclosure and compliance requirements proposed in the bill.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/20/apple-uighur/\">The Washington Post</a> reported earlier this month that Apple had lobbied against the bill, and according to The&#160;Times, the tech giant pushed for longer deadlines to reach compliance, less disclosure to the general public, and putting more onus on the US government to assess whether Chinese entities are complicit in the oppression of Muslims.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-09/apple-foxconn-broke-a-chinese-labor-law-for-iphone-production\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/apr/14/ethicalbusiness.money\">Nike</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/09/19/Coca-Cola-stands-firm-amid-criticism-of-human-rights-violations-in-South-East-Asia\">Coca-Cola</a> have over the years been accused by human rights groups of a variety of labor abuses and worker exploitation, particularly in China.

He was 46 years old.</p><p>Tributes came from those who had not only met Hsieh but had read his highly influential first book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220\">Delivering Happiness</a>.\"</p><p>The entrepreneur was widely credited for raising the bar for customer service in online retail, laying out his philosophy around happiness in the 2010 book. Hsieh and his cofounder Alfred Lin famously maintained a focus on Zappos' culture after its sale to Amazon in 2009.</p><p>The book was number one on the New Your Times Best Seller List the year of its release and it remains Amazon's number one bestseller in the law for small businesses section and number four in the site's entrepreneurship category.</p><p>Hsieh's lessons evidently still hold true a decade on. Here are four key lessons from the book:</p><h2>1. Find your one true passion and don't follow the money</h2><p>It's important to figure out the one thing you're passionate about, Hsieh wrote. If you have that in mind and know what your ultimate goal is, subsequent decisions will become easier to make.&#160;</p><p>\"You want to figure out the right balance of profits, passion, and purpose in business and in life,\" Hsieh wrote.</p><p>During his first couple of years at Zappos, Hsieh and his cofounder Alfred Lin struggled to make a profit and had only a couple of months' worth of cash.</p><p>Coming from their successful prior business, LinkExchange, they thought it would have been easy to raise new funds until it wasn't. They halted thinking solely about profit, were clear with their staff about the economic situation, cut jobs and salaries, and worked with the remaining of the team to find solutions to make the business profitable.</p><p>The remaining team stepped up and worked harder than before. The layoffs didn't hurt the company's productivity due to the staff's effort but also because they were passionate about the company, and believed in its future and potential.</p><p>\"It was a big lesson in the power of instilling passion throughout the entire company and working as a unified team. Everyone was making sacrifices,\" Hsieh wrote.</p><p>Hsieh wanted to transform Zappos from a good to a great company: \"Great companies have a greater purpose and bigger vision beyond just making money or being number one in a market,\" wrote Hsieh, citing the book \"Good to Great\" by Jim Collins. \"A lot of companies fall into the trap of just focusing on making money, and then they never become a great company.\"</p><h2>2. Hire the right people, have the right company culture, and the rest will develop</h2><p>Treat people well and only hire people you would hang out with outside of working hours. \"Many of the best ideas came about while having drinks at a local bar,\" said Hsieh. Those are the people who will make you want to go to work and feel part of a bigger family — the ''friends of Zappos\" in Hsieh's case — and therefore do whatever needed to make a company successful.</p><p>You also need to actively foster culture. \"You want to create a stronger company culture, which will make your employees and coworkers happier and create more employee engagement, leading to higher productivity,\" Hsieh wrote.</p><p>Culture was famously a major priority for Hsieh, who saw this as key to the success of the business. He asked all his staff to write down what the business meant to them, and made a book out of their thoughts — none being censored. Every year a new edition would be produced, with new sentences added and changed. Hsieh would give out that new version of the Zappos Culture Book to prospective employees, vendors, and even customers.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>3. Surprise your customers and show them how much you care</strong></h2><h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc25c47037cbd0018612b96?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Hsieh\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;You want to figure out the right balance of profits, passion, and purpose in business and in life,&#34; Hsieh wrote.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/january-8-las-vegas-nevada-tony-hsieh-ceo-of-zappos-speaks-news-photo/539692878?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Farina/Corbis via Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h3><p>In 2003, the dot-com crash was still hammering Zappos' profit.</p><p>Hsieh decided to make customer service the focus of the business. He wrote that at the time it felt like the only choice for its survival but realized later on it was actually \"a blessing in disguise.\"</p><p>Good customer service builds a brand and drives word of mouth, he said.</p><p>\"Our philosophy has been to take most of the money we would have spent on paid advertising and invest it into customer service and the customer experience instead, letting our customers do the marketing for us through word of mouth,\" Hsieh wrote.</p><p>That involved measuring whether Zappos employees went \"above and beyond\" for customers, rather than measuring them on call volumes.</p><p>Another way was to continually \"wow\" customers — for example giving loyal customers overnight shipping even when they only promised the standard option.&#160;</p><h2>4. Make learning a priority for yourself and staff</h2><p>Hsieh called himself an \"avid book reader\" and made a compulsory book list for his staff. Zappos' office had a library with thousands of books and offered courses on the most important titles.</p><p>Continual growth should always be any business's priority, the entrepreneur wrote. And any workplace should appreciate employees spending time and effort into their personal and professional development, allowing them to take up challenges as soon as they are ready.&#160;</p><div

continues his hopeless mission to contest President-elect Joe Biden's win, according to Monday reports from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raises-more-than-150-million-appealing-to-false-election-claims/2020/11/30/82e922e6-3347-11eb-afe6-e4dbee9689f8_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"

Times</a>.</p><p>In reality, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donations-trump-leadership-pac-pay-family-finance-2024-presidential-bid-2020-11\" rel=\"noopener\">only a small fraction of small-dollar donations is being used for Trump's legal challenges</a>, with the vast majority instead being put into an account which the president can use to fund his post-White House political career.&#160;</p><p>The Post and Times reports differ slightly on the total raised by the Trump campaign since Election Day. The Post said that more than $150 million was raised in that time, citing multiple sources, while a source who spoke to The Times put that number at $170 million.&#160;</p><p>Regardless of the exact total, it's a significant amount for the campaign. For comparison, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, one of Trump's main political action committees, raised $125 million in all of the second quarter of 2020, and raised $81 million during September, its best fundraising month, according to The Post.</p><p>Business Insider has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fbed0fc037cbd0018612701?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Joe Biden\" height=\"1328\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Joe Biden (pictured) has won the 2020 presidential election, but Trump has continued to contest the election results in several states.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Joshua Roberts/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Hundreds of emails&#160;</h2><p>At a time when most losing campaigns start winding down, Trump's campaign took the unusual step and increased its calls for donations, The Post and The Times reported.</p><p>The campaign sent out hundreds of emails to donors in November, The Post reported.</p><p>The focus of the emails since Election Day has been on riling up supporters about Trump's unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud, giving supporters the impression that they're directly helping the campaign contest the election results in the courts with their donations.&#160;</p><p>According to The Post, one of these recent emails was a message to donors from Vice President Mike Pence, which read: \"Our democracy and freedom is at risk like never before, which is why I'm reaching out to you now with an URGENT request. President Trump and I need our STRONGEST supporters, like YOU, to join the Election Defense Task Force. This group will be responsible for DEFENDING the Election from voter fraud, and we really need you to step up to the front lines of this battle.\"</p><h2>Where the money is actually going</h2><p>The fine print on the donation page tells another story, though.</p><p>According to The Times, the email fine print says that nearly all small-dollar donations are split between the Save America PAC, new leadership PAC to fund the president's post-White House political future, and the Republican National Committee.</p><p>The emails added that donors have to spend&#160;$5,000 in order for part of their money to start going to Trump's legal fund. Until they hit that number, 75% goes to the new PAC and 25% goes to the RNC, according to The Times.&#160;</p><p>\"Small donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an 'official election defense fund' are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign's debt or funding his post-presidential political operation,\" Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center — a nonpartisan nonprofit that works to reduce the influence of money in politics — told The Post.</p><p>\"The average donor who gives in response to Trump's appeal for funds to 'stop the fraud' likely doesn't realize that their money is actually retiring Trump's debt or funding his leadership PAC,\" he added.</p><p>The Times also noted that the Trump campaign is automatically signing donors up for repeated weekly contributions. Donors have to un-tick a box to opt out of the scheme, which some critics have called misleading, according to The Times.&#160;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donations-trump-leadership-pac-pay-family-finance-2024-presidential-bid-2020-11\">Business Insider</a> previously reported, a leadership PAC like the Save America PAC is typically created by current and former politicians, and can be used to fund travel and events.</p><p>The Post report pointed out that the money from this kind of PAC could even be used to pay for events at Trump's own properties. Leadership PACs are \"loosely regulated\" and do not face the same restrictions as candidate committees do, the newspaper reported.</p><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li>Read more:</li><li><a

With the worst of the winter season yet to come and an effective vaccine some weeks, or even months, away, there is a degree of caution hanging over the financial markets.</p><p>Oil meanwhile eased after a group of the world's largest exporters delayed a key meeting to discuss their supply plans for 2021, over a lack of consensus on what any deal might look like.&#160;</p><p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, together with partners including Russia, Mexico and Oman, is holding a virtual meeting this week to hash out its supply plans for next year. Its existing agreement to curtail daily output by 7.7 million barrels a day expires at the end of December.&#160;</p><p>Since the group agreed in the spring to restrict output and protect the oil market from a damaging decline, the price of crude has risen by around 80% and, while a second wave of COVID-19 is threatening demand in the short-term, the rollout of a vaccine means movement is less likely to be restricted. An extension of the output cuts in their current form is now in question.</p><p>\"We still believe that the group will probably find some face-saving compromise, with a short extension being the most likely outcome followed by a phased production return,\" RBC commodities strategist Helima Croft said in a note.</p><p>\"Nonetheless this latest fracas does not bode well for collective cohesion in 2021 as vaccine optimism abounds and producers anticipate a strong recovery,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price\">Brent crude futures</a>, which are most sensitive to OPEC production, edged up 0.1% on the day to around $47.91 a barrel, having touched an earlier session low of $47.39, while <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?type=wti\">US crude futures</a> were roughly unchanged around $45.35 a barrel, but off an intraday low of $44.83.&#160;</p><p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-esg-trends-markets-climate-investing-stock-sustainability-social-2020-11\"><em>A top equity portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs shares his four essential ESG trends that you need to be thinking about</em></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/us-dollar-index\">dollar index</a> fell 0.3%, as investors pushed capital into more risk-exposed assets, such as emerging-market currencies, commodities and the crypto market.&#160; The dollar is trading around its lowest since mid-2018 against a basket of major currencies, reflecting the improvement in risk appetite that has accelerated in pace in the past few weeks.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies rallied for a second day, pushing the price of <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> up by 6% to around $19,585.

Tequila is a designation of origin, meaning to call your drink tequila you have to produce it in Mexico and follow certain rules. According to The Verge, the company's effort to brand its drink Teslaquila was blocked by Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council.</p><p>\"[The] name 'Teslaquila' evokes the word Tequila ... (and) Tequila is a protected word,\" the council argued in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tequila-teslaquila-mexican-industry-2018-11\">November 2018</a>.</p><p>The council head, Martín Muñoz, said the name Teslaquila could cause confusion about the drink's origin, and in February 2019 the council filed an objection. Essentially, if Tesla wanted to make a tequila, it had to use the word tequila without changing it so as to avoid diluting the brand.</p><p>A month later, the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property ruled Teslaquila could not be registered.</p><p>Musk's team argued back in July, saying the name was just the Tesla brand name with \"quila\" added on — but this didn't convince the regulator, which in January handed down its ruling.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-car-race-over-tesla-won-musk-knows-doesnt-matter-2020-8?r=ih-sub\">Winning the electric-car race is just the beginning of Elon Musk's plan for Tesla</a></em></p><p>There don't seem to be hard feelings, however, as Muñoz told The Verge: \"Today the tequila industry has someone as important as Elon Musk representing it. This is, without a doubt, a benefit to all the tequila producers because he is giving his image as an important businessman and he is showing he wants to comply with the rules of this industry.</p><p>\"We welcome Elon Musk and the Tesla tequila brand.\"</p><p>Tesla Tequila is made by a California-based label called Nosotros Tequila, which per Reuters belongs to the Mexican producer Casa Maestri.</p><p>Tesla's product-design officer, Javier Verdura, did not comment on Tesla Tequila's timeline when contacted by The Verge, but he did say the company had trouble finding a manufacturer that could make the distinctive lightning-bolt-shaped bottle.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Obama.</p><p>In 2008, Obama was the first Black man to be elected as president of the United States — more than 140 <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1857222,00.html\">years after the Emancipation Proclamation</a> was signed by President Abraham Lincoln, which effectively ended 400 years of the enslavement of Black men, women, and children in the United States.</p><p>Blackface is part of that enduring legacy of slavery and racism in the US, a remnant of minstrel shows, in which white Americans painted their face black to mock black people with racist caricatures in the 1800s.</p><p>The racist skit appeared on NTV's \"Mezhdunarodnaya Pilorama\" or \"International Sawmill,\" a satirical show with Tigran Keosayan as the host. In the segment, a Russian actress appears as Obama, wearing blackface and baggy clothes and a bandana and gesturing in an attempt to mimic rappers.</p><p>The segment ran about a minute and a half and Keosayan promotes it as an interview with Obama about his new book, \"A Promised Land.\"&#160;</p><p>\"We now go live to the dark side of America's history, Barack Obama,\" Keosayan says, introducing the actress in blackface.</p><p>The actress immediately chants \"Black lives matter!\" to which Keosayan asks her to stop shouting and says that racism does not exist in Russia. Keosayan then continues with racist questions about the book.</p><p>Keosayan asks the actress if she is proud of her book, to which she says, \"Of course.\" Keosayan then asks, \"Because none of your relatives have written books?\" to which she replies, \"Because none of my relatives that came before me could write.\"&#160;</p><p>Keosayan then tells her she should have been a rapper and not a US president, and the actress starts to rap for the host.&#160;</p><p>NTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the Russian-state controlled network RT and Keosayan's partner, defended the skit on Twitter, and additional reporting from the Moscow Times uncovered that the pair <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/11/30/obama-blackface-skit-on-kremlin-funded-tv-sparks-outrage-a72176\">were co-writers.</a> Simonyan argued that Keosayan's background as an ethnic Armenian and self-deprecating humor about his background meant that the new skit was not over the top.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\"

the advertising and tech industries</a></em></p><p>Company sources told the Financial Times that Facebook was considering putting a banner at the top of its site encouraging users to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>In October, the social-media giant <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/supporting-public-health-experts-vaccine-efforts/\">launched a new \"preventative health tool\"</a> that directed users toward information about getting flu shots.</p><p>Both <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55129336#:~:text=Moderna%20is%20filing%20for%20US,to%20recommend%20for%20roll%20out.\">Moderna</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html\">Pfizer</a> have filed for emergency authorization of their COVID-19 vaccines, so it's possible Facebook will roll out something similar once vaccines become available to the public.</p><p>Facebook also announced in October it was changing its policy to ban ads that discourage people from getting vaccinated.</p><p>The platform does not fully ban anti-vaccination — also known as \"anti-vaxx\" — content, though in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-anti-vaccine-crack-down/\">February</a> it said it would start making pages and groups that regularly promote anti-vaxx posts more difficult to find in its search results.</p><p>Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate campaign group, said Zuckerberg's announcement was not addressing the real problem.</p><p>\"Mr. Zuckerberg is deeply hypocritical to claim he is offering to help with the Coronavirus vaccine, when his companies, Facebook and Instagram, host the world's most renowned anti-vaxxers and amplify their toxic lies into tens of millions of users' timelines,\" Ahmed said.</p><p>Ahmed said if Facebook were serious about vaccine misinformation, it should remove prominent sources of misinformation from its platform. \"If Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to help, he could remove the identified pages and groups, some with hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, which spread lies about vaccines, as laid out clearly in <a

One of the most pressing issues in need of attention is the rising number of shootings. Across the country,<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/08/02/shootings-and-gun-deaths-continue-to-rise-at-alarming-rate-in-large-us-cities/?sh=719a66a86f0f\"> shootings have skyrocketed</a> this year, especially in large cities, and even more disturbing are the number of children caught in the crossfire.&#160;</p><p>The homicide rate in Philadelphia is<a href=\"https://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/\"> 38% higher</a> than last year, and by the end of the summer, nearly 100 children under the age of 18 had been<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/philly-shootings-children-trnd/index.html#:~:text=(CNN)%20At%20least%2098%20individuals,under%20the%20age%20of%2010.&text=Police%20data%20shows%20nine%20of%20the%20shootings%20were%20fatal.tal.\"> shot</a>. Compared with last year, New York City had nearly doubled their shootings and shooting fatalities as of September, with over<a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/nycs-surge-in-gun-violence-sees-spike-in-kid-teen-and-young-adult-victims/2514840/\"> 50 children shot</a>.&#160;</p><p>Murder and shooting rates are up nearly 50% in Chicago and in the recent weeks,<a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/10/31/21543106/chicago-shootings-gun-violence-weekend-homicide-october-30-november-1\"> over 30 people were shot</a> in the span of just a few days. As of October, nearly 50 children in Chicago were victims of firearm violence this year.</p><p>As a pediatric emergency medicine physician in Chicago, I feel as if we are watching the next mass shooting unfold before our eyes. We need to take this moment with new White House leadership to make progress on regulating guns for the sake of our children.&#160;</p><h2>Guns are turning into a public health emergency</h2><p>Firearm injuries (15%) are the second-leading<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/LeadingCauses.html\"> cause of death</a> for US children. Car crashes (20%) are the No. 1 cause of death in children ages 1-19. Yet, federal funding for pediatric firearm injuries is only<a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00476?journalCode=hlthaff\"> funded at 3%</a> of what it should be based on its mortality burden (how many deaths can be attributed to this phenomenon) compared with other causes of death. A<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2595514\"> study</a> in 2017 found that, compared with other leading causes of death, gun violence was one of the least researched in relation to its mortality rate.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Research on the dangers and health consequences of firearms was almost completely banned until recently because of the Dickey Amendment. The<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993413/\"> amendment</a>, passed in 1996 as part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993413/\">spending bill</a> and backed by the National Rifle Association, restricted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding anything that \"advocated or promoted gun control.\" Many interpreted this directive to include research on gun violence, which effectively led to the shutdown of any meaningful firearms research. We need to make up for lost time. In December 2019, for the first time in 20 years, Congress approved<a href=\"https://www.ajmc.com/view/gun-violence-research-receives-federal-funding-for-first-time-in-20-years\"> $25 million</a> dollars for gun violence research.&#160;&#160;</p><p>This is a start, but it is not nearly enough.</p><p>Prevention efforts also are needed to stop shooting injuries and fatalities to children. Most children's firearm injuries involve guns stored in the<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/347593\"> home of the victim</a> or that of a friend or relative. An estimated<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-018-0261-7\"> 4.6 million children</a> live in homes with guns that are stored unsafely, unlocked, and loaded.&#160;</p><p>A recent<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2761305#:~:text=Child%20access%20prevention%20(CAP)%20laws%20are%20state%2Dlevel%20laws,firearms%20in%20households%20with%20minors.&text=We%20conducted%20a%20state%2Dlevel,years%20from%201991%20to%202016.016.\"> study</a> found more stringent laws that hold gun owners liable for unsafe storage of firearms were associated with decreased pediatric firearm deaths.&#160; Currently, only half of states have laws that regulate any accountability of gun owners for safe firearm storage, and these laws vary in strictness.</p><p>The threat of guns is ever-present. We have been bombarded by images of rifle and handgun-toting Trump supporters attempting intimidation at<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-reaction-idUSKBN27M2ND\"> voting sites</a> and<a href=\"https://gunsandamerica.org/story/20/07/30/guns-anti-police-violence-protests-aurora-colorado/\"> protests</a>.&#160; These self-proclaimed militiamen are domestic terrorists pushing the normalcy of carrying and flaunting guns in public. These are the images our children absorb. They are images endorsed and propagated by the soon-to-be former president of our country.&#160;</p><p>The Brady Campaign, a national nonprofit gun control advocacy group,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrisB_Brown/status/1325123498256207872?s=20\"> announced</a> that now President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were the strongest gun violence protection ticket in our country's history. Let's take advantage of this momentum to make homes and streets safer for our children and debunk the normalization of deadly firearms in the public imagination.</p><p>Restriction of firearm rights is a sensitive topic in the US. There are political implications and emotions not present when we discuss other health issues.&#160; However, safe firearm storage reduces pediatric gun injuries and deaths.&#160;</p><p>When the election has ceased to consume all of our attention and headlines in the next days and&#160; weeks, we must get back to work planning for how to protect our children from ongoing gun injuries and violence.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Dr. Sheryl Yanger, a Public Voices Fellow of The OpEd Project, is an assistant professor of pediatrics (emergency medicine) at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-violence-killing-higher-rates-public-health-joe-biden-administration-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/WcbHOO5jcuk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 13:26:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fbec62c037cbd00186126d1?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d0abbf2b3e2a459d4c5216ac69e9a581","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn32@2020_5/2020/12/01/14-28-12-153_989d3b4b07be4df6.webp","destWidth":5546,"destHeight":4160,"sourceBytes":1570226,"destBytes":1570226,"author":"insider@insider.com (Sheryl Yanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fbec63050e71a00115577e0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn48@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-28-10-332_1a0dde5be9331d34.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn19@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-28-10-417_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn67@2020_3/2020/12/01/14-28-06-991_47399b12b0e4644d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn47@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-28-09-041_27fce1bfb79d08ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_6/2020/12/01/14-28-08-006_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WcbHOO5jcuk:HDnGDg-5ntI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn79@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-28-07-052_880359e11b14ec54.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/WcbHOO5jcuk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_4/2020/12/01/14-28-05-848_ede09d43d2a125c4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606832863000},{"createdTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:43","updatedTime":"2020-12-01 22:27:43","title":"How to share a fleet in a tweet on Twitter's mobile app","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-share-a-fleet-in-a-tweet","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f77601274fe5b0018a8ec7e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"twitter logo\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It&#39;s easy to tweet out (certain) fleets you&#39;ve made on Twitter.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>You can share a Twitter fleet as a tweet, but only if you were the creator of the original fleet.</li>\n<li>Twitter's fleets feature allows users to share ephemeral images, video, text, and share tweets.</li>\n<li>To share a fleet as a tweet, your fleet has to be a still image or text-based fleet;

You can never guarantee 100% transparency. It's not just about any intentional cover-up, you are also constrained with by technology and other issues with a novel virus.
