It also coincides with a two-hour playthrough session, which I played remotely earlier this month. There’s still a while to go before <em>Outriders</em> arrives on consoles and PCs, and it’s already a lot of fun. But how will the game avoid the pitfalls of similar (notoriously named) ‘looter shooters’ like EA’s <em>Anthem</em>?</p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bef4ef42-e6df-11ea-adbb-d0fdc3699813\" alt=\"Outriders\" credit=\"Square Enix\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div> </figure><p>It’s easy to frame <em>Outriders</em> as a combination of several great and hugely popular games that came before it. <em>Anthem</em> aside, the weapons UI and stores take unmistakable cues from <em>Destiny</em>. The over-the-shoulder view is lifted from <em>Gears</em> (or <em>Mass Effect</em>, perhaps), and that’s even before we get to the gunplay and how the game works. (Part MMORPG, part <em>Destiny</em> was my shorthand while I was playing). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This makes it very easy for someone who’s played one of those games to get up to speed quickly and start enjoying blasting mutants and other creatures. Established conventions and gameplay features do make it harder to explain what <em>Outriders</em> is bringing to the party, however. </p><p>Judging from my early time with the game, it boils down to cooperative play, and how you kit out your character in different combinations of otherworldly powers -- something you can do anytime without needing particular items or money.</p><p>The source of your powers is what’s known as the anomaly. Your foes are also imbued with similar powers, and unraveling the mystery of the anomaly forms a major part of the storyline, it seems. These powers are apparently born from the same energy that destroyed the technology and structures in place when humanity got to Enoch, the name of the space colony where the game is set.</p><p>This world building was the wobbliest part of <em>Outriders</em> for me. I’ve watched the teasers and earlier playthroughs of parts of the game, and it’s all a little familiar and bland, if I can use the word bland to describe an apocalyptic wasteland. Barring a few of the big, bad bosses, characters struggle to stand out -- even the one you’re playing. Perhaps the universe building will come later? It’s my <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964\">biggest worry</a> for now. </p><div> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aujOVMTfkWM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"> </iframe> </div><p>Let’s touch on the characters, now that we have the full roster. There’s the Devastator (a tank character), Pyromancer (fire abilities), Trickster (close-range with time-bending powers) and the recently revealed Technomancer character, which plays like a healer-summoner, albeit one retooled for a post-apocalyptic failed space colony. It can install turrets, rocket launchers and mini-guns. The Technomancer is your long-range support, with best-in-class healing powers to provide support to your allies.</p><p>Regardless of character class, the guns are satisfying too, each with their own feel, whether it’s a potent sniper rifle or shotgun. Even your lightweight pistol, which I always had on hand during my playthrough, is capable of felling most foes in tandem with your powers. </p><p>You can equip three powers at a time, although you’re able to swap these in and out in a sub-menu when you’re not gunning down foes. I went with the Trickster for this preview, mainly because its powers and abilities jived with how I used to play <em>Mass Effect</em> years ago. </p><p>Like that series, there are power cool-down timers, run-and-gun, find-cover-to-survive gameplay mechanics and more. It’s not a complicated posit. From the parts I played, you mostly gun down enemies, secure areas, pick up loot and new weapons, rinse and repeat, with some heavily armored, powerful bosses scattered throughout. Yes, that’s an oversimplification but the takeaway is it’s still a lot of fun. I hope there’s a good selection of levels and setups in the final product, like the <em>Saving Private Ryan-</em>styled frontline run that came near the end of my play.</p><section data-eng-breakout=\"5f4530cb65825903b290c649\" data-eng-breakout-type=\"image\"> <img class=\"image-url\" data-eng-breakout-field=\"img_url\" alt=\"Outriders\" data-eng-required=\"true\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bf182eb0-e6df-11ea-ad97-2fd6cc184829\" /> </section><p>The part I enjoyed most was mixing powers with other players, experimenting with skill load-outs and upgrades. It’s about how they all work with each other. The Devastator’s ‘endless mass’ attack can pull enemies together, meaning any explosive splash attack from the Pyromancer or area-of-effect powers of a Trickster can be stacked together easily for maximum destruction. The Technomancer, meanwhile, can pick off the stragglers either from a distance or through auto-targeting turrets.</p><p>During my playthrough, I was given a blank-slate Trickster with plenty of points to assign to skills. It also gave me ample opportunities to test out multiple powers, like time-slowing fields, or a very addictive teleportation strike that put me behind the enemy ranks. I was then free to shoot them from behind, catching them unawares. Combine your collective powers -- say, with a friendly Technomancer’s mortar-style attacks -- and enemies explode in a shower of gore.  </p><p>Later on, I swapped this out for knives that damaged and slowed multiple enemies at once, hopping from cannon-fodder to cannon-fodder, enemies that couldn’t be targeted with area bombs. It made easy work for the Devastator also on my team, with his heavy-hitting attacks, who was able to survive the now-limited fire from the slowed-down enemy.</p><p>This is what seems to separate <em>Outriders</em> from all the other games I mentioned earlier. Improving your equipment and weapons are key, yes, but combining characters’ strengths and weaknesses (and stacking powers together) seemed to be the path to victory, at least if my early playthrough was any indication. As such, this game will hinge on how you interact with other players, unless you decide to play it alone. </p><p>There’s an additional layer here: a \"World Tier\" difficulty system. When you start Outriders, you’ll be placed in the lowest difficulty level. As you gain experience in the world, separate to your character’s level, you’ll level up through 15 different stages, and then leap up to a newer, more difficult tier. Enemies will hit harder, but they’ll leave behind better loot too -- it’s a little like the system in <em>Diablo 3</em>. That said, if you die, your character will lose a percentage of this World Tier experience, and you’ll have to build it back up again. It’s all meant to ensure players choose the appropriate level of difficulty to play.</p><p>When <em>Outriders</em> launches, you and your friends can complete the entire game together, or you can drop in and drop out, not beholden to other people’s schedules. Unfortunately, it won’t be something I’ll be able to test until the game arrives, and whether I’m able to convince friends to play it with me. Are they ready (and willing) to play something else that looks, at times, built for regular, time-intensive, sustained gaming?</p><p>Yes, you can (and probably will have to) grind for gear, but the <em>Outriders</em> team has said several times that power layout and team composition and skill will trump shiny new guns. </p><p><em>Outriders</em> launches on PS4, Xbox One and PC holiday 2020.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:30:35 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/beff0161-e6df-11ea-bca2-f1eae367d40a","linkMd5":"5f02bf3722494d983b53f4bf9ce19968","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-12-39-836_214c6b7989367255.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1125,"sourceBytes":812676,"destBytes":208882,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/beff0161-e6df-11ea-bca2-f1eae367d40a":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-12-39-836_214c6b7989367255.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bef4ef42-e6df-11ea-adbb-d0fdc3699813":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn18@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-12-57-389_e6750d94acc18b5f.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bf182eb0-e6df-11ea-ad97-2fd6cc184829":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-12-58-006_c8aee26e1786d2d0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159491},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"Amazon's latest AR shopping tool fills your space with virtual furniture","link":"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ar-shopping-furniture-home-decor-171005257.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/08f66880-e6ef-11ea-beea-b5e01e7582cb\" /><p>Amazon’s newest AR shopping tool will let you see furniture and other home decor in your space before you buy it, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/amazon-rolls-out-a-new-ar-shopping-feature-for-viewing-multiple-items-at-once/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reports.

But unlike AR glasses such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-acquires-north-153625943.html\">North’s Focals</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vue/vue-your-everyday-smart-glasses/description\">Vue Pro</a> ($299) were regular frames with built-in speakers. It featured bone conduction technology, the ability to listen to calls and audio, as well as activity tracking. Unfortunately due to various delays, it didn’t actually ship the Vue Pro until 2019, and some customers appeared unhappy with the experience. </p><p>Undeterred, the company is back with another iteration of their smart glasses, but without a Kickstarter this time. Called the Vue Lite ($179), these glasses are a lighter, cheaper version of the Vue Pro, but without the more notable features of its predecessor. One of the reasons Vue made the Lite was to get people more comfortable with smart glasses. “We see that level of comfort and simplicity as the catalyst to get people to really start switching into connected frames,” said Aaron Rowley, Vue’s co-founder.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<core-slideshow data-slideshowid=\"a8020e6c-697f-3154-a847-8813f92db403\" /><p>In a lot of ways, the Vue Lite is akin to Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-echo-frames-hands-on.html\">Echo Frames</a> (which haven’t officially launched yet) as well as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html\">Bose Frames</a> (albeit without the latter’s AR and gesture elements). But after trying out the Vue Lite for a few days, I have to say that I’m not a fan. Not only does it have a few usability issues, I’m not sold on the concept in general, and I actually think it could push people away from smart glasses rather than towards them. </p><p>Perhaps the best feature of the Vue Lite is that it doesn’t look like a pair of smart glasses at all. The model I tried had a standard rectangular black frame made out of cellulose acetate, with no obvious indicator that there was anything unusual about it. According to Vue, the glasses weigh around 23 grams without the lenses, with front frame choices of cellulose acetate, metal or titanium. Vue also offers prescription lenses in addition to clear, blue light filtering, tinted, polarized and photochromic options. Though the design of the glasses didn’t quite fit my face shape, I do really like the style of it in general. </p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/3024eb40-e666-11ea-aab7-7b4b3003a769\" alt=\"Vue Lite smart glasses \" credit=\"Engadget\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </figure><p>Flip the Vue Lite over, however, and you’ll see some telltale signs that these are no ordinary glasses. Each arm has four magnetic charging pins, with which you would attach two magnetic charging cables. When it’s charging, a small LED will glow red and then turn off when it’s fully charged. There are also touch controls on either side near the hinges, helpfully indicated by the Vue logo. </p><p>The setup of the Vue Lite isn’t entirely intuitive and I would advise reading the instructions before pairing it with your phone. The reason for this is that each side of the Vue Lite operate independently of each other, and only become connected through the pairing process. So when you turn on the Vue Lite for the first time, you’ll need to power on <em>both</em> arms by pressing on both touch buttons simultaneously (both sides will audibly say “Power On” to indicate this has occurred). </p><p>After that, the Vue Lite will enter pairing mode (It’ll say “Pairing” to let you know it’s doing so). From there, you can go into the Bluetooth settings of your phone, and select “Vue Lite” to begin. After it’s connected, you’ll then get a <em>second</em> pairing request, which is what syncs the arms to each other. If you make the mistake of simply powering on one side and not the other (like I did initially), then you’ll only get audio from one side and the Vue Lite might not work properly. </p><p>Those aforementioned touch controls are the main ways to control the Vue Lite. You can supposedly double tap to play music or answer calls, and long press (around five seconds) to trigger your phone’s voice assistant. Unfortunately, I found this to be a little hit or miss for me. Sometimes those controls would work as advertised, but other times, they would not. It would often take me several tries before a long press would wake Siri up, for example. This is especially tricky because a long press of about eight seconds would power off the Vue Lite completely. Sometimes the glasses would even power off without me touching anything. Vue has said to me these issues could be due to buggy pre-production firmware on my model, but it’s worth noting anyway. </p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/55cde130-e666-11ea-8cfe-ac82db7a42a0\" alt=\"Vue Lite\" credit=\"Engadget\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </figure><p>Unlike the Vue Pro, which has bone conduction audio technology, the Vue Lite utilizes directional speakers for “open ear listening.” The idea here is that the speakers can “point” sound waves towards your ear so that you can listen to your music or the phone call while still hearing what’s around you at the same time. This is the same technology found on the Bose Frames as well as Amazon’s Echo Frames.</p><p>The audio quality on the Vue Lite is just okay. There’s practically no bass to speak of, and music generally sounded a little lackluster and bland compared to using a pair of headphones. But when I used it for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, that wasn’t a problem. Calls sounded pretty clear, and I was pretty impressed with the outgoing call audio too (I swapped devices with my husband so I could hear what it sounded like on the other end). </p><p>Where the audio quality really takes a nosedive is when I used it in a noisy environment. While being able to listen to your surroundings sounds like a good idea in theory, it’s not so great when trying to make out what exactly a podcaster is trying to say while walking on a busy sidewalk. </p><p>Plus, there is significant sound leakage with the Vue Lite. When the audio is at max volume -- which it often needs to be so that I can hear what’s being said -- I can actually place it on the table, walk several feet away and still make out what’s being said. The audio is certainly softer and more subdued of course, but that’s not great if you’re trying to have a private conversation or if you’re listening to a guilty pleasure tune. </p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bd223610-e666-11ea-96ff-9a736c9aea51\" alt=\"Vue Lite smart glasses\" credit=\"Engadget\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div> </figure><p>As for battery life, it lasts about a day on standby and around three to four hours of continuous playback. That’s not great, especially because when you’re charging your glasses, you then won’t have access to your glasses, which some people might need for, you know, seeing. And even if you keep your audio listening to a minimum, having to charge your glasses every night before you go to bed can be kind of a pain. </p><p>There are other features that are missing on the Vue Lite too. The Vue Pro has an activity tracking feature along with the ability to “find your glasses” via an app. The Vue Lite has neither. I understand that this is to cut costs -- it’s called “Lite” for a reason -- but without these extra features, these are just glasses with built-in speakers. At least the Bose Frames had the promise of an AR ecosystem that’ll alert you to nearby restaurants or landmarks, and even gesture-based navigation (though they weren’t live at the time of our review). </p><p>But just on its own, I don’t get it. I understand that there are some people that dislike the feel of earbuds or headphones in/on their ears, but I am not one of them. Using these glasses for a week just made me miss my earbuds. I would probably prefer a pair of glasses like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-level-activity-tracking-glasses-launch.html\">Level by VSP</a> (which are currently being discontinued), which are regular glasses with an activity tracker but no speaker. They’re in a completely different category, but I would even prefer a “real” pair of smart glasses like the AR-enabled North by Focals. Sure, they’re extremely expensive, but at least they have unique and useful features beyond just speakers. </p><p>In short, the Vue Lite -- as well as glasses with open-listening speakers -- just aren’t for me, at least not in their current iteration. But if you’re keen on them, then you can <a href=\"http://www.vueglasses.com\">check out their site</a> and pre-order them starting today. It’ll begin shipping in September of this year. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:00:48 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a0b2cfe0-e665-11ea-a9bd-5770ab72188f","linkMd5":"a2d045243cf6b09b73651608276aebba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-12-39-905_ad58b16ab367df74.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":1067,"sourceBytes":737322,"destBytes":202630,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a0b2cfe0-e665-11ea-a9bd-5770ab72188f":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-12-39-905_ad58b16ab367df74.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/3024eb40-e666-11ea-aab7-7b4b3003a769":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn25@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-12-57-938_a903046a16428181.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/55cde130-e666-11ea-8cfe-ac82db7a42a0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn1@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-12-57-522_78f7a6c54e885453.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bd223610-e666-11ea-96ff-9a736c9aea51":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn9@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-12-57-616_118df6ff50b2af46.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159493},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"Outlier adds Astronomy and Statistics classes to its online university","link":"https://www.engadget.com/outlier-astronomy-statistics-140021110.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d105df70-e6ba-11ea-b3f7-d56461182a10\" /><p>We’re in the throes of a deadly pandemic, and there’s not much time before everyone’s expected to get back to school. That’s why it’s fortunate that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-13-masterclass-outlier-college-courses.html\">home-learning startup Outlier.org</a> is adding two more classes to its burgeoning roster of college courses.

It launched last year with two courses on Calculus and Psychology fronted by star instructors like Hannah Fry and Marjorie Rhodes.

Apple is also working on building the first of two real-world stores, expected to open its doors in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-apple-to-open-india-retail-store-2021.html\">Mumbai in 2021</a>. After that point, Bloomberg’s sources in the know claim that a second Apple Store will open in Bangalore. </p><p>It’s been a pretty long road, getting from there to here. After all, India’s Foreign Direct Investment rules mandate that foreign companies source 30 percent of their parts from local sources. In addition, the country has insisted that big US companies partner with a local retailer to run the sales part of their business. In order to counter this, Apple began a building a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-17-apple-begins-building-iphones-in-india.html\">limited number of iPhone (SE) devices</a> in the country at partner factory Wistron’s plant in Karnataka. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>After Apple began building products in the country, and after plenty of glad-handing, India relaxed the retail rule in 2018. Even so, it’s taken a while for India to allow Apple (and other major foreign brands) to sell their wares direct to consumers online. And this plan was originally going to take place far earlier this year, but was disrupted by the effect of COVID-19. </p><p>Coronavirus has seen India’s economy contract by anything up to <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indian-economy-expected-to-contract-by-around-25-per-cent-in-the-first-quarter-of-fy21-report/articleshow/77739356.cms\">25 percent</a>, with its manufacturing, construction and service industries hardest hit. Despite this, analysts say that the country is now the world’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-25-india-now-second-largest-smartphone-market.html\">second-largest smartphone market</a> after China, making it a key battleground for big hardware makers. India is, however, nowhere near as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-07-analysts-predict-the-end-of-the-smartphone-boom.html\">wealthy</a> as other nations, and so much of this boom has been to the benefit of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-14-samsung-fights-phone-slump-with-india-models.html\">low-end</a> Chinese phone makers as well as domestic players.</p><p>The high price of the iPhone means that Apple has a paltry chunk of the country’s marketshare, with iOS holding <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/india\">3.35 percent</a> of the market.

After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laura_hudson/status/1298090524688166915\">teasing transcription support</a> last year, Microsoft is officially bringing the feature to Word for the web today, giving users an easy way to capture the text from their conversations. Like <a href=\"http://www.otter.ai/\">Otter.ai</a> and similar services, you can start transcription recordings live at the touch of a button, or upload audio and video clips. You’ll find the feature right under Word’s Dictate button, and transcribed text will appear in a new sidebar.</p><p>Based on my brief testing this morning, Word’s transcription capabilities seem  fairly accurate — or at least, as accurate as Otter’s competing solution. It was able to capture most of the text from an NPR radio segment while properly identifying multiple speakers. I could also edit the text in the sidebar, and name the individual speakers, before moving it over to the Word document. As with every cloud-based transcription service, accuracy will depend heavily on the quality of the recording.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2f7665e0-e6e1-11ea-bb6e-a323596c039a\" alt=\"Microsoft Word Transcription\" credit=\"Microsoft\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"622\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">Microsoft</div> </figure><p>As a reporter who interviews people frequently, I’ve grown to love using automatic transcription services. They’re not perfect, but they make it far easier to find specific quotes and organize my thoughts, all while focusing on the people I’m actually talking to. And now that transcription is built into Word, I have less of a reason to subscribe to Otter or other alternatives. </p><p>You’ll need a Microsoft 365 subscription to use the feature, naturally, and you’re also limited to five hours of transcription per month and 200MB file uploads. Transcriptions are <em>only</em> available on Word for the web right now, though Microsoft says it’s coming to the Word Android and iOS apps by the end of the year. It’s something I’d definitely love to see integrated into desktop Word apps eventually.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t forgotten about Word’s dictate feature either, which is better suited to jotting down text directly from your voice. You can now use voice commands while dictating to adjust formatting, add emojis, or even pause dictation to answer a phone call. It’s not exactly groundbreaking, but the upgrade makes Word’s solution more like dedicated software like Dragon Naturally Speaking. The enhanced dictation is available free to Word users on the web and mobile, and Microsoft says it’ll be available on the Word Mac and PC apps for Microsoft 365 users by the end of the year.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:00:26 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2f79c140-e6e1-11ea-adb7-001d7ca9e105","linkMd5":"d2388c96fb45fdd0de158e3c8f63ba5d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-12-39-843_0ce4ab0b194bb4f1.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1073,"sourceBytes":112198,"destBytes":34066,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2f79c140-e6e1-11ea-adb7-001d7ca9e105":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-12-39-843_0ce4ab0b194bb4f1.webp","https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2f7665e0-e6e1-11ea-bb6e-a323596c039a":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn29@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-13-19-799_425fc10885d59d9c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159493},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"Instagram brings in-app shopping cart to all US businesses","link":"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-checkout-expansion-facebook-shop-section-150010522.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-01/90afcc90-1445-11e9-9f7b-27e6a5976d82\" /><p>Instagram is finally flipping the switch on the in-app shopping cart it’s been testing for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-19-instagram-checkout-in-app-purchases.html\">more than a year</a>.

It'll last for up to 30 hours on a full charge while using the GPS functions and up to twice as long on the UltraMax mode.

But it’s not like we can launch rockets into space whenever we feel like it. In fact, NASA has developed a strict set of criteria that must be met before they can light the fuse on a Falcon 9 rocket. Here’s how they decide whether or not we can safely reach for the stars today.</p><p>Space, as you may have heard, is hard. Just figuring out when to set a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window\">launch window</a> depends on any number of factors including the goals and objectives of the mission, the Earth’s position relative to other celestial bodies, even the type of rocket used and its required trajectory to reach its target. The two biggest factors, however, are the spacecraft’s destination and its solar power. Some spacecraft may need full exposure to our local star to power themselves or may need to avoid the bright solar rays in order to study deep space. The launch window -- the span of time that a rocket can successfully launch during -- will therefore be different for putting an Earth-observing satellite into LEO versus launching a Dragon Capsule to precisely rendezvous with the ISS. The launch window for Mars missions, for example, is only open once every 26 months.</p><iframe src=\"https://dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/8uo2UF3?app=1&#38;iframe=card\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><p>The reason we only get a shot at Mars once every two plus years is due to their relative orbital positions in the solar system. We want Mars’ orbit to be as close to the Earth’s as possible so that we can huck a spacecraft to intercept it using as little fuel as possible, since the more fuel you have to carry to get there decreases the amount of capacity you have for cargo and supplies. Instead, we use Mars’ gravitation to help pull us along while the spacecraft “coasts” into orbit. This is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\">Hohmann transfer orbit</a> and while it is considered the most efficient means of moving between two planets, the timing has to be precise. If the spacecraft is launched too early or too late, it’ll miss the rendezvous point with its target.</p><iframe src=\"https://dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/sA2L7nF?app=1&#38;iframe=card\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><p>Adding to that challenge is the fact that both planets are not only moving through space, they’re revolving as well. This combination of forward and rotational momentum is why rocket launches don’t go straight up, but rather arc (below). <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/lets-go-to-mars-calculating-launch-windows/\">It’s like throwing a football</a>. The ball gets all of its energy with the initial throw and it follows a curved flight path leading the receiver (i.e. heading to where the receiver will be, not where they currently are) so that both the ball and its target arrive at the same point in space at the same moment in time.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/24dfb620-e6ed-11ea-9f8b-422a3b90d4fe\" alt=\"nasa launch\" credit=\"NASA\" creditUrl=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1996\" data-ops=\"\" /> <figcaption /> <div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div> </figure><p>\"You've got this object that's going to go flying out into the air and you've got to shoot it,\" Eric Haddox, lead flight design engineer in NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP), said in <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/launchwindows.html\">a 2012 press statement</a>. \"You have to be able to judge how far away your target is and how fast it's moving, and make sure you reach the same point at the same time.\"</p><p>\"To launch at any time other than that optimal time, you're going to have to alter the trajectory, steer the rocket to get back to that point,\" Haddox continued. \"So that's where it becomes a trade of, 'Okay, if my window were a half hour long, how much performance would I need to fly at any time within a half hour? Or, if my window were an hour long, how much performance would I be able to get out of the rocket to fly at any time within that one hour?'\"</p><p>For example, let’s say NASA wants to deliver supplies to the ISS. Flight engineers will calculate the ISS’ orbital trajectory to figure out when it will pass as close to directly overhead of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida as possible. This is known as the plane window. “If it passes directly over Kennedy Space Center, that’s our optimal time for launch,” NASA Flight Dynamics Officer, Richard Jones told <a href=\"https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-things-work-shuttle-launch-windows-3142572/\"><em>Air and Space</em></a> in 2002. “If it passes a few miles to the east or west, that’s okay but it will require some additional steering. And that takes additional fuel and adds stress to the external tank, which we want to minimize.”</p><p>The problem is that while the Earth is rotating at just over a thousand miles an hour, the ISS’ orbit is fixed in space. This means that on one of its 90 minute orbits of the Earth, the ISS might fly directly over Kennedy Space Center, but when it passes by again 90 minutes later, the Earth will have rotated and the ISS will fly over a point about 1000 miles west of Florida. As such, ISS resupply missions have a single launch window per day, since it takes 24 hours for the Earth to complete a rotation. </p><p>This is why SpaceX’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-iss-crewed-mission-launch-success-192904084.html\">successful second attempt to deliver astronauts</a> to the ISS occurred at roughly the same time of day as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-space-x-crew-dragon-falcon-9-launch-202116820.html\">the scrubbed first attempt</a> -- it’s when the station’s orbital trajectory would bring it closest to the coordinates of the Dragon Capsule’s launch site. Flight officers must also contend with the phase window. That’s the span of time that a rocket has to catch up and match speed with its orbiting target before it runs out of fuel. </p><p>This of course presumes that conditions on the ground won’t interfere with the launch or pose a safety threat to the crew. But when has Mother Nature ever cooperated? In the lead-up to a launch, NASA monitors weather both at the launch site and the surrounding region and reacts to adverse conditions in accordance with regulations set by the 12 points of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_commit_criteria\">lightning launch commit criteria</a> (LLCC). Atmospheric data is provided by the 45 Weather Squadron operating out of the nearby Patrick Air Force Base which keeps an eye out for thunderstorms, high winds, and low cloud cover. “Weather is the single largest source of launch delays and scrubs,” <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/649911main_051612_falcon9_weather_criteria.pdf\">notes a study out of Patrick AFB</a>.</p><p>For example, during the SpaceX crewed launch in May NASA kept an eye on storms up and down the Eastern seaboard since, if the astronauts had to bail, they’d splash down somewhere along there.</p><p>“We have a really complicated way of weighting different locations, depending on how much risk they have in terms of an escape,” Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, told <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/05/26/spacex-crew-launch-comes-with-new-weather-constraints-for-downrange-aborts/\"><em>Spaceflight Now</em></a> in May. “For the landing, there are also special parameters: winds, waves and wave direction.”</p><p>“Some of these individually have to go ‘green’ and be a ‘go,’ and then on the entire launch corridor we have a common risk number that we use to basically make an assessment, and then get to a go/no go decision,” he continued. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/649911main_051612_falcon9_weather_criteria.pdf\">nine conditions that will ground a prospective Falcon 9 launch</a> outright are:</p><ul>  <li><p>Sustained winds at the 162-foot level of the launch pad in excess of 35 mph.</p></li>  <li><p>The presence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear\">wind shear conditions</a>, which could lead to control problems for the launch vehicle.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch through a cloud layer greater than 4,500 feet thick that extends into freezing temperatures -- the Challenger was lost in 1986 due to a broken o-ring which cracked in chilly conditions.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch within 10 nautical miles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_clouds\">cumulus clouds</a> with tops that extend into freezing temperatures.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch within 10 nmi of the edge of an active thunderstorm within 30 minutes of the last observed lightning strike.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch within 10 nmi of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil_cloud\">anvil clouds</a>, which often generate strong winds and lighting.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch within 5 nmi of “weather clouds that extend into freezing temperatures and contain moderate or greater precipitation,” as they tend to produce damaging hail.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch within 3 nmi of a thunderstorm’s debris cloud.</p></li>  <li><p>Having to launch through cumulus clouds either formed from or currently attached to a smoke plume. Again due to the possibility of lightning strikes. </p></li> </ul><p> Two weather conditions will delay the launch for either 15 or 30 minutes:</p><ul>  <li><p>If field mill instruments (they measure the strength of magnetic fields in the atmosphere) within 5 nmi of the launch pad exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or +/- 1,000 volts per meter, the launch is delayed 15 minutes.</p></li>  <li><p>If lightning of any kind is observed within 10 nmi of the launch pad or flight path, that’s a 30 minute delay.</p></li> </ul><p>You’ll notice that most of these conditions are designed to mitigate lightning strikes, especially rocket triggered lightning strikes. This phenomenon occurs when the rocket and its electrically conductive exhaust pass through a sufficiently strong electrical field. The rocket condenses the field as it passes through by as much as two orders of magnitude (that is lighting is 100 times more likely to occur than naturally). This compression continues until the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_breakdown#:~:text=Although%20air%20is%20normally%20an,break%20down%2C%20becoming%20partially%20conductive.\">breakdown electric field of air</a> limit is exceeded and a lightning strike occurs. </p><p>These rules are in place due in part because during the Apollo 12 mission in 1969, the rocket passed through a cumulus cloud and triggered a lighting strike that damaged some nonessential equipment onboard the rocket. The crew was able to complete their mission but things could have gone sideways (and then groundways) dangerously quickly if that bolt had hit a vital component.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:46:14 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b9db5f50-e6f1-11ea-bd77-7ef79cff5bfe","linkMd5":"e61f9a8e4e6a229538d3b151e4fbeae9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-12-42-525_a3c7dc3cf0da6fb4.webp","destWidth":3000,"destHeight":1842,"sourceBytes":621257,"destBytes":112868,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b9db5f50-e6f1-11ea-bd77-7ef79cff5bfe":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-12-42-525_a3c7dc3cf0da6fb4.webp","https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/24dfb620-e6ed-11ea-9f8b-422a3b90d4fe":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn45@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-12-57-437_fe515090fcddd3ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159491},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"Chrome's new tab grouping feature brings order to chaos","link":"https://www.engadget.com/chrome-tab-groups-10-times-faster-160053379.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/8c5237d0-e6e1-11ea-affd-05670bbdb50f\" /><p>As promised, Google is bringing a new organization feature to tab hoarders.

Superfans -- who wouldn’t mind getting a new Xbox One X just months ahead of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-launch-november-191726809.html\">the release of the Xbox Series X</a> -- will have the chance to win two of the consoles.</p><p>The three consoles each reflect separate aspects of the film and comic series -- as though they’re straight from Amazonia. The Wonder Woman Golden Armor console matches the golden suit of armor worn by Wonder Woman in the upcoming film. The console and adjoining controller were “made entirely by hand” with 24-carat gold leaves, according to a statement from Microsoft.

The Barbara Minerva console, inspired by Wonder Woman’s main nemesis in <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>, has an intricate snakeskin pattern and faux leopard fur. This console isn’t available to buy or win, but was made for promotional purposes.</p><p>It would have been strange for Microsoft to roll out fancy branded Xbox One X consoles for sale, given that the company has already <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-one-x-one-x-discontinued-182312615.html\">discontinued the One X</a> and the Series X release is forthcoming. But as limited movie tie-ins to be auctioned for a good cause, it’s hard to find fault with these. <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> opens in theaters October 2nd.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:00:33 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2b885db0-e62f-11ea-affa-40615984c9b9","linkMd5":"982e3a17700c3ac5a609772af1d4c3c6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn69@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-12-39-761_75f5de264d9dc84b.webp","destWidth":1096,"destHeight":617,"sourceBytes":150605,"destBytes":116902,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/2b885db0-e62f-11ea-affa-40615984c9b9":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn69@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-12-39-761_75f5de264d9dc84b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159493},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"Samsung's Galaxy Buds+ drop to $130 on Amazon","link":"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-wireless-earbuds-sale-amazon-151425917.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/012dc450-e6e4-11ea-affb-76a721513719\" /><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds+ are great wireless earbuds for Android users and solid alternatives to AirPods now that they have their own iOS app. They’re also more affordable in Amazon’s latest sale that drops the price of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083KVM9VW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=productpost2020-20&#38;language=en_US\">Galaxy Buds+ to $130</a>. That’s $20 off their normal price and only $1 more than the lowest they ever have been.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083KVM9VW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=productpost2020-20&#38;language=en_US\" class=\"athena-button\">Buy Galaxy Buds+ at Amazon - $130</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Samsung debuted these true wireless earbuds back in February we gave them <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html\">a score of 83</a>, mostly because the company made some major improvements without messing with the good stuff. They have the same design as their predecessors, which is a good thing — the Buds+ are smaller than many competing wireless earbuds and they’re comfortable to wear for long stretches of time. They also still have touch controls that are somewhat customizable, but one-touch access to Spotify is only available to Android users despite the earbuds’ newfound iOS capabilities.</p><p>Speaking of which, you no longer have to fiddle with the Galaxy Wearables app on iOS to customize the Galaxy Buds+ because they now have their own dedicated app. This massively improves the experience for iPhone users as it makes it easier to customize features like EQ presets and touch controls. You also get clearer access to a battery life indicator in the app as well as the Find my Earbuds feature.</p><p>That alone makes the Galaxy Buds+ a more solid alternative to Apple’s AirPods, but Samsung’s other improvements sweeten the deal. Sound quality is much better thanks to help from Samsung’s subsidiary AKG and new exterior microphones do a better job capturing your voice, rather than outside noise, while you’re on a call. Samsung also increased the battery life to 11 hours on the Buds+, and they come with a wireless charging case that holds additional hours of battery life (unlike with Apple’s AirPods, you don’t have to pay extra for wireless charging capabilities).</p><p>But the biggest feature that the Galaxy Buds+ are lacking is active noise-cancellation, which is a bummer considering all of the new true wireless earbuds that have been coming out with that feature (including Samsung’s own <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html\">Galaxy Buds Live</a>, which aren’t as easy to recommend). However, such a feature would certainly increase the price of the Buds+ to well over their normal $150 starting price. The Buds+ are also only IPX2 rated, so you’ll want to try not to drop them in a puddle or get them too sweaty when you’re working out. But those are small sacrifices to make for otherwise solid wireless earbuds, especially when you get get them on sale for $20 less.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:14:25 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/012dc450-e6e4-11ea-affb-76a721513719","linkMd5":"12b303e7fd86a17b5653cfef5ace8840","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-12-39-812_91305127c0dbfde8.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":1067,"sourceBytes":185046,"destBytes":99824,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/012dc450-e6e4-11ea-affb-76a721513719":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-12-39-812_91305127c0dbfde8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159492},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"DJI’s next smartphone gimbal might have a magnetic quick mount system","link":"https://www.engadget.com/dji-osmo-mobile-4-gimbal-leak-134024108.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a7f6d4f0-e6d7-11ea-afb1-d6b5cc442f6b\" /><p>It looks like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/dji\">DJI</a> is preparing to launch a new smartphone gimbal.

When the company introduced its Osmo Mobile 3, it made the gimbal foldable and redesigned its shape so that it didn’t block the charging and audio ports like the Osmo 2. One of the biggest complaints with the Osmo 3 was the attachment mechanism, so it makes sense that it would be DJI’s focus this time around.</p><p>As for software, it looks like there’s a new dynamic zoom that automatically zooms out as the camera moves forward. Aside from that, we can expect Osmo Mobile 3 features, like gesture controls and hyperlapse, to carry over.</p><p>According to <em>WinFuture</em>, the new device will cost just under €150 (about $177) and come with a 2450 mAh battery that will last up to 15 hours.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 13:40:24 +0000","feedId":339,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a7f6d4f0-e6d7-11ea-afb1-d6b5cc442f6b","linkMd5":"3f7b9ae4d8f07578bf113d7d26b9e2ac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-12-39-735_bc45f3583eafeffb.webp","destWidth":1152,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":68776,"destBytes":10262,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a7f6d4f0-e6d7-11ea-afb1-d6b5cc442f6b":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-12-39-735_bc45f3583eafeffb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598379159493},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:12:39","title":"'Predator: Hunting Grounds' will let you play as young Arnie","link":"https://www.engadget.com/predator-hunting-grounds-arnie-arnold-schwarzenegger-172902517.html","description":"\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/bed5b760-e6f3-11ea-bf61-285ca2f97839\" /><p>Although you could already <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dutch-predator-hunting-grounds-dlc-may-26-161110866.html\">play as Arnold Schwarzenegger’s iconic character Dutch</a> in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-10-ps4-illfonic-predator-hunting-ground.html\"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a>, it was an older version of Major Alan Schaefer to fit with the game’s more modern setting.

On September 16th, the company will go forward with its annual AR/VR conference, except it will be held virtually. Most important of all, however, is that it will no longer be called Oculus Connect. Instead, it will now be known as Facebook Connect. </p><p>“Connect has grown to include so much more than Oculus, with research updates and product news from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-01-instagram-third-party-ar-filters.html\">Spark AR</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-oculus-social-vr-world-facebook-horizon.html\">Facebook Horizon</a>,” said the company in a blog post. “Moving forward our annual AR/VR event will be called Facebook Connect to better reflect its broader scope.” Since it’ll be virtual, the company said that the event will be completely free and open to the public for the first time. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Further, the company is changing the name of its internal AR/VR team to Facebook Reality Labs (or FRL). FRL was the name previously given to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-14-facebook-researchers-are-building-virtual-spaces-to-improve-ai-a.html\">company’s research division</a>, which in turn used to be known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/oculus-research-is-now-the-facebook-reality-lab/\">Oculus Research</a>. That team will now be known as FRL Research, and will still be led by Chief Scientist Michael Abrash. </p><p>In a statement, Facebook said: “Before today, we lacked a unified brand identity from which to tell the story of how we’re building the future of VR and AR, With the Facebook Reality Labs name, we’re making clear where these technologies are coming from.”</p><p>Facebook has also clarified that it is not doing away with the Oculus name. It still plans on making Oculus-branded VR headsets and Oculus is still at the heart of Facebook’s VR efforts. It’s just that the Oculus Connect event has evolved to include various Facebook’s AR/VR projects over the years. </p><p>Be that as it may, fans might not be so pleased with the name change. There was already a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-login-account-policy-backlash-160034955.html\">backlash</a> last week when the Oculus fan community balked at the need for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-account-policy-192552362.html\">a Facebook login</a> to use Oculus headsets. The further melding of Oculus into Facebook might not be what people want.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:00:26
