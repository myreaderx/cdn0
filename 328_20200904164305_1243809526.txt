I actually think the Pixel 5 is going to be a boring yet surprisingly fun phone. Let me try to unpack that.</p> \n<p>What <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/02/google-pixel-5-what-do-we-know-so-far/\">we know so far about the Pixel 5</a> is that it’ll <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/03/13/pixel-5-lineup-might-not-be-the-high-end-phones-youd-expect/\">run a Snapdragon 765G</a> (<a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/05/11/qualcomms-snapdragon-768g-is-all-about-more-accessible-5g/\">or something close to that</a>), have 5G, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, 5.8″ 90HZ AMOLED display with 90Hz refresh rate, 4000mAh battery with wireless charging, rear fingerprint reader, and a dual rear camera featuring 12.2MP main as well as secondary wide-angle cameras. None of that sounds particularly noteworthy until you consider that the phone may <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/05/18/google-survey-hints-at-349-pixel-4a-699-pixel-5-prices/\">cost somewhere between $600 and $700</a>.</p> \n<p>With that set of specs, Google’s 3 years of software support, and what we assume will be the best still camera setup on the planet for a smartphone, I can’t come up with another phone to consider that you would or could buy for that much money. The only phone that comes somewhat close is the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/oneplus-nord\">OnePlus Nord</a>, with a very similar set of specs, slightly lesser software support, and a camera best described like you would a Beyond Burger.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-271256\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a\" width=\"980\" height=\"653\" data-wp-pid=\"271256\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-1366x911.jpg 1366w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Specs and price aside, because that can’t be the whole story, I also like this idea that Google is just doing whatever the hell they want. For example, there isn’t a Pixel 5 XL (yet) and so we have a single phone at a really incredible size. <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/08/21/pixel-5-renders-return-of-the-fingerprint-reader/\">CAD renders measure in</a> at almost identical marks as the Pixel 4a, with a similar screen size. As someone who just got done <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/08/17/google-pixel-4a-review-that-price-is-nice/\">reviewing the Pixel 4a</a>, I can tell you that the size, weight, and easy-to-mange size were super refreshing.</p> \n<p>I know there will be folks mad about no XL and the smallish screen size compared to their current 6.7″ <del>tablets</del> phones. I also think that if people get one in hand, they’ll have similar feelings to those that the Pixel 4a brought out in me. We haven’t had many phones in recent years that were manageable. We’ve all settled into this oversized-or-bust idea that keeps getting worse.</p> \n<p>Speaking of weight, there is a chance that the Pixel 5 is plastic instead of glass, at least <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/08/23/so-this-is-the-pixel-5-and-pixel-4a-5g/\">according to this rumor</a>. Again, that might offend some of the all-glass-everything bros, but plastic is actually pretty great on phones. It’s lightweight. It doesn’t crack. It allows for wireless charging. And it’ll probably help cut costs. Should Google try and at least up the quality of the plastic over the Pixel 4a to something nicer like we saw on the Pixel 3a, you’ll find no complaints here. Plastic does not have to mean cheap <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2018/04/23/why-does-everyone-think-all-glass-smartphones-are-premium/\">just as glass doesn’t mean premium</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-271255\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a\" width=\"980\" height=\"653\" data-wp-pid=\"271255\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-1366x911.jpg 1366w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Let’s not forget that as a part of that hardware, you get Google’s vision for Android, where that means more than just security patches and version updates. When you buy a Pixel phone now, it gets regular Pixel Feature Drops that continue to improve a phone with software innovations not always available to other Android phones. Google has already<a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2019/12/09/pixel-phones-first-pixel-drop-features/\"> issued at least</a> <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/03/02/googles-march-feature-drop-for-pixel-phones-official-includes-dark-theme-scheduling/\">three to its Pixel</a> <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/06/01/latest-pixel-feature-drop-includes-adaptive-battery-improvements-safety-check-feature/\">phones over the past 9 months</a>. I can’t see them stopping this any time soon either.</p> \n<p>Wrapping up, we may only get one or two colors and one size, there won’t be any wild design highlights to help the phone standout, and the front is going to be a big flat slab of glass with a hole punch camera. It could be plastic. It likely has close-to-mid-range specs. It will be boring. On the flip side, there will be a crazy good camera. It’ll have the best software support in Android. It’s software feature set will only grow over time. It may only cost $700 (or under).</p> \n<p>I worry that the Pixel 5 will be dismissed by the Spec Squad, but that may be a foolish move. I don’t need a bronze phone that could double as a kettle bell. Times are different. The Pixel 5 is shaping up to be that – different.</p> \n<p>We’ve grown accustomed to owning these $1,000 phones that are like luxury items. We have to baby them. We care so much about every little spec because of their cost. The dumbest things matter. With a $700 Pixel 5, you might not care so much about any of that. You’ll reach for your phone because it’s a tool that will help you get things done. It’ll do the important stuff well. It’ll let you live a little more. 2020 sucks, so bring on the boring phone that leaves a bunch of cash left in the bank.</p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/gBLrOZgsNYM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 21:07:17 +0000","feedId":328,"bgimg":"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-980x653.jpg","linkMd5":"999347c5702290f18bf5a63330f987ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn6@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-38-219_5073a64273de7f3b.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":653,"sourceBytes":77978,"destBytes":38096,"author":"Kellen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-4-980x653.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn6@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-38-219_5073a64273de7f3b.webp","https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-4-XL-Pixel-4a-5-980x653.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-54-194_067fa9f35ed21d94.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-38-008_632c39cbd7770819.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn20@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-53-162_ba93a88a5466e91f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=gBLrOZgsNYM:sRHawdCGKCA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn29@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-42-53-067_1d71d0c8a7255877.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn81@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-52-930_0fa97b23504da6fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/gBLrOZgsNYM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-53-058_d50c20b938f416c6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237757915},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","title":"OnePlus 8T Reported to Offer 6.5″ 120Hz Display, Ton of Rear Cameras, Android 11","link":"https://www.droid-life.com/?p=271228","description":"<p>Read the original post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/03/oneplus-8t-reported-to-offer-6-5-120hz-display-ton-of-rear-cameras-android-11/\">OnePlus 8T Reported to Offer 6.5″ 120Hz Display, Ton of Rear Cameras, Android 11</a></p> \n<p>Thanks to a report from <em>Android Central</em>, we’re getting a solid understanding of what to expect from OnePlus’ next smartphone, the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/oneplus-8t\"><strong>OnePlus 8T</strong></a>.</p> \n<p>According to the report, the OnePlus 8T will pack some exciting specs, including a 6.55″ AMOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. While that’s the same size as the OnePlus 8’s display, that bump up to 120Hz will be sweet. Additionally, expect to see a ton of cameras on the 8T’s backside, with the report indicating four rear cameras — 48MP primary lens, 16MP wide-angle, 5MP macro, and 2MP portrait.</p> \n<p>It’s noted that the 8T utilizes an entirely different image sensor versus the OnePlus 8, so we should expect different results than what we see on the OnePlus 8.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271062\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1013\" height=\"749\" data-wp-pid=\"271062\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1.jpg 1013w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1-270x200.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1-980x725.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1-768x568.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1-1200x887.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Reported OnePlus 8T Image</em></p> \n<p>Other specs include a Snapdragon 865+ processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, as well as OxygenOS 11 based on Android 11. Basically, a solid second half of 2020 pickup for OnePlus fans, especially if OnePlus has upped the imaging performance from the rear camera.</p> \n<p>As for launch, it’s expected this phone will be unveiled towards the end of September or in the first week of October. The OnePlus 7T also arrived at the end of September, so that timing makes sense.</p> \n<p>Let’s take some price guesses since we’re here. Right now, the OnePlus 8 can be had for $699. For the 8T, I’m going with a guess of $759.</p> \n<p>// <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/exclusive-oneplus-8t-has-120hz-amoled-display-48mp-quad-rear-cameras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Android Central</a></p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/3-CtA55C8Zo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 19:28:29 +0000","feedId":328,"bgimg":"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1.jpg","linkMd5":"eab42bdcc02811386e15e8bc049eeb37","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-38-108_1e2a8748fce2e1fd.webp","destWidth":1013,"destHeight":749,"sourceBytes":36064,"destBytes":15212,"author":"Tim","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OnePlus-8T-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-38-108_1e2a8748fce2e1fd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-38-008_632c39cbd7770819.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn70@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-53-057_d2e8ff0d39e467c4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=3-CtA55C8Zo:Tno4FeVp1MU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn57@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-53-082_3e9ceca8799340eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn81@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-52-930_0fa97b23504da6fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/3-CtA55C8Zo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn35@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-53-033_30b81cf6287dc1ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237757918},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","title":"Google Pixel 5: What Do We Know So Far?

(Updated: September 1)</a></p>\n<p>The <strong>Google Pixel 5</strong> is shaping up to be one of the weirdest in Google&#8217;s phone story. Not only is it expected during a global pandemic, but Google may be moving this new version of the Pixel out of the ultra high-end phone category and into a space hundreds of dollars lower than usual.</p>\n<p>The pool of info surrounding Google&#8217;s next flagship phone isn&#8217;t deep just yet, since we wouldn&#8217;t typically prepare for a Google Pixel 5 until October. Still, following the story so far has revealed a handful of interesting bits and because this is Google, our attention is here.</p>\n<p>This is everything we know about the Google Pixel 5.</p>\n<h2>What is the Pixel 5?</h2>\n<p>Assuming the name sticks, this would be the 5th generation flagship phone from Google, following the Pixel (2016), Pixel 2 (2017), Pixel 3 (2018), and Pixel 4 (2019). Each of those previous phones came as two different models, a regular and XL, though there is already evidence suggesting that Google will skip the XL this year and release a regular 5 only.</p>\n<p>The name, while you may think is unofficial this early, has <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/07/10/google-pixel-4a-5g-and-pixel-5-names-appear-to-be-confirmed/\">essentially been confirmed at this point by Google</a>. Within a beta version of the Google App, the name &#8220;Pixel 5&#8221; was discovered alongside other Pixel phones, including yet-to-be-released Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a (5G) devices.</p>\n<p>We have also seen <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/02/17/hello-google-pixel-5-reference/\">references to the Pixel 5 in AOSP</a> as far back as February, which came after the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/01/16/new-pixel-4a-codenames-might-be-here/\">first 2020 Pixel codenames</a> surfaced. Those codenames arrived as “redfin,” “sunfish,” and “bramble.” All evidence to date points to sunfish as the Pixel 4a, redfin as the Pixel 4a (5G), and bramble as the Pixel 5. So you know, previous Pixel phones had difference codenames <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2019/10/24/first-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl-factory-images-now-available-and-there-are-3-of-them/\">for regular and XL models</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond references to the phone, what else do we have?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-267391\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL-980x654.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 2 XL\" width=\"980\" height=\"654\" data-wp-pid=\"267391\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL-980x654.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-2-XL.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>A specs list is starting to grow</h2>\n<p>Again, with no phone expected for months, the Pixel 5 specs list is almost completely unknown. We&#8217;re pretty sure that the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/03/13/pixel-5-lineup-might-not-be-the-high-end-phones-youd-expect/\">phone will run a Snapdragon 765G</a> (<a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/05/11/qualcomms-snapdragon-768g-is-all-about-more-accessible-5g/\">or 768G</a>), have 5G, feature a &#8220;best in class&#8221; camera, charge with wireless charging, and keep the elements out with water resistance. We could see <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/02/19/pixel-5-may-feature-battery-share-for-reverse-wireless-charging/\">reverse wireless charging too</a>.</p>\n<p>The rest is a mystery, like whether or not we&#8217;ll only get a dual camera again. Will Motion Sense and Project Soli radar return? Will there be a 90Hz or 120Hz display? Is Active Edge dead? Will we get more than 6GB RAM and a starting storage (finally) higher than 64GB? Last year&#8217;s Pixel 4 battery weighed in under 3000mAh &#8211; Google can&#8217;t make that mistake again, right?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">UPDATE JULY 30</span></strong>: While not official, an <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/07/30/google-camera-teardown-hints-at-upcoming-features-no-pixel-5-xl/\">unpack of a Google Camera app</a> could be hinting at upcoming Pixel 5 camera features like a dedicated Motion Blur function, audio zoom functionality for video recording, flash intensity settings, and quick video sharing options similar to what we have now for photos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As this story has evolved in recent months, we currently believe the Pixel 5 will feature a 90Hz display, 4000mAh battery, Snapdragon 765G processor, 8GB RAM, 12.2MP main camera with secondary wide-angle lens, 8MP selfie camera, plastic body, rear fingerprint reader, and wireless charging.</p>\n<p>The thing is, we need Google to do a better job of leaving out the gimmicks and nailing essentials. That may be tough to do at the price they may be targeting.</p>\n<h2>What if the Pixel 5 is $699?</h2>\n<p>With a Snapdragon 765G onboard and not Qualcomm&#8217;s over-priced Snapdragon 865, Google has an opportunity to price the next Pixel phone well below its competitors. There&#8217;s still no proof that it will, <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/05/18/google-survey-hints-at-349-pixel-4a-699-pixel-5-prices/\">but a survey in May gave us hope</a> that a $699 starting price is being considered.</p>\n<p>The survey compared a Google Pixel phone with the basics, a plastic body, and a headphone jack for $349, to another phone labeled as &#8220;Premium Google Pixel Phone.&#8221; The premium phone would have the &#8220;best flagship&#8221; experience, a top tier camera, first access to Google features and innovation, and a price of $699.</p>\n<p>For further comparison, we can look at other Snapdragon 765G phones to see if that&#8217;s even realistic. As it turns out, it is. The <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/06/15/samsung-galaxy-a71-5g-arrives-this-week-dope-phone-at-599/\">Samsung Galaxy A71 5G released with the same chip</a>, a large full HD AMOLED display, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, 4500mAh battery with 25W fast charging, and a quad rear camera system for $599. The OnePlus Nord is coming with (rumored) <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/07/14/oneplus-nord-everything-we-know-just-not-a-price/\">similar specs and a sub-$500 price</a>. The LG Velvet could arrive within this price range too.</p>\n<p>Should Google stick to that Qualcomm processor, ditch Motion Sense, and give us the rest of the goods, I don&#8217;t see why they couldn&#8217;t hit that $700 price.</p>\n<h2>What does it look like?</h2>\n<p>This is where the Pixel 5 rumor world gets a little shaky. Up until now, the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/07/06/supposed-pixel-5-renders-show-a-familiar-phone-design-fingerprint-reader/\">only leak claiming to be of the new Google Pixel phone</a> is what you are seeing below. It comes from a newish leaker who says that the images are &#8220;based on leaked CAD drawings,” sort of like we have seen with numerous other phones in the past.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-266931\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-980x731.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 5\" width=\"980\" height=\"731\" data-wp-pid=\"266931\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-980x731.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-270x201.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-768x573.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-1536x1145.jpg 1536w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-1366x1018.jpg 1366w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-1920x1431.jpg 1920w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1-1200x895.jpg 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Pixel-5-1.jpg 2047w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Most of the time, CAD renders are right, but something feels off about these. For one, leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1280168001799630850\">@onleaks</a> isn&#8217;t sold on them and has since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1281928120879194113/photo/1\">shared</a> a few variations that he says are floating about. In his renders, you can see he&#8217;s suggesting there are designs for a regular Pixel 5, Pixel 5 XL, and Pixel 5 XL 5G in the wild, even though we already told you there isn&#8217;t yet evidence of more than one Pixel 5 device.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-267394\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-980x528.jpeg\" alt=\"Pixel 5 CAD Renders\" width=\"980\" height=\"528\" data-wp-pid=\"267394\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-980x528.jpeg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-270x145.jpeg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-768x414.jpeg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-1536x827.jpeg 1536w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-2048x1103.jpeg 2048w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-1366x736.jpeg 1366w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-1920x1034.jpeg 1920w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pixel-5-CAD-Renders-1200x646.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p>\n<p>These images also showcase a design with a rear fingerprint reader, a backside incredibly close to last year&#8217;s Pixel 4, and a front that would require Google to ditch Motion Sense, a new technology that has only been used once.</p>\n<p>To recap, these CAD drawings are out there and no one is quite sure what to make of them.

In addition to the new sports channels, the rest of the Viacom line-up could go live shortly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">UPDATE</span></strong>: YouTube TV now lists all of the sports channels that will certainly be a part of an announcement. We&#8217;ve got more details <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/02/youtube-tv-now-listing-nfl-network-redzone-and-more-as-available-networks/\">right here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These discoveries were a part of several reddit threads in the YouTube TV subreddit, where a number of users stumbled onto listings for new channels while doing searches. Doing a search for &#8220;sports plus,&#8221; for example, was showing what has been captured at the top of this post.</p>\n<p>In that image, you can see an advertisement for Sports Plus, with icons for RedZone, GOLTV, TVG, Stadium, Fox Soccer Plus, MAV TV, and more. Additional searches brought up temporary listings for beIN, NFL Network, MLB Strike Zone, and the missing Viacom networks, like Nick Jr., NickToons, MTV2, MTV Classic, etc.</p>\n<p>Google hasn&#8217;t announced any of this yet and I wasn&#8217;t able to find the listings, but with so many showing up for a period of time, I can&#8217;t imagine an announcement is far off. The only question now is, how much is this going to cost us?</p>\n<p>At least one reddit user said he was able to find trial information on the Sports Plus package that showed a 5-day free trial, with a $15/mo fee afterwards. While that sounds reasonable, I&#8217;m struggling to envision a world where NFL Network, beIN, and some of the non-sports package channels are added without a price hike.

My Buds+ get crazy-good battery life, fit my ears perfectly, and sound amazing. While the Buds Live have fine battery life (up to 8 hours), the fit and feel of these buds, along with what I’d label as a “just ok” listening experience make me feel that all potential buyers should just opt for the less expensive Galaxy Buds+.</p> \n<p>Allow me to discuss a couple of these points in detail.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271153\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"867\" data-wp-pid=\"271153\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23.jpg 1300w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23-980x654.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></a></p> \n<h3>Fit and Feel</h3> \n<p>The Galaxy Beans as we like to call them look awesome and straight from the future. The problem is, I suppose I have funky ears because anyway I stick these buds in, they don’t feel all that great. However, I’m the same person who can’t stand the feel of AirPods, and those are apparently loved by millions of people, so take my comments on fit and feel however you’d like.</p> \n<p>Now, there’s no sense that they’re going to fall out or anything, they’re perfectly snug in there, but they’re simply not as comfortable as my Buds+ and for $169, that’s a bit of a downer. I appreciate the feel of squishy rubber tips in my ears, not a hardened plastic, which is why I love my Buds+ so much in this department.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271131\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"898\" data-wp-pid=\"271131\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23.jpg 1300w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23-270x187.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23-980x677.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23-768x531.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23-1200x829.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></a></p> \n<p>For those who do get a good fit with these buds, I don’t think you’ll need to worry about them jostling loose or anything like that. The only thing you’ll want to take note of before purchase is that I think these buds don’t provide a great seal and quite a bit of ambient noise can get in due to the design. However, with active noise cancellation, something my Buds+ don’t have, you can eliminate a good amount of outside sound.</p> \n<h3>Sound Quality</h3> \n<p>Each Buds product from Samsung has an EQ that can be tweaked from the Wearables app. For the most part, everyone should be running the Dynamic EQ, as it provides the best scoop on highs, mids, and lows, but if you’re more into podcasts or something with a lot of spoken word, I’d recommend the Soft setting. For pop and hip-hop fans, check out the Bass Boost EQ. It’s not overly obnoxious in the low end and both the Buds Live and Buds+ have pretty darn good bass considering their size.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271155\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"867\" data-wp-pid=\"271155\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware-.jpg 1300w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware--270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware--980x654.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware--768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware--1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Unfortunately, there’s no manual band manipulation allowed inside the Wearables app, which is something I’d like to see Samsung offer in the future, but know that the audio EQ you have on your phone will affect how these Buds Live sound, too. On Samsung phones, the “Sound quality and effects” menu allows you to access various sound presets, as well as a 9-band EQ.</p> \n<p>I have to go back to comparing these Buds Live to my Buds+ because I’ve been using the Buds+ since I first got them back in February of this year. In terms of straight sound comparison, the Buds+ sound much more full and robust to my ear, which is due to overall design of the products. However, while I believe the Buds+ to be superior in sound, the Buds Live aren’t bad at all. Once you get them in your ears just right, they can make some great sounds, with the noise cancellation helping you really immerse yourself in whatever it is you’re listening to.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271134\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"867\" data-wp-pid=\"271134\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23.jpg 1300w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23-980x654.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></a></p> \n<h3>Features</h3> \n<p>For $169, Samsung packed in what feels like as much as they could into these little beans. Buyers get the noise cancellation I already mentioned, touch controls for controlling media playback and accessing Bixby and Spotify, as well as a Bixby wake-up feature that isn’t present on my beloved Galaxy Buds+.</p> \n<p>For touch controls, I have my left and right ear touchpads set to activate noise cancellation, though, you can set them to Bixby, Volume down/up, and Spotify. What has always triggered me is that users cannot customize these touchpads much beyond Samsung’s presets. For example, if I wanted noise cancellation on the right side and volume down on the left, I can’t do that. However, you can have noise cancellation set to one side and Spotify to the other, which can be useful for Spotify users.</p> \n<p>For all you Bixby fans, the wake-up feature can be cool, so long as all you want to do is simply actions. For example, using just your voice, you can get weather information, call contacts, and control other apps on your device. To use this, you’ll need to go through the Bixby setup process on your Samsung device.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-271137\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"867\" data-wp-pid=\"271137\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23.jpg 1300w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23-270x180.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23-980x654.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></a></p> \n<h3>Battery</h3> \n<p>Much like my Galaxy Buds+, I haven’t had any issues with the battery on the Galaxy Buds Live. I’ve gone on a few bike rides and dog walks and had plenty of juice left, so I’m inclined to believe it when Samsung says these should have no issue giving you quite a few hours of usage on a single charge. According to Samsung, you can expect 5.5 hours of life when using ANC and Bixby active listening turned on or up to 8 hours with both of those features disabled. I’ve been using them disabled and haven’t had a problem.</p> \n<h3>Should You Buy?</h3> \n<p>As I’ve alluded to, just go with the Galaxy Buds+, folks. While these beans look plenty sweet, you’re getting a way better audio experience from the Buds+. For those who want earbuds for working out, the Buds+ have a much tighter feel in your ear, allowing you to workout hard and not have to worry about anything moving around. Plus, Samsung even rates the battery life way better on the Buds+.</p> \n<p>Honestly, besides looking good, I’m just not sure why the Buds Live were made. Sure, they offer the noise cancellation, but you don’t need that on the Buds+ because of the seal they offer your ears. Seriously, in the categories I use to rank my earbuds, this whole review just feels like a big advertisement for the Buds+.</p> \n<p>If you take one thing away from this post, it should be that the Buds Live are a fine device, but the Buds+ are better.</p> \n<h3>Buy: <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds-live-mystic-bronze-sm-r180nznaxar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Buds Live</a> ($169) | <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds-plus-white-sm-r175nzwaxar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Galaxy Buds+</a> ($129)</h3> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/fz6ZsnjRPtU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 20:49:57 +0000","feedId":328,"bgimg":"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23.jpg","linkMd5":"427217de7b44ebcede3d71bfb1d1917c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn2@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-42-51-795_78d9ed121494ad7e.webp","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":867,"sourceBytes":250679,"destBytes":94790,"author":"Tim","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-2-of-23.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn2@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-42-51-795_78d9ed121494ad7e.webp","https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-23-of-23.jpg":null,"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Sooftware-.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-42-53-114_7d15c080ee515c0d.webp","https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-21-of-23.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn71@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-42-53-179_48866e7c964f2efd.webp","https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Galaxy-Buds-Live-17-of-23.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn25@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-42-53-295_b41d633772bdecaa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-38-008_632c39cbd7770819.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn34@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-54-180_fad1bd6c36a3a1c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=fz6ZsnjRPtU:hNIHQPot27M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-53-026_03a1fcc32de25bd6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn81@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-52-930_0fa97b23504da6fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/fz6ZsnjRPtU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-42-54-031_47fdd61ed626f799.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237757917},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","title":"TCL Details New Tablets and Wireless Earbuds, US Availability Not Likely","link":"https://www.droid-life.com/?p=271213","description":"<p>Read the original post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/03/tcl-details-new-tablets-and-wireless-earbuds-us-availability-not-likely/\">TCL Details New Tablets and Wireless Earbuds, US Availability Not Likely</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/tcl\"><strong>TCL</strong></a> announced a suite of new products during this year’s IFA event. Unfortunately, the products don’t appear slated for release in the US anytime soon, but we can still fill you in on what’s new just in case that changes. What we’ll focus on are TCL’s new tablet and wireless earbuds, but also know that the company announced a smartwatch designed specifically for seniors. Very nice.</p> \n<p>The tablets are called <strong>TCL 10 TABMID</strong> and <strong>TCL 10 TABMAX</strong>. The TABMID features an 8-inch FHD IPS display, Snapdragon 665 processor, 5,500mAh battery, fingerprint sensor, 5-megapixel front facing camera, 8-megapixel rear facing camera, and both WiFi and 4G connectivity.</p> \n<p>It will be available in select markets beginning in Q4 for €229.

Could it be the LG <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/wing\"><strong>Wing</strong></a>, recently <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/08/26/lg-wing-spotted-in-maserati-looks-funky-but-in-a-good-way/\">spotted on the streets of South Korea</a>? From what LG is teasing in its video and accompanying press release, that’s our guess, with an unveiling now set for September 14.</p> \n<p>In the video’s description, LG says, “Explorers across the world, celebrate with us on the 14th as we unveil our newest device to the world. Discover the unexplored – to unearth the new and unexpected ways of enriching your life through LG.”</p> \n<p>Such majestic. Much LG, but it also says a lot without actually saying anything. The press release that goes along with the video is much, much more telling.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The invitation letter is about 20 seconds long, and the main display rotates clockwise to form a ‘T’ shape, and at the same time, the screen hidden in the back also reveals a ‘new form factor’ that is different from the previous one.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Yup, this must be the Wing, folks.</p> \n<p>The livestream kicks off at 10AM ET on September 14.

With <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/01/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-arrives-september-18-for-2000/\">shipments expected by September 18</a>, you will be separating from up to $2,000 today, should you decide to buy one, without ever having touched the device. That&#8217;s crazy, and yes, we ordered two because this is the phone we have been waiting all year for.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in Mystic Black or Mystic Bronze at Samsung&#8217;s store, Verizon, AT&#38;T, T-Mobile, Best Buy, and Amazon. Unlike the original Galaxy Fold, this one should be easier to get your hands on.</p>\n<h2>Best Galaxy Z Fold 2 deal</h2>\n<p>There really aren&#8217;t a lot of deals on the new Galaxy Z Fold 2, unless you have a newish phone to trade-in to Samsung or Verizon. Depending on the trade, you could save up to $800 with Samsung, though that would mean you have an original Galaxy Fold or Galaxy Z Flip to give them. The next highest value Samsung is offering is $650 for a Galaxy S20 Ultra. Verizon is only going as high as $550 back.</p>\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s trade-in deal is the better of the two, as they give you the value of your trade-in as a discount off purchase today (ex: trade in a Z Flip and you&#8217;d pay $1,200 today). You&#8217;ll send that device in later, once your new Z Fold 2 arrives to prove you weren&#8217;t lying about your trade-in. It&#8217;s our favorite trade-in program in the business.</p>\n<p>Other values from Samsung are $550 for S20+. $500 for Note 10+ or Note 10 5G, $470 for S20, and $360 for an S10+. The highest value for an iPhone trade is $500 for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The highest for a Google phone is $290 for a Pixel 4 XL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Pre-order Galaxy Z Fold 2 from Samsung</strong></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Other options</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-5g/\">Verizon</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gOrwMj\">Amazon</a> | <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-5g-256gb-unlocked-black/6426273.p?skuId=6426273\">Best Buy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Customize Galaxy Z Fold 2 with Samsung</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-271164\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-980x575.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Galaxy Z Fold 2\" width=\"980\" height=\"575\" data-wp-pid=\"271164\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-980x575.jpg 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-270x159.jpg 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-768x451.jpg 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-1366x802.jpg 1366w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-1200x705.jpg 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Planning to order from Samsung and want a custom Galaxy Z Fold 2 that isn&#8217;t just bronze or black? If you order directly, Samsung will let you pick the color of the hinge. You could have a Mystic Bronze or Black Z Fold 2 with a silver, gold, red, or blue hinge. The Mystic Black model with alternate colors looks amazing.</p>\n<p>They are saying (currently) that it will take about 5 weeks to make your special Z Fold 2, so from this day 1 of pre-orders, that might mean an arrival in early October. Since you aren&#8217;t a YouTuber or tech blog bro who needs to start their coverage of this device immediately, I&#8217;m thinking the wait could be worth it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Customize your Galaxy Z Fold 2</strong></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?a=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/joEstymDEpk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 04:57:05 +0000","feedId":328,"bgimg":"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-980x575.jpg","linkMd5":"4d11fb36ccc2eee1cd99ba991d16a423","destWidth":980,"destHeight":575,"sourceBytes":43729,"destBytes":29934,"author":"Kellen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Custom-Galaxy-Z-Fold-2-980x575.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-38-008_632c39cbd7770819.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn89@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-42-53-683_0e1d7dcadcc5ecf5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?i=joEstymDEpk:w4QnGANZ12g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn95@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-53-089_293aa84968f770a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/DroidLife?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn81@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-42-52-930_0fa97b23504da6fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DroidLife/~4/joEstymDEpk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn63@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-42-52-968_17ef33edaa309b6d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237757915},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:42:37","title":"Samsung Now Makes Its Own Fancy Triple Wireless Charging Station, Announces Set of New Devices","link":"https://www.droid-life.com/?p=271185","description":"<p>Read the original post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/02/samsung-now-makes-its-own-fancy-triple-wireless-charging-station-announces-set-of-new-devices/\">Samsung Now Makes Its Own Fancy Triple Wireless Charging Station, Announces Set of New Devices</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/samsung\"><strong>Samsung’s</strong></a> on a roll this week, announcing a gang of products following yesterday’s availability announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/tag/galaxy-z-fold-2\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>.

That should mean that everyone just gets NFL Network, while the other channels are all going to be available as an add-on. Thursday Night Football, y&#8217;all!</p>\n<p>Once YouTube TV announces the new sports line-up and a price, we&#8217;ll update this post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a

original post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/09/02/t-mobile-fires-up-2-5ghz-5g-in-80-cities-and-its-actually-a-big-deal/\">T-Mobile Fires Up 2.5GHz 5G in 80 Cities and It&#8217;s Actually a Big Deal</a></p>\n<p>The story of 5G over the past two years hasn&#8217;t been one to pay much attention to. Carriers have forced the logo on your phone and likely had a hand in making you pay for the technology that pushes it, all while your experience on their network hasn&#8217;t changed much. You either had &#8220;5G&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t any faster than your previous LTE connection, or you were told there was 5G somewhere in your city, on a random block, that could maybe produce 2Gbps speeds if you were standing on a street corner. In other words, 5G has been a bust.</p>\n<p>Today, T-Mobile is firing up 5G you should actually care about.</p>\n<p>When T-Mobile bought Sprint, they <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2020/04/21/t-mobile-and-sprint-already-making-big-5g-moves-upgrading-customer-connections/\">acquired a bunch of 2.5GHz spectrum</a> that will be used as mid-band 5G and will be a portion of a 5G network that will produce meaningful speeds and connections. T-Mobile has had <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2019/12/02/t-mobile-just-turned-on-its-nationwide-5g-network/\">&#8220;nationwide&#8221; 5G for a while as low-band 5G</a>, but it&#8217;s mostly like an LTE connection in terms of speeds and experience. Mid-band 5G is worth paying attention to.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile says it has turned on mid-band 5G in over 80 cities and towns as of this morning. With this mid-band (2.5GHz) 5G, you could see speeds 7.5x greater than your current LTE connection. T-Mobile has suggested average download speeds around 300Mbps with peaks hitting 1Gbps.</p>\n<p>To get a better feel for the importance of mid-band, T-Mobile&#8217;s layer cake graphic does a great job of explaining. Below, you can see the low-band 5G, the reach it has without the speeds (height in the cake). The mid-band might not reach as far, but it can still spread over large distances, while creating faster speeds. Then you have 5G mmW at the top, which is the super fast 5G that can barely work properly through a window and is more like a WiFi hotspot used in dense cities and stadiums. The mid-band is a good balance of reach and speed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-263873\" src=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network-980x613.png\" alt=\"T-Mobile Mid-Band 5G Network\" width=\"980\" height=\"613\" data-wp-pid=\"263873\" srcset=\"https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network-980x613.png 980w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network-270x169.png 270w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network-768x480.png 768w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network-1200x750.png 1200w, https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T-Mobile-Mid-Band-5G-Network.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As a part of today&#8217;s news, T-Mobile released a list of cities that now have access to their mid-band 5G.
