The accelerator announced today that it will keep its two-day Demo Day virtual, but instead of offering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/y-combinator-moves-its-online-demo-day-forward-one-week/\">pre-recorded pitches on-demand</a>, the entire program will be streamed live.</p>\n<p>In an e-mail, Y Combinator said the feedback was that &#8220;founders enjoyed the bonding experience involved in prepping for a live demo day and investors like seeing the founder pitch their businesses personally.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve decided that a live Demo Day is an important part of founders’ YC experience,” <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/michael-seibel\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"michael-seibel\">Michael Seibel, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Y Combinator’s CEO, <a href=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-s20-virtual-demo-day/\">wrote in a blog post.</a></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The thirty-first Demo Day will be live over Zoom, splitting the batch between two days. Each company will have one minute to present, with a single-slide summary, description and team bio available on the website for attendees to peruse. If you can’t attend, recordings will be published at the end of the week.</p>\n<p>The accelerator told TechCrunch that presentations will kick off at 9 a.m. PST and end at noon, with breaks scheduled throughout the day. Similar to past Demo Days, investors will be able to indicate interest in investing and share contact information with founders through YC Demo Day software.</p>\n<p>Startups that deferred Demo Day in years past will present at the upcoming Demo Day. Deferring to present on Demo Day is fairly common and happens when founders are not yet ready to present their startup to the VC and tech press community. In a remote world, some startups may opt for this route until things turn back to normal (if that ever happens, of course).</p>\n<p>For founders participating in remote accelerators, a question remains: Is the new format worth the equity? Y Combinator says that the most recent cohort is the first batch to participate in an entirely remote program, run entirely through the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>\n<p>Founders recently shared with me the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/without-desks-and-a-demo-day-are-accelerators-worth-it/\">ups and downs of this accelerator season</a>. One founder, Michael Vega-Sanz, recommends that first-time founders attend a physical accelerator instead of a virtual one for the energy it brings.</p>\n<p>“If you’re a competitive person, like we were, you’ll see other companies kicking butt, getting praised in front of everybody,” he said. “I know this sounds a bit narcissistic, but we were like, ‘Damn, we really need to pick our game up.’ ” Peer competition might sound insignificant, but founders, much like investors, thrive on FOMO and rivalries.</p>\n<p>Y Combinator going live feels like an attempt at bringing excitement and earnestness to the pitch experience. Techstars did a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1255242114532868096\">live, virtual demo day</a> earlier in the pandemic, even bringing on Ice-T to congratulate the founders participating through a Cameo.</p>\n<p>YC Demo Day will be August 24 and 25.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6OXUJCKSWi\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/without-desks-and-a-demo-day-are-accelerators-worth-it/\">Without desks and a demo day, are accelerators worth it?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Without desks and a demo day, are accelerators worth it?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/without-desks-and-a-demo-day-are-accelerators-worth-it/embed/#?secret=6OXUJCKSWi\" data-secret=\"6OXUJCKSWi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/jaDrRpeirN8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:45:08 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/yc-all-demo-day-2017.png?w=711","linkMd5":"8bee53ca8182e76c7103ae2842e6e785","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn49@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992143776_baeb502d2186382e.webp","author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn70@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143344_2dd64f6cd7555981.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jaDrRpeirN8:x7auR_ScL0U:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992143352_ff155f733aedef06.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/jaDrRpeirN8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn82@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144304_5980d4a85a6c925d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Microsoft’s new Family Safety app offers parental controls across phones, PCs and Xbox","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023563","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> new screen time and parental controls app, Microsoft Family Safety, is today <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/28/microsoft-family-safety-app-helping-protect-what-matters-most/?ref=403-redirect\">launching</a> publicly on iOS and Android, following a preview of the experience which had <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/05/11/new-microsoft-family-safety-app-now-available-preview-ios-android/\">arrived</a> earlier this spring. The app is designed to help parents better understand children&#8217;s use of screen time, set limits and create screen time schedules, configure boundaries around web access, and track family members&#8217; location, among other things.</p>\n<p>The app competes with other parental control technologies, including those built into iOS and Android &#8212; the latter of which is also available as a standalone app, called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink\">Family Link</a>. Like its competitors, Microsoft Family Safety will work best for those who have already bought into the company&#8217;s own ecosystem of products and services. In Microsoft&#8217;s case, that includes Windows 10 PCs and Xbox devices, for example.</p>\n<p>Also like many screen time apps, Family Safety displays an activity log of how screen time is being used by kids. It can track the hours spent on devices, including Windows computers, phones, and Xbox, as well as across websites and apps. It can also show the terms kids are searching for online.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023585\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023585\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2023585\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?w=320\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023585\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>A weekly report is emailed to parents and kids, with the hopes of encouraging discussions around healthy use of screen time. This was already a complicated subject before the pandemic. But now, with kids attending school at home and filling summer downtime with hours in games while parents still try to work without childcare, it&#8217;s grown to be even more complicated.</p>\n<p>Initially, parents may have just given up on screen time altogether, grateful for anything that allowed them that gave them moments of peace. But with staying at home becoming a new normal, many families are now reconsidering what amount of screen time is healthy and how much is too much.</p>\n<p>With the new app, parents can set screen time limits that apply across devices &#8212; including Xbox. These limits can be narrowly configured to allow for access to educational apps that facilitate online learning, while limiting other types of screen time &#8212; like gaming, for instance. When kids run out of time, they can ask for more and parents can choose whether or not to grant it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the web filtering aspects of the new app take advantage of Microsoft&#8217;s newer browser, Microsoft Edge across Windows, Xbox, and Android. The app will allow parents to set search filters and block mature content. Other content controls will notify parents if the child tries to download a mature game or app from the Microsoft Store, as well.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023587\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023587\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2023587\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?resize=768,370 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?resize=680,328 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Parents can also control purchases by granting approval to kids&#8217; requests, so there won&#8217;t be surprise bills later.</p>\n<p>Plus, the app&#8217;s built-in location sharing means families can skip downloading additional family locator apps, like Life360, for access to basic location tracking features &#8212; like those that show family members on a map and lets you save favorite locations, like &#8220;Home.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023586\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023586\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2023586\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Connect.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"357\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>\n<p>Since its preview period, Microsoft has expanded the app&#8217;s capabilities to include a handful of new features, including one that lets you block and unblock specific apps, a location clustering feature, and an expanded set of options for granting more screen time (e.g 15 or 30 mins., 1, 2, or 3 hours, etc.). Accessibility options were also updated and improved, including improved visual contrast for low vision users and additional context for screen readers.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll note, however, that some of Family Safety&#8217;s experience don&#8217;t fully extend to iOS and Android, like purchase controls and web filtering. On iOS, the app can&#8217;t even track screen time usage as Apple makes no API available for this, even after launching its own screen time service and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/\">shutting down competing apps</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s due to how other platforms have their own operating systems and ecosystems locked down to encourage customers to only buy and use their devices. Unfortunately, that means families that have devices from a variety of vendors &#8212; like iPhone users who also game on Xbox, or Android users whose computer is a Mac, for instance &#8212; don&#8217;t have simple tools that let them manage everything from one place.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says it will soon roll out two new features to Family Safety following its launch. These include location alerts and drive safety (e.g. aimed teen drivers),, and will be a part of a paid Microsoft 365 Family Subscription.</p>\n<p>The new Family Safety app is rolling out now for <a href=\"https://aka.ms/FamilySafety/iOS\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://aka.ms/FamilySafety/Android\">Android</a> as a free download. You may not be able to immediately access the app due to its phased rollout, but should sometime this week.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CUkMKZrnF2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 19:55:03 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?w=320","linkMd5":"f7b4ace25a56695fb111e22864048d6b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn29@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992114507_340493f9cef4b0df.webp","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Microsoft-Family-Safety-app-2.jpg?w=320":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn29@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992114507_340493f9cef4b0df.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Buying.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992144721_0ecae1adf42da492.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Family-Safety-Connect.gif?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn34@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992145277_db2136c06a97ff11.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992143344_c19bd9b06954338f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=CUkMKZrnF2U:xDxSrTGceJI:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn10@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992143357_36c6069a7406d347.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CUkMKZrnF2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn65@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992143304_044a6cd8e2c57336.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Alcohol delivery service Drizly confirms data breach","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023532","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Online alcohol delivery startup <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/drizly\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"drizly\">Drizly <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has told customers that it was hit by a data breach.</p>\n<p>In an email to customers obtained by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"techcrunch\">TechCrunch, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> the company said that a hacker &#8220;obtained&#8221; some customer data.

It can acquire other firms and make decisions separately from SAP.</p>\n<p>We spoke to a few industry analysts to find out what they think about all this, and while the reasoning behind the move involves a lot of complex pieces, it could be as simple as the deal was done under the previous CEO, and the new one was ready to move on from it.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0Cys5icCtT\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/\">SAP will spin out its $8B spin-in Qualtrics acquisition</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;SAP will spin out its $8B spin-in Qualtrics acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/embed/#?secret=0Cys5icCtT\" data-secret=\"0Cys5icCtT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Bold step</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s certainly unusual for a company like SAP to spend this kind of money, and then turn around so quickly and spin it off. In fact, Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that this was a move he didn&#8217;t see coming, and it could be related to that fat purchase price. &#8220;To me it could mean that SAP didn&#8217;t see the synergies of the acquisition panning out as they had envisioned and are looking to recoup some of their investment,&#8221; Leary told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst with Constellation Research agreed with Leary&#8217;s assessment, but doesn&#8217;t think that means the deal failed. &#8220;SAP doesn’t lose anything in regards to their [&#8230;] data and experience vision, as they still retain [controlling interest in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"qualtrics\">Qualtrics] <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. It also opens the opportunity for Qualtrics to partner with other ERP vendors [and broaden its overall market],&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Jeanne Bliss, founder and president at CustomerBLISS, a company that helps clients deliver better customer experiences sees this as a positive step forward for Qualtrics. &#8220;This spin off enables Qualtrics to focus on its core business and prove its ability to provide essential technology executives are searching for to enable speed of decision making, innovation and customization,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<h2>Show me the money</h2>\n<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &#38; Strategy sees the two companies moving towards a VMware/Dell model where SAP removes the direct link between them, which could then make them more attractive to a broader range of customers than perhaps they would have been as part of the SAP family. &#8220;The big play here is all financial. With tech stocks up so high, SAP isn&#8217;t seeing the value in its stock. I am expecting a VMware kind of alignment with a strategic collaboration agreement,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Ultimately though, he says the the move reflects a cultural failure on the part of SAP. It simply couldn&#8217;t find a way to co-exist with a younger, more nimble company like Qualtrics. &#8220;I believe SAP spinning out Qualtrics is a sign that its close connection to create symbiotic value has failed. The original charter was to bring it in to modernize SAP but apparently the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; attitudes kicked in and doomed integration,&#8221; Moorhead said.</p>\n<p>That symbiotic connection would have involved McDermott&#8217;s vision of combining operational and customer data, but Leary also suggested that since the deal happened under previous the CEO, that perhaps new CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/christian-klein\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"christian-klein\">Christian Klein <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> wants to start with a clean slate and this simply wasn&#8217;t his deal.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hjFMBo1lHO\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/and-then-there-was-one-co-ceo-jennifer-morgan-to-depart-sap/\">And then there was one: Co-CEO Jennifer Morgan to depart SAP</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;And then there was one: Co-CEO Jennifer Morgan to depart SAP&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/and-then-there-was-one-co-ceo-jennifer-morgan-to-depart-sap/embed/#?secret=hjFMBo1lHO\" data-secret=\"hjFMBo1lHO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<h2>Qualtrics for the win</h2>\n<p>In the end, Qualtrics got all that money, gets to IPO after all, and returns to being an independent company selling to a larger potential customer base. All of the analysts we spoke to agreed the news is a win for Qualtrics itself.</p>\n<p>Leary says the motivation for the original deal was to give SAP a company that could sell beyond its existing customer base. &#8220;It seems like that was the impetus for the acquisition, and the fact that SAP is spinning it off as an IPO 20 months after acquiring Qualtrics gives me the impression that things didn&#8217;t come together as expected,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mueller also sees nothing but postivies Qualtrics. &#8220;It’s a win [&#8230;] for Qualtrics, which can now deliver what they wanted [from the start], and it&#8217;s a win for customers as Qualtrics can run as fast as they want,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the company moves on, and the Qualtrics IPO moves forward, and it&#8217;s almost as though Qualtrics gets a do-over with $8 billion in its pocket for its trouble.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JIbKLD6Q8h\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/why-is-sap-spinning-qualtrics-out-via-an-ipo/\">Why is SAP spinning Qualtrics out via an IPO?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Why is SAP spinning Qualtrics out via an IPO?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/why-is-sap-spinning-qualtrics-out-via-an-ipo/embed/#?secret=JIbKLD6Q8h\" data-secret=\"JIbKLD6Q8h\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AHSyUcPpiMQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:46:56 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"3af23f8ddf3c5fe8cf8604b05c9f1550","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn86@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992143352_29cab3a176312c5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AHSyUcPpiMQ:kzpW0idi0-w:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn10@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992144278_e7193fb171ba0831.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AHSyUcPpiMQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn98@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144351_8032c23063de3f26.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Facetune maker Lightricks brings its popular selfie retouching features to video","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023389","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.lightricks.com/\">Lightricks</a>, the startup behind <a href=\"https://www.lightricks.com/products\">a suite</a> of photo and video editing apps &#8212; including most notably, selfie editor Facetune 2 &#8212; is taking its retouching capabilities to video.

And these edits can be applied in real-time to see how they look as the video plays, instead of after the fact.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In addition, users can apply the effect to one frame only and Facetune Video&#8217;s post-processing technology and neural networks will simultaneously apply an effect to the same area of every frame throughout the entire video, making it easier to quickly retouch a problem area without having to go frame-by-frame to do so.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Facetune Video, the 3D face model plays a significant role; users edit only one video frame, but it&#8217;s on us, behind-the-scenes, to automatically project the location of their edits to 2D face mesh coordinates derived from the 3D face model, and then apply them consistently on all other frames in the video,&#8221; explains <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightricks\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lightricks\">Lightricks <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Zeev Farbman. &#8220;A Lightricks app needs to be not only powerful, but fun to use, so it’s critical to us that this all happens quickly and seamlessly,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>Users can also save their favorite editing functions as &#8220;presets&#8221; allowing them to quickly apply their preferred settings to any video automatically.</p>\n<p>In a future version of the app, the company plans to introduce a &#8220;heal&#8221; function which, like Facetune, will allow users to easily remove blemishes.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023441\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023441\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2023441\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg 6636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=768,311 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=1536,623 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=2048,830 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Facetune-Video_Image.jpg?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lightricks</p></div></p>\n<p>The technology that makes these selfie video edits work involves Lightricks&#8217; deep neural networks that utilize facial feature detection and geometry analysis for the app&#8217;s retouching capabilities. These processes work in real-time without having to transmit data to the cloud first. There&#8217;s also no lag or delay while files are rendering.</p>\n<p>In addition, Facetune Video uses the facial feature detection along with 3D face modeling A.I. to ensure that every part of the user&#8217;s face is captured for editing and retouching, the company says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we’re also doing is taking advantage of lightweight neural networks. Before the user has even begun to retouch their selfie video, A.I.-powered algorithms are already working so that the user experience is quick and interactive,&#8221; says Farbman.</p>\n<p>The app also does automated segmentation of more complex parts of the face like the interior of the eye, hair, or the lips, which helps it achieve a more accurate end result.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s finding a balance between accuracy in the strength of the face modeling we use, and speed,&#8221; Farbman adds.</p>\n<p>One challenge here was overcoming the issue of jittering effects, which is when the applied effect shakes as the video plays. The company didn&#8217;t want its resulting videos to have this problem, which makes the end result look gimmicky, so it worked to eliminate any shake-like effects and other face tracking issues so videos would look more polished and professional in the end.</p>\n<p>The app builds off the company&#8217;s existing success and brand recognition with Facetune. With the new app, for example, the retouch algorithms mimic the original Facetune 2 experience, so users familiar with Facetune 2 will be able to quickly get the hang of the retouch tools.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023448\" style=\"width: 381px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023448\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2023448\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?w=371\" alt=\"\" width=\"371\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg 1048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=82,150 82w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=164,300 164w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=768,1408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=371,680 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=838,1536 838w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-1.01.02-PM.jpg?resize=27,50 27w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: Lightricks</strong></p></div></p>\n<p>The launch of the new app expands Lightricks further in the direction of video, which has become a more popular way of expressing yourself across social media, thanks to the growing use of apps like TikTok and features like Instagram Stories, for example.</p>\n<p>Before, Lightricks&#8217; flagship video product, however, was <a href=\"https://www.lightricks.com/products#product_videoleap\">Videoleap</a>, which focused on more traditional video editing, and not selfie videos where face retouching could be used.</p>\n<p>Facetune has become so widely used, its name has become a verb &#8212; as in, &#8220;she facetunes her photos.&#8221; But it has also been criticized at times for its unrealistic results. (Of course, that&#8217;s more on the app&#8217;s users sliding the smoothing bar all the way to end.)</p>\n<p>Across its suite of apps, which includes the original Facetune app (Facetune Classic), Facetune 2, Seen (for Stories), Photofox, Video Leap, Enlight Quickshot, Pixaloop, Boosted, and others, including a newly launched artistic editor, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/quickart-one-tap-photo-editor/id1503066339\">Quickart</a>, the company has generated over 350 million downloads.</p>\n<p>Its apps also now reach nearly 200 million users worldwide. And through its subscription model, Lightricks is now seeing what Farbman describes as revenues that are &#8220;increasing exponentially year-over-year,&#8221; but that are being continually reinvested into new products.</p>\n<p>Like its other apps, Facetune Video will monetize by way of subscriptions. The app is free to use by will offer a VIP subscription for more features, at a price point of $8 per month, $36 per year, or a one-time purchase of $70.</p>\n<p>Facetune 2 subscribers will get a discount on annual subscriptions, as well. The company will also sell the app in its Social Media Kit bundle on the App Store, which includes Facetune Video, Facetune 2, Seen and soon, an undisclosed fourth app. However, the company isn&#8217;t yet offering a single subscription that provides access to all bundled apps.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

id=\"speakable-summary\">In March, Brooklynite Jeremy Cohen achieved minor internet fame when he launched an elaborate scheme to court Tori Cignarella, a cute stranger living in a nearby building.</p>\n<p>After spotting Cignarella across an air shaft, Cohen used drones, Venmo, texting and FaceTime to interact with his socially distanced crush. But it was on their second date when Cohen pulled out all the stops. He purchased a gigantic plastic bubble, sealed himself inside and invited his new friend to go on a touchless walk. As Cohen wrote on Instagram, “just because we have to social distance doesn’t mean we have to be socially distant.”</p>\n<p>Cohen’s quirky, DIY approach made for fun clickbait for a few days. But it’s also a somewhat unflattering metaphor for the kinds of touch-centric entrepreneurialism that has proliferated in the age of COVID-19. From dating to banking, education to retail, the virus has pushed everyone to rethink how touch and proximity factor into daily interactions. Businesses besieged by the uncertainty of shutdown orders, partial re-openings, remote work, disease spikes and changing consumer behavior have been forced to test-drive solutions on the fly.</p>\n<p>Amid that confusion, a few common approaches have emerged. Some are rushing to return to normalcy, adopting quick fixes at the expense of more broad-based solutions. Others are using the pandemic as an excuse to accelerate technological shifts, even those that may be unwelcome, impractical or both. Still others are enforcing guidelines selectively or not at all, tempting consumers back, in part, through the promise of “normal” (read: non-distanced and non-regulated) interactions.</p>\n<p>Enter haptics. Investment in touch technologies had been on the rise before COVID-19, with virtual reality fueling fresh interest in haptic gloves and full-body suits, and haptics for mobile devices like wearables and smartwatches infusing the field with new resources. While it is difficult to capture the health and growth of the haptics industry with a single number, one estimate puts the global haptics market at <a href=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2832340/haptics-global-market-trajectory-and-analytics\">US$12.9 billion in 2020,</a> projected to grow to US$40.9 billion by 2027.</p>\n<p>In addition to established players like <a href=\"https://www.immersion.com/\">Immersion Corporation</a>, founded in 1993 and active working on haptics applications ranging from gaming and automotive to medical, mobile and industrial, Sony, Apple, Microsoft, Disney and Facebook each have dedicated teams working on new haptics products. Scores of startups, too, are currently bringing new hardware and software solutions to market: Ultraleap (formerly Ultrahaptics), a Bristol-based company that develops <a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/haptics/\">midair haptics</a>, has secured $85 million in funding; HaptX, which makes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lgyvr7vsJs\">exoskeleton force feedback gloves</a> for use in VR and remote manipulation, has raised $19 million in funding; and Neosensory, focused on routing sound through the skin with a wrist-based wearable <a href=\"https://neosensory.com/\">Buzz</a>, has received $16 million in funds. A recent industry-wide initiative <a href=\"https://hapticsindustryforum.org/\">intended to make it easier to embed haptics in multimedia content</a> suggests that we could soon see growth in this area accelerate even further.</p>\n<p>Despite these trends, the business of touch isn’t heading in one clear direction. And with such variety in business responses, customers have responded with confusion, frustration, anxiety and defiance. More than disgruntlement, though, COVID-19 shines a light on a longstanding debate over whether the future will have more touch or less. Tensions around touch were already high, but rapid changes, Band-Aid solutions and short-term thinking are making the problems worse.</p>\n<p>What’s needed now is a longer view: serious, systematic thinking about where we &#8212; as consumers, citizens, humans &#8212; want and need touch, and where we don’t. To get there, we need greater investment not just in technologies that sound good, but ones that will deliver on real needs for connection and safety in the days ahead.</p>\n<h2>Plexiglass is the new mask</h2>\n<p>While the mask may be the most conspicuous symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic in much of the world, the new normal has another, clearer symbol: plexiglass.</p>\n<p>Plexiglass leads the way as our environments are retrofitted to protect against the virus. In the U.S., demand began rising sharply in March, driven first by hospitals and essential retailers like grocery stores. Traditional sectors like automotive are using much less of the stuff, but that difference is more than made up for by the boom among restaurants, retail, office buildings, airports and schools. Plexiglass is even popping up in temples of bodily experience, surrounding <a href=\"https://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/dancers-protected-by-plexiglas-at-popular-vancouver-strip-club\">dancers at strip clubs</a>, <a href=\"https://kesq.com/news/2020/05/03/palm-desert-spa-owner-invents-unique-device-as-they-prep-for-new-normal-to-keep-clients-safe/\">clients at massage parlors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/coronavirus-workout-california-gym-trnd/index.html\">gymgoers in fitness centers</a>.</p>\n<p>Like plexiglass itself, the implications for touch are stark, if invisible. Plexiglass may communicate sterility and protection &#8212; though, truth be told, it dirties often and it’s easy to get around. More to the point, it puts up a literal barrier between us.</p>\n<p>The story of plexiglass &#8212; like that of single-use plastic, ventilation systems, hand sanitizer and ultraviolet light &#8212; underscores how mundane interventions often win the day, at least initially. It is much easier for a grocery store to install an acrylic sneezeguard between cashiers and customers than it is to adopt contactless shopping or curbside pickup. At their best, interventions like plexiglass are low-cost, effective and don’t require huge behavior changes on the part of customers. They are also largely reversible, should our post-pandemic lifestyles revert back to something more closely resembling our previous behaviors.</p>\n<p>Besides their obvious environmental consequences, plasticized approaches can erode our relationship to touch and thereby to each other. In Brazil, for example, some nursing homes have installed &#8220;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/18/americas/brazilian-care-home-hug-tunnel-scli-intl/index.html\">hug tunnels</a>&#8221; to allow residents to embrace family members through a plastic barrier. Given that &#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1280295188196462595\">when will I be able to hug my loved ones again?&#8221;</a> is a common and heart-wrenching question these days, the reunions hug tunnels facilitate are, well, touching. But as a shadow of the real thing, they amplify our desperate need for real connection.</p>\n<p>The same with circles on the floor in elevators or directional arrows down store aisles: In expecting us to be our best, most rational and most orderly selves, they work against cultural inclinations toward closeness. They indicate not so much a brave new future as a reluctant present. And without proper messaging about their importance as well as their temporariness, they are bound to fail.</p>\n<h2>Touch tech to the rescue</h2>\n<p>To feed our <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skin-hunger-coronavirus-human-touch\">skin hunger</a>, futurists are pushing haptic solutions — digital technologies that can replicate and simulate physical sensations. Haptics applications range from simple notification buzzes to complex whole-body systems that combine vibration, electricity and force feedback to <a href=\"https://teslasuit.io/\">re-create the tactile materiality of the physical world</a>. But although the resurgence of VR has rapidly advanced the state of the art, very few of these new devices are consumer-ready (one notable exception is <a href=\"https://cutecircuit.com/the-hug-shirt/\">CuteCircuit’s Hug Shirt</a> — released for sale earlier this year after 15+ years in development).</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/knocki\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"knocki\">Haptics <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> are typically packaged as part of other digital techs like smartphones, video game controllers, fitness trackers and smartwatches. <a href=\"https://www.bhaptics.com/tactsuit/\">Dedicated haptic devices remain rare and relatively expensive</a>, though their imminent arrival is widely promoted in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSp1dM2Vj48\">popular media</a> and the popular technology press.

Using cheaper components compromises haptic fidelity, and at this point, what counts as an acceptable quality of haptic simulation remains ill-defined. We don’t have a tried and tested compression standard for haptics the way we do with audio, for instance; as Immersion Corporation’s Yeshwant Muthusamy recently argued,<a href=\"https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/analog/article/21125846/haptics-is-ready-for-standardization\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/analog/article/21125846/haptics-is-ready-for-standardization&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFYbZMFdY-9FK5E5tygLvxlu5IaYQ\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/analog/article/21125846/haptics-is-ready-for-standardization\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/analog/article/21125846/haptics-is-ready-for-standardization&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFYbZMFdY-9FK5E5tygLvxlu5IaYQ\">haptics has been held back by a problematic lack of standards</a>.</p>\n<p>Getting haptics right remains challenging despite more than 30 years&#8217; worth of dedicated research in the field. There is no evidence that COVID is accelerating the development of projects already in the pipeline. The fantasy of virtual touch remains seductive, but striking the golden mean between fidelity, ergonomics and cost will continue to be a challenge that can only be met through a protracted process of marketplace trial-and-error. And while haptics retains immense potential, it isn’t a magic bullet for mending the psychological effects of physical distancing.</p>\n<p>Curiously, one promising exception is in the replacement of touchscreens using a combination of hand-tracking and midair haptic holograms, which function as button replacements. This product from Bristol-based company Ultraleap uses an array of speakers to project tangible soundwaves into the air, which provide resistance when pressed on, effectively replicating the feeling of clicking a button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/cen-ultraleap-touchless-tech/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/cen-ultraleap-touchless-tech/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGJynpfPJ3teeXsvabp-0c8sBegZQ\">Ultraleap recently announced that it would partner with the cinema advertising company CEN</a> to equip lobby advertising displays found in movie theaters around the U.S. with touchless haptics aimed at allowing interaction with the screen without the risks of touching one. These displays, according to Ultraleap, “will limit the spread of germs and provide safe and natural interaction with content.”</p>\n<p>A recent study carried out by the company found that more than 80% of respondents expressed concerns over touchscreen hygiene, prompting Ultraleap to speculate that we are reaching <a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/end-of-public-touchscreens/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/end-of-public-touchscreens/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFeSh0jR0qOgmmMpTS5JNy--QqUwA\">“the end of the [public] touchscreen era.”</a> Rather than initiate a technological change, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to push ahead on the deployment of existing technology. Touchscreens are no longer sites of naturalistic, creative interaction, but are now spaces of contagion to be avoided. Ultraleap’s version of the future would have us touching air instead of contaminated glass.</p>\n<h2>Touch/less</h2>\n<p>The notion that touch is in crisis has been a recurring theme in psychology, backed by scores of studies that demonstrate the negative neurophysiological consequences of not getting enough touch. <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/losing-touch-another-drawback-of-the-COVID19-pandemic-67542\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/losing-touch-another-drawback-of-the-COVID19-pandemic-67542&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNEjbMiCznhlYEAimskpjihzNIOFDQ\">Babies who receive insufficient touch show higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol</a>, which can have all kinds of negative effects on their development. In prisons, for example, being deprived of touch through restraint or solitary confinement is <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGACYThGhGNJPlPxmCS_MVkeLp1Tw\">a punishment tantamount to torture</a>. As technology continues to make inroads into our lives, interactions that once required proximity or touch have become mediated instead, prompting ongoing speculation about the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3gzba/the-life-of-the-skin-hungry-can-you-go-crazy-from-a-lack-of-touch\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3gzba/the-life-of-the-skin-hungry-can-you-go-crazy-from-a-lack-of-touch&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNER259Oz_nkzErBpoeY2shkMxQRzQ\">communicating by technology rather than by touch</a>.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic intensifies this crisis by demanding a sudden, collective withdrawal from physical contact. The virus lays a cruel trap: the longer we’re apart, the more we crave togetherness and are willing to take dangerous risks. But giving in to the desire to touch not only exposes us and those we care about to a potentially mortal danger, it also extends the amount of time before we can resume widespread touching.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has already revealed important lessons about touch, haptics and humanity. First is that while circumstances can change quickly, true social and behavioral change takes longer. The many examples of Americans acting as though there is no pandemic going on should give pause to anyone thinking touch-free futures are just around the corner. Atop this, there is plain-old inertia and malaise, which suggests some pandemic-era interventions will stick around while others will disappear or slacken over time. Consider 9/11 &#8212; nearly two decades later, though we still can’t greet our loved ones at their gate, most airports don’t strictly monitor our liquids and gels.</p>\n<p>By the same token, one can imagine unfilled hand sanitizer stations as the ultimate hangover from these times. We may begin to like the plexiglass barriers between ourselves and our fellow subway passengers, but hate them at restaurants and sporting events. We may encounter more motion-detecting sliding doors and hand-tracking options, but when they falter we may revert to revolving doors, handles and push-buttons.</p>\n<p>A second and equally important insight is that the past and the future exist side by side. Technological development takes even longer than behavioral change, and can be bedeviled by momentary trends, expense and technological limitations. For example, there are a lot of pressures right now to transform stores and restaurants into “last-mile” fulfillment centers, to embrace AR and VR and to reimagine space as contact-free. In these scenarios, objects could be touched and handled in virtual showrooms using high-fidelity digital touch technologies. But some of this pressure is based on promises that haptics have yet to fulfill. For instance, <a href=\"https://tanvas.co/\">being able to touch clothing through a mobile phone may be possible in theory</a>, but would be difficult in practice and would mean other trade-offs for mobile phones’ functionality, size, weight and speed.</p>\n<h2>Touch/more?</h2>\n<p>But just as the coronavirus pandemic did not create making us miss touching, it also did not create all the problems with touching. Some of the touch we were used to &#8212; like the forced closeness of a crowded subway car or the cramped quarters of airline seats &#8212; is dehumanizing. Social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have drawn attention to how unwanted touch can have traumatic consequences and exacerbate power imbalances. We must think broadly about the meaning of touch and its benefits and drawbacks for varying types of people, and not rush toward a one-size-fits-all solution. Although touch may seem like a fundamentally biological sense, its meaning is continually renegotiated in response to shifting cultural conditions and new technologies. COVID-19 is the most rapid upheaval in global practices of touching that we’ve seen in at least a generation, and it would be surprising <em>not</em> to see a corresponding adoption of technologies that could allow us to gain back some of the tactility, even from a distance, that the disease has caused us to give up.</p>\n<p>Too often, however, touch technologies prompt <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/01/feel-the-force-haptics-could-soon-make-all-your-ready-player-one-dreams-come-true/\">a &#8220;gee whiz&#8221; curiosity without being attentive to the on-the-ground needs</a> for users in their daily lives. Businesses looking to adopt haptic tech must see through the sales pitch and far-flung fantasies to develop a long-term plan for where touch and touch-free make the most sense. And haptic designers must move from a narrow focus on solving the complex engineering problem touch presents to addressing the sorts of technologies users might <em>comfortably</em> incorporate into their daily communication habits.</p>\n<p>A useful exercise going forward is to consider how would we do haptic design differently knowing we’d be facing another COVID-19-style pandemic in 2030? What touch technologies could be advanced to satisfy some of the desires for human contact? How can firms be proactive, rather than reactive, about haptic solutions? As much as those working in the field of haptics may have been motivated by the noble intention of restoring touch to human communication, this mission has often lacked a sense of urgency. Now that COVID-19 has distanced us, the need for haptics to bridge that physical gap, however incompletely, becomes more obvious and demanding.</p>\n<p>Businesses feel it too, as they attempt to restore “humanity” and “connection” to their customer interactions. Yet as ironic as it might feel, now is the time not to just stumble through this crisis &#8212; it’s time to prepare for the next one. Now is the time to build in resilience, flexibility and excess capacity. To do so requires asking hard questions, like: do we need VR to replicate the sensory world in high fidelity, even if it’s costly? Or would lower-cost and lower-fidelity devices suffice? Will people accept a technologized hug as a meaningful proxy for the real thing? Or, when touch is involved, is there simply no substitute for physical presence? Might the future have both more touch and less?</p>\n<p>These are difficult questions, but the hardship, trauma and loss of COVID-19 proves they demand our best and most careful thinking. We owe it to ourselves now and in the future to be deliberate, realistic and hopeful about what touch and technology can do, and what they can’t.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7fvvI9oE2LM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 21:28:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"59bab7c2a88b36ba56977bc2fa028277","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn34@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992144410_c4d7a575cac2240d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=7fvvI9oE2LM:7CM-IaXLLUY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn38@2020_1/2020-07-29/1595992143360_c153f4b29d5c2f33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/7fvvI9oE2LM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn2@2020_1/2020-07-29/1595992143237_9493668cdcd41455.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Thanks to COVID-19, everybody wants Density’s technology tracking building occupancy and use","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023669","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Before the COVID-19 epidemic, <a href=\"https://www.density.io/\">Density</a> was being used by companies like TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company, Verizon, to see how it could better use office space after the Yahoo!/Aol merger.

That means fulfillment centers, grocery stores, warehouses, meat processing plants, in addition to something like TechCrunch headquarters.</p>\n<p>What will the company do with all that money? Spend it on sales, marketing, and actually getting the tech into customers&#8217; buildings, according to Farah.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of what we&#8217;re going to invest in is customer success, core infrastructure and growing our product and sales,&#8221; said Farah. &#8220;The first time our customers hear about us is when they get on a demo for a sales call.&#8221;</p>\n<p>New orders for the company&#8217;s hardware and software service are pouring in, he said.

A lot of building management is done on pen and paper when it comes to space utilization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both access control and utilization have been areas that more companies need to get a handle on thanks to the COVID-19 epidemic, which made backing a company like Density a natural fit, he said.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X9Uk8cSqQbc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 00:18:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1f0213d0f65b34030ee9c2fa3e0bf5a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn78@2020_1/2020-07-29/1595992143348_e2277099d2fe6875.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=X9Uk8cSqQbc:0WCvF38Uzs0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn66@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992144396_9c321521033a8de7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/X9Uk8cSqQbc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn61@2020_2/2020-07-29/1595992143236_6a54ff7ffcc189d5.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Toppr raises $46 million to scale its online learning platform in India","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023626","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Toppr, one of the largest online learning startups in India, has secured $46 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its platform including a new product.</p>\n<p>Dubai-headquartered investment firm Foundation Holdings led the Mumbai-based seven-year-old startup’s Series D round. Kaizen Private Equity, an existing investor, also participated in the new round, which brings Toppr’s to-date raise to over $92 million.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://toppr.com\">Toppr</a> operates four products and services that are aimed at K-12 students. Learning app, Toppr&#8217;s marquee service, offers students live classes and sessions to clear doubts, pre-recorded lessons and tests.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Toppr’s catalog covers 17 subjects and prepares students for five dozen competitive exams, explained Toppr founder and chief executive Zishaan Hayath in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>A portion of Toppr’s library is available to students at no charge on Learning app, but full access requires a membership. The subscription starts at 1,000 Indian rupee ($13.35) and goes as high as 3,000 Indian rupee ($40).</p>\n<p>The startup launched Codr, a product aimed at helping all school-age children learn computer programming, last month. A Codr session costs about $9.35. Toppr also maintains a free problem solving app that enables a student to take a picture of a question and get its solution instantly, explained Hayath.</p>\n<p>In the background, the app uses character recognition and machine learning to sift through a large bank of problems Toppr has amassed over the years to determine its solution.</p>\n<p>Toppr&#8217;s Learning app has amassed over 13 million users, more than 150,000 of whom are paying subscribers, he said. In recent months, the startup has also worked on a new product called School OS, which enables a school to digitize their learning experience. Through School OS, a teacher can assign and collect homework digitally, and students can attend live classes.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023704\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023704\" class=\"wp-image-2023704 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zishaan.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zishaan Hayath, the founder and chief executive of Toppr, a Mumbai-headquartered edtech startup (Photo: Toppr)</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;They can also attend classes from previous years, or of grades ahead of them. Our schooling system is built in a way that keeps you locked in the current year&#8217;s curriculum. On digital, one of the benefits is that you don&#8217;t have to follow such rules. So for instance, if a student in tenth grade needs to brush up some concept from grade nine, they can do so at any moment,&#8221; said Hayath.</p>\n<p>More than 40 schools have deployed School OS for their 60,000 students, he said. The startup plans to have 300,000 students enrolled to School OS in the next few months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Toppr has emerged as the highest traffic destination for K-12 learning and hosts over 1 million sessions every day. Toppr’s community of 50,000+ educators from across the country has contributed to over 35 lakh learning pieces, including questions, solutions, concepts, games and videos for the students. Our investment in Toppr also reflects our commitment to empowering great teachers via the new School OS. The new School OS already has 55,000+ learners on it,” said Aakash Sachdev, Managing Director of Foundation Holdings, in a statement.</p>\n<p>Sachdev has joined Toppr&#8217;s board as part of the new financing round.</p>\n<p>Hayath said the startup will continue to focus on scaling its various products and services, and also invest a little on marketing &#8212; an aspect he said Toppr has never spent any penny on.</p>\n<p>Another relatively new area for Toppr is exploring merger and acquisition deals. Hayath said the startup has so far resisted the idea of acquiring a team or firm to grow inorganically, but is open to scouting deals for a right fit.</p>\n<p>Toppr&#8217;s fundraising announcement today comes as edtech startups in India witness a significant surge in their userbases at a time when firms in other industries are finding it difficult to steer through the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Byju&#8217;s, India&#8217;s most valuable edtech startup, raised <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/2020/07/exclusive-byjus-raises-23-mn-from-bond-capital-raveendrans-family-holds-3-25-bn-worth-stake/\">about $23 million</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/\">Mary Meeker&#8217;s Bond last month</a>.

But she previously spent five-and-a-half years at Google, where she worked on strategic partnerships, and nearly nine years at Facebook, where she began in corporate development and later focused on M&#38;A.</p>\n<p>Because Choksi knows firsthand how some of the biggest companies on the planet think about potential acquisition targets and how deals ultimately come together, we asked if she would share some of those insights with us during our recent founder-centric Early Stage event. The idea was to help attendees better how understand how &#8212; and why &#8212; certain acquisitions come together; her advice was so helpful that we wanted to share it more widely here.</p>\n<p>So where to start? Choksi suggested people first understand the &#8220;build, partner, or buy&#8221; mentality of big acquirers. Indeed, while deals can look very much alike to outsiders (a deal is a deal is a deal), they are not. First, big companies will build internally if they are bolstering a strategic asset or what they need involves sensitive information or technology. A good example of something that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> would never buy, for example, is search tech, because search is the company&#8217;s crown jewel, she noted. Companies will meanwhile partner in order to fill a product or service gap or when they&#8217;re looking to stand up a new platform, she said, pointing to the early days of Google&#8217;s Android ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As for when they finally go shopping, companies are driven by three things, said Choksi: talent, technology and traction. With talent, as you might imagine, companies may conduct an acqui-hire with the goal of filling a talent or leadership gap internally or to acquire niche skills that their current employees don&#8217;t already have, she said.</p>\n<p>Companies meanwhile shop for technology when they need outside tech to boost their organic efforts. Choksi pointed to Luma.io by way of example. Back in 2013, the young company, which created a video-capture, stabilization and sharing app, was acquired by Instagram (which was itself already owned by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook); <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a week after it closed the Luma deal, Facebook launched video on Instagram largely based on Luma&#8217;s platform.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/cFT_BF0IjGI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:29:24 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"3befbb3cb0987794752088d4bd216588","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Connie Loizos","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992143342_12f4d496db1b38cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=cFT_BF0IjGI:VtivQdVc7sA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn85@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992143345_20a209958f18819d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/cFT_BF0IjGI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn22@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992143238_f91ff85b168077f7.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"TransferWise confirms new $5B valuation following $319M secondary share sale","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023272","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"http://www.transferwise.com/\">TransferWise</a>, the London-headquartered international money transfer service, is disclosing that it is now valued at $5 billion by private investors, confirming an earlier Sky News <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-hits-4bn-valuation-as-employees-cash-out-12022305\">report</a>. The new valuation represents an increase of 43% since May 2019, and has been triggered by a further $319 million in secondary share sales.</p>\n<p>Leading the &#8220;secondary&#8221; share round &#8212; which sees existing shareholders, including employees, permitted to sell a portion of their holdings to other new and existing investors, and therefore means no money has entered TransferWise&#8217;s balance sheet &#8212; is new investor D1 Capital Partners and existing shareholder Lone Pine Capital.</p>\n<p>Vulcan Capital also came on board as a new investor, with Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Investments and LocalGlobe adding to their existing holdings.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Noteworthy, the new $5 billion valuation doesn&#8217;t quite make TransferWise the most valued privately-owned fintech in Europe. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/klarna-raises-460-million-looks-to-expand-its-payments-presence-in-the-u-s/\">Klarna was first out the gate in August last year</a> with a disclosed $5.5 billion valuation, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/\">Revolut followed in February this year</a>, right before the coronavirus crisis took hold.</p>\n<p>Each instance also seemingly represents contrasting ways to value and grow a fintech company, with each scale-up balancing equity-financed growth versus profitability differently.</p>\n<p>Both Klarna and Revolut reached their latest valuation via significant new primary funding &#8212; $460 million and $500 million, respectively. TransferWise achieved this latest uplift off the back of secondary private markets only, and did the same in May 2019 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/three-point-five-unicorns/\">after a $292 million secondary round</a> that saw investors value the company at $3.5 billion. That was more than double the valuation TransferWise achieved in late 2017 at the time of its $280 million Series E round.</p>\n<p>In addition, 2010-founded TransferWise has been profitable since sometime in 2017, and 2005-founded Klarna has been profitable pretty much from day one but posted its first loss last year as it invested into global expansion. The much younger Revolut continues to be loss-making, prioritising growth above all else &#8212; but is <a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/fintech-bank-revolut-aims-to-turn-a-profit-by-year-end-20200421\">reportedly</a> aiming for profitability by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TransferWise now serves 8 million customers worldwide, processing around £4 billion in cross-border payments each month, across 2,500 currency routes and 54 currencies. The company also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dont-bank-on-it/\">recently announced</a> new regulator permissions to offer savings and investments options in the U.K. via the TransferWise borderless account, with the new product set to launch &#8220;in the next 12 months&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve been funded exclusively by our customers for the last few years and we didn’t need to raise external funding for the company,&#8221; says co-founder and current CEO Kristo Käärmann in a statement. &#8220;This secondary round provides an opportunity for new investors to come in, alongside rewarding the investors and employees who’ve helped us succeed so far&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Of course, a significant new funding round &#8212; secondary or primary &#8212; always invites the hackneyed question of if or when TransferWise plans to go public. On one hand, it&#8217;s a moot question, since early and long-standing investors continue to be able to get liquidity on the private markets. On the other hand, large late-stage secondary investors typically have an IPO in mind sooner or (perhaps) later.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For us, it&#8217;s a decision that really depends on what the benefit is? Is it a useful time for the company, and that time hasn&#8217;t come yet,&#8221; Käärmann told me on a call late last month, adding that it will only happen <em>when</em> it&#8217;s useful for the company <em>and</em> for its customers.</p>\n<p>However, for anyone who has been keeping up, you wouldn&#8217;t expect the TransferWise CEO to say otherwise.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"v4iI4iCmW1\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dont-bank-on-it/\">TransferWise to offer investment products but has &#8216;no plans&#8217;

All of these applications are important sources of data that can be analyzed to improve a company’s performance. That data often remains separate, however, making it difficult for different teams to collaborate.</p>\n<p>Hevo enables its clients’ employees to integrate data from more than <a href=\"https://hevodata.com/integrations/\">150 different source</a>s, including enterprise software from Salesforce and Oracle, even if they don’t have any technical experience. The company announced today that it has raised an $8 million Series A round led by Singapore-based venture capital firm Qualgro and Lachy Groom, a former executive at payments company Stripe.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The round, which brings Hevo&#8217;s total raised so far to $12 million, also included participation from returning investors Chiratae Ventures and Sequoia Capital India’s early-stage startup program Surge. The company was first covered by TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/03/hevo-data-gets-1m-in-seed-funding-to-streamline-data-integration/\">when it raised seed funding in 2017</a>.</p>\n<p>Hevo&#8217;s Series A will be used to increase the number of integrations available on its platform, and hire sales and marketing teams in more countries, including the United States and Singapore. The company currently has clients in 16 markets, including the U.S., India, France, Australia and Hong Kong, and counts payments company Marqeta among its customers.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Puneet Bysani, tech lead manager at Marqeta, said, &#8220;Hevo saved us many engineering hours, and our data teams could focus on creating meaningful KPIs that add value to Marqeta’s business. With Hevo&#8217;s pre-built connectors, we were able to get data from many sources into Redshift and Snowflake very quickly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Based in Bangalore and San Francisco, Hevo was founded in 2017 by chief executive officer Manish Jethani and chief technology officer Sourabh Agarwal. The two previously launched SpoonJoy, a food delivery startup that was <a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/grofers-acquihires-townrush-spoonjoy-758089\">acquired by Grofers</a>, one of India’s largest online grocery delivery services, in 2015. Jethani and Agarwal spent a year working at Grofers before leaving to start Hevo.</p>\n<p>Hevo originated in the challenges Jethani and Agarwal faced while developing tech for SpoonJoy’s order and delivery system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All of our team members would come to us and say, &#8216;hey, we want to look at these metrics,&#8217; or we would ask our teams questions if something wasn’t working. Oftentimes, they would not have the data available to answer those questions,&#8221; Jethani told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Then at Grofers, Jethani and Agarwal realized that even large companies face the same challenges. They decided to work on a solution to allow companies to quickly integrate data sources.</p>\n<p>For example, a marketing team at a e-commerce company might have data about its advertising on social media platforms, and how much traffic campaigns bring to their website or app. But they might not have access to data about how many of those visitors actually make purchases, or if they become repeat customers. By building a data pipeline with Hevo, they can bring all that information together.</p>\n<p>Hevo is designed to serve all sectors, including e-commerce, healthcare and finance. In order to use it, companies sign up for Hevo&#8217;s services on its website and employees enter their credentials for software supported by the platform. Then Hevo automatically extracts and organizes the data from those sources and prepares it for cloud-based data warehouses, such as Amazon Redshift and Snowflake. A user dashboard allows companies to customize integrations or hide sensitive data.</p>\n<p>Hevo is among a roster of &#8220;no code, low code&#8221; startups that have recently raised venture capital funding for building tools that enable non-developers to add features to their existing software. The founders say its most direct competitor is Fivetran, an Oakland, California-based company that also builds pipelines to move data to warehouses and prepare it for analysis.</p>\n<p>Jethani said Hevo differentiates by &#8220;optimizing our product for non-technical users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>“The number of companies who need to use data is very high and there is not enough talent available in the market. Even if it is available, it is very competitive and expensive to hire that engineering talent because big companies like Google and Amazon are also competing for the same talent,&#8221; he added. &#8220;So we felt that there has to be some democratization of who can use this technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hevo also focuses on integrating data in real-time, which is especially important for companies that provide on-demand deliveries or services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jethani says e-commerce clients have used Hevo to manage an influx in orders as people under stay-at-home orders purchase more items online.

Given that Rackspace had $652.7 million in Q1 2020 revenue and BigCommerce reaped $33.2 million in the same period, we have a puzzle on our hands.</p>\n<p>Let me explain. At its IPO price, Rackspace is worth around 2x its current revenue run rate. For a company we associate with the cloud, that feels cheap at first glance. BigCommerce is targeting a valuation of around a little under 10x its current annual run rate, which feels light compared to its competitor <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shopify\">Shopify&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> current price/sales ratio of of 66.4x (per <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/\">YCharts</a> data).</p>\n<p>We did some maths to hammer away at what&#8217;s going on in each case. The mystery boils down to somewhat mundane margin and growth considerations. Let&#8217;s dive into the data, figure out what&#8217;s going on and ask ourselves if these companies aren&#8217;t heading for a second, higher IPO price range before they formally price and begin trading.</p>\n<h2>Margins and growth</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s unpack Rackspace&#8217;s IPO pricing first and BigCommerce&#8217;s own set of numbers second.</p>\n<h3>Rackspace</h3>\n<p>While Rackspace has a public cloud component, its core business is service-driven, so it isn&#8217;t a major cloud platform that competes with Microsoft&#8217;s Azure, Google&#8217;s GCP or Amazon&#8217;s AWS.  This isn&#8217;t a diss, mind, but a point of categorization.</p>\n<p>The company has three reporting segments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multicloud Services</li>\n<li>Apps &#38;

Given the amount of concerns lawmakers have expressed over Amazon in recent years, that&#8217;s a big deal.</p>\n<h3>Who&#8217;s running the show?</h3>\n<p>The hearing is being coordinated by the <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/antitrust-commercial-and-administrative-law-116th-congress/\">House Judiciary&#8217;s Antitrust Subcommittee</a>, a subsection of the broader House committee that focuses on antitrust issues, among other topics. Because it&#8217;s in the House, the subcommittee is controlled by Democrats and is helmed by David Cicilline, a prominent and serious critic of big tech companies. It&#8217;s worth noting that Val Demings, who is currently being considered as Joe Biden&#8217;s running mate, is among the Democratic members.</p>\n<p>On the Republican side, Jim Sensenbrenner is the ranking member. The outspoken Trump supporter Matt Gaetz also serves on the subcommittee and we can expect to hear a lot from him for reasons we&#8217;ll get into it a little bit.</p>\n<h3>What is this all about?</h3>\n<p>The title of the hearing is &#8220;Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 6: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.&#8221; <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=14921\">Five previous hearings</a> were also part of the subcommittee&#8217;s year-long antitrust investigation into digital markets, touching on issues like data privacy, innovation, the free press and competition. Expect all of those angles to come up at Wednesday&#8217;s hearing.</p>\n<p>What the hearing is about and what will end up being the focus could be two different things, depending on how well Cicilline is able to rein things in as the subcommittee&#8217;s chair. As we mentioned previously, Florida Republican Matt Gaetz has signaled his interest in steering the four tech CEOs to the less substantive but more politically expedient topic of anti-conservative bias in tech.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Gaetz made a <a href=\"https://gaetz.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-matt-gaetz-files-criminal-referral-against-facebook-ceo-mark\">criminal referral</a> to the Justice Department that accused Mark Zuckerberg of lying in his 2018 testimony to Congress when he said Facebook does not have a bias against conservatives. The issue of anti-conservative bias is a favorite among Trump-friendly Republicans, and Gaetz is likely to veer away from very real concerns over anti-competitive behavior among tech companies toward unproven bias claims.</p>\n<h3>Will they really say anything useful?</h3>\n<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline stressed the importance that the tech CEOs are &#8220;forthcoming&#8221; on Wednesday, emphasizing the &#8220;central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people.&#8221; While it would serve these companies to appear transparent and not evasive, the testimony is likely to be a careful combination of the two.</p>\n<p>In past appearances, tech CEOs have been criticized for being tight-lipped, offering only robotic answers and promising to &#8220;get back&#8221; to members of Congress every other question. We can expect more of this Wednesday, though the tone and efficacy of the hearing will really depending on who&#8217;s asking the questions and how well lawmakers coordinate their lines of inquiry.</p>\n<h3>Where is Twitter? Microsoft?</h3>\n<p>Last week, House Republicans <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/republicans-want-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-to-testify-at-house-hearing.html\">led by Jim Jordan</a> called on Twitter to appear at tech&#8217;s big antitrust hearing, claiming that the day would be &#8220;incomplete&#8221; without an appearance from Jack Dorsey. Dorsey has made appearances before Congress before, but the new request was rightfully ignored.</p>\n<p>While often elevated to the status of peer companies like Facebook and YouTube, Twitter is a relatively small company with an outsized impact on society — and one not suspected of market-shaping practices that could box competitors out. To put it in perspective: Twitter&#8217;s market capitalization is $29 billion; Facebook&#8217;s is $667 billion.</p>\n<p>Compared to Twitter, Microsoft is massive and a more natural fit for the hearing but the company has a much more storied history of government scrutiny. Cicilline himself <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078903/podcast-house-antitrust-chairman-cicilline-tech-monopoly-vergecast\">said</a> that regulatory enforcement against Microsoft two decades ago &#8220;made space for an enormous amount of additional innovation and competition.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Depending on who you ask, U.S. regulatory efforts against Microsoft either presaged an era of regulatory overreach or failed to be little more than a slap on the wrist.

GoPro, even while struggling to remain relevant as sales drop, cultivated a rich brand identity, and this merchandise embodies the GoPro lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The line is called &#8220;Lifestyle Gear,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a nice sampling of outdoor gear featuring GoPro&#8217;s logo.

There are waterproof backpacks, durable duffels and compact cases for the compact cameras. If done correctly, soft goods often sell with healthy margins, which could be a good win for GoPro.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>GoPro has struggled the last few years after storming onto the scene. The stock has been under $10 a share since 2017, though it&#8217;s trending upward this year. Over the last few years, the company revamped its product offering several times, and, most recently, started branching off into different products, including flashlights and now soft goods. Right now, in the second half of 2020, the company sells four cameras, but two are carryovers from 2019.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/FfANERj5HxE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:19:28 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"cbf9052f92150207ede7512b867784fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Matt Burns","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn41@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992116145_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_4/2020-07-29/1595992144306_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143244_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992143419_ae9212b02466c12e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=FfANERj5HxE:Caqy8QqsSRU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn93@2020_5/2020-07-29/1595992143347_62d358388d174163.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_6/2020-07-29/1595992144417_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/FfANERj5HxE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn42@2020_3/2020-07-29/1595992143239_0642e76be37fdcde.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-29 11:08:30","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 03:08:30","title":"Disrupt 2020 early-bird savings vanish in just 4 days","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2021373","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=4daysleft&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=4daysleftpost&#38;display=TRUE\">Disrupt 2020</a> doesn’t arrive until September, but the countdown clock to early-bird savings winds to a halt in just four days.

The company unveiled the interiors during a virtual event today, and offered members of the press (myself included) a special tour of the interior in VR. The cabin is designed with customer experience top-of-mind, as you might expect for a trip that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to take.</p>\n<p>Virgin Galactic&#8217;s VSS Unity will offer up to six passengers an unparalleled trip to suborbital space, where they&#8217;ll experience weightlessness in zero gravity and have the chance to observe the curve of the Earth and the blackness of the cosmos beyond the atmosphere. The cabin is entirely designed around optimizing the safety, comfort and freedom of the paying, private astronauts throughout the journey &#8212; from the flight up while attached to the carrier craft, to the high-G burn after the Unity separates from that carrier transport, to the free-floating in-space wander, and finally to the high-G return to Earth at a very different inclination from the initial atmospheric exit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2023406\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/virgin-galactic-spaceship-cabin.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"505\" />To make this work, Virgin Galactic created carbon fibre and aluminum seats that combine 3D soft material weaves with metallic, rose gold accents and fabrics created in partnership with Under Armour (which also created the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/these-are-the-under-armour-designed-suits-for-virgin-galactics-space-tourists/\">custom spacesuits passengers will wear</a>) to ensure that all private astronauts flying on Unity are as protected and comfortable as possible during the parts of the flight where they&#8217;ll experience three times the normal gravity of Earth. These custom-fit seats are tailored in terms of sizing to each individual passenger, and feature thoughtful details like a channel in the centre of the headrest that can accommodate pony tails, for instance.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2023410\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/virgin-galactic-getting-into-seat.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"505\" /></p>\n<p>The five-point harness that&#8217;s built into the seats can be unfastened using a single clasp, whereupon the straps with the fastening hardware retract into the seat automatically to ensure they&#8217;re safely out of the way during the free-flight zero-gravity portion of the trip, but easy enough to find when they need to strap back in for the return trip.</p>\n<p>All the seats are also designed to do double duty as handholds during the free float &#8212; as is just about everything else in the passenger cabin. That&#8217;s also why the seats have a cantilevered mounting post that offers free space underneath each, which is more room for exploration once the Unity exits Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and concepts like up and down lose significance.</p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2023412\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/free-float-virgin-galactic.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"505\" />Throughout the cabin, Virgin used soft materials for this same reason, and there are a total of 17 windows throughout the interior (including three for the two-person crew), with each of the passenger-accessible windows rounded with a soft material &#8220;halo&#8221; complete with a handhold edge and integrated camera. Virgin has put cameras throughout the cabin, in fact, and each provides high-quality photo capture tuned by imaging experts for the specific lighting conditions of the trip. The thinking here is that all the private astronauts should be guaranteed great documentation of their experience without having to worry about actually capturing any of that themselves. Virgin says it&#8217;ll be providing some of this imagery pretty much immediately upon landing so that spacefarers can share to their social accounts right away.</p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2023408\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/windows-top-virgin-galactic-cabin.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"505\" />Every seat is a window seat, with one to the side and one above, for taking in the breathtaking views. There&#8217;s also a large mirror that covers the entirety of the rear bulkhead separating the cabin from the rocket engine, which provides the astronauts the ability to check out their zero-G antics.</p>\n<p>The seats also change orientation and inclination based on which part of the journey is happening, from upright for those 3.5Gs on the rocket ride straight up, to a reclined position for the atmosphere-skimming 3G velocity-slowing re-entry. Each seat also has an information display that can provide data about what&#8217;s happening during the flight &#8212; though the pilot and co-pilot aren&#8217;t fully separated from the main cabin, so you can theoretically just ask them questions about the trip live, as well.</p>\n<p>Virgin Galactic also took the in-flight mood lighting that its airliner counterpart pioneered and translated it for space, with dynamic lighting reacting to each stage of the trip and emanating from various strategically placed and non-obvious cabin lights. Take a look below for more detailed photos of the cabin interior, including a configuration that allows three passengers but saves room on the other side of the cabin for experiments (one other way Virgin Galactic plans to monetize its service).</p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2023414,2023415,2023416,2023417,2023418\"]</p>\n<p>The company still has some final preparations yet to do before it can begin flying its paying customers, but with the interior of VSS Unity complete, it&#8217;s closer than ever to its goal. This is definitely a unique offering, so it&#8217;s hard to judge the product without any available reviewers, but it&#8217;s clear that Virgin Galactic has put a lot of thought, consideration and expertise into developing a spaceship interior designed to work for everyone who can afford to take the trip.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\"

me.</p>\n<p>He also noted that as the company&#8217;s enterprise business has grown, the need for customers to be able to prepare for what&#8217;s coming next has also increased. Until now, GitHub often provided this information to some of its larger customers directly (through good-old slide decks), but that same information will now be available to all. To Niyogi, this is essentially about &#8220;building GitHub more the way that people build software on GitHub already.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023367\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023367\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2023367\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png 1279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image002.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GitHub</p></div></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly then, the roadmap lives in a GitHub repo.
