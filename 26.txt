said <span class=\"xn-person\">Sree Chaguturu</span>, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit management business of CVS Health, in a statement earlier this year. &#8220;We have analyzed pharmacy and medical claims to identify where these benefits can make a difference and employ a rigorous and transparent evaluation process to assure that any vendor included in <em>Point Solutions Management</em> meets high standards for safety, quality and user experience at the vendor&#8217;s lowest price in the marketplace.&#8221; </span><span style=\"font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;\"> </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Chaguturu plan providers are interested in point solutions that can digitally compliment the care that patients receive from physicians that can help with self-management of chronic conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">These self-directed, digitally enhanced therapies are especially important at a time when more care is being conducted remotely thanks to the social distancing demands imposed by efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;The point solutions management platform is a platform designed for B2B2C.. Where plan sponsors are contracting through the platform to help their members,&#8221; said Chaguturu, in an interview. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">We work with Big Health to support awareness of the application through our other platforms as well.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Rather than go direct to consumer like any number of other mental health and wellness applications vying for customers, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/big-health\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"big-health\">Big Health <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has chosen to work with employer provided healthcare plans and services like CVS Caremark&#8217;s because it can reach more people, said Big Health co-founder Peter Hames.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;\">&#8220;CVS has shown real forward thinking in implmenting this platform to provide this conduit to digital care,&#8221; Hames said.</span><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;\"> &#8220;</span>CVS Caremark administrates benefits to over 100 million people in America. The scope via the reimbursement space is huge&#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We could take a direct to consumer model. [But] my experience has shown me that going through this reimbursed pathway provides  a much bigger vector.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>The two companies declined to disclose the financial terms of the arrangement between CVS and Big Health, but Chaguturu did say that the company did not invest in solutions offered through its program or have a financial interest in the business.</p>\n<p>Big Health

id=\"speakable-summary\">2020 has been all but normal. For businesses and brands. For innovation. For people.</p>\n<p>The trajectory of business growth strategies, travel plans and lives have been drastically altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a global economic downturn with supply chain and market issues, and a fight for equality in the Black Lives Matter movement — amongst all that complicated lives and businesses already.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest stories in emerging technology is the growth of different types of voice assistants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Niche assistants such as <a href=\"https://www.aider.ai/\">Aider</a> that provide back-office support.</li>\n<li>Branded in-house assistants such as those offered by BBC and Snapchat.</li>\n<li>White-label solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.houndify.com/\">Houndify</a> that provide lots of capabilities and configurable tool sets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With so many assistants proliferating globally, voice will become a commodity like a website or an app. And that’s not a bad thing — at least in the name of progress. It will soon (read: over the next couple years) become table stakes for a business to have voice as an interaction channel for a lovable experience that users expect. Consider that feeling you get when you realize a business doesn’t have a website: It makes you question its validity and reputation for quality. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/voice-ae1d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"voice-ae1d\">Voice <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> isn’t quite there yet, but it’s moving in that direction.</p>\n<h2>Voice assistant adoption and usage are still on the rise</h2>\n<p>Adoption of any new technology is key. A key inhibitor of technology is often distribution, but this has not been the case with voice. Apple, Google, and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/baidu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"baidu\">Baidu <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> have reported hundreds of millions of devices using voice, and Amazon has 200 million users.

Google said recently there are 500 million monthly active users of Google Assistant. Not far behind are active Apple users with 375 million. Large numbers of people are using voice assistants, not just owning them. That’s a sign of technology gaining momentum — the technology is at a price point and within digital and personal ecosystems that make it right for user adoption. The pandemic has only exacerbated the use as Edison reported between March and April — a peak time for sheltering in place across the U.S.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KWDQByekIgE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:41:35 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/01-voice-assistant-installed-base.png","linkMd5":"95ec1293c2d28911af081394e2a7b51c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596039687717_3b503d8bb93cb9b0.webp","author":"Richard Dal Porto","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/01-voice-assistant-installed-base.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596039687717_3b503d8bb93cb9b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_2/2020-07-29/1596039712005_97a3f0fb32816dcd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KWDQByekIgE:6BPjiolsv4E:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039712998_726be51b55e4976c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KWDQByekIgE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039712171_8e967998930dd7d1.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"China now accounts for nearly one-quarter of Tesla revenue","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023764","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has been counting on China to maintain its sales momentum, and it seems to be on track with the plan.</p>\n<p>In the three months ended June 30, the automaker&#8217;s revenue in China climbed 102.9% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, according to its latest SEC <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/2d27eb7d-849a-459a-b53c-4da2aaa6787a\">filing</a>.

The company announced today its taking its employee assistance voice technology dubbed &#8220;Ask Sam&#8221; and making it available to associates at over 5,000 Walmart stores nationwide. The tool allows Walmart employees to look up prices, access store maps, find products, view sales information, check email, and more. In recent months, Ask Sam has also been used to access COVID-19 information, including the latest guidelines, guidance and safety videos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ask Sam&#8221; was initially developed for use in Walmart-owned &#8220;Sam&#8217;s Club&#8221; stores, where it<a href=\"https://chainstoreage.com/technology/sams-club-associates-in-need-of-info-can-go-ask-sam\"> rolled out</a> across the U.S. in 2019. Because of its use of voice tech, Ask Sam can speed up the time it takes to get to information versus typing a query on the small screen. This allows employees to better engage with customers instead of spending time on their device looking for information.</p>\n<p>In the COVID-19 era, the tool offers another perk &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to use a voice app when you&#8217;re wearing gloves.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In addition to common functions like price lookups and product locators, Ask Sam can also help employees with printing, email, or viewing staff birthdays or other events. An included Emergency Alert feature allows managers to quickly and efficiently alert all employees of emergency situations, whether that&#8217;s a lockdown order requiring them to remain in the store or an in-store emergency that requires everyone to leave the stores.</p>\n<p>The voice assistance technology was built using machine learning techniques, which means it gets smarter and more accurate over time, as it&#8217;s used. In addition, a team manually reviews the questions being asked to help find other patterns and trends the tech may have missed, like top searched-items.</p>\n<p>This is not the retailer&#8217;s first experiments in use voice technology. In addition to the Ask Sam product&#8217;s earlier launch within Sam&#8217;s Club stores, Walmart itself also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/\">partnered</a> with Google last year on voice-ordering across Google Assistant-powered platforms, in a bid to counter Amazon&#8217;s advances with Alexa in the home. And three years ago, Walmart had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/\">worked</a> with Google on voice-based shopping on Google Home devices before Google Express shut down.</p>\n<p>Walmart has not said whether it would create a version of Ask Sam technology that would aim to serve retail customers. But given that the product is now capable of answering questions that customers want to know too &#8212; like where to find an item or how much it costs &#8212; it makes sense that the retailer would expand the offering in the future.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1dRzbOsBKhA:TMS_DcIa23Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img

</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I’m in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. My employer won’t sponsor me for a green card, so I’m looking to apply for one on my own. My husband and I are both citizens of Germany, but I was born in India. I’ve heard that people born in India face waiting decades for a green card. Is there any way to minimize the wait?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>— Dedicated in Daly City</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Dedicated:</p>\n<p>Thanks for your question. It’s great to hear you want to pursue a green card on your own. As always, I recommend that you contact an experienced immigration attorney to help guide you through the green card application and interview process.</p>\n<p>I’ll discuss the green card options that don’t require you to have an employer or family sponsor and lay out a few tricks that might support you to minimize your wait time for a green card. For more details on these strategies, listen to my <a href=\"https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/028-all-about-priority-dates/\">podcast on priority dates</a>.</p>\n<p>As you may know, your country of birth — rather than your country of citizenship — is what counts when assessing your eligibility for a green card and how long it will take to get one.</p>\n<p>All green card categories — except for those for the spouse, parents and dependent children of U.S. citizens — have a cap on the number that can be issued each year. In addition, these categories have a per-country limit of 7% of the total number available. Because the demand in most green card categories from individuals born in India far exceeds the supply for that country, the wait times are excessively long for individuals who were born there.</p>\n<p>For individuals who must wait for a green card, their priority date determines their place in the green card line. If you self-petition for a green card, your priority date is when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) receives your initial green card petition.</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HeVqI7h33RE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:15:30 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-at-TC.jpg?w=642","linkMd5":"90c5136bec7730901b3310ad3b7cf549","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_2/2020-07-29/1596039712477_785ba040e8863fa0.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039712015_db96033de68a3811.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=HeVqI7h33RE:gs9nMol78ic:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_2/2020-07-29/1596039712086_88e04d07c35eb4fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/HeVqI7h33RE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn55@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039712917_6dc6179b8d067f64.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Spotify users are streaming again, but ad revenues still suffer due to COVID crisis","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023845","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s continued impact on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\">Spotify&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> business was apparent in the results of the company&#8217;s Q2 2020 earnings today.

The company attributed this growth to a range of factors, including growth in more expensive Family Plan subscriptions and its new Duo option for two users, as well as the expansion of those plans to new markets, like Russia.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the company touted that users&#8217; listening hours are also now returning to levels near what they were before the COVID-19 health crisis.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In the first quarter, the pandemic had initially led to declines in daily active users and listening hours as consumers coped with their sudden lifestyle changes,. like working from home and homeschooling children. Spotify today said that as of June 30, global consumption hours have since recovered to &#8220;pre-COVID levels&#8221; in all markets except Latin America, which is still around 6% below peak levels prior to the global health crisis.</p>\n<p>This recovery in listening hours was led by those areas where the COVID-19 spread is slowing, including the E.U. and Asia-Pacific regions, the company noted. Spotify is also now seeing growth in other areas where listening had slowed due to government lockdowns and the work-from-home shift, like in-car listening. This is now less than 10% below pre-COVID levels, up from a 50% decline at its lowest point in April.</p>\n<p>On the downside, Spotify&#8217;s ad revenue suffered in the quarter due to an overall more conservative market than before the COVID crisis &#8212; a trend the company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-tech-results/spotify-revenue-misses-as-coronavirus-deters-advertisers-idUSKCN24U1G3\">expects to continue</a> throughout the year. This drove Spotify to miss on revenue expectations in the quarter. The company reported revenue growth of 13% to 1.89 billion euros, but this fell short of analyst estimates of 1.93 billion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last quarter we noted a marked deceleration in sales brought on by the global health crisis where the last three weeks in March were down more than 20% relative to our forecast,&#8221; the company said in its shareholder <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2020-FINAL.pdf\">letter</a>. &#8220;Performance continued to lag our expectations through April and May, but we significantly outperformed expectations in the month of June. [Quarter to date] through May, ad-supported revenues were down 25% year-over-year, but performance in the month of June showed significant improvement and was only down 12% year-over year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Though advertising is not a main revenue driver at this time, it&#8217;s still a key part of Spotify&#8217;s strategy with regard to its podcasting business. The company is investing heavily in bringing in new and exclusive deals, including recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/kim-kardashian-west-lands-podcast-deal-with-spotify-11592427337\">Kim Kardashian West</a>, <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-05-19/the-joe-rogan-experience-launches-exclusive-partnership-with-spotify/\">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-07-16/higher-ground-and-spotify-announce-the-michelle-obama-podcast-debuting-july-29/\">Michelle Obama</a>, <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-18/warner-bros-is-bringing-the-dc-super-heroes-and-super-villains-to-spotify-as-an-exclusive-series-of-podcasts/\">DC &#38; Warner Bros</a>., <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/addison-rae-podcast-spotify-exclusive-1234709818/\">TikTok star Addison Rae</a>, and others. And it&#8217;s willing to spend &#8212; Joe Rogan&#8217;s deal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814\">reportedly</a> cost the company more than $100 million, for instance.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also selling its own podcast ads and building out other tools for podcast creation, editing, and distribution as part of its investment in this space. For instance, Spotify is developing new ad technology aimed at better monetizing podcasts, like its latest<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/spotify-tests-in-app-offers-an-interactive-ad-format-for-podcasts/\"> test of in-app offers</a>, which will allow users to view and use coupon codes and other offers made in audio ads at any time from the Spotify app.</p>\n<p>More recently, the company<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/spotify-launches-video-podcasts-worldwide-starting-with-select-creators/\"> invested in video podcasts</a> as well. Spotify also says its Streaming Ad Insertion technology will also become more broadly available to U.S. advertisers this summer and announced a $20 million ad partnership with Omnicom Media Group, which Spotify claims is the largest, global, strategic podcast ad partnership to date.</p>\n<p>Overall, Spotify said its podcasting advertising outperformed in the quarter and is continuing into July.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Jgv2pb4cOZY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:50:21 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"5da57326e655872e41ab46641ded6b31","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596039712013_04a4ad7aab329ac8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Jgv2pb4cOZY:UHn-4Fp5bt0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596039713561_57919617feb293b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Jgv2pb4cOZY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039711897_25c69b6bc7c24b37.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Instrumental raises $20M to scale its AI-powered manufacturing tech","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023801","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">This morning <a href=\"https://www.instrumental.com/\">Instrumental</a>, a startup that uses vision-powered AI to detect manufacturing anomalies, announced that it has closed a $20 million Series B led by <a href=\"https://www.canaan.com/\">Canaan Partners</a>.

And we asked participating Canaan partner <a href=\"https://www.canaan.com/team/hrach-simonian\">Hrach Simonian</a> about the business metrics and milestones that led him to lead the deal.</p>\n<h2>Tech</h2>\n<p>Instrumental&#8217;s tech is a combination of cameras and code. The startup installs its hardware on manufacturing lines, employing learning software to ferret out anomalies using data from small sample sets. The company&#8217;s goal to help other businesses that build physical products boost yields and save time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our customers identify design, quality, and process issues weeks faster than their competitors and get to mass production with a higher quality product that can be built for significantly less money,&#8221; she said in an email to TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>According to Shedletsky, who previously worked at Apple in design and manufacturing capacities, Instrumental uses commodity hardware. The startup&#8217;s software is what matters, allowing its camera-units to train with as few as 30 units and simple labeling training. Notably, given the reduced-capacity Internet available at many manufacturing facilities in China where the company often works, its hardware can handle on-site data processing to prevent upload/download lag.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to get tech installed onto manufacturing lines, the company told TechCrunch, as it&#8217;s easy to get fired for stopping a production run. This can make it hard for companies like Instrumental to get their foot in the door.</p>\n<p>Instrumental works around the problem by getting its tech installed on manufacturing lines when they are in pre-production development. If the startup can prove value there, its tech can be rolled out when the lines move from development to production. And, if Instrumental&#8217;s tech works with initial lines, it can be scaled across other manufacturing lines that are spun up, something called &#8220;replicating lines.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2023811\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2023811\" class=\"wp-image-2023811\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg 5549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=1536,1107 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=2048,1476 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Instrumental-product-in-nest.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2023811\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Instrumental hardware unit, via the company.</p></div></p>\n<p>The startup has two products: One for manufacturing lines in development, and one for those in production. Unlike enterprise software contracts that are often sold on a yearly-cadence, Instrumental&#8217;s manufacturing deals can ramp up based on volume through a process that its CEO called &#8220;continuous sale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The model allows the company to charge more, more quickly than an enterprise software contract waiting for its re-up period to allow for renegotiation, boosting how quickly Instrumental can grow its business,</p>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n<p>Flush with $20 million, what does Instrumental have planned? Shedletsky told TechCrunch that her first goal is to expand its business in the electronics space, a part of the manufacturing world where the startup has seen initial customer traction.</p>\n<p>To support that effort, Instrumental is building out its go-to-market functionality, and continuing to work on its core technology she said.</p>\n<p>After living off its Series A for around twice as long as many venture-backed companies tend to, TechCrunch was curious how quickly Instrumental intends to deploy its larger Series B. According to its CEO, the startup plans on being principled, but not slow. She stressed that she&#8217;s working to build a long-term company, and that she wants to create something that is both sustainable, and large.</p>\n<p>Lacking hard growth metrics, TechCrunch was curious what attracted Canaan to Instrumental at this juncture. According to the Hrach Simonian, a general partner at the firm, &#8220;Instrumental’s tools are quickly becoming a business imperative,&#8221; something that can be seen in its &#8220;renewal rates with big customers&#8221; he said, describing them as &#8220;extraordinarily high.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Given the sheer scale of global electronics <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200220005575/en/Global-Electronics-Manufacturing-Services-Market-2020-2024-Increasing\">is enormous</a>, giving Instrumental nearly infinite TAM to sell into.

The company, formerly known as The News Lens, announced today that it has raised $8 million from New York-based investment firm Palm Drive Capital, as part of its Series D round.</p>\n<p>TNL <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/media-5cbd\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"media-5cbd\">Media <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Group’s last funding announcement <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/taiwan-based-media-startup-the-news-lens-raises-series-c-for-its-international-growth-plans/\">was a Series C round announced two years ago</a>. Co-founder and chief executive officer Joey Chung told TechCrunch that its latest infusion of funding will be used to add more media verticals, continue TNL Media Group’s international expansion and finish its current pipeline of data analytics and tech service products.</p>\n<p>TNL Media Group&#8217;s previous investors include North Base Media, the firm co-founded by Washington Post and Wall Street Journal veteran Marcus Brauchli (who is also a member of the startup’s board). <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-news-lens\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"the-news-lens\">The News Lens <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> launched seven years ago as a bilingual site to give millennial readers an alternative to traditional media outlets in Taiwan, where coverage is often sharply divided along political lines and traffic is driven by celebrity gossip and other tabloid fodder.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YPyzDBYipS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/the-news-lens/\">With Angel Funding From Top Media Veterans, The News Lens Wants To Reshape Journalism In Taiwan</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;With Angel Funding From Top Media Veterans, The News Lens Wants To Reshape Journalism In Taiwan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/the-news-lens/embed/#?secret=YPyzDBYipS\" data-secret=\"YPyzDBYipS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Since then, it has grown through a series of launches and acquisitions. In addition to its main news site, it also operates separate sites for tech, sports, lifestyle, gadgets and entertainment content. Earlier this year, TNL Media Group <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/taipei-based-tnl-media-group-acquires-adtech-startup-ad2iction/\">acquired Taiwanese mobile ad technology startup Ad2iction</a>, a cloud-based platform for brands to manage and create digital ads.</p>\n<p>Since TNL Media Group already has offices in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also has a media vertical dedicated to covering Southeast Asia, Chung said the company is now looking for opportunities to expand there. At the same time, he added that TNL Media Group has &#8220;had numerous very late-stage conversations&#8221; about partnerships to launch in Japan.</p>\n<p>The company’s media verticals complement its data analytics business because it is able to draw on TNL Media Group’s user base for data, which Chung said is &#8220;one of the largest readership pools for digital audiences in the greater China market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On average, TNL Media Group’s sites have around 14 million monthly unique users. Its data analytics business, which launched within the past year, currently has about three to five clients per month. &#8220;But of course, we are planning for that to be ramped up substantially in the coming months and years and that will gradually grow to become a very important part of our entire business portfolio,&#8221; Chung said.</p>\n<p>TNL Media Group’s other products include mobile ad tech, digital ticketing services, online events and online classes, and a content management system (CMS) it will start licensing to other companies.</p>\n<p>Chung said that by the end of this year, many of these products will be integrated with its readership and data to develop a demand side platform (DSP, a tool that connects ad buyers with publishers) and a data management platform that are already in production.</p>\n<p>In a press statement about its investment in TNL Media Group, Palm Drive Capital managing partner Nick Hsu said, “Palm Drive Capital focuses on investing in global technology startups using software to transform traditional industries. This is evident in the media industry, particularly as Taiwan’s online ad expenditure has already reached over one billion U.S. dollars and is estimated to grow to 1.65 billion U.S. dollars by 2021. Having known the TNL Media Group team for years, we see massive potential to leverage data to drive growth, consolidation, and international expansion in the media industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wApMvZsIPSc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:00:14 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"27dd66ab8b36562f3536fc99ec7534f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Catherine Shu","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn31@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039713067_420432d9e227a1e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wApMvZsIPSc:KW7yda-UwBk:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn75@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039712035_c4b1f850a94b110e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wApMvZsIPSc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039712968_0a228c4ee4e1542f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Remitly raises $85M at a $1.5B valuation, says money transfer business has surged","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023759","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Remittances &#8212; when people send money internationally to family and friends, or as a payment &#8212; has long been one of the most important levers for getting funds to people in developing economies.</p>\n<p>However, the persistent spread of the coronavirus is having a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/business/global-remittances-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tough impact</a> on that, with the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Bank estimating</a> that remittances to low and middle-income countries will fall 20% this year to $445 billion (down a record $554 billion in 2019).

He attributes that to Remitly offering not just competitive rates, but its focus on doing it virtually &#8212; that is, without requiring people to come into physical shops to send or receive money, as they might more typically do with Western Union or MoneyGram.</p>\n<p>(I&#8217;d also argue that the connection might be a little more direct: it may also be that Remitly is used by migrants who are in better economic circumstances themselves, less impacted by job and wage losses than others, and this has also helped its business to thrive.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;We aren’t seeing that downturn in remittances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Over half of global remittances these days  are sent via physical cash locations, and during a pandemic, many don’t feel as safe doing that, and so that will impact numbers.&#8221; He added that the amounts might seem modest in the developed world, but even incremental transactions are meaningful. &#8220;$200-$300 goes an incredibly long way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just before the pandemic really started to take hold in the US and Western Europe, Remitly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/remitly-launches-passbook-a-neobank-aimed-at-immigrants-to-expand-beyond-money-transfers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched Passbook</a>, a &#8220;neobank&#8221; in partnership with Greendot, as part of its strategy to expand into a wider range of financial services for immigrants.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In retrospect, given how events unfolded globally &#8212; where people who were not being forced into new economic situations were likely going to stay put and hold tight until things returned to normal &#8212; it was a challenging launch, to say the least. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Oppenheimer said that the company is not disclosing the number of users but &#8220;have gotten a lot of customer feedback about offering basic banking and more, and we are excited to scale it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The funding being announced today will also go towards the company working on expanding the range of services, with credit a likely next candidate for services.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We have seen how the business is evolving, and the focus of its customers.

It was easy for us to say we want to double down and lead this round. This is the time and moment for a new story and a new leg to that business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Notably, PayU has continued on as a member of Facebook&#8217;s Libra project, where a kind of crypto/virtual currency is being developed to run financial services on Facebook&#8217;s own rails and those of its partners. Le Moal says PayU continues to be very optimistic for how this will evolve, although nothing to announce yet on that front.

It seems that the smart assistant has lost its luster even for the company that once touted it as the centerpiece of its massive hardware ecosystem. And now, according to a new report, Samsung is consider dropping the smart assistant from its mobile devices altogether. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Word comes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-samsung/samsung-weighs-dropping-bixby-as-google-dangles-new-mobile-apps-deal-idUSKCN24U0TF\">from Reuters</a> this week, citing a “correspondence.” Details are vague, and Samsung is unsurprisingly pushing back on the suggestion that it’s dramatically scaling back its commitment to Bixby. The hardware powerhouse denies the suggestion that it’s going to be dropping the software and/or its Galaxy Store store from its own devices.</span></p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A spokesperson tells TechCrunch, “Samsung remains committed to our own ecosystem and services. At the same time, Samsung closely works with Google and other partners to offer the best mobile experiences for our users.&#8221; They add, more specifically, “Samsung will continue to offer <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bixby\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bixby\">Bixby <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Galaxy Store on its devices. Both services are an important part of the Galaxy ecosystem.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Per the report, the company is considering a rev-share deal that would put Google’s Assistant, search and Play Store in more prominent positions on its devices. It’s a deal that Google has been long been pushing for. And understandably so. Samsung currently controls the largest Android market share — and for that matter, the largest market share period, with 21.2% of total global shipments, per <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor\">figures from IDC</a>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Huawei is at a closeish number two with 17.8%, but we all know how that situation is going for Google at the moment. Between Samsung and Huawei, we’re talking well over a third of the total global smartphone market. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for what’s in it for Samsung, well, it’s probably more about what’s not in it for Bixby. Thus far the assistant’s main selling point is its relative versatility, is it also appears on things like washing machines. Of course, thus far, it remains almost exclusively the domain of Samsung’s own devices. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The publicl indifference toward Bixby is not for lack of trying. Samsung has long included a devoted Bixby button on its Galaxy devices — though the company began to allow users to disable that functionality back in 2017. It’s also not for lack of spending. Samsung has shelled out a lot to enhance the assistant with the acquisition, and the Bixby roadmap has offered plenty of promise. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next week’s Unpacked event should offer some key insight into where the company’s head is, with regards to Bixby these days. </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3HkIbAU4PpY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:49:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_2711.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"d9c266f15c951b879e2822732e59d6b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn51@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039712816_862f1b7353e31e27.webp","author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039712008_31330561be82f5d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3HkIbAU4PpY:DnIEG2RyscE:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn79@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039712128_ed7f8f63ddc6ad25.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3HkIbAU4PpY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712838_f113aa615e8202a4.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Hearsay, maker of compliant tools for financial services, deepens ties with Salesforce","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023816","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Financial services companies like banks and insurance tend to be heavily regulated. As such they require a special level of security and auditability. <a href=\"http://hearsaysystems.com/\">Hearsay</a>, which makes compliant communications tools for these types of companies, announced a new partnership with Salesforce today, enabling smooth integration with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"salesforce\">Salesforce <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> CRM and marketing automation tools.</p>\n<p>The company also announced that Salesforce would be taking a minority stake in Hearsay, although company co-founder and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/clara-shih\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"clara-shih\">Clara Shih, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> did not provide any details on that part of the announcement.</p>\n<p>Shih says the company created the social selling category when it launched 10 years ago. Today, it provides a set of tools like email, messaging and websites along with a governance layer to help financial services companies interact with customers in a compliant way. Their customers are primarily in banking, insurance, wealth management and mortgages.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>She said that they realized if they could find a way to share the data they were collecting with the Hearsay toolset with CRM and marketing automation software in an automated way, it would make greater use of this information than it could on its own. To that end, they have created a set of APIs to enable that with some built-in connectors. The first one will be to connect Hearsay to Salesforce with plans to add other vendors in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about being able to connect [data from Hearsay] with the CRM system of record, and then analyzing it across thousands, if not tens of thousands of advisors or bankers in a single company, to uncover best practices. You could then use that information like GPS driving directions that help every advisor behave in the moment and reach out in the moment like the very best advisor would,&#8221; Shih explained.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means sharing the information with the customer data platform (CDP), the CRM and marketing automation tooling to deliver more intelligent targeting based on a richer body of information. So the advisor can use information gleaned from everything he or she knows about the client across the set of tools to deliver more meaningful personal message instead of a targeted ad or an email blast. As Shih points out, the ad might even make sense, but could be tone deaf depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we focus on is this human-client experience, and that can only be delivered in the last mile because it&#8217;s only with the advisor that many clients will confide in these very important life events and life decisions, and then conversely, it&#8217;s only in the last mile that the trusted advisor can deliver relationship advice,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>She says what they are trying to do by combining streams of data about the customer is build loyalty in a way that pure technology solutions just aren&#8217;t capable of doing. As she says, nobody says they are switching banks because it has the best chat bot.</p>\n<p>Hearsay was founded in 2009 and has raised $51 million, as well as whatever other money Salesforce will be adding to the mix with today&#8217;s investment. Other investors include Sequoia and NEA Associates. Its last raise was way back in 2013, a $30 million Series C.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bjHoLWKsNig\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:30:02 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"3454fa844653b25652a086c8fd018c1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039712601_f922a6ca1002f5fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bjHoLWKsNig:-bIVHF6FEkc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn47@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039713270_c23e27a7a217be78.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bjHoLWKsNig":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_1/2020-07-29/1596039711897_fb8efa8c2161fbbf.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Only 3 days left for serious savings on Disrupt 2020 passes","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2021543","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Time to get your binge on at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=3daysleft&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=3daysleftpost&#38;display=TRUE\">Disrupt 2020</a>, startup fans.

batteries&#8221; to other automakers. Musk added that that would even include Autopilot, the advanced driver assistance software that Tesla offers to provide intelligent cruise control in a number of different driving scenarios.</p>\n<p>Musk was addressing a Teslerati article about how German automakers are looking to close the technology gap between themselves and Tesla when it comes to producing EVs. Volkswagen Chairman Herbert Diess has in past comments expressed admiration for Musk and Tesla&#8217;s accomplishments on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>VW has created its own EV platform, which it intends to use as the base for a number of different electric cars, ranging from sport sedans to SUVs. The company is also openly pursuing licensing its MEB platform to other automakers, and struck such a deal with Ford last July for the American automaker&#8217;s European business.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Musk says that Tesla&#8217;s interest in licensing stems from its underlying goal, which is &#8220;to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors&#8221; according to his tweet. This isn&#8217;t the first time the automaker has indicated a willingness to be more open in pursuit of that goal, either: In 2014, Musk <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you\">penned a blog post</a> announcing that Tesla would be making its intellectual property freely available to &#8220;anyone who, in good faith, wants to use [its] technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, that hasn&#8217;t stopped Tesla from taking aim at potential competitors via legal action on occasion – it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/\">filed suit against electric automaker Rivian and four of its former employees last week</a>, alleging theft of trade secrets and poaching key talent.</p>\n<p>A platform licensing or supplier relationship would be an entirely different arrangement, of course, and one with plenty of precedent in the automaker industry. Nor would it necessarily negatively impact Tesla&#8217;s own auto sales, since the company offers a number of other selling points above and beyond its underlying powertrain and battery tech.</p>\n<p>At the time of Volkswagen&#8217;s announcement, the German automaker said it expects it could make up to $20 billion in revenue through the MEB deal with Ford, with a significant chunk of that coming from MEB parts and components supply. Tesla could realize similar gains but perhaps amplified globally, especially if it can ramp powertrain and battery production beyond the capacity needs of its own vehicle demand capacity.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oCANSF6YsAU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 11:09:57 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1a45c0895f2f45a63dcd2e8b62d894c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn71@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039711999_b35241899c3d0576.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oCANSF6YsAU:JWbOxl46cvU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn19@2020_2/2020-07-29/1596039712014_cedd90cbe4de9a14.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oCANSF6YsAU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712888_a72d1a30b83e1394.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Build products that improve the lives of inmates","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023461","description":"<div class=\"article__contributor-byline-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"article__contributor-byline\">\n\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"byline__author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-name\">Nik Milanovic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\">Contributor</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"contributor__twitter\">\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NikMilanovic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--twitter icon--white\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" version=\"1.1\" aria-labelledby=\"title\">\n\t\t<title>Share on Twitter</title>\n\t\t<path d=\"M20,4c-0.7,0.3-1.5,0.6-2.4,0.7c0.9-0.5,1.5-1.4,1.8-2.3c-0.8,0.5-1.7,0.8-2.6,1C16.1,2.5,15,2,13.8,2c-2.3,0-4.1,1.9-4.1,4.2c0,0.3,0,0.7,0.1,1C6.4,7,3.4,5.4,1.4,2.9C1,3.5,0.8,4.1,0.8,4.9c0,1.4,0.7,2.7,1.8,3.5C2,8.4,1.4,8.2,0.8,7.9v0.1c0,2,1.4,3.7,3.3,4.1c-0.4,0.1-0.7,0.2-1.1,0.2c-0.3,0-0.5,0-0.8-0.1c0.5,1.7,2,2.9,3.8,2.9c-1.4,1.1-3.2,2-5.1,2c-0.3,0-0.7,0-1-0.1c1.8,1.2,4,1.7,6.3,1.7c7.5,0,11.7-6.4,11.7-12V6.1C18.8,5.6,19.4,4.8,20,4z\"/>\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tNik Milanovic is a fintech and financial inclusion enthusiast, with a decade of work across mobile payments, online lending, credit and microfinance.

One group perennially left out of tech conversations — moved out of sight and out of mind — is the 2.3 million people in the U.S. prison system. As tech becomes such a critical driver of progress in the world, we should be building products that improve inmates’ lives and help them reintegrate into society without the risk of relapse.</p>\n<p>I recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikMilanovic/status/1283816054909661184\">stumbled across</a> an essay I wrote following my work at the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, analyzing Norway’s humane prison systems and asking, “Could they work here?” These prisons are designed to replicate life outside their walls. They incorporate features like yoga classes and recording studios. They give inmates a chance to pursue higher education so that they can be meaningfully employed when they reenter the outside world. Anyone who has seen the documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_(film)\">13th</a> knows that American prisons are very different. Why?</p>\n<p>(Quick disclaimer: This is a fraught and emotional topic. It is hard to appreciate the complexity of incarceration and recidivism in a 1,000-word op-ed. I appreciate the input and forbearance of those with different perspectives.)</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Writ-large, the corrections system has <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/jenvogt/sentencing-notes\">five</a> goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Punish offenders.</li>\n<li>Incapacitate them (keep them off the streets).</li>\n<li>Deter crime.</li>\n<li>Repay society.</li>\n<li>Rehabilitate people so that they don’t commit more crimes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But sadly, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12\">per criminologist Bob Cameron</a>, &#8220;Americans want their prisoners punished first and rehabilitated second.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is why Norway has a <a href=\"https://www.encartele.net/2018/04/what-can-us-correctional-facilities-learn-from-scandinavian-jails/\">recidivism</a> rate of 20% while the U.S. rate hovers at around 75%. That is staggering. Three out of every four former inmates is at-risk of committing a crime after leaving prison. This is a huge deadweight loss for society. How much lower could that rate be if we invested in prisoners’ potential? If we gave them the tools to seamlessly reenter the world? Is there a role for private, for-profit enterprises here, and if so, how could technology be used to help people exit the corrections system permanently?</p>\n<h2>What’s being done today</h2>\n<p>Most tech coverage just focuses on tools used to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/study-shows-software-used-to-predict-repeat-offenders-is-no-better-at-it-than-untrained-humans/\">predict recidivism</a> and keep past offenders, many of whom are trying to reform their lives, behind bars. But there are many startups building products to help them successfully move on.</p>\n<p>New York-based <a href=\"https://apdscorporate.com/\">APDS</a> recently <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2020/06/25/apds-which-provides-educational-opportunities-to.html\">raised</a> a $5 million Series B to provide tablets that inmates can use for learning purposes. The tablets are now in-use in 88 correctional facilities in 17 states. Inmates can use the software to learn English, get their GEDs or learn entrepreneurship. North Carolina startup <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/North-Carolina-Turns-to-Technology-to-Reduce-Recidivism.html\">Pokket</a> helps inmates plan for life outside of prison in the six months leading up to their release date.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mission-launch.org/\">Mission: Launch</a> is an organization that hosts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/former-prisoners-rethink-criminal-justice-through-entrepreneurship-and-civic-technology/\">demo days and hackathons</a> for inmates. They teach financial literacy, entrepreneurship and community engagement. Hackathon participants so far have built an app to convert online messages from friends and family into written postcards for inmates (who are shut off from social media) and an app to help people leaving the corrections system to seal their records so that they can get hired again.</p>\n<p>Maintaining connections with friends and loved ones outside of prison makes a significant difference when it comes to reentering society. Technology company Securus recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-prisoners-isolation-technology\">announced</a> free messaging on its 290,000 tablets so that inmates can communicate with relatives without having to pay exorbitant <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/02/11/phone-justice-report/\">fees</a>. <a href=\"https://prisonvoicemail.com/\">Prison Voicemail</a> in the U.K. provides a cheap phone service that families can pay. In all cases when it comes to implementing technology to reduce recidivism, the financial burden should not fall on inmates, a captive population with limited agency and earning potential.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prisonscholars.org/what-we-do/our-solution-education/\">Prison Scholars</a>, a nonprofit founded by a former inmate, teaches entrepreneurship to inmates and helps them create post-incarceration business plans. They estimate that inmates who receive education are 43% less likely to return to prison, an implied ROI of $18.36 to society for every dollar invested. <a href=\"https://defyventures.org/\">Defy Ventures</a> boasts of 82% employment for program graduates and a 7.2% recidivism rate. <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/how-prisons-can-use-tech-to-help-reduce-recidivism.html\">Other programs</a> to teach digital literacy and <a href=\"https://www.aetv.com/shows/60-days-in/articles/inmates-as-tech-professionals\">coding</a>, which make resources like textbooks and Wikipedia available offline, have found similar success.</p>\n<p>There are many similar <a href=\"https://www.charlestonchronicle.net/2019/08/12/virtual-bridges-technology-helps-inmates-prepare-for-life-outside-prison/\">examples</a> of tech and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/10/06/digital-literacy-will-reduce-recidivism-in-the-long-term/\">education</a> directly lowering recidivism. But why stop here? What else could tech do to make an impact?</p>\n<h2>What we could still do</h2>\n<p>The U.S. <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/12/17/the-hidden-cost-of-incarceration#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Justice%20Statistics,2.3%20million%20people%20behind%20bars.\">spends</a> $80 billion to keep inmates behind bars. This creates an <em>enormous </em>financial incentive for taxpayers to reduce recidivism. Two related questions need to be addressed: Can tech companies actually make money on products to improve the lives of those in the prison system? And <em>should they</em>?</p>\n<p>To answer the first question &#8212; and at the risk of sounding crass &#8212; a very simplified business model could look like this: State governments pay companies somewhere between $0 and the cost of keeping an inmate in jail for one year (~$<a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/PolicyAreas/CJ/6_cj_inmatecost#:~:text=It%20costs%20an%20average%20of,%2432%2C000%20or%20about%2058%20percent.\">81,000</a>) for each inmate who successfully uses an educational product to prep for leaving prison.</p>\n<p>The payment could be split across multiple years, so that the longer someone is able to go without reoffending, the more the provider makes. If taxpayers paid tech providers just 50% of the cost to house an inmate for one year, the tech company would make a per-user LTV of over $40,000 (!). This kind of financial incentive could easily attract more talented entrepreneurs to the goal of improving the lives of people in the corrections system. (The opposite of the for-profit prison business model, which creates a perverse incentive to maintain a constant prison population.)</p>\n<p>The question of whether it is morally permissible for for-profit tech companies to sell products built for this demographic is a more difficult one. While there is no right answer, there are guidelines that companies could follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don’t charge inmates or their families.</strong> Taxpayers have the largest financial incentive to reduce recidivism — and all the associated costs of the prison — so it is to state corrections budgets that tech companies should look for revenue opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>No <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law#:~:text=Goodhart's%20law%20is%20an%20adage,to%20be%20a%20good%20measure.\">Goodhart&#8217;s law</a> or perverse incentives.</strong> Products have to be designed and sold based on principles, e.g., “help former inmates reintegrate into society and live full lives,” and not numeric targets, e.g., “keep former inmates from committing a felony within three years of leaving prison.” Numbers-based targets can always be gamed. Force companies to keep the end-goal in mind of giving people the tools to improve their lives.</li>\n<li><strong>Collect user feedback. Award contracts only to the companies with high user affinity.</strong> Unlike standard consumers, inmates experience a principal/agent problem: The purchaser of the services (taxpayers) is not the user (the inmate). States should require tech providers to collect anonymous feedback from the users of their products, and only award contracts to those that get the highest ratings.</li>\n<li><strong>Your product’s job-to-do does not end when the sentence does. </strong>If products built to reduce recidivism are truly successful, it means that the providers of those products will be slowly eliminating their own markets as prison populations go down. These products should be built not just to get people out of prison, but to help them build meaningful lives for the years after they leave.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are so, so many great products yet to be built for this demographic. A LinkedIn or <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/craigslist\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"craigslist\">Craigslist <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Jobs equivalent populated by the employers who hire former inmates. Live-streamed religious services so that inmates can continue to participate in their community faith organizations. Nonvocational hobby education platforms. Limited versions of MasterClass or Udemy or <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/coursera\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coursera\">Coursera <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. Closed-loop online games.</p>\n<p>Lastly &#8212; and needless to say &#8212; tech doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface when it comes to righting the wrongs of our corrections system. The reinstatement of voting rights, employment on-ramps and limits to background checks, the elimination of for-profit private prisons, adjustments to prison wages that tacitly amount to indentured servitude … the list of things we could improve is long. But tech can still play a critical role in improving the lives of fellow citizens in the corrections system.</p>\n<p>Mohandas Gandhi quipped that “The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/defy-ventures-redefines-the-hustle/\">Almost one-third </a>of Americans have some criminal history. The U.S. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#:~:text=As%20of%202016%2C%202.3%20million,the%20world's%209.8%20million%20prisoners.\">accounts</a> for 25% of the world’s prison population. Let’s stop ignoring this demographic and build tools that really make the world better for those who need it most.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/aMgWFBHvxvs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:30:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"0ea033a199095321684ea3692425f4c8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Richard Dal Porto","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn39@2020_3/2020-07-29/1596039686991_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn63@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712960_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-29/1596039712601_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713055_f0c8bdba290a4833.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=aMgWFBHvxvs:r55pJevAuvY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn87@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039712003_09de3671ce3da04c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_5/2020-07-29/1596039713105_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/aMgWFBHvxvs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2020-07-29/1596039711894_35d97195ce4377ef.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-30 00:21:23","updatedTime":"2020-07-29 16:21:23","title":"Humana partners with Heal and invests $100 million in the company’s doctor-on-demand service","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2023770","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">&#8220;The doctor&#8217;s office is dead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the way Nick Desai, the co-founder and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based startup <a href=\"http://www.heal.com/\">Heal</a> describes the future of traditional healthcare delivery.</p>\n<p>While Desai&#8217;s bluster may be wishful thinking, the doctor&#8217;s office is certainly changing, and that&#8217;s thanks in part to companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/heal\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"heal\">Heal, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> which offer in-home and telemedical consultations &#8212; and health insurance providers like <a href=\"http://www.humana.com\">Humana</a> that are backing them.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The two companies have announced a new partnership that will see <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/humana\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"humana\">Humana <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> pushing Heal&#8217;s in-home and virtual care delivery services to the patients it covers and committing $100 million to spur the Los Angeles-based startup&#8217;s growth.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Humana has a more strategic view of home-based care,&#8221; said Desai. &#8220;We want all payers to be this strategic. Most insurance partners offer Heal now but we want them to view it more strategically.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>For Desai, the home is the best place to get care because doctors can see the environment that may influence (and in some cases complicate or worsen) a patient&#8217;s condition. Heal, Desai says, also works with the digital technologies to provide more remote and persistent patient monitoring, so that doctors can have a better sense of a patient&#8217;s health over time, rather than at an acute moment of care.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;You want to talk to the doctor and get continuity of care,&#8221; said Desai. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We think we are…  an accelerant for the adoption of those services.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things like iPhone-based EKG machines, remote diagnostics to determine diabetic retinopathy, digital hubs to provide remote monitoring of body mass and movement are all hardware offerings within Heal&#8217;s panoply of care and diagnostic solutions. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to be able to gather more and more of those diagnostics remotely,&#8221; Desai said. &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything that makes care more accurate, more data driven, more timely we want to use and ask our patients to utilize so that they can get better care, more quickly and more affordably.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The new financing from Humana will go to support Heal&#8217;s geographic expansion, product development, and sales and marketing, Desai said. Already, the company has expanded into new treatment areas, including teletherapy for mental health.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussion between Heal and the Louisville-based Humana began back in December and the two businesses only inked the final terms of their deal last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heal telemedicine, telepsychology (CA only), and digital monitoring services are currently available in New York, New Jersey, Washington, California, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington D.C.

Our goal is to make the healthcare experience easier, more personalized and caring for the people we serve—and is the hallmark of how Humana delivers human care.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Desai, the deal is also an indicator of not just his company&#8217;s growth, but the growth of the entire Los Angeles technology ecosystem. </span></p>\n<p><span
