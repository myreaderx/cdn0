When Disney bought LucasFilm in 2012, they acquired a back catalog consisting of hundreds of novels by I don&#8217;t know how many authors. This issue potentially affects scores if not hundreds of authors, which at first made me doubt the veracity of the claims. After all, how could 8 years go by without other authors complaining?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is relatively simple; if there are other authors, and they signed the NDAs Foster mentioned, then they certainly would not be speaking now.</p>\n<p>I have reached out to both sides to ask for more information. I will add their responses to this post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_skeleton/\">mr.skeleton</a> via <a
