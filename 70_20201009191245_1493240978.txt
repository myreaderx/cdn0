It rids the need for hand-editing curves and manually accounting for scan densities, making it easy to go from scan to final image in a matter of minutes through its own graphic interface within Lightroom. Below is a year-old introduction to how Negative Lab Pro works:</p>\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sY8aow54Uyw?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe></div>\n<p>With that out of the way, let’s get on to the new features Negative Lab Pro 2.2 brings to the table.</p>\n<p>First up, Negative Lab Pro 2.2 features an entirely rebuilt engine that ensures the entire workflow can be done with Raw file formats and is non-destructive. Now, rather than there being multiple layers of adjustments atop the image, all conversions and adjustments are made directly to the Raw negative scan (if you convert the scanned negative into a Raw file format upon import). In theory, this should mean there isn’t any loss of quality when multiple adjustments are made on top of one another.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 534px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5846005791/452fca3503c866e935d4cb80f938b9597d2525a7.gif\" target=\"article-76733adc6b394b4380297144832e4328\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/5846005791/452fca3503c866e935d4cb80f938b9597d2525a7.gif\" width=\"534\" data-filename=\"452fca3503c866e935d4cb80f938b9597d2525a7.gif\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 534px;\">A screen recording showing how the curves will intelligently adjust based on the adjustments made to scans.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The new engine also features what its developer calls ‘Multilayer Auto-Generating Integrated Curves,’ which is a fancy way of saying the plug-in is able to intelligently adjust the curves to preserve the tonality and scans as adjustments are made. Negative Lab Pro developer Nate Johnson provides an explanation for how this new technology works:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>‘The new engine has its own processing pipeline with 9 internal processing layers working together seamlessly under the hood. Internally, I can define, order and combine each layer in the way that makes the most sense for film processing. For instance, color balancing happens earliest in the pipeline, so your color balance remains stable even if you drastically adjust your tones. Negative Lab Pro then auto-generates up to 42 curve points in real time (14 integrated points for each color channel), which are then fed directly into Lightroom’s curve control.’</em></p>\n<p>Put simply, this new development should result in ‘purer tones and colors’ in your negatives, even as adjustments are applied.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of the redesigned engine is improved color stability. Now, adjustments made to the image — such as contrast, brightness and more — won’t affect the color balance of an image. Nate demonstrates in the comparison images below the difference between Negative Lab Pro version 2.1 and version 2.2 when making changes to contrast:</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop twoBottom center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"250\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_4.jpeg\" target=\"article-76733adc6b394b4380297144832e4328\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"250\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS250x0~articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_4.jpeg\" width=\"250\" data-filename=\"Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_4.jpeg\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_3.jpeg\" target=\"article-76733adc6b394b4380297144832e4328\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"250\" height=\"140\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS250x0~articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_3.jpeg\" width=\"250\" data-filename=\"Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_3.jpeg\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A collection of new tools have also been added to Negative Lab Pro 2.2, including film-specific color temperature and tint sliders, a new color picker, range control for highlights and shadows, and new tone profile families, which provide different baselines for getting started with editing your scans.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_2.jpeg\" target=\"article-76733adc6b394b4380297144832e4328\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/5846005791/Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_2.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Negative_Lab_Pro_2.2_2.jpeg\"></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The integrated temp/tint sliders that use the new 2.2 engine.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you’re using Negative Lab Pro 2.2 with Lightroom Classic, the update also adds new LUT-based emulations.

Automatic download and display provide the ability to fully evaluate photos in seconds, and real time live view output will help focus and compose the image. Scripting language lets users have control of their camera, allowing them to take multiple photos with varying settings just by clicking a single button.</p>\n<p>This integration with the Smart Shooter Plug-In adds onto native Lightroom Classic functionality to provide:</p>\n<p><strong>Compatibility with Sony Cameras:</strong> Users will be able to see their Sony camera in the Lightroom Classic tethering bar and ingest images directly into Lightroom Classic without any additional configuration or set-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatically Apply Lightroom Presets:</strong> Using the plug-in, images are immediately imported into Lightroom Classic catalogs so that users will be able to apply presets in real-time. This saves time compared to alternative solutions that require use of watch folders.</p>\n<p><strong>Save to card and computer simultaneously:</strong> Smart Shooter provides the ability to capture and save images to both their computer and camera memory card for backup.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Tethering Features:</strong> Direct your tethered session from Smart Shooter to take advantage of its advanced tethering features including multi-loupe view, Live View, automated scripts, increased camera controls and more while still instantly transferring images to Lightroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Barcode Scanning:</strong> Automatically scan barcodes or QR codes, through the camera lens, to automate workflow, improve organization and save time in post-production.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-camera connectivity:</strong> Seamlessly toggle between up to 8 cameras in Lightroom or simultaneously control and trigger up to 8 cameras from the Smart Shooter interface.</p>\n<p>Long-time Lightroom user and photographer Bryan Welsh stated, \"As a working portrait photographer, I rely on tools that enhance my ability to work without adding stress. The new plug-in for Smart Shooter 4 and Adobe Lightroom [Classic] performs seamlessly to deliver on that. This combination allows me to see my best work realized.\"</p>\n<p>Smart Shooter comes in two versions, both for a single user, but with different options and prices. Smart Shooter 4, which costs $69.95, can be used with one camera and offers tethered shooting, remote control, live view and prepackaged scripts. Smart Shooter 4 PRO has the functions from the base version, but offers multi-camera control, Through the Lens Barcode and QR code scanning, external API integration and custom scripting.
