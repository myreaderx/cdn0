{"code":1,"isDone":false,"toInsertArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:25:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:25:44","title":"27","link":"http://www.themagpi.com/?post_type=issue_post&p=1174","description":"<p>Welcome to Issue 27 of The MagPi magazine. This month&#8217;s issue is packed cover to cover with something for just about everyone!</p>\n<p>Are you tired of controlling your Raspberry Pi with the same old mouse and keyboard? Have you ever wished you could have the ergonomic feel of a console controller in your hands when playing some of those retro games we have written about in past issues? If you answered yes to either of these questions, why not take a look at Mark Routledge&#8217;s fantastic article describing how to do just that.</p>\n<p>Alec Clews talks us through the use of Git, a free version control software package that we also use here at The MagPi to ensure that all of the team work on the most up to date copy of each issue. This is a great read, especially if you work with any type of document or file as part of a team.</p>\n<p>As you can see from our front cover, we return to the popular world of Minecraft in Dougie Lawson&#8217;s clever article on building QR code structures inside the game. We also have more physical computing from ModMyPi, and a great father and son story on building and funding a Raspberry Pi project through Kickstarter.</p>\n<p>Of course we have not forgotten about programming. William Bell continues his popular C++ series and we also have part three of our game programming series using FUZE BASIC. Start thinking of some game ideas now because in the next issue we will have a game programming competition.</p>\n<p>If you want even more from The MagPi this month then why not join us on the 11th October at the SWAMP Fest event (see this month&#8217;s Events page) where we will have our own stand. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this month&#8217;s issue and don&#8217;t forget to like our Facebook page and leave a comment at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MagPiMagazine\" class=\"autohyperlink\" title=\"http://www.facebook.com/MagPiMagazine\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/MagPiMagazine</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?a=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?a=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?a=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?a=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?i=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?a=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?i=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/themagpi/~4/UIsD2YOMzM0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 21:41:35 +0000","feedId":34732,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"1f68c913e68845234551ba8d62f33118","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn85@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-25-44-571_fc006b694332b2c1.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"williamhbell","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn85@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-25-44-571_fc006b694332b2c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_6/2020/10/13/06-25-45-759_4d5247f098222fc8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn97@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-25-45-723_88907b3cc6093d5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?i=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn1@2020_1/2020/10/13/06-25-45-782_5ce28fba13d98379.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/themagpi?i=UIsD2YOMzM0:58SEpWB6Gq0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn90@2020_5/2020/10/13/06-25-45-833_096bbaed7b38a99e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/themagpi/~4/UIsD2YOMzM0":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602570344430}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:25:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:25:44","feedId":34732,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:25:44 +0000","fetchMs":107,"handleMs":180311,"totalMs":182587,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"73ea241ae7d255271935defd73b6cde0","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"16508a984879497ca12a6871133aae39_34732","contentType":"text/xml;
