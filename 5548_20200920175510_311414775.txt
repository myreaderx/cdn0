I’m curious because I remember that you posted a photo of weeds on your Facebook story.” Suddenly, I realized two things after that question:</p><ul><li>Whether I like it or not, anything I share on social media can affect other’s thoughts. Sometimes, it impinges on them.</li><li>People who work in the creative industry have misunderstandings about stimulants.</li></ul><p>I have not shared everything on Facebook, but I have never mentioned using stimulants at work. Until last night, a friend sent me an article about a designer who was arrested while using weed, and then he explained that it helped him be more creative.</p><p><strong>So, could stimulant drugs help us boost our creativity?</strong></p><p>In this article, I will share what I know based on my experience and feeling about creative work. I hope you will find out your answer after reading.</p><h3><strong>1. What is creativity?</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"what-is-creativity\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*palvb-w5EV21QGfaAH9lPg.jpeg\" /></figure><blockquote><strong>“Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing.”<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.creativityatwork.com/2014/02/17/what-is-creativity/\">creativityatwork.com</a></blockquote><p>According to this definition, creativity has 2 phases a.k.a <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-solve-problems-applying-a-uxdesign-designthinking-hcd-or-any-design-process-from-scratch-v2-aa16e2dd550b\">double diamond process</a>.</p><p><strong>Phase 1 — Do the right things:</strong> the purpose of this stage is to identify the problem that needs to be solved properly. There are two parts:</p><ul><li>The first one is to collect project information in many ways: ask questions to have design materials, create design direction, and get expectations from customers.</li><li>The second one is to understand and redefine whether the problem we are solving is correct or not; we are truly understanding it or not. There are some techniques: Debrief, Find out insights, ask yourself the question “What can I do?”, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase 2 — Do the things right:</strong> it’s time to find the right solution. There are also two parts:</p><ul><li>Try some methods to list all suitable and potential solutions: Research, Brainstorm, Sketching, etc. to get an idea pool, strategies, concepts, sketches, or demo.</li><li>Review methods: Feedback, Clarify, Revise, and Develop existing solutions. Repeat this process until finding out the most suitable solution.</li></ul><p>For example, when you design a logo, you will see creativity is a process that goes through these steps:</p><ul><li>Receive requirements and information from a client;</li><li>Clarify unclear points;</li><li>Debrief to make sure the elements of color, shape, layout, and message the logo needs to convey are what they want precisely;</li><li>Ask the client if they have any idea to input or design references. Then analyze our ability whether we can do it or not;</li><li>Research, referencing, and sketch ideas;</li><li>Select 3 options that suit the requirements;</li><li>Send them to the client and wait for their feedback;</li><li>Receive feedback, discuss, and revise;</li><li>Finalize the logo and close the project.</li></ul><h3><strong>2. States of work</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"states-of-work\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J47_eoNyEMY3ursxa_yymg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>In the book “Deep Work”, <strong>Cal Newport</strong> mentioned two concepts: Deep Work and Shallow Work.</p><ul><li><strong>Deep work:</strong> the state requires a high level of cognitive concentration without any dispersion, and must try hard to practice skills at the same time. In the creative process, Do the things right phase will require Deep work the most.</li><li><strong>Shallow work:</strong> the state requires logical, repetitive, and does not need a lot of concentration.</li></ul><p>It’s easy to realize that Deep work state will create the most value in working. Especially, machines (Artificial Intelligence) can replace people in the Shallow work in this Digital Economy. Then we can only compete with machines with our deep work capabilities. You can find out more about this topic by searching on the internet with the keywords “Deep work”, or buy the book aforementioned to dig deep about it.</p><h3><strong>3. Why stimulants?</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"why-use-stimulants-while-you-can-try-heathier-methods\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fDrW_EnqUHfMBGZil_NK0w.jpeg\" /></figure><p>It is hard to get into Deep work state because it requires brain training for a long time, and you have to switch to different working habits. In this digital world, it’s much more difficult because many things can distract us: social media, entertainment news, games, etc. Many companies invest vast amounts of research in finding ways to catch our attention as much as possible. Therefore, to maintain Deep work state, we have different forms:</p><ul><li>Psychologist<strong> Carl Jung</strong> built a stone house in Switzerland to focus on thinking and writing only. He chose to “Escape from the World”;</li><li>I do demanding tasks that require creativity between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m, the period time when I can entirely focus on work;</li><li><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> chose a minimalist lifestyle to focus on more important things. He developed a daily routine such as walking in the park, skimming a book, lying on the couch to recharge. Furthermore, he also applied the Pomodoro method, which was not yet named at that time. How genius he is!</li></ul><p>On the other hand, some famous artists choose stimulants: <strong>Vincent van Gogh</strong>, <strong>Thomas Kinkade</strong>, <strong>Andy Warhol</strong>.</p><p>Science has proven that a sufficient dose of stimulants will help the brain more flexible; it promotes converging thinking, which affects people’s concentration. In other words, we can easily concentrate when using stimulants. Many different types of stimulants, coffee (caffeine), and cigarette (nicotine) are two things we can easily find in daily life. <strong>Because the Do the things right phase requires us to be continually in Deep work state, then Designer often thinks that stimulants will help them be more creative.</strong></p><h3><strong>4. How do stimulants affect us?</strong></h3><figure><img alt=\"how-do-stimulants-affect-us\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1ieWA5cD8ZbrnyAxRawe0g.jpeg\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~mfarah/pdfs/Creativity-Psychopharm.pdf\"><strong>A 2009 study by Martha Farah</strong></a> has shown that stimulants push thinking convergence, and foster our concentration. However, it reduces the ability to think differently in healthy people. If you have used stimulants, indeed you are familiar with the feeling as if everything is very desirable, fuzzy, all senses are more sensitive, and you become emotional. Sounds chill, right? Psychologists believe that your self-awareness will decrease when you are at this stage, and the accuracy of everything around you is reduced. This is when our feelings gradually erode, causing us to begin to separate from our true selves. Finally, it makes us harder to identify our true feelings.</p><p>For a creator, losing yourself will affect your style. Notably, it also reduces our capacity for social interaction, and makes communication more difficult.</p><p>I can’t deny it has a positive effect sometimes. In case that we are overwhelmed by negative emotions or stress for a long time, stimulants can help us relax temporarily. We feel happy and forget our anxiety for a short period.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Low doses of stimulant has the effect of increasing concentration, attention, and perception. Moderate doses can lead to increased euphoria and strength, addiction, and cognitive decline. High doses will lead to psychosis and complete depression. <strong>Too much of anything is not good!</strong></p><h3>5. My thoughts</h3><figure><img alt=\"personal-thoughts-on-stimulants\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SaWeS6zd5NgCoulQgqrCOw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Basically, <strong>life is trade-offs!</strong> I understand that using stimulants to improve concentration is an act of trading health for efficiency at work. This is a lousy trade-off because most of us agree that health is the most important thing in the end. Moreover, when we use stimulants for a long time, we will get addicted. As a result, the body always feels “hungry”, then sends signals that push us to feed more stimulants. Day by day, it will make us so addicted, and we can’t live without it. Alternatively, we can look for other methods to help us get into the state of “Deep Work” in a healthier way.</p><p>I used to use weed to relax and stop thinking about my stressful work sometimes. Luckily, now I found a more effective way instead of depending on weed like the time before. I will share more detail in another article.</p><p>Currently, researchers are still arguing whether stimulants are harmful or not. But for me, depending on something to assure the quality of work will not be professional at all! And our lack of professionalism that is harmful to our careers.</p><blockquote><strong>Don’t believe in stimulants — believe in yourself!</strong></blockquote><p>Do you have any experience with it? Please share your thought!
