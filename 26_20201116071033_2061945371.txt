So when Dominic Penaloza left his job at WeWork China as the head of innovation and technology this spring, he decided to focus on proptech in Asia.</p> \n<p>Instead of building a startup himself or investing in one, Penaloza combines both objectives by launching a “startup studio” called <a href=\"https://www.reinventventures.com/\">REinvent</a> (“RE” short for “real estate”). The industry jargon refers to an organization that builds startups with an in-house team, hence it’s also referred to as a “startup factory” or “venture builder.” A famous example is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/rocket-internet/\">Rocket Internet</a>, which is credited for building Lazada in Southeast Asia and Jumia in Africa.</p> \n<p>Penaloza, a serial entrepreneur who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/wework-confirms-deal-to-buy-naked-hub-one-of-its-main-competitors-in-china/\">exited his co-working startup Naked Hub to WeWork China</a> in 2018, now runs a team of 45 across Shanghai, Taipei and Singapore, most of whom he has worked with at WeWork and Naked Hub. The studio is organized into what the chief executive calls product “squads” consisting of the likes of product managers, designers, engineers, and artificial intelligence experts, and has the capacity to work on four projects at one time.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>The founder also brought onboard heavyweight investors to help the startup studio tackle a sector with deeply entrenched players. Among REinvent’s backers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074078/about:blank\">JustCo</a>, a major co-working company in the Asia Pacific backed by some of Asia’s biggest property owners, such as the Singaporen sovereign wealth fund <a href=\"https://www.gic.com.sg/\">GIC</a>; multi-national property developer <a href=\"https://www.frasersproperty.com/\">Frasers Property</a>; and one of Japan’s leading real estate firms <a href=\"https://www.kentaku.co.jp/corporate/en/\">Daito Trust</a>.</p> \n<p>REinvent has full ownership in the ventures it launches, while the three investors own equity in it. The company declined to disclose how much it has raised from its investors so far.</p> \n<p>The financiers also importantly contribute strategic resources, Penaloza told TechCrunch in an interview. Started in May, REinvent has already launched two ventures, including one called <a href=\"https://www.switch.site/\">Switch</a> that lets individuals and enterprises book workspace and pay per minute, similar to how bike-sharing works. The difference is that Switch is a marketplace with third-party landlords like JustCo and Frasers, while bike-share companies often supply and operate the bikes themselves.</p> \n<p>\n <div id=\"attachment_2074082\" style=\"width: 336px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n  <img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074082\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2074082 \" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"326\" height=\"709\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-reinvent-3.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px\" />\n  <p id=\"caption-attachment-2074082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screenshot of the Switch app</p>\n </div></p> \n<p>The marketplace today has a growing network of 2,500 desks at over 20 locations across Singapore, including small office booths that have sprung up across malls. It’s proposing on-demand workspace at a time when the whole world is forced by the coronavirus pandemic to rethink where to work physically.</p> \n<p>“Real estate companies are all figuring out how to react to COVID, how to help organizations survive COVID and to prepare for the next pandemic so the impact on business would not be as big as this time,” said Penaloza.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, flexible work pods are an attractive proposition for mall owners, especially those in China looking for new tenants as e-commerce encroaches into offline retail.</p> \n<p>“E-commerce was eating up the traditional retail model even before COVID. Developers in China are trying to repurpose some of their malls… There are now a lot of F&amp;B, experiential stores, cafes, and even co-working space inside malls,” observed Penaloza.</p> \n<p>Penaloza <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/former-tesla-and-lyft-exec-jon-mcneill-just-launched-a-fund-that-plans-to-spin-out-its-own-companies/\">tested an early version</a> of his on-demand workspace vision back at WeWork China where he made the firm’s public space available to customers without a membership, capturing professionals who use Starbucks for meetings and remote working but providing a quieter environment and better WiFi.</p> \n<p>The other product REinvent has introduced is SixSense, software for spatial analytics and social distance detection.</p> \n<p>“Real estate is something not many people think about, but it’s one of the biggest industries on earth,” <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;

He declined to disclose the specific amount, however, or comment on the valuation.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>We used to live in a seller’s world, where buyers had a small selection of choices from which they could pick their products. “You wanted to buy a car, there would be only one new car model every four years. Things have changed,” said Depura, noting that customers today have no shortage of companies trying to sell them similar lines of products.</p>\n<p>While that’s great for customers, it means that companies have to put more effort to make a sale. Regardless of what these firms are attempting to sell, they are competing with dozens of other companies, if not more, and trying to reach customers whose patience is dropping at an alarming level.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, as Depura watched Facebook and gaming firms like Zynga develop addictive products and services, he wondered if some of these learnings could be baked directly into modern age sales efforts. That was the inception of MindTickle, which now helps companies train their customer-facing teams.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mindtickle.com/\">MindTickle</a>, whose name is inspired from the idea of gamifying mindsets, allows companies to train and upskill their salespeople at scale, and uses role playing methods to help them practice their pitch, and how they should handle a customer’s queries.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2074103\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2074103\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2074103 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"873\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2074103\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">MindTickle helps companies train their salespeople in a way that makes the learning feels like a game.

Some of the names it did share include MongoDB, Nutanix, Qualtrics, Procore, Square, Janssen, Cloudera, Dexcom, Merck &#38; Co., and Benetton Group.</p>\n<p>More importantly, its clients have publicly praised the startup&#8217;s platform. As of this writing, MindTickle is ranked as the <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/enterprise\">top product for enterprises</a> and <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/top-sales\">fifth best product for sales</a> on G2, a popular marketplace for software and services.</p>\n<p>As for the business side, the startup said its revenue has grown by over 170% in the past year and it is hopeful to end the year at an annual recurring revenue of more than $30 million. Like several other SaaS startups, MindTickle has also been immune to the virus.</p>\n<p>In fact, it has seen a surge in its customer base and usage in recent months as firms shut offices and moved work to remote platforms to avoid their exposure to the coronavirus, said Depura. &#8220;Today, our platform is being used in ways we had not even envisioned,&#8221; he said, adding that at some firms, finance departments and HR teams have also moved to MindTickle. &#8220;We are seeing a major shift.&#8221;</p>\n<p>“MindTickle’s track record of growth, quality of product and marquee customer base highlights their strengths,” said Sumer Juneja, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “By delivering engaging and personalized training to users, MindTickle is uniquely placed to support businesses to increase revenue generation and extend critical capabilities within their existing workforce.” The Japanese investment group, which began conversations with MindTickle about three months ago, says it is exploring more investments in SaaS categories.</p>\n<p>The new fund will allow MindTickle, which employs about 400 people in the U.S., Europe, and India, to further establish this new category, said Depura. The startup is also developing new product features and will deploy the new funds to further grow in Europe, and the U.S., which is already one of its key markets.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/eO_CCJyBndA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:01:37 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg","linkMd5":"4c19eca02a94ce66ba9c764dc40b9910","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/16/07-10-06-353_65f2e3d52b1fd9c2.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":873,"sourceBytes":167389,"destBytes":59912,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mindtickle_sample.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/16/07-10-06-353_65f2e3d52b1fd9c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn10@2020_3/2020/11/16/07-10-29-449_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn86@2020_1/2020/11/16/07-10-32-227_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn40@2020_4/2020/11/16/07-10-32-319_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn36@2020_1/2020/11/16/07-10-32-244_754ceb8a041a8755.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eO_CCJyBndA:VvORZKgmMLU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_2/2020/11/16/07-10-32-275_bc0274d17bc0e184.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn90@2020_5/2020/11/16/07-10-32-421_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/eO_CCJyBndA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn53@2020_1/2020/11/16/07-10-32-313_e0dba8124ec40e71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605510598510},{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 15:09:58","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 15:09:58","title":"Apple responds to Gatekeeper issue with upcoming fixes","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2074153","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has updated <a href=\"\">a documentation page</a> detailing the company’s next steps to prevent last week’s Gatekeeper bug from happening again, as Rene Ritchie <a href=\"\">spotted</a>.

Does Apple log every app you launch on your Mac to gain competitive insights on app usage?</p>\n<p>It turns out it&#39;s easy to answer that question as the server doesn&#39;t mandate encryption. Jacopo Jannone intercepted an unencrypted network request and <a href=\"\">found out</a> that Apple is not secretly spying on you. Gatekeeper really does what it says it does.</p>\n<p>“We have never combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are launching or running on their devices,” the company <a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>But Apple is going one step further and communicating on the company&#39;s next steps. The company has stopped logging IP addresses on its servers since last week. It doesn&#39;t have to store this data for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/gatekeeper-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"gatekeeper-2\">Gatekeeper <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p>\n<p>“These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs” Apple writes.</p>\n<p>Finally, Apple is overhauling the design of the network request and adding a user-facing opt-out option.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n“In addition, over the the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>\n<li>Strong protections against server failure</li>\n<li>A new preference for users to opt out of these security protections”</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"c8c6Xn6n65\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/macos-apps-wont-launch/\">PSA: macOS is a little broken this morning, with many non-Apple apps hanging at launch</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;PSA: macOS is a little broken this morning, with many non-Apple apps hanging at launch&#8221;
