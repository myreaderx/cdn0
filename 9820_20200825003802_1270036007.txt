They&#8217;ve got 15 minutes to kill, so they pick up their phone and (because they&#8217;re 46 and don&#8217;t know about TikTok yet) scroll through Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between checking out their best friend&#8217;s pictures from a tropical vacation and trying to untangle their Aunt Ida&#8217;s&#8230; uh, &#8220;unorthodox&#8221; political insights, they see your Facebook advertisement for gorgeous, handmade leather bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ads reach people like this because of tracking, pixels, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/social-media/facebook-lookalike-audiences/\" target=\"_blank\">lookalike audiences</a>, and all the other technical magic that powers Facebook&#8217;s advertising platform. Facebook can see that this potential customer is in the market for a new leather bag (they were just searching for one last night!) and, based on the demographic targeting you&#8217;ve applied, shows them your ad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only five minutes left until the school bell rights and children flood out the doors into the car, demanding snacks, Fortnite V-Bucks, and meaningful action to address global climate change. So, your prospect clicks your ad with the intent to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only&#8230; <strong>your Facebook ad doesn&#8217;t send them where they expected</strong>. Instead, it takes them to the homepage of your store. The beautiful leather bag you were advertising is nowhere in sight. Now the kids are in the car, the phone is back in the console, and the sale is lost. Where&#8217;d you go wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to discuss how <strong>dedicated Facebook landing pages help you capture more of these near-miss conversions</strong>. Along the way, we&#8217;ll highlight ways you can optimize your pages to make &#8217;em more impactful and share some examples of digital brands who&#8217;re doing it right.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/social-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blog-visual-cta-generic-social-lightgrey.jpg\" alt=\"Landing Pages with Social Media\" width=\"2260\" height=\"1216\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is a Facebook Landing Page?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Facebook landing page is a dedicated page designed to convert visitors from a specific <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/ppc/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>pay-per-click (PPC)</strong></a> Facebook ad</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These landing pages are different from other pages (like product pages on your website) because they&#8217;re tailor-made to complement your Facebook ad. They continue the story—the hook, the design, the call to action that was introduced to the reader as they scrolled through their Facebook newsfeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, Facebook offered landing pages within their own platform. These allowed businesses to gate their content for Facebook likes (earning them the nickname &#8220;like gate&#8221;), but they haven&#8217;t been available since 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, when we talk about Facebook landing pages, we&#8217;re talking about the first page someone sees after they click on a Facebook ad—not to be confused with the on-platform landing pages Facebook used to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Do I Need Landing Pages for My Facebook Ads?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s Facebook newsfeed is unique. The content and pages you like, the friends you&#8217;re connected to, the groups you&#8217;re joined—these things all influence the way your newsfeed populates. Because prospects&#8217; newsfeeds are personalized and the ads they see are highly targeted, your Facebook landing page needs to be tightly aligned with your ad if it&#8217;s going to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some other reasons that having dedicated landing pages for each Facebook ad is good practice:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Potential customers need more information</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scrollers, readers, and browsers on Facebook need extra nurturing to go from ad click to purchase. These potential customers are in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness\">brand awareness phase</a>. To convert on your page, they&#8217;ll wanna see specific information related to whatever got them to click on the ad in the first place. A focused Facebook landing page—with concise info and a consistent message—is the best way to turn them into customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mobile users are distracted users</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t log into Facebook for in-depth reading and focused learning. They&#8217;re filling time, or just picking up their phone for a quick check-in. And because <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/\" target=\"_blank\">94% of Facebook ad revenue is from a mobile device</a>, you should assume everyone who sees your ad only has five minutes or less to make a purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why you need to make it as easy as possible to go from Facebook ad to landing page call to action. Every navigation obstacle or confusing message risks losing your prospect&#8217;s attention and having them move on to something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Homepages are slow and overwhelming</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Homepages are great for solution-aware prospects looking for specific information, but they can be overwhelming for visitors from social media. (Just think of all the distractions: nav bars, calls to action, lists of products and features.) A MECLABS study found that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.smallbizdaily.com/5-common-problems-b2b-lead-generation-fix-them/#:~:text=According%20to%20MECLABS%2044%25%20of,cost%20you%20that%20lead%2C%20forever.\" target=\"_blank\">44% of clicks generated by B2B companies send readers to a homepage</a> and not a dedicated landing page. That&#8217;s a lot of businesses that aren&#8217;t optimizing for conversions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An average visitor <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/#:~:text=Dive%20Brief%3A,seconds%20on%20a%204G%20connection.\" target=\"_blank\">won&#8217;t wait more than three seconds for a page to load</a>.  Most websites are heavy with images, scripts, and other elements that make them slower than an optimized landing page. When you send your Facebook ad traffic to your homepage, you&#8217;re probably losing more customers than you realize. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Do I Create a High-Converting Facebook Landing Page</strong>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got a quick-reference list of Facebook <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">landing page best practices</a> below, but there are two things you really wanna keep in mind as you start building your page:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know your audience</strong>. It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook has amazing targeting capabilities, but you won&#8217;t be able to take advantage of them if you don&#8217;t know anything about your ideal prospects. Before you shell out the cash for Facebook ads, make sure that you know your audience well. Spend time investigating how potential customers search for your solution, what words they use when describing products or services similar to yours, and what features or benefits interest them most. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep it consistent</strong>. When writing for a Facebook landing page, remember to keep the messaging consistent between your ad and your landing page. Marketers might think that repeating copy is repetitive, but it can help reinforce your message to prospects and reassure them they&#8217;re in the right place after they click. Same with calls to action: if someone clicks an ad about earning a doctoral degree, that&#8217;d better be the main focus of your landing page. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>5 Facebook Landing Page Must-Haves</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Clear unique selling proposition (USP)</strong>. Visitors should immediately be able to tell what makes your product or service a fit for their needs. Don&#8217;t bury the most important details lower on your page—show &#8217;em above the fold.</li><li><strong>Strong, descriptive headlines</strong>. Your headline should make the reader want to know more or see more. The headline on both the Facebook ad and landing page should convey the same offer.</li><li><strong>Consistent design elements</strong>. The goal here is to continue the story you started on Facebook, and that includes visuals. If the images on your Facebook ad are neutral colors with images of smiling kids, then your Facebook landing page should also have neutral colors with images of smiling kids.</li><li><strong>High-quality images or videos</strong>. This seems like a gimme, but you&#8217;d be surprised how many Facebook landing pages use low-res visuals that scare off prospects right after they&#8217;ve clicked an ad. Make sure to use images or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-benefits-of-using-video-on-landing-pages/\">videos on your landing page</a> that shows your offer in the best light.</li><li><strong>A singular, compelling call to action</strong>. You can repeat your call to action throughout the page, but you should only ask visitors to do one specific thing. Plus, your copy should tell them exactly what happens when they do that thing: for example, &#8220;get the ebook&#8221; rather than &#8220;submit&#8221; on a form.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Examples of Facebook Landing Pages Done Right</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;d never give you all this information without providing some concrete examples. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of Facebook landing pages from Unbounce customers who really know what they&#8217;re doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quarters: Target Your Ads with Demographic Information</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://quarters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quarters</a> is an all-inclusive community living space in multiple locations around the world. They advertise their service on Facebook by highlighting their transparent pricing, contract flexibility, and included amenities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Facebook ad that Quarters is running has five variants. Each features copy and imagery designed to target people looking for housing in a particular city or neighborhood—say, Manhattan—allowing Facebook to surface relevant ads depending on audience location.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Quarters.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Quarters_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - Quarters\" class=\"wp-image-97855\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://quarters.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quarters</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone clicks through to the landing page, Quarters encourages them to &#8220;Check Availability,&#8221; repeating the call to action throughout the page to keep it top-of-mind. This does a great job of guiding visitors to take the next step in the purchase journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a place to live can be a substantial expense (especially in the Big Apple), and Quarters anticipates their prospects will have plenty of questions. The landing page includes tons of useful information, including 360-degree tours of available rooms, details on the neighborhoods (with images and maps), and quick-reference lists of amenities and pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>TapSnap + Samuraw: Give Visitors Everything They Need to Convert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a couple of landing pages that show it&#8217;s often more important to be clear than clever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.tapsnap.net/\" target=\"_blank\">TapSnap</a> is a photo booth rental company and their Facebook landing page makes that obvious. Above the fold, their message is super straightforward: they&#8217;re selling photo booths, they&#8217;ll deliver them to you, here&#8217;s how to get in touch. <em>Boom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side note: Check out the arrow at the bottom of the fold that directs your eye to more information. Without it, the page might&#8217;ve created a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/false-bottom/\" target=\"_blank\">false bottom</a> effect, leading people to believe that they were at the bottom of the page when there&#8217;s actually more to read. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Tapsnap.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Tapsnap_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - TapSnap\" class=\"wp-image-97859\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.tapsnap.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TapSnap</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Further down, TapSnap provides a concise, skimmable list of features that help prospects quickly understand what they can expect from the product. Plus, the brand shows its booths in action with photos from real events (alongside examples of the different kinds of pictures available) to show off the experience they create. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TapSnap doesn&#8217;t leave anything to the imagination—and neither does <a href=\"https://www.samuraw.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Samuraw</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuraw offers a high-quality mineral and probiotic supplement made from natural ingredients, and this Facebook landing page (built by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.webistry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Webistry</a>) delivers that message right away in the headline. By including the &#8220;add to cart&#8221; call to action above the fold, Samuraw also gives visitors a clear path to purchase.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Samuraw.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Samuraw_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - Samuraw\" class=\"wp-image-97856\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.samuraw.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Samuraw</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re already in the market for a real-food multivitamin and probiotic (who isn&#8217;t?), you might choose to purchase right them. But if you&#8217;re curious about ingredients and other nutritional details, Samuraw has done a great job of providing all that information further down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another neat feature of this Samuraw landing page is the sticky call to action that follows visitors as they scroll the page. This helps keep the offer top of mind and makes it easy for readers to purchase the product when they&#8217;re ready to convert.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Wanna see how other brands are using Facebook landing pages to grow their businesses?</strong> Check out this post about <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/campaign-strategy/baby-food-brand-brought-in-email-subscribers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how a baby food brand used Facebook to create an email list of 14,000+ subscribers</a>, or this one about <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/ppc/how-indochino-uses-unbounce-for-ppc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how Indochino drove 50% growth</a> in just one year. </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2>Taboola + TurnKey: Use Proof Points to Establish Credibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging proof (like evidence of your supposed benefits or testimonials from happy customers) in your Facebook ad and landing page copy is a powerful way to create trust with your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://www.taboola.com/advertisers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taboola</a>, an advertising and sponsored content platform that you&#8217;ve probably seen surfacing content all over the web. In this Facebook ad, Taboola makes sure to highlight their expansive digital network: &#8220;Reach 1.4B users &#8211; and get traffic that converts.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a huge benefit that&#8217;s sure to get the attention of businesses who wanna get their message in front of loads of prospects.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Taboola.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Taboola_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - Taboola\" class=\"wp-image-97858\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.taboola.com/advertisers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taboola</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Taboola continues to build trust on their Facebook landing page. Above the fold, they&#8217;ve included a banner of some of their most recognizable partners and customers: USA Today, IKEA, and Microsoft, to name a few. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further down, Taboola even includes concrete results that brands have gotten with the platform. It&#8217;s one thing to say you can increase someone&#8217;s conversion rate or audience engagement. It&#8217;s another thing to prove it with hard numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.turnkeyvr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TurnKey</a> gives us another great example of how to use proof on your Facebook landing page. As a vacation rental platform, the company needs visitors to trust that their properties will be handled with care. They do that by including featured media logos and various awards in a banner above the fold.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Turnkey.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Turnkey_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - TurnKey\" class=\"wp-image-97860\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.turnkeyvr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TurnKey</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most compelling proof on this page is a testimonial that TurnKey includes lower down. This customer totally lays out TurnKey&#8217;s unique selling proposition: other rental platforms have left their home in shambles and failed to earn them what they expected, whereas TurnKey puts their mind at ease by protecting the property from damage and generating more revenue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve gotta hire this guy, TurnKey. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>CommuniCloud: Convert More with a Compelling Incentive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, your offer is great—but to <em>really</em> get people converting, it can help to give &#8217;em a little something extra. For ecommerce companies, maybe it&#8217;s free shipping or a discount. For SaaS brands, it&#8217;s usually a no-commitment free trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.communicloud.com/\">CommuniCloud</a> is driving registrations on this Facebook landing page. The brand keeps things simple: along with a quick description of their benefits and some social proof, we&#8217;ve got a quick form that asks just for necessary information. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Communicloud.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Communicloud_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - CommuniCloud\" class=\"wp-image-97860\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.communicloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Communicloud</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that CommuniCloud <em>doesn&#8217;t require a credit card</em> to sign up for their trial. That&#8217;d create some serious friction at this stage, so better to capture contact details and sort out the payment side later.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Schedulehead + HiredHippo: Show Off the Product In Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some products are&#8230; let&#8217;s say, <em>more photogenic</em> than others. It&#8217;s easier to get people&#8217;s attention with a picture of food or clothing than something like software. Still, showing off your product—whatever it is—can better (and more quickly) communicate what you&#8217;re offering than words alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.schedulehead.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Schedulehead</a> is a software platform that helps companies manage their employee scheduling and payroll. On this Facebook landing page, the brand is sure to highlight their user interface right from the beginning—before even getting into the specifics of their functionality. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_Schedulehead.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Schedulehead_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - Schedulehead\" class=\"wp-image-97857\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.schedulehead.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schedulehead</a>.

There are at-a-glance graphs and charts, map and calendar integrations, and loads of other features to help track your workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And check out this page from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://signup.hiredhippo.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">HiredHippo</a>, a job search network that automatically matches professionals with hiring companies. (Love this headline, by the way. Finding job opportunities without updating a dull resume sounds like a dream come true.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Full_HiredHippo.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/HiredHippo_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Facebook Landing Page Examples - HiredHippo\" class=\"wp-image-97857\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://signup.hiredhippo.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HiredHippo</a>.

Or, if team sports are more your thing, they’re the MVPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where most landing pages provide immense value by setting <em>you</em> up to score a sale—perhaps by generating, vetting, or capturing leads—a sales page makes the touchdown itself. (Am I doing this sports metaphor thing right?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, sales pages have loftier goals than your average product page or landing page. Rather than aiming for downloads, signups, or click-throughs (all of which play a role in finding and nurturing leads), <strong>the purpose of sales pages is turning ad clicks directly into paying customers</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suffice it to say, the pressure is <em>on</em>. Your sales pages need to come through with the win, which means you need to know how to create a high-converting sales page for every campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what makes a great sales landing page and show you how to create a sales page that actually converts clicks into customers. Plus, we’ll look at what you can learn from some of our favorite real-world sales page examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let’s answer some of the most common questions related to sales pages for online stores and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Everything You Wanted to Know About Sales Landing Pages</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a sales page, exactly?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A sales page is a dedicated landing page built to convert ad traffic into customers</strong>. You can think of sales pages as the modern sales letter, but more targeted and data-driven. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good sales page is more than just a convenient place to send click-throughs. It’s the best place to send someone who clicks on a targeted ad, whether you’re running <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/social-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">paid ads on Instagram</a> or an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">email marketing campaign</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why do I need a sales landing page?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to online stores, sales pages convert better in terms of volume and revenue. In fact, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://info.monetate.com/rs/092-TQN-434/images/EQ1-2018_First-Impressions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">landing pages have been shown</a> to convert 2X as many visitors into customers and increase average customer spend 2X. <em>Whoa</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big reason for this is that online stores have built-in distractions that can pull visitors in multiple directions (things like links to related products, promotions, shipping details, etc.). <strong>You use a sales page when you want to maintain momentum and ensure shoppers only have one thing on their mind: making the purchase</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What separates a sales page from a typical landing page?\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like every great landing page, a sales page is built around a specific conversion goal. However, when it comes to sales page design, the objective isn’t just any old conversion—it’s getting visitors to actually buy. In order to close the deal, a sales page might be longer than the average landing page, especially for bigger purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about product pages vs. sales pages?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have product pages, do you still need sales landing pages?  Um, <em>heck yes!</em> Unlike product pages, which highlight features in depth, a sales landing page is built specifically to convert. That means visitors see the exact information they need to make a purchasing decision, without the distractions typically found on a product page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, sales landing pages are more flexible than traditional product pages. They can be tweaked and tested and updated before you could even begin making changes to the rest of your website.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/ecommerce-lookbook/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/LookBook-Blog-Visual-CTA_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"538\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Do I Create a Sales Page That Converts?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A sales landing page is a tool to drive, well, sales. As such, it must be carefully designed to motivate leads to take action. Whether you’re creating a new sales page or hoping to optimize an existing page, there are a few key notes you need to hit. So, what goes into crafting a high-converting sales landing page?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your sales page needs to match the ad so visitors instantly recognize that they’re in the right place</strong>. Nothing derails a potential sale faster than a page that has little or nothing to do with whatever was featured in the ad (this is basically the ecommerce version of catfishing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is perhaps the most important (and often underestimated) part of an effective sales page, so here’s a quick example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you’re marketing a subscription service for a range of fancy jams and jellies, but this month you’re using paid ads to promote lavender honey from a local farm. It’s seasonal and supplies are limited, so it’s not something you want to add to your website’s regular catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever clicks on that ad has already told you they&#8217;re interested in the lavender honey (why else would they have clicked?). That means they don’t want to see that you offer ice wine jelly or canning supplies (at least, not right at that moment).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what does your sales page need to do? Show them the honey—and, hopefully, they’ll show you the money. Sweet, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use persuasive copy. </strong>Your sales page needs to do the job of a salesperson, which means compelling leads to open their wallets. The headline should convey immediate benefits and the body copy should be used to address sales objections, answer potential questions, and compel visitors to click ‘buy.’&#160;</li><li><strong>Show the product in action. </strong>Sometimes, simply showing the product in use is the best way to communicate value. Include visuals of the product in action to get customers excited about their upcoming purchase.</li><li><strong>Build trust with social proof. </strong>Address potential sales objections with real testimonials from existing customers. This helps potential customers see the value your product provides and adds credibility to your claims.</li><li><strong>Provide clear next steps. </strong>You don’t want to pay for ads that lead to a dead end. Maintain momentum by featuring a single, straightforward call-to-action on a prominent, clickable button so the next steps are 100% clear.</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Ready to build a high-converting sales page of your own?</strong> Check out our library of 100+ ready-to-use <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-templates/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sales page templates</a> and start selling more today.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>High-Converting Sales Page Examples Created with Unbounce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Dinnerly</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Dinnerly_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Dinnerly_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Sales Landing Page Examples - Dinnerly\" class=\"wp-image-98017\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://dinnerly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dinnerly</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>From the creators of Marley Spoon, <a href=\"https://dinnerly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dinnerly</a> is an alternative meal kit service for the budget-conscious home chef. Their price per meal is roughly half of typical meal kits, but their recipes still pack a full-plate, high-quality punch. They’re able to pull this off by minimizing costs related to packaging and marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this campaign, Dinnerly advertised on Reddit and sent click-throughs to the sales landing page shown above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why does this sales page convert so well?</strong><br>This page is built specifically for leads from a single source: Reddit. From the headline to the CTA (“Claim My Reddit Discount”), everything about this page is tailored to the leads who click through from a Reddit ad campaign. Greeting visitors with “Hi Reddit!” immediately tells them they’re in the right place. As we scroll down, the page continues to match both the source and the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can you learn from Dinnerly?</strong><br>What can other marketers learn from this example and apply to their own pages? The big takeaway here is to <strong><em>match the message and design of your sales page to the ad</em></strong>. If you want to run similar campaigns across several sources (say, Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram), you should consider building and customizing variant sales pages for each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Ruby</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Sales Landing Page Examples - Ruby\" class=\"wp-image-98018\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.ruby.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ruby</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ruby.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ruby</a> provides virtual reception and chat services to a wide range of businesses. On this sales landing page, they’re speaking directly to business owners who need live phone support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is this page so great at selling?</strong><br>If you’re looking for inspiration on how to write a sales page, this is it. Both the headline and supporting copy reinforce benefits in terms relevant to the audience.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the content (including benefits, visuals, and pricing information) is targeted towards businesses that need virtual reception and are concerned about missing customer calls or not being able to handle after-hours conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This landing page also wins because it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Frames customer testimonials as “Success Stories” to add clout to standard social proof.&#160;</li><li>Features data from customer surveys to demonstrate proven results.</li><li>Emphasizes their money-back guarantee, which addresses some of the biggest sales objections. (“Is it worth the cost? Will I regret this purchase?”)</li><li>Minimizes external distractions by focusing on the receptionist services (rather than looping in their live chat offering).</li><li>Visually divides sections and uses color-blocking to make it easier to scroll for relevant information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can you learn from Ruby’s sales page example?</strong><br>A good sales page provides answers to everything potential customers need to confidently make an informed purchase. Even if you offer tiered services (like Ruby’s monthly packages of 100, 200, or 500 receptionist minutes), you can leverage a single sales page to drive conversions for all of them. The key is to aim for transparency about pricing and packages, so leads don’t have to click away from your sales page to learn more.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to provide extra information that doesn’t fit on the main page, you can use lightbox popups like Ruby does for their monthly plans. This is a clever way to keep visitors on the page without bogging down the main content with excessive details that might not be relevant to each visitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Thistle</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Thistle_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Thistle_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Sales Landing Page Examples - Thistle\" class=\"wp-image-98020\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.thistle.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thistle</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thistle.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thistle</a> is a ready-to-eat meal subscription service that specializes in nutritious, plant-based dishes made from local ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why does this sales page get results?</strong><br>One of the simplest things that makes a sales page effective is focusing on the benefits instead of features. The headline highlights what the visitor cares about most (meals that are “so deliciously easy”) and the rest of the copy uses language that says Thistle truly <em>gets</em> what their audience wants.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though text only takes up a third of the space above the fold (allowing that bright, veggie-filled salad to do much of the talking), all of these heavy hitters are visible <em>before</em> we scroll down: &#8220;no more groceries,&#8221; &#8220;fill your fridge,&#8221; &#8220;super healthy,&#8221; &#8220;gourmet meals,&#8221; &#8220;less cost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can you apply these lessons to your own sales pages?</strong><br>In a highly competitive space, you need something that makes you stand out. Your sales page should balance speaking to your audience’s needs (which your competitors are likely also doing) and emphasizing your unique selling point (which is specific only to your brand). For Thistle, this means highlighting the traditional convenience and benefits of a meal delivery service, but also leaning into the health benefits that set them apart.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Craving more inspiration for your sales page design?</strong> Take a look at how <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/ppc/how-indochino-uses-unbounce-for-ppc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indochino</a> and <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/how-ecommerce-company-packlane-delivers-on-brand-targeted-campaigns-with-custom-landing-pages/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Packlane</a> use Unbounce sales pages to fuel their digital marketing strategy and online sales.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2>4. Solo Stove</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/SoloStove_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/SoloStove_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Sales Landing Page Examples - Solo Stove\" class=\"wp-image-98019\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.solostove.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Solo Stove</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This sales page is part of a retargeting campaign for customers who’ve already purchased the <a href=\"https://www.solostove.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Solo Stove</a> and potentially other accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes this sales page a winner?</strong><br>There are a few reasons why this sales page is so effective. Not only does it appeal to the community that’s built up around their brand, but it also uses visuals that show the product in action.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, by introducing the shield as their “most-requested accessory,” Solo Stove implies that their customers already want this. This serves two purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, for anyone who may have actually requested the shield, this page offers pure validation. If you even <em>thought</em> about wanting a shield for your Solo Stove and saw this campaign, you’re pretty much guaranteed to buy into it right away. As for the rest of Solo Stove’s customers retargeted by this campaign, the idea that it’s highly requested primes them to convert by building social proof right into the offer.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page also makes use of a clever CTA (“Claim your Shield” above the “Shop Now” button) that suggests Solo Stove customers are entitled to the shield after eagerly awaiting its release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can you learn from Solo Stove?</strong><br>When you offer multiple products, using sales pages creates space to focus on just one item at a time. That said, you can play around with the formula to best serve your campaign. Unlike most of the other sales pages we’re discussing today, this one breaks the mold a little by linking out to three purchase pages instead of driving all traffic to one.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solo Stove included three separate “Shop Now” buttons to match the three sizes offered. However, splitting up traffic works here because anyone who clicks on this ad is already a Solo Stove customer. That means they already own a fire pit in one of these sizes—and since the shields are named to match each size, there’s no question of which button each customer should click.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. The Coffee Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CoffeeNetwork_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CoffeeNetwork_Thumb.png\" alt=\"Sales Landing Page Examples - The Coffee Network\" class=\"wp-image-98016\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://thecoffeenetwork.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Coffee Network</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thecoffeenetwork.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Coffee Network</a> is an Australia-based coffee marketplace for bean lovers with an appetite for trying new blends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes this sales page stand out?</strong><br>Presumably, the audience here is already interested in coffee and likely searching online for the best coffee or, more specifically, the best coffee in Australia. That said, this sale page still has to <em>sell</em>—especially because the target audience is likely unfamiliar with the Coffee Network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a focus on benefits and customization (roasting method, strength, and flavor), the copy describes the coffee finder tool both clearly and succinctly. The three steps under “How It Works” are easy to understand at a glance. The call to action repeatedly urges coffee lovers to “try now” and the heading and body copy reiterate how simple it is to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from a single link in the footer that leads to their homepage (which prevents leads from bouncing if they aren’t quite ready to buy), this sales page is free of external links and distractions. Including minimal links, offers, and buttons helps keep leads on the page until they’re ready to “Try Now” or grab more information from the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can you learn from this sales page example?</strong><br>Shorter landing pages work best for products that are simple, smaller purchases (i.e., products that don’t require as much deliberation or persuasion). For most of us, buying coffee isn’t all that complicated. So, in this example, a short and simple sales page hits the spot. The ideal length of any sales page depends on what you’re selling. However, when it comes to deciding <em>what</em> to include on your sales page, quality content always trumps quantity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Need even more sales page samples in your life?</strong> Check out our list of <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/ecommerce-landing-page-examples-sales/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">27 landing page examples that drive online sales</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Put the Power of Sales Pages to Work for Your Business</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to assume that whoever clicks on your ad is interested in your business—in which case, it would make sense to take them to your online store or product page to learn more about your offerings. But, as you know, that’s <em>not</em> why shoppers click ads for individual products or services.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don’t care about the rest of your product line (at least, not at that moment). They just want to know more about what you promised them in the ad. So, sending ad traffic straight to your website or product page likely isn’t going to lead to a sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have products or services that practically sell themselves, creating a campaign-specific sales page prevents leads from getting lost on your website instead of following through with the purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to grow your online sales without scaling your sales team (and costs), you need dedicated sales pages built to drive revenue.

Where&#8217;re the soap landing pages?&#8221; — You, probably.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so fast, sudsy—you’re looking at this the wrong way. The idea here isn’t to find a landing page template that matches your business <em>exactly</em>. First and foremost, you want to <strong>choose a template that supports your campaign conversion goal</strong>. Everything else—your industry, your product or service, your branding—comes second.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll show you how to pick out the perfect template for your next marketing campaign. Then, we’ll show you <strong>how you can transform it into a custom-branded, high-converting masterpiece</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Choose a Template That Supports Your Conversion Goal</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s a conversion goal, exactly?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your conversion goal is the action you want visitors to take as a result of your marketing campaign</strong>. Maybe you want somebody to buy a product, like fancy soap. Or maybe you want them to sign up for a webinar about… I dunno, making fancy soap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that <strong>some landing page templates are better-suited to specific conversion goals than others</strong>. If you just want someone to buy a product, your landing page’s call to action is pretty straightforward. On the other hand, if you’re registering people for a webinar, you’re gonna need their name and email address (at least). That’ll mean a more complex call to action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which template is best for your conversion goal? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly, landing page templates fall into one of two categories: <strong>click-through pages </strong>and <strong>lead generation pages</strong>. They’ve each got a distinct type of call to action meant to support a certain conversion goal.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98180\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages.png 3568w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-150x66.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-560x247.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-80x35.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-768x338.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-1536x677.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-2048x902.png 2048w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-1000x441.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-650x286.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-300x132.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Types_Landing_Pages-160x70.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3568px) 100vw, 3568px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\">The page on the left is a click-through landing page, while the one on the right is a lead gen landing page.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Click-through landing pages prime visitors for the next step in their journey, like a checkout flow or sign-up page. Since the real ask comes wherever they end up <em>after </em>this page, the call to action here is simple—usually just a button. (&#8220;Buy Now&#8221; is a classic of this genre.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/lead-generation/high-converting-lead-generation-landing-page-examples/\">lead generation landing pages</a> use forms to capture visitor information that can be used later, like for promotional emails. These pages typically offer some kind of incentive (or “<a href=\"https://unbounce.com/lead-generation/lead-magnet-examples/\">lead magnet</a>”) for filling out the form—a downloadable ebook or webinar registration, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about the design of a template?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to decide whether your conversion goal requires a click-through or lead gen landing page. Then, <strong>consider</strong> <strong>how the template&#8217;s design spotlights your offer</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re selling soap, you probably want a click-through template that can accommodate lots of photos of your product, like <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/freshgoods/\">this one</a>. And maybe you think that soap-making webinar we suggested earlier sounds like a great idea. You might want a lead gen template that can share a video of what people can expect, like <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/multor/\">this one</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that neither of these templates have anything to do with soap. We chose &#8217;em because <strong>their call to action supports our conversion goal and their design reinforces our offer</strong>. Now, we can start to replace elements of these pages with our own copy and imagery to integrate them into our marketing campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Converting a Landing Page Template for Your Campaign</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every landing page template is different, but they usually have similar elements and follow the same general structure: a header section, a list of features and benefits, some social proof, and a call to action.&#160;(Also check out this post on the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-anatomy-of-a-landing-page/\">anatomy of a landing page</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the steps below to <strong>transform your chosen template into a branded landing page that&#8217;ll win over your visitors</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Your Header Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Add a hero image of your product, service, or lead magnet</strong>. If you want to help prospects visualize the benefits, consider showing your offer in the context of use: someone using your product to solve a problem or improving themselves through your service.&#160;</li><li><strong>Be sure to include your company logo</strong>. You want people to know this is your landing page, after all.&#160;</li><li><strong>Write a descriptive headline that tells people exactly what you’re offering</strong>. You can also communicate your main <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-glossary/definition/unique-value-proposition/\">value proposition</a> using a couple of sentences just under your headline.</li><li><strong>Update your call to action</strong>. If you’re using a click-through template, you could have a button that sends people to a product page on your website, a third-party delivery platform, or even add <a href=\"https://documentation.unbounce.com/hc/en-us/articles/203814024-Adding-a-Shopify-Buy-Button-to-Your-Landing-Page\">a Shopify integration</a>. If you’re capturing leads, try to keep your form simple—only ask for the information you absolutely need.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98211\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header.png 2880w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-150x67.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-557x250.png 557w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-80x36.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-768x345.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-1536x689.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-2048x919.png 2048w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-1000x449.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-650x292.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-300x135.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Promo_Header-160x72.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\">This header from <a href=\"https://promo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"-1&#34;\">Promo</font></a> (featured in our post on <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/\"><font size=\"-1\">high-converting landing page examples</font></a>) communicates their offer super clearly.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Your Benefits Section </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People skim, so <strong>provide a bulleted list of the benefits of your offer</strong>. If you’re creating a sales page, use this space to highlight how your product or service improves your customers’ lives. If you’re offering a lead magnet (like an ebook), tell people what they’ll learn and how they can apply it.</li><li>Does your template have icons for each benefit? <strong>Make sure they’re relevant to your offer or brand</strong>. If not, lots of websites offer free icons you can use to replace ‘em: <a href=\"https://streamlineicons.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">streamlineicons.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flaticon.com</a>, <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">thenounproject.com</a>, <a href=\"https://material.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">material.io</a>, <a href=\"https://icons8.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">icons8.com</a>, <a href=\"https://ionicons.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ionicons.com</a>, among others.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Your Social Proof Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Include a testimonial from a satisfied customer</strong>, or maybe an endorsement from an industry leader. The trick here is authenticity: use a real quote that <em>sounds</em> believable. Even real testimonials that are too positive can sound like you’re making ‘em up.&#160;</li><li>Alternatively, you could <strong>showcase other kinds of proof</strong>: awards you’ve won, trust seals you’ve earned—that sorta thing.</li><li>Whatever you include here, <strong>remember to ask permission</strong>. For example, depending on where you source a testimonial from (Amazon, G2), there may be restrictions on how you can use it.&#160;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Your About Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Let people know more about your business</strong>. What makes your product or service unique? What’s your mission statement—your raison d&#8217;être? This is your opportunity to connect with visitors beyond this particular offer.</li><li>That said, you don&#8217;t want visitors to lose focus. <strong>Keep it short and sweet</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98209\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About.png 2880w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-150x80.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-470x250.png 470w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-80x43.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-768x409.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-1536x817.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-1000x532.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-650x346.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-300x160.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/CocoVillage_About-160x85.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\"><a href=\"https://cocovillage.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"-1&#34;\">Coco Village</font></a> (who we highlighted in our post on the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/best-landing-page-examples/\"><font size=\"-1\">best landing page examples</font></a>) blends social proof with their own parenting philosophy.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Your CTA Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If your page runs long, <strong>consider including a final pitch for your offer</strong>. This is your last chance, so make it count. Pump up the urgency or exclusivity, or remind visitors about the benefits they stand to gain—whatever it takes to get the conversion.</li><li><strong>Repeat the call to action button from your header section</strong>. Or, if this is a lead gen page, include a button that bumps visitors back up to your form.&#160;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Your Footer Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Add your logo and any other details you need to communicate </strong>(contact information, copyright notice, any other necessary boilerplate) at the very bottom of the page.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And that about covers it. With that quick checklist, you can turn just about any template into an on-brand landing page in just a few minutes. Simple, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3 (More) Examples of Landing Page Template Customization</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, the soap example is feeling a little played out. Now, let’s take three templates that Unbounce put together in <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/news/working-for-you-during-covid-19/\">response to COVID-19</a> earlier this year—FreshGoods, Multor, and Horizons—and switch ‘em up for different industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do all of this yourself, of course. But just to make sure these examples are <em>absolute fire</em>, I’ve recruited Gus from our design team to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gus says “what’s up,” by the way. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44b.png\" alt=\"👋\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FreshGoods → UNIQ</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98148\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-scaled.jpg 2117w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-124x150.jpg 124w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-207x250.jpg 207w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-66x80.jpg 66w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-768x929.jpg 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-1270x1536.jpg 1270w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-1694x2048.jpg 1694w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-1000x1209.jpg 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-650x786.jpg 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-300x363.jpg 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Compare-132x160.jpg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2117px) 100vw, 2117px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/freshgoods/\">FreshGoods</a>, a click-through landing page template that was designed to help brick-and-mortars get online super quick. Small retailers that don’t have a website can use it to launch a basic ecomm page. Restaurants and breweries can use it to link out to delivery platforms or run special promotions. But it can also fit a more general product launch page—say, for a new mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design for FreshGoods clearly speaks to a bakery or cafe. You’ve got the hero image of a bread basket, secondary photography of hand-made pastries and specialty coffees, plus icons that imply food delivery.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/FreshGoods_Full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Thumb_FreshGoods.jpg\" alt=\"Landing Page Template Examples - FreshGoods\" class=\"wp-image-98146\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\"></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">The original version of <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/freshgoods/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FreshGoods</a>.

But think about the amount of real work that went into this. Swapping in the new logo? Two minutes. Sourcing images… say 10 minutes. (Or even less, considering our in-app <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/integrations/unsplash/\">integration with Unsplash</a>.) Add a couple other minor tweaks, and what you’re looking at is, like, 20 minutes for a whole new page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you’ve gotta do now is write your campaign copy.

That&#8217;s not surprising, given that Quality Score algorithms are &#8220;black boxes&#8221; that play a crucial role in the success of any PPC campaign. We still have very little insight into how Google Ads, Microsoft Advertising (formerly Bing Ads), and the social media advertising platforms calculate and use Quality Score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are often a customer’s first interaction with a brand and set the stage for the relationship going forward. Distilling Quality Score into a number is misleading for PPC advertisers because it undervalues <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/why-should-i-use-landing-pages/\">the importance of landing pages</a> on several other crucial components of a campaign, such as brand perception and positioning.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a side note, most ad platforms use the term &#8220;Quality Score,&#8221; while others use &#8220;Ad Relevance&#8221; or something similar. For the sake of simplicity, I use Quality Score interchangeably with Ad Relevance and Relevance Score metrics unless otherwise noted. Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Quality Score &#38; Why Does It Matter to PPC Advertisers?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality Score is an approximation of your keywords&#8217; and ads&#8217; relevance to your target audience. It&#8217;s usually represented in the ad platforms as a number from 1-10. This dramatically oversimplifies the complex and user-specific Quality Score inputs factored into each ad auction, but it&#8217;s the best we have. Search engines and social media platforms use this metric to <strong>decide which ads to show and how much to charge an advertiser for each click or impression.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Ads pioneered Quality Score in their Ad Rank algorithm to reward advertisers that created relevant ads with a lower cost per click. Advertisers that try to show irrelevant ads to uninterested users may receive a lower Quality Score and have to pay a higher cost per click to remain visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the equation below, providing a great user experience to boost your Quality Score can improve your Ad Rank and lower your cost per click. From what we can tell, most PPC platforms use an equation like the one below to determine where your ads appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula.jpg\" alt=\"Ad Rank Calculation\" class=\"wp-image-98298\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula.jpg 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-150x48.jpg 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-560x179.jpg 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-80x26.jpg 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-768x245.jpg 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-650x207.jpg 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-300x96.jpg 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula-160x51.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each ad platform treats landing pages differently in their Quality Score equations. Savvy PPC advertisers should understand the nuance of each platform to tailor their campaigns for the best results. As a shorthand, the table below shows the similarities and differences between each major ad platform’s version of Quality Score as well as the associated factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table.jpg\" alt=\"How Quality Score Is Calculated\" class=\"wp-image-98304\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table.jpg 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-150x108.jpg 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-347x250.jpg 347w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-80x58.jpg 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-768x553.jpg 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-650x468.jpg 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-300x216.jpg 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table-160x115.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, here&#8217;s the question platforms are asking when they evaluate your ads against these different attributes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Landing Page Experience:</strong> Is your ad&#8217;s landing page relevant to the visitor’s intent and does it help them accomplish their objectives quickly and transparently?</li><li><strong>Ad Click Through Rate/Engagement:</strong> Are your ads clicked as often as competing ads?</li><li><strong>Ad Relevance: </strong>Do your ads align with your audiences’ interests and intent?</li><li><strong>Post-Click Conversion Rate:</strong> Are visitors likely to convert or take meaningful action after clicking your ad?</li><li><strong>Recency:</strong> Are your ads recently published or updated regularly?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the answer to any of these questions is &#8220;no,&#8221; there&#8217;s a good chance your Quality Score is suffering as a result. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/ppc/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blog-visual-cta-generic-ppc-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"Landing pages with PPC\" width=\"2260\" height=\"1216\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Do Landing Pages Impact Quality Score on Different Platforms?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages are an important part of Quality Score algorithms and, fortunately, are one of the easiest elements of a PPC campaign to control. <strong>The most important part of the “Landing Page Experience” component of Quality Score is providing a positive visitor experience.</strong> Answer their search intent with relevant content, provide <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/page-speed-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lightning-fast page speed</a>, and make sure your site looks great on all screen sizes.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When done correctly, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.workshopdigital.com/blog/unbounce-landing-pages-adwords-quality-score/\" target=\"_blank\">landing pages can have a positive impact on Google Ads Quality Score</a>. That means a<strong> lower cost per click and higher conversion rates </strong>when compared to sending traffic to a website. And even though some ad platforms do not explicitly factor landing pages into their Quality Scores, marketers shouldn&#8217;t ignore the improvement in visitor experience and their likelihood of developing a positive association with your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Google Ads &#8211; Quality Score</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Ads’ support content explicitly mentions the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1659694?hl=en\">importance of landing pages for creating a positive user experience</a>. I want to emphasize the <em>experience</em> portion because most people assume that Google Ads Quality Score only focuses on landing page <em>relevance</em>. Your landing pages must be relevant to keywords and ads that your visitors clicked on, yes, but <strong>it’s </strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404197?hl=en\"><strong>just as important to Google</strong></a><strong> that your landing page loads quickly, is secure, and looks great on all screens.</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads.png\" alt=\"Quality Score Attributes - Google Ads\" class=\"wp-image-98314\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads.png 830w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-150x44.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-560x166.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-80x24.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-768x228.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-650x193.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-300x89.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads-160x47.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\">Here&#8217;s Google Ads explaining how Quality Score is calculated.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Landing pages won’t have any direct impact on the Expected CTR or Ad Relevance components of your Google Ads Quality Score, but the domain and URL you show in your ads may indirectly help or hurt your click-through rates.&#160;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Not advertising on Google yet?</strong> Check out our guide to <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/ppc/google-ads-basics/\">getting started with Google Ads</a> and you&#8217;ll have your first PPC campaign up and running in no time. </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2>2. Microsoft Advertising &#8211; Quality Score</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en-us/50894\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Advertising Quality Score</a> is nearly identical to Google Ads Quality Score, although they provide significantly less documentation for each of the three components. Unlike Google, Microsoft <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50813/2\" target=\"_blank\">explicitly mentions</a> that the landing page experience factor is “based on how many times customers leave your ad&#8217;s landing page shortly after arriving.” This implies that <strong>lowering your landing page’s bounce rate (among other things) will improve your Quality Score.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising.png\" alt=\"Quality Score Attributes - Microsoft Advertising\" class=\"wp-image-98319\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising.png 708w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-150x26.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-560x97.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-80x14.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-650x113.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-300x52.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising-160x28.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\">Microsoft Advertising&#8217;s writeup on the factors that impact Quality Score.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a good idea to monitor your Microsoft Advertising Quality Score, but don’t expect to get much helpful information about individual keywords. In this case, I suggest following the best practices for Google’s Quality Score improvements in the hopes that Microsoft will reward the same efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Facebook Advertising &#8211; Ad Relevance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/436113280262012?id=561906377587030\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook’s Ad Relevance</a> is a completely different type of metric than Google’s Quality Score. The three components of Facebook’s Ad Relevance ratings are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Quality Ranking:</strong> A ranking of your ad&#8217;s perceived quality. Quality is measured using feedback on your ads and the post-click experience. Your ad is ranked against ads that competed for the same audience.</li><li><strong>Engagement Rate Ranking:</strong> A ranking of your ad&#8217;s expected engagement rate. Engagement includes all clicks, likes, comments, and shares. Your ad is ranked against ads that competed for the same audience.</li><li><strong>Conversion Rate Ranking:</strong> A ranking of your ad&#8217;s expected <strong>conversion rate</strong>. Your ad is ranked against ads with your optimization goal that competed for the same audience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Facebook’s audience targeting does not rely on search keywords. So it&#8217;s much harder to determine a social user’s intent at any given moment. Many Facebook campaign types also allow users to convert, transact, or engage with content on the platform itself. (So they don’t <em>require</em> a landing page.) In these cases, Facebook relies heavily on the engagement and interactions that happen on its platform to determine if an ad is relevant or not.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Facebook Ads&#8217; documentation doesn&#8217;t mention external landing pages, they do reference &#8220;post-click experience&#8221; and &#8220;conversion rate&#8221; in two of the three Ad Relevance factors. Advertisers using Facebook&#8217;s audience and conversion pixels should assume that<strong> Facebook Ads can measure engagement and conversion rates on your websites</strong>. Adjust your landing pages accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Twitter Ads &#8211; Ad Score</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter Ads has the least amount of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/help/troubleshooting/bidding-and-auctions-faqs.html\" target=\"_blank\">support content related to their Ad Score</a> and no mention of landing pages.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter.png\" alt=\"Quality Score Attributes - Twitter Ads\" class=\"wp-image-98325\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter.png 785w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-150x27.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-560x101.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-80x14.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-768x138.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-650x117.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-300x54.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter-160x29.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%;\">The factors that affect your Ad Score on Twitter.</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Facebook Ads, most of Twitter Ads&#8217; conversions happen within their platform in the form of likes, retweets, content engagement, and follows. If Twitter does consider landing page engagement, conversions, or experience as a factor, it doesn&#8217;t seem to influence your campaign performance heavily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, <strong>pairing your Twitter Ads with dedicated landing pages is still a good idea if you expect to re-engage and convert visitors on your site. </strong>The best Twitter Ads campaigns aren&#8217;t going to reach their full potential if your landing pages don&#8217;t reinforce the positioning (and offers) that you tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. LinkedIn Ads &#8211; Campaign Quality Score</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, LinkedIn. Nothing is easy in LinkedIn Ads, including <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/85406/campaign-quality-scores-for-sponsored-content?lang=en\">finding your Campaign Quality Score</a>. Like the other platforms, LinkedIn rates each sponsored content campaign on a 1-10 scale. Unlike the other platforms, they don’t allow you to see your Campaign Quality Score unless you manually export a .csv file of your historical performance.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you follow the tedious, eight-step process to export your scores, you’ll find a number in the “Campaign Quality Score” column—but no insights or further detail on how to improve it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without this information, the best advice I can give you is to focus on improving your ads’ click-through rates and engagement (likes, shares, etc.). There&#8217;s no mention of landing pages. If you send traffic from your ads to an external site, follow the best practices shared by the other platforms and <strong>put your users’ experience first.</strong> At worst, this will improve your conversion rates. At best, it could boost your Campaign Quality Scores and lower the notoriously high CPCs on LinkedIn Ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pay Attention to Quality Score—But Don’t Obsess Over It</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tried and true methods that will improve your Quality Score with landing pages. Most are focused on enhancing the visitor’s experience and don’t require substantial dev support. Unbounce users can take advantage of <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/features/dynamic-text-replacement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dynamic Text Replacement</a> to improve relevance and page speed improvements to create lightning-fast experiences.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your landing pages will (directly and indirectly) influence Quality Score. But the algorithms are opaque, so it&#8217;s impossible to know <em>exactly</em> what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve seen results vary dramatically by industry and campaign type. I recommend thinking about it as a lagging indicator (not a leading metric) of your efforts. Schedule reminders to review your landing page experience scores once per month or once per quarter. Look for progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a little attention, your landing pages will help take your campaigns to the next level.&#160;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/social-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blog-visual-cta-generic-social-pink.jpg\" alt=\"Landing pages for social media campaigns\" width=\"2260\" height=\"1216\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:01:00 +0000","feedId":9820,"bgimg":"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula.jpg","linkMd5":"815cff11a95a84e30c2549f61bb04674","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-58-817_11519225fc37a705.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":319,"sourceBytes":78938,"destBytes":26138,"author":"Andrew Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_formula.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-58-817_11519225fc37a705.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_LPQuailtyScore_table.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn31@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-36-03-993_4bdc300dce2038e3.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blog-visual-cta-generic-ppc-yellow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-36-03-614_35bad81fdfa3c7f1.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_google_ads.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn64@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-36-02-030_00e2f0b23af9b8da.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_ms_advertising.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-36-02-383_21b69d816a8ac4ea.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/quality_score_twitter.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-36-03-497_6bb530eef60a904b.webp","https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blog-visual-cta-generic-social-pink.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-36-04-301_fe95068da9e99967.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315757677},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:35:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:35:57","title":"Marketers and Landing Pages: Behind the Scenes for 2020","link":"https://unbounce.com/?p=97489","description":"\n<p>As part of our new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate/\" target=\"_blank\">Conversion Benchmark Report</a>, Unbounce ran a survey of marketers, working in dozens of industries, in early 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to know about your plans when it comes to running a high-converting campaign—as well as the role played by landing pages in supporting your post-click strategy. How do our expectations line up with the insights revealed by a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate/\" target=\"_blank\">machine learning analysis of 19 million conversions</a>? How firm is the average marketer’s grasp on industry conversion rates?&#160;And how satisfied are they with their current performance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, 2020 didn&#8217;t exactly turn out how anybody expected.

I thought I&#8217;d share some of the results with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blue-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93558\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Takeaway #1: The most popular digital marketing strategy is a diverse one.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about budgets, the 400 people we surveyed were evenly split in how much they plan to spend on marketing activities in 2020. Answers ranged from <strong>less than $5,000</strong> to <strong>more than $500,000</strong>, and this didn’t always depend on the size of the business.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the heft of their wallets, though, marketers also told us they planned to fire on all cylinders by <strong>taking on a wide variety of marketing activities</strong>. Here are the most popular types of campaigns you told us you&#8217;re running this year:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97916\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1.png 874w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-150x128.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-292x250.png 292w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-80x68.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-768x657.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-650x556.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-300x257.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_1-160x137.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" /><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">The “Other” category also yields some varied answers, from paper mailers to podcasts to push notifications.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, we expect this mix of activities has changed to match the new normal. A business-as-usual approach to event marketing hasn’t been possible, for instance, and the landscape for PPC and social is <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/5-tips-for-managing-ppc-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/358006/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">different than it was six months ago</a>. (Though PPC experts are nothing if not adaptable.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These challenging times don’t mean these activities have been completely abandoned, however. While in-person networking is harder, many companies have found ways to achieve similar goals online by running webinars or digital conferences. (Many say this shift to virtual gatherings will have a <a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/51-of-marketing-professionals-expect-virtual-events-to-stick-around-surve/579354/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lasting impact on how they do event marketing</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to another question&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How often are marketers including landing pages as part of their campaigns in 2020?&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Very often, it turns out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>36.2%</strong> of respondents told us they use them <strong>all of the time,</strong> and <strong>41.8%</strong> said <strong>most of the time</strong>—that’s a whopping <strong>77%</strong> who see landing pages as an essential part of their post-click strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97891\" width=\"684\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2.png 684w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-150x128.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-292x250.png 292w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-80x68.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-650x556.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-300x257.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_2-160x137.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We surveyed marketers outside our networks, but likely attracted some fans of landing pages (and Unbounce) who may have skewed the results. Still, these responses are an indicator that if you&#8217;re <em>not</em> using landing pages to support your campaigns, you&#8217;re in the minority.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>New to landing pages?</strong> One reason they appeal to so many marketers is that they help you squeeze more conversions out of your existing ad budget.

That&#8217;s still true, but it was also surprising how many respondents said they also use landing pages to connect more directly with prospects by scheduling appointments (<strong>42%</strong>) and phone calls (<strong>37.2%</strong>).&#160;Here&#8217;s how it breaks down:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97894\" width=\"940\" height=\"979\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3.png 940w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-144x150.png 144w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-240x250.png 240w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-77x80.png 77w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-768x800.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-650x677.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-300x312.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_3-154x160.png 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Four years ago, when we were working on the first version of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/\">Conversion Benchmark Report</a>, we focused our analysis entirely on lead gen because the overwhelming majority of landing pages on our platform served that purpose.<strong> That’s no longer the case. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s findings reveal that what marketers consider to be a conversion has diversified. A conversion can look <em>very different</em> depending on your business, your customers, and your goals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, while CTAs related to ecommerce (like showing off merchandise or adding a product to cart) are still less common than, say, calls to download an ebook, the popularity of these use cases continues to grow. As competition increases and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/campaign-strategy/how-to-start-online-business-quickly/\">more brick-and-mortar businesses move online</a>, we expect more marketers to adopt <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/pre-cart-landing-pages/\">pre-cart landing pages</a>. These let them tell better stories about their products or frame their offers in more compelling ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Takeaway #3: When it comes to reaching their conversion potential, marketers are an ambitious bunch.&#160;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In advance of publishing the benchmark data, we were curious about what marketers think is an <em>average </em>conversion rate in their industry and what kinds of conversion rates they&#8217;d be satisfied with achieving.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, you’ve got high—but, crucially, <em>not</em> unrealistic—expectations about how you want your landing pages to perform. First, here’s how respondents told us they think the average page performs in their industry:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97917\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-150x97.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-388x250.png 388w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-80x52.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-768x495.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-650x419.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-300x194.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_4-1-160x103.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketers rarely <em>expect</em> conversion rates over 10%. More than two-thirds of them told us that the averages in their industry are likely below that impenetrable ceiling. (As we&#8217;ll see, their instincts aren&#8217;t wrong.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s where you told us you&#8217;d <em>like</em> to be:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97918\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-150x97.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-388x250.png 388w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-80x52.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-768x495.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-650x419.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-300x194.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_5-160x103.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, marketers crave big numbers when it comes to conversion rates. If we total the numbers, <strong>71.8% </strong>of marketers told us they’re trying to achieve conversion rates of <strong>11%</strong> or higher. Many have their sights set even higher than that! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lofty goals like these are good—<em>great</em> even. And our results show they’re definitely achievable, but probably not without knowing your audience very well and taking the time to test and continuously optimize your landing pages and campaigns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do landing pages in your industry <em>actually </em>perform?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drumroll, please&#8230; <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f941.png\" alt=\"🥁\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to our analysis of 34 thousand landing pages, the <strong>average landing page</strong> <strong>converts at 9.7% (or 3.2%, expressed as a median</strong>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not the whole story, though. Some industries perform much better than others. For example, the finance and insurance industries convert at <strong>11.6% (average)</strong>, while real estate achieves<strong> average conversion rates of</strong> <strong>6.2%</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when we decided to isolate the top quartile in our conversion data—that&#8217;s fancy talk for focusing on the <em>top 25%</em> of performers—we also see much more drool-worthy conversion rates. In finance and insurance, chart-topping pages convert closer to 26%! (So people who told us they wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied with anything less aren&#8217;t dreaming. There are campaigns and marketers achieving those kinds of results right now.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/home-improvement-desktop-graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"Conversion Rate by Home Improvement Type Graph\" class=\"wp-image-94772\" width=\"1082\" height=\"670\"/><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">This graph from the Conversion Benchmark Report shows the median (rather than average) conversion rates for four subcategories in the home improvement industry. </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few generalities. In <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/\" target=\"_blank\">the report,</a> you&#8217;ll find the specific benchmarks related to 16 industries, including SaaS, e-comm, agencies, and business services. You can also read insights about how long your pages should be, what reading level you should target, what calls-to-action are most popular, and which emotions relate to more conversions.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Why&#8217;d we create the report?</strong> More than just benchmarks, the data-derived insights from the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/\" target=_blank>Conversion Benchmark Report</a> will help you pair your savvy with AI to create the highest-converting campaigns of your career.

Marketers have big ambitions for their landing pages, and they’re looking to do even more with them in 2020. We also saw that the <em>best-performing</em> landing pages routinely hit double-digit conversion rates. (Yowza.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s holding the rest of &#8217;em back? We wanted to know where our respondents saw room to improve their landing pages, and here’s what they told us:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97920\" width=\"865\" height=\"758\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6.png 865w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-150x131.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-285x250.png 285w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-80x70.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-768x673.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-650x570.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-300x263.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Graph_6-160x140.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t deliberate, but it seems to me that the answers here fall into four broad categories:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, there are <strong>issues with optimization</strong>. Marketers feel they don&#8217;t have time to optimize their pages using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">A/B testing</a>. Sometimes they may not have the data or expertise to make meaningful choices when it comes to improving their conversion rates.</li><li>Second, <strong>matching the right page to the right audience </strong>can be tricky. Fixing it can involve traffic optimizations further up the funnel. But how do you <em>also </em>make sure that each visitor hits the landing page that&#8217;s right for them? </li><li>Third, whether it&#8217;s a matter of talent or time, sometimes marketers don&#8217;t feel like <strong>the copy and design</strong> on their pages are effective. (Testing could help, yes. But see #1 on this list.) For small businesses, marketers may have to play too many roles. And they may not have access to learning material that helps them improve.</li><li>And fourth are <strong>technical hurdles</strong>, like slow loading times or ensuring pages look perfect on different devices. (These made up the &#8220;Other&#8221; category above.) In this case, marketers have risen to the challenge of building lighter, more mobile-friendly experiences.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s marketers have a lot on their plate—you could say they&#8217;re young, scrappy, and hungry—but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not looking for easy ways to step up their game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#ededed\" class=\"has-background\"><strong>How&#8217;d we get these numbers?</strong> We fielded the Unbounce Conversion Benchmark Survey between December 2019 and February 2020. To ensure a healthy sample size, we surveyed 439 people. After a few qualifying questions, we paired it down 400 respondents who identified as marketers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can marketers overcome these challenges?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to getting the most conversions from your landing pages, we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about a shift in mindset we&#8217;re calling <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/news/introducing-conversion-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">Conversion Intelligence</a>. Again and again, we&#8217;ve seen evidence that better performance isn&#8217;t an accident. It&#8217;s the result of <strong>continuously fine-tunin<b>g</b></strong><b> each element of your campaigns</b>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when marketers often do this optimization work on their own, they quickly run up against limits—of time and money, of expertise, of insight. By <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/marketing-ai/artificial-intelligence-will-change-how-you-do-marketing-in-2021/\">pairing your expertise with Artificial Intelligence</a>, you can overcome these limits.

Starting with the benchmarks,  dig into your industry. Use the machine-derived insights about reading ease, word count, and sentiment to create higher-converting pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/marketing-ai/optimize-with-smart-traffic-landing-page-variants/\">build a low-commitment (as in, quick and easy) variant or two</a> based on the insights in the CBR, then flip on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/\">Smart Traffic</a> and see how they perform. This feature uses machine learning to <strong>automatically match each and every visitor to the landing page most likely to convert.</strong> There&#8217;s no need to babysit it or declare a champion variant, and it never stops learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Smart Traffic is a quick win, especially if you don&#8217;t have the time or traffic for the traditional A/B testing. It needs just a little bit of attention to get it up and running on your most important pages. <strong>All you need to do is build a few variants, and turn it on.</strong> We see an average lift in conversions of 20% for customers who use it, so it&#8217;s very much worth the small effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/pink-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93559\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding a New Normal</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Conversion Benchmark Report Survey was a bit of informal market research before starting on an intimidating project.

As they continue down the landing page, more general and experiential benefits of a VIU education are showcased—like small class sizes, an inclusive community, and laid back “island life” on one of the world’s most beautiful natural playgrounds.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VIU team (of only six!) who worked on this campaign drove traffic through a number of channels, from paid advertising on Facebook and YouTube to social media sharing to traditional print ads at ferry terminals and their local airport. Not surprisingly, given the nature of their target audience, most of their traffic came from mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“What helped us with conversion rates was that Unbounce is such a mobile-friendly platform.

As a subscription-based business, landing pages are key to ckbk’s marketing in order to grow their email lists and drive more signups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, they’ve done something a little different than your typical lead generation strategy by incentivizing registrations with an extended free trial voucher. This landing page not only acts as a gateway for visitors to enter the code they’ve been given, referred, or seen promoted online, it also serves as additional advertising for all of the content and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is exactly what makes this page so compelling—<strong>a showcase of benefits through messaging, video, testimonial, and imagery</strong>. Just below a warm and inviting hero image (anybody else craving some fresh-baked bread right now?) showing a real-life recipe displayed on a mobile device is a summary of membership value alongside a short promotional video. As you scroll down, the features and benefits—like diversity of recipes, filters for skill level and dietary requirements, the ability to create your own “collections,” and more—are plainly laid out to show visitors all the goods they’re in for and address any concerns or questions you may have before signing up. Complete with a bright, eye-catching (and mouthwatering) image gallery of just some of the cookbooks included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also clearly know just how important building trust is, especially depending on the level of information you may be asking visitors to share. Endorsements from award-winning chefs and travel writers, press from recognizable publications, and a note that a membership can be cancelled anytime—including during the extended free trial—all help to reassure visitors they’re in good hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>PS.

Everyone loves to get a little something for free, but they’re not giving just <em>anything </em>away. Instead of a more typical “swag” item like a coffee mug or t-shirt—which, while still great, are more generic items any business can customize—they’re dishing out freebies that are perfectly aligned with the products and services they offer, and the wants and needs of their prospects.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors to this page are likely already problem aware, somewhat solution aware, and probably in some stage of evaluation. <strong>It’s super smart for Condair to offer a gift in exchange for their information so they can get in direct contact, and to use page real estate for additional form fields that help qualify leads</strong> instead of trying to dazzle them with superfluous design or slick photography that doesn’t hold much weight for their prospects. Instead, they’ve kept their offer and landing page itself simple, making space to ask the kind of questions they need to in order to best serve that individual. That said, they don’t go overboard with form fields—there are just enough questions to get a context for that visitor’s needs while keeping their time, and value of their exchange, in mind.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit is three-fold: Condair gets a contact portal and wealth of data for prospects who may have otherwise anonymously left their site, a relationship is instantly established through reciprocity, and said prospects get a cool little present <em>before they even become</em> Condair customers.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>National Sewing Circle</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96986\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS.png 1440w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-150x93.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-404x250.png 404w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-80x49.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-768x475.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-1000x618.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-650x402.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-300x185.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-160x99.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The folks at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nationalsewingcircle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">National Sewing Circle</a> (and their marketing agency, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.tnmarketing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TN Marketing</a>) are seasoned pros at effective lead generation. We’ve featured their work before in a post on great <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/14-inspiring-popup-design-examples-to-help-grow-your-online-business/\">popup examples</a>, and couldn’t pass up another opportunity to do so when we discovered how well this lead gen landing page was performing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let that seemingly innocuous little carrot fool you—this page packs a serious <strong>conversion punch at 88% of over 3,400 visitors</strong>. Catering to a thriving and active community of sewing enthusiasts, they’ve chosen to offer a cute, fun, and broadly-applicable pattern with an incredibly low barrier to entry. Much like Condair in the previous example, National Sewing Circle understands the balance of give and take, asking only for an email address to “unlock your download.” From there, they can <strong>nurture those leads through <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/email-marketing/\">email marketing</a> and show how much value they can deliver</strong> beyond this humble yet hardworking carrot.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/carrotworkout.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96987\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And get this—it’s one of <em>many.</em> The simplicity of this landing page makes it extra easy to duplicate with minimal customizations, as well as giving it a clean, clutter-free appearance. And since National Sewing Circle knows there’s (usually) no such thing as too many leads, they’ve made it part of a themed package of individual patterns. The landing page below, also created in Unbounce, links out to each pattern’s respective download page, all with similarly high conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96988\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy.png 1440w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-134x150.png 134w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-223x250.png 223w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-71x80.png 71w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-768x861.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-1370x1536.png 1370w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-1000x1122.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-650x729.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-300x336.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/NSS-copy-143x160.png 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UENI</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96989\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI.png 1440w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-150x85.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-443x250.png 443w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-80x45.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-768x433.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-1000x564.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-650x367.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-300x169.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/UENI-160x90.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ueni.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UENI</a>, which provides marketing and advertising services to small businesses, proves <strong>anticipation can be a powerful thing</strong> with this relatively vague, yet high-converting landing page targeted at ecommerce clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the primary use cases for lead generation landing pages is drumming up excitement <em>before</em> a business, product, service, announcement, or whatever the case may be, has even come to fruition. It’s a way to<strong> get the word out early while building a list of subscribers, allowing you to gauge interest before going to market and create a more solid launchpad for when you do.</strong> We’ve used this strategy before for Unbounce campaigns, and I have to admit that launch day is a<em> lot </em>less nerve wracking when you already have a list of people who’ve essentially told you they’re excited to see what you’ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, UENI’s applied a light hand in copy and design to beautifully capture a feeling of “mystery” while giving enough detail away to intrigue the right clients. Though the page may seem sparse, its polished design, saturated, high-contrast colors, and use of negative background space <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/how-ecommerce-company-packlane-delivers-on-brand-targeted-campaigns-with-custom-landing-pages/\">reflect their brand</a> and a certain level of quality one can expect from them (even in its simplest form).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The copy is doing a lot of heavy lifting, too. In a handful of sentences, they’ve managed to communicate everything they need to about who this offer is for, why it’s great—as the headline claims—and what makes it special (exclusive access). It’s a strong case for swapping out nothing more than your email address. And at a <strong>56% conversion rate,</strong> it seems a lot of people are <em>already</em> sold.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"editors-note\">\n    <p>Learn the ins and outs of high-converting <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/ecommerce-landing-page-examples-sales/\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce landing pages</a> from 27 real-word examples.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Frank &#38; Dick</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96993\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB.png 1440w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-119x150.png 119w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-199x250.png 199w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-64x80.png 64w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-768x966.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-1221x1536.png 1221w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-1000x1258.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-650x817.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-300x377.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/VB-127x160.png 127w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.frankanddick.no/\" target=\"_blank\">Frank &#38; Dick</a> is a digital advertising and media agency based in Oslo, Norway, that specializes in ecommerce for mid-to-large businesses.

Marketers, copywriters, and salespeople talk about <em>attention</em> all the time. It’s like a nervous tic, always sitting on the tip of the tongue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s curious, though, because another word that marketers <em>don&#8217;t often </em>use is &#8220;patience.&#8221; And <strong>patience is just as important</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, our first objective is to gain the <em>attention</em> of our prospects. But with signup pages, it&#8217;s also about making that registration process as painless and as easy as possible.&#160;In other words, it&#8217;s not enough just to get your visitors&#8217; attention⁠—you shouldn&#8217;t test their patience either. Not with additional questions. Not with confusing copy. Not with incongruent design. As UX expert Steve Krug once famously put it, &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me think.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re going to cover <strong>12 examples of signup pages that get both patience and attention right</strong>, with commentary by yours truly. But before we get our hands dirty, let&#8217;s take a closer look at what a signup page is.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blue-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93558\" width=\"25\" height=\"5\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What&#8217;s a Signup Page?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, a signup page is a type of landing page with a primary conversion goal to drive registrations.&#160;These can occur on the landing page itself, or the page can prime visitors before prompting them to enter an account creation flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you may be saying to yourself, &#8220;But I’m already driving traffic to my website. Do I <em>really</em> need a separate signup page?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make a comparison. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone lands on your website&#8217;s homepage, they could have come from one of many channels (like an organic search or by clicking a backlink in someone else&#8217;s content.) They&#8217;re checking you out, yes, but they may not be there to buy. They might not even know what you&#8217;re offering or what you do. Your visitors are curious, maybe. Intrigued? Possibly. But will they fill out a contact form? Don&#8217;t count on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you run ads, though, your main goal is often to get your visitors to convert. For this reason, it makes much more sense to send them to a landing page that is <strong>specifically designed to get them to sign up</strong> instead of a generic homepage full of links and other distractions. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97344\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash.jpg 1920w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-150x100.jpg 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-375x250.jpg 375w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-80x53.jpg 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-650x433.jpg 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/austin-distel-goFBjlQiZFU-unsplash-160x107.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>When should I use a signup page?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re running paid ads, you should be using a signup page. That goes for PPC ads and social media ads like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, or if you&#8217;re running email campaigns. In all cases, <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using dedicated landing pages</a> to drive traffic is an easy way to boost conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With SaaS, especially, remember the importance of patience. It&#8217;s crucial here because testing your target audience&#8217;s patience will cost you—a lot. No one bounces faster than a first-time SaaS user. That&#8217;s why you must ease them in. <strong>Sequenced pages can help you achieve this goal by making the experience seamless, focused, and pleasant.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two other elements are vital to keep in mind. First, grant your users small victories, in the beginning, to give them a sense of empowerment. And, second, be sure to show them tons of value early on. Have them perceive the value of your tool, specifically <em>for them</em>. How do you create these little <em>Aha! </em>moments? By having them apply what they learned easily, and by getting them to experience the results for themselves.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"curated-tip\">\n    <div class=\"container inner text-left\">\n        <p><strong>Wanna learn how other SaaS marketers use landing pages to connect with customers?</strong> See how you can get a handle on your business and achieve unprecedented growth in <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/saas-optimization-guide/\" target=_blank>our guide for SaaS marketers from Talia Wolf</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2>Create a signup page that&#8217;ll knock their socks off.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most landing pages, a high-converting signup page must have some <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-anatomy-of-a-landing-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">essential elements</a>, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A clear benefit-driven headline</li><li>A subheading that drives home the point</li><li>A fantastic (and relevant) hero image </li><li>A compelling call-to-action &#160;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But wait.&#8221; Yes, you there with your hand raised. &#8220;Where’s the  form?&#8221;&#160;<em>Exactly</em>! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great signup page is one that might as well be yelling, &#8220;Look, ma. No hands!&#8221; You want to keep the <em>f-f-f-friction </em>to a minimum, either by keeping your form as short as possible or even hiding it until the right might moment. (Some smart examples of this tactic below.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do this by having them click on the call-to-action, no fields. And <em>voilà</em>! A form appears, seemingly out of thin air. From there, you&#8217;ve got options. Will you lead them down a multi-page sequence? Or will you collect the email and get them to log onto your platform, where they’ll be prompted to follow dopamine-triggering queues? Or will you email them and start nurturing them that way?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to learn is to see these principles in action, though. Let’s dig deeper into how to create a signup page by going over some Unbounce-certified examples below.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/industry/saas/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"[General] Unbounce for SaaS\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-SaaS-Blog-Visual-CTA_2.png\" alt=\"Find out how to build high-converting Unbounce pages without disrupting a single developer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"538\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/pink-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93559\" width=\"25\" height=\"6\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>12 Great Signup Pages Created by Unbounce Customers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, an excellent registration page follows all the principles of a great landing page but uses them to get people to fill out your form.

Ruby shows incredible focus.</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/ruby-full-signup-page.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Ruby signup pages\" class=\"wp-image-97349\" width=\"1182\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example.png 2363w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-150x76.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-495x250.png 495w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-80x40.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-768x388.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-1536x776.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-2048x1035.png 2048w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-1000x505.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-650x328.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-300x152.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Signup-Page-Above-the-Fold-Example-160x81.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.ruby.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ruby</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ruby.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ruby</a> is a virtual receptionist and chat company that gets the power of branding. Their gorgeous above-the-fold setup for this landing page is a perfect example of signup done right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, the headline is direct. Make more sales when people reach out to you. They promise to help you create &#8220;happy customers&#8221; while you’re at it.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body copy is equally clear. The first sentence (&#8220;Missed calls are costing you customers&#8221;) is a swift punch to the gut. Hit ‘em where the pain point is. Then, tie that to your offer, with a bow. Well done.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And look at that image. The yellow sticks out like a broken thumb, and the caller’s gripping the phone. There&#8217;s a clear gap between the caller and the target audience, symbolizing silence. Her expression. What is she <em>thinking</em>? <strong>This isn&#8217;t your typical stock image.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two buttons? I&#8217;d probably <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A/B test</a> this setup against a single button, since you can easily find their phone number on the top right-hand corner. It might yield higher conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, comparing this signup page with <a href=\"https://www.ruby.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ruby&#8217;s homepage</a> illustrates the different approach you need to take with your landing pages:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Ruby homepage\" class=\"wp-image-97350\" width=\"1260\" height=\"629\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison.png 2520w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-150x75.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-501x250.png 501w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-80x40.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-768x383.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-1536x767.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-2048x1022.png 2048w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-1000x499.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-650x324.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-300x150.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Ruby-Homepage-Above-the-Fold-Comparison-160x80.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair headline, right? Unlike the signup page, though, it ain&#8217;t about the target audience at all. &#8220;Meet Ruby&#8221; sounds a lot like something you’d say when introducing someone at a party. The body copy focuses on the company too. And the CTA? &#8220;Watch <em>OUR </em>Video.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most significant difference lies in all those menu options. Buttons are popping out at you from almost every corner. That&#8217;s five buttons I get exposed to even before I start scrolling. <em>Everything </em>is calling for my attention, and I&#8217;m more likely to begin exploring than to convert.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This works for a homepage, of course. It&#8217;s beckoning us to browse and get to know Ruby. But Ruby&#8217;s signup page had a<strong> much tighter focus in its messaging suited to converting traffic from a paid campaign</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. GraphicsZoo stays true with a gorgeous landing page.</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a class=\"fancybox iframelpexamples\" href=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/graphicszoo-full-signup.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/graphicszoo-signup-page-above-the-fold-example.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97352\"/></a><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Image courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.graphicszoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GraphicsZoo</a>.

As a white-label graphic design service, they <em>get</em> landing page design.&#160;The GIF above gives you a sneak peek of the platform. That&#8217;s all you need to know that it’s got a gorgeous, useful, and intuitive UI.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline explains what the app is in simple terms. (That&#8217;s fine, but it might be worth testing a benefit-oriented headline. Something like, &#8220;Scaling white-label design services just got a whole lot easier.&#8221;)&#160;Finally, there are no menu items on this registration page. Just a single call-to-action, and it only wants your email address. Keeping the ask small makes it more likely that visitors will convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

If there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;ll make me do a double-take, which is a super weird thing to do by yourself, it&#8217;s a remarkable form. (No, seriously.)&#160;Just look at that CTA: Start Now. There&#8217;s not a misleading word in there. (For example, it&#8217;s not, &#8220;Sign up now,&#8221; which wouldn&#8217;t be quite true.) And when you click on it, you&#8217;re prompted with, &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Started.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everything fades into the background when you click.</strong> All you need to do to get started is to give Flyhomes your email and whisper the sweet words every marketer wants to hear: &#8220;Nurture me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.

It takes a saying that a villain in a movie might say to someone they&#8217;ve screwed over, and turns it on its head. This <em>is </em>business. Then the page tells you what the product is and ties it directly to the benefit in the headline.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body copy simply expands upon this line, before presenting the initial pricing.&#160;The image is also immediately recognizable as a SaaS design, so there’s no mistaking where you are when you land. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though sometimes multiple CTAs spell trouble, the double-dip on the calls-to-action here is a nice touch. This landing page puts the primary CTA under the body copy and the secondary CTA on the top right, space traditionally reserved for the menu. What I love about this is that the primary CTA invites the target audience to view a demo first, while the top-right button instead prompts the target to hop right into a free trial.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I would test though is this type of design against variants with photos of people as well as copy. SaaS is getting competitive. It’s becoming an increasingly saturated market, one where visual branding will play a greater role.<strong> </strong>Beyond a single landing page, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">A/B testing</a> can provide useful insights into which direction you should be guiding your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>6.

But if you&#8217;re offering me a 60-day trial, I&#8217;m intrigued enough to want to read through the copy and find out what I&#8217;m getting into. (Still, it&#8217;d be worth testing a variant with trimmed copy or a shorter form.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite thing about this page, though, is how they’ve managed to squeeze all this essential information into an easily digestible and clean landing page.&#160;The fine print under the CTA also does a good job of addressing common objections: when they offer a 60-day free trial with no commitment, the company means business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free-trial pages have been around since modems used to screech at you.

But the<strong> buyer journey isn&#8217;t linear because the B2B buyer tends to be research-savvy. </strong>They jump back and forth between the interest and consideration stages, and the consideration stage is much longer.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, B2B buyers also more interested in technical features than emotional appeals compared to B2C. That&#8217;s because they want to know all about the <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>return on their investment.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nakisa understands this.

Are there many restaurant owners who believe their restaurant is &#8220;amazing&#8221;? Sure. But this quote isn&#8217;t functioning as a testimonial, per se. Instead, the bottom subheading (in red, which helps it stand out) asks if you share this <strong>common sentiment</strong>. Then it presents <strong>a list of benefits that address this pain point, with a simple visual showcasing a platform feature.&#160;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page is an excellent example of using creativity to vary your copy, while pushing the boundaries. (It&#8217;s also a great opportunity to A/B test the different ways you can present a pain point.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, they&#8217;ve gone with a quote, but maybe something more direct would be more effective? Or perhaps a touch of humour would work? And some audiences could respond better to one headline, while others respond better to another. (A/B testing or using a tool like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic-ppc/\">Smart Traffic</a> can help you find out what copy works best for winning new signups.)</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3>11.

(!) </strong><em>I know, I know.</em> Earlier, I noted that excluding the menu is the obvious move. (It&#8217;s certainly a landing page best practice.) But this menu here works, and here&#8217;s why I think it does: since Marley Spoon is a food subscription service, they provide a chance to look at the menu before taking advantage of the coupon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing it does well?&#160;<strong>Those buttons are in different colors.&#160;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, even without reading the call to action, that these two buttons have two separate appeals. One’s a simple signup button, whereas the main CTA is a clear benefit-driven one: Save $80 in 4 weeks.&#160;That&#8217;s a strong 1-2 copy punch combo.

Amazing!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got it, flaunt it, especially if you&#8217;ve received a significant award and recognition from an industry leader in your space.

marketers get a bad rap</em>. In the last decade, the conversation has focused on technical marketing: growth hacking, conversion rate optimization, SEO, the merging of product and marketing, and data, data, data. At the same time, brand became less exciting—and sometimes an afterthought. It was too “fluffy.”</p> \n<p>But that’s all changing. Companies have found their edge by investing in incredible brands, and <strong>a company’s brand has become its differentiator</strong>. Look to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the recent launch of Hey</a> or other companies like Equal Parts, Headspace, Warby Parker, Casper, and Notion as examples.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It might seem like building a brand doesn’t line up with the idea of being&nbsp;data-driven. But we<strong> can apply what we’ve learned about technical marketing over the last decade to build better brands</strong> and make better decisions in today’s data-driven world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Through customer research, landing page testing, conversion rate optimization, and traditional brand development tactics, you can be smarter about building and evolving your brand. Landing page optimization can serve as your testing ground for this stuff, and I’ll show you how.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blue-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93558\" width=\"25\" height=\"5\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<h2><strong>What Goes Into a Brand?</strong></h2> \n<p>Before we dive into how to take a data-driven approach to building a brand, let’s make sure we are on the same page about what <em>makes up</em> a brand. The short answer is “a lot.” But for this overview, I’ll focus on a few critical parts:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>The look and feel (design, user experience)</li>\n <li>The voice, tone, and messaging</li>\n <li>The positioning (versus others in the market)</li>\n <li>The overall brand promise</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The <strong>look and feel</strong> of a tech brand is mostly encapsulated in the design, feel, and user experience (UX) of both the website and product. Everything (from a company’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/\" target=\"_blank\">color scheme</a> to the feel of its animations) matters when trying to convey a personality. Look to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://design.studio/work/airbnb\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb</a> as an example of how important the design and feel can be in establishing your brand’s personality:</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97737\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb.png 1054w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-150x150.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-251x250.png 251w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-80x80.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-768x765.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-1000x996.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-650x648.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-300x299.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-airbnb-160x160.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1054px) 100vw, 1054px\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n   Here you can see Airbnb’s visuals convey feelings of fun, diversity, and being human.

Pretty straightforward, but it’s important to note that companies should aim to <strong>make this attractive to the right person at the right time </strong>(and that’s where landing page testing can come in).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your company’s <strong>positioning in-market versus your competitors</strong> is an essential part of your brand. How do you distinguish yourself against the alternatives? Why should someone choose YOU over THEM? You only have so much real estate. What you want to say can vary depending on a variety of factors, like your personas and where they are in the funnel (i.e., people who are just discovering you versus ready to make a purchase).</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97740\" width=\"1440\" height=\"672\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma.png 1920w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-150x70.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-536x250.png 536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-80x37.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-768x358.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-1536x717.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-1000x467.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-650x303.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-300x140.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-figma-160x75.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n   Figma positioned versus a competitor.\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Finally, the overall <strong>brand promise</strong> represents what you are promising to deliver to your customers. What is that <em>thing </em>you are promising? Sometimes it can be something as straightforward as a promise in your tagline: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” It’s important to balance:&nbsp;</p> \n<ol>\n <li>how you position yourself against competitors;</li>\n <li>what is attractive to your target customers;</li>\n <li>and what you can deliver on.</li>\n</ol> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97741\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico.png 1200w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-150x88.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-429x250.png 429w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-80x47.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-768x448.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-1000x583.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-650x379.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-300x175.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-geico-160x93.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n   Geico delivers its brand promise in a tagline.\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Your messaging and positioning will differ significantly based on these factors above. <strong>How your product serves one <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-pages/scientific-model-for-emotionally-powerful-landing-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>persona</strong></a> may be far different than how it serves another.</strong></p> \n<p>A solid understanding of all of this will result in a successful marketing team and (likely) company growth. But this is also what most marketing and product teams mess up. Without the data, people tend to make assumptions. Or marketers aren’t customer-centric enough in their approach, and they deliver the wrong message, brand, or feel to the wrong person at the wrong time.</p> \n<p>The great thing about all of this is that <strong>we can use landing page testing and conversion rate optimization to test and validate all of these elements of your brand</strong>. Let’s explore a few ways you can get this done (fast).</p> \n<h2>1. Use landing page testing to validate your personas.</h2> \n<p>Say you are revisiting your target customers and why they decide to use your product. Understanding what resonates with each persona at each stage may be hard to figure out. It usually takes a lot of research, but you can also get quicker answers with landing pages.</p> \n<p>Below are a few examples of how you can do this. For these tests, it’s best to send traffic to these landing pages with an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">A/B test</a> (which you can do in Unbounce). You can drive traffic to the pages using paid ads on Facebook, for instance, or you can tap into your existing audiences and push traffic via email—in either case, split the traffic for reliable comparisons.</p> \n<h3>Test different calls to action to let users self identify.</h3> \n<p>On your landing page, create the isolated options that someone can click to self-identify. For example, describe your product for specific personas and with clear self-identifying calls to action (e.g., “I’m a marketer”). See the example below:</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97745\" width=\"1917\" height=\"894\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example.png 1917w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-150x70.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-536x250.png 536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-80x37.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-768x358.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-1536x716.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-1000x466.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-650x303.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-300x140.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-160x75.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1917px) 100vw, 1917px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>From there, push them into the funnel or purchase page and see which CTAs get the most clicks and have the best conversion rates. You can use this data to see which audience your product resonates with most and validate or invalidate specific personas.</p> \n<h3>Test different jobs-to-be-done through CTA optimization.</h3> \n<p>To gather data around which jobs your users are hiring you to do, test different CTAs with those audiences. Allow them to self-select, just like in the example above. But here we put different <a href=\"https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jobs to be done</a> side-by-side with our product. <strong>With this data, you can see the most common and attractive use cases for your product.</strong>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97746\" width=\"1914\" height=\"856\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2.png 1914w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-150x67.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-560x250.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-80x36.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-768x343.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-1536x687.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-1000x447.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-650x291.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-300x134.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-2-160x72.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>You can also run different landing pages entirely and see which one converts best in an A/B test.&nbsp;These are not going to give teams definitive answers about your personas and why they use your product, but they’ll inform those strategic discussions. And it’s far better than going into this strategy blind. </p> \n<p>\n <div>\n  By running ads or segmented campaigns via email and pushing those users to landing pages with messaging or design that you seek to test, \n  <strong>you can stop guessing and learn more quickly.</strong>\n </div></p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h2>2. Use conversion rate optimization (CRO) to improve your positioning.</h2> \n<p>Landing pages are also the perfect way to <strong>test your product’s positioning with consumers. </strong>One of the best things you can do via landing page optimization is test your positioning against competitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How? Run an A/B test of a page showing you versus your competitors and have different positioning/messaging on each variant. See which one wins by looking at traffic, CTRs, and conversion rates. (Be careful here: a best practice is to avoid direct side-by-side comparisons against your competitors.)</p> \n<p>Look to this Zendesk example below for inspiration:</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97751\" width=\"960\" height=\"1350\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk.png 1920w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-107x150.png 107w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-178x250.png 178w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-57x80.png 57w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-768x1080.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-1092x1536.png 1092w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-1456x2048.png 1456w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-1000x1406.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-650x914.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-300x422.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/zendesk-vs-desk-114x160.png 114w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n   (Source: \n   <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/zendesk-vs-desk/\" target=\"_blank\">Zendesk</a> via \n   <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.crayon.co/blog/great-competitive-comparison-pages\" target=\"_blank\">Crayon</a>)\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>You can also refine other parts of your positioning within your landing pages. For example, you can test headline copy with particular personas to see which positioning of your product resonates better with each.&nbsp;Or, as you push traffic at different funnel stages to landing pages, you can learn when to include a “learn more” versus “buy now” call to action. Testing CTAs will help you better understand what customers want at different parts of the user journey.</p> \n<p>Finally, any ongoing testing will likely involve <strong>the refinement of your <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-glossary/definition/unique-value-proposition/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>core value prop</strong></a> and product positioning.</strong> As you gather data from landing page performance and change the copy and design, note what wins. And, as you discover more winners, share this data with those in charge of your overall product positioning. Based on these opportunities, they can make improvements to the messaging and framing of the product against competitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h2>3. Using CRO to find the best brand promise.</h2> \n<p>This may be the most straightforward thing you can do with landing page testing. How? Test and validate your main value prop in your landing page headline. Here’s one approach I have taken when trying to validate our best headlines:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Develop your top <strong>2-5 headlines</strong> based on your brand factors (personas, position in market, product value, etc.)</li>\n <li>Create a short landing page with the same sections below it and the same CTA (e.g., “Learn More”).</li>\n <li>Create variants of the page with each headline you’ve devised.</li>\n <li>See which one gets the most clicks/leads/sign-ups/purchases.</li>\n</ol> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97747\" width=\"1920\" height=\"746\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3.png 1920w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-150x58.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-560x218.png 560w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-80x31.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-768x298.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-1536x597.png 1536w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-1000x389.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-650x253.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-300x117.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/brand-example-3-160x62.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>With this, you should start gathering data on CTRs that resonate best and you will have <strong>data that is more valuable than a simple survey</strong>:&nbsp;which copy <em>actually</em> got people to convert?</p> \n<div class=\"blog-cta-image-section\" data-ga=\"\">\n <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/?p=97707/unbounce.com/product/features/unlimited-ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" data-campaign=\"\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/2.5_VisualCTA_AB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2260\" height=\"1217\" /></a>\n</div> \n<h2>4. Ease tension between technical and brand marketing teams.</h2> \n<p>There’s always an inherent tension between the teams focused on conversion and those focused on brand. Conversion-oriented marketing teams push the boundaries of the brand to drive sign-ups, purchases, and more. Brand teams seek to rein in this approach to avoid going “off-brand.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Data-driven approaches to brand development can smooth out this tension.</strong> </p> \n<p>The conversion-focused marketing team can build relationships with brand teams by proactively testing messages, designs, and positioning through landing pages. (Brand teams might not know these things are possible.)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Plus, you can use landing pages to push the boundaries of the brand. Test the “off-brand” stuff by running small scale tests for copy, positioning, and design. The company faces less risk that way, but it may gain some interesting insights that help inform your strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Build alignment by testing things together and evolving the brand <em>together</em>.&nbsp;</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h2>Key considerations when using data to inform your brand strategy.</h2> \n<p>When using A/B testing to iterate on your brand, there are some key things to note. More than anything, the team must <strong>avoid making decisions using biased data. </strong>Data is only as useful as its source. </p> \n<p>Audiences are your most important consideration here:</p> \n<ul>\n <li>Who are you sending to these landing pages?&nbsp;</li>\n <li>What’s their context?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Careful consideration of these two questions can make or break any data that comes from landing page testing.&nbsp;In general, you should <strong>align your ad with your landing page</strong> as much as possible to avoid confusing the visitor.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here are some other things to think about when evaluating the validity of your landing page tests:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>How confident are you that an up-funnel optimization will not lead to adverse behavior down the funnel?</strong> Or, said more simply, is your messaging <em>deceptive</em>? Use your best judgment here and ensure you tie landing page performance to down-funnel metrics.</li>\n <li><strong>Are you trying to get in front of new people or existing people?</strong> People who know your brand or don’t? Identify the best audiences and find them—push people via email or ads or serve up the landing page(s) in a survey. Choose the right audience based on what answer you are trying to get. Similar to choosing the right audience for research, choose the right audience for landing page testing.</li>\n <li>If possible,<strong> segment the traffic to your landing pages to narrow down what is working for whom.</strong> For example, if your company serves both engineers and designers, separate the ads and landing pages for these audiences so you can understand what works for each audience independently.</li>\n</ul> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"alignleft size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/pink-rectangle-horizontal.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-93559\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<h2><strong>Tying It All Together</strong></h2> \n<p>Everything I’ve described here is really just a derivative of research, but you are testing it in a more robust and informative way. <strong>By giving people more context and a “real” feel via landing pages, you’ll get better answers to the most pressing questions about your brand.</strong>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brand and data-driven marketing don’t need to be separate. By working together, conversion rate optimization pros can inform brand strategies and help companies better understand their customers’ desires, needs, and values.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Try a completely different approach to how you position yourself or even test landing pages against your traditional product positioning. See what sticks and see if you can refine how you speak to your customers across the board. If that doesn’t work, roll things back and try it again.

The adrenaline rush of going to pick up your nametag on the first day. The opening keynote that gets everyone in the room buzzing. The networking breaks where you awkwardly introduce yourself to strangers and mingle over tiny sandwiches. (OK, maybe that’s just me.)</p> \n<p>This year though, almost every single conference and event has been either delayed or canceled. COVID-19 has put a pause on large group gatherings of all kinds, and many event organizers have been left scrambling to figure out what they can or should do as an alternative.</p> \n<p>One option is to take your event online and run a webinar (or perhaps, a series of webinars), instead. But can you really replicate all that buzz, networking, and opportunity over a laptop screen? How can you possibly do a webinar that’s as exciting as an in-person event?</p> \n<p><strong>Charlene Ditch, Founder and CEO of </strong><a href=\"https://charlenekateevents.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Charlene Kate Events</strong></a>, says the potential is there for marketers who are prepared to put in the effort:</p> \n<div class=\"blog-photo\">\n <img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Charlene-Quote.png\" alt=\"Charlene Ditch, Founder and CEO of Charlene Kate Events\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\" />\n</div> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n <p><em>We’re navigating a new world and while we must adapt, we still have to be thoughtful in how we deliver the attendee experience.

Align Your Theme and Dates</h2> \n<p>Every great online event starts with a great idea. You want to put something out there that nobody else has ever done before (or do it better than anyone else)—and this can be challenging when there are hundreds of webinars happening every single month.</p> \n<p>That’s why the theme you choose is so important. You want to <strong>cover a topic that your audience truly cares about</strong> and <strong>find a unique angle they can’t resist</strong>. You’ll want to brainstorm ways you can incorporate this theme into each of your speaker topics, the visual identity of your event, and the actual takeaways that attendees will be talking about afterward.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Digtal-Agency-Day.png\" alt=\"A webinar example by Unbounce: Digital Agency Day\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    The theme for \n    <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://digitalagencyday.com/\">Digital Agency Day</a> was growth—how agencies can scale up with tactics from the top experts in their industry. \n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>So how do you choose the theme for your virtual event? Here are some things to consider…</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Does it relate to a problem your target audience is trying to solve? </strong>Always approach your webinar from a customer-first perspective. Look for pain points that they care about, goals they’re trying to achieve, and opportunities they would like to pursue. Test out your theme by asking your current customers if they’d be interested in the topic.</li>\n <li><strong>Do you have expertise in this space?</strong> In order to attract qualified leads, the theme of your event should relate back to your business. Nobody wants to attend a pet grooming webinar put on by McDonald’s, for example. (Although I do wonder how they always manage to perfectly style the fur on <a href=\"https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Grimace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grimace</a>.)</li>\n <li><strong>Are there industry experts who can speak on this theme?</strong> You might get stuck if the theme you choose is too narrow or niche. Ideally, there should be a few experts who can speak on this theme or other companies that you can imagine wanting to partner up for the event.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>It also helps if you can tie your webinar to real-world events that are happening in your industry, or other important dates on the calendar. For example, right now many companies are putting on special webinar series to help their customers adapt to COVID-19.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Keela-Webinar.png\" alt=\"A Virtual Event by Keela\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    This webinar series was put on by \n    <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.keela.co/lp/adaptation-series\">Keela</a> to help non-profit organizations adapt to COVID-19. \n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<h2 id=\"Tip2\">2. Track Your Webinar Goals</h2> \n<p>Webinars are an excellent opportunity to generate leads for your business and <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/campaign-strategy/how-to-build-an-email-list/\">build up your email list</a>. Depending on the topic you choose and how heavily you promote the event, this will be an opportunity to reach new leads and get them interacting with your brand for the very first time. That’s why it helps to set a few goals at the start so you can be strategic with your planning and track how much ROI you drive from your efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Here are some of the most important goals you should think about earl on:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Number of Registrants</strong> – Set a realistic goal for the number of registrants you’re hoping will sign up for your webinar. It’s OK if this number changes as you start building out your event—the actual number of registrants will depend on your promo efforts, your partnerships, and how much traffic you drive to the sign-up page.</li>\n <li><strong>Number of Attendees </strong>– According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.on24.com/resources/assets/report-webinar-benchmarks-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">webinar benchmarks from On24</a>, an average of 56% of registrants show up to attend an online event. This number drops to 43% if you’re expecting more than 100 attendees—so be realistic, and expect only about half of your registrants to actually be there on the day.</li>\n <li><strong>Number of Sales or Sign-Ups</strong> – The final goal you’ll want to track is how many registrants or attendees end up becoming customers with your business afterward. You can set a projected goal for this based on your business model and the types of leads you plan to attract.</li>\n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"Tip3\">3. Recruit a Lineup of Star Speakers</h2> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/MOW-Speakers.png\" alt=\"Recruit High-Profile Speakers for Your Webinar\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    For \n    <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/marketing-optimization-week/\">Marketing Optimization Week</a>, the Unbounce team recruited high-profile names and reps from high-profile companies to speak at the event.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>This is a big one. Because the first thing anyone does when they see a new webinar or online event is to check who’s going to be speaking. If you don’t have the right name recognition or expertise on deck, then a lot of people just aren’t going to be all that interested.</p> \n<p><strong>Rachel Scott, Senior Marketing Manager at Unbounce</strong>, says that there are three valuable things to look for when creating your ideal list of speakers:</p> \n<div class=\"blog-photo\">\n <img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Rachel-Quote.png\" alt=\"Rachel Scott, Senior Marketing Manager at Unbounce\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\" />\n</div> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n <p>Recognizable names are a huge draw, so you’ll want to look for those first. But there are also company names that can be just as important. Try to find a balance between the two, while also actively searching for diversity and different points of view. Check out other industry webinars and see who has been speaking recently—you can find a lot of great presenters that way, and they’ll probably be more keen to participate.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You’ll want to start recruiting early because you need your speaker line-up in place before you can start promoting your event. One other tip that Rachel suggested is to offer a <strong>lead sharing opportunity</strong> to big-name partners or speakers who would help expand your reach.</p> \n<div class=\"blog-photo\">\n <img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Rachel-Quote.png\" alt=\"Rachel Scott, Senior Marketing Manager at Unbounce\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\" />\n</div> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n <p>Give speakers and partners the opportunity to generate leads for their business as well. You could offer a one-to-one lead share for example, and for every lead they help bring into the webinar you’ll give them access to another lead who registered. That way, they have an incentive to drive registrations to the event and spread the word. Alternatively, you can set a registration goal for them, where if they bring in a certain number of leads you’ll share the full list of webinar registrations.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>In your pitch to speakers, you’ll want to emphasize <strong>what’s in it for them</strong>. Whether that’s lead sharing, a partnership opportunity for their company, the number of attendees they’ll be able to reach, or who they’ll be speaking alongside at the event.</p> \n<p><strong>Do You Need a Webinar Host?</strong></p> \n<p>A host or moderator can help make your online event more exciting and easy to follow for attendees. Look for someone within your own company who might be great at this task—charming, friendly, and knowledgeable. You can have them introduce each guest, run Q&amp;A sessions with speakers, and act as the “face” of the event to make it more personal.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Tip4\">4. Set Up Your Webinar Platform and Tools</h2> \n<p>There are a number of different platforms you can use to run your webinar or online event. Here are a few of the most popular options that <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/integrations/\">integrate with Unbounce</a> landing pages:</p> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/integrations/zapier/?integration=gotowebinar\">GoToWebinar</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/unbounce/integrations/demio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Demio</a>&nbsp;</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/unbounce/integrations/livestorm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Livestorm</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/unbounce/integrations/zoom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zoom</a></li>\n</ul> \n<p>Your choice will ultimately come down to the features you need, how much control you want over the platform, and what price point makes sense for your business.</p> \n<p>Beyond the webinar platform itself, you’ll also want to set up a landing page to promote the event and bring in new registrants. You can use Unbounce to quickly set up a page that highlights your speakers and encourages attendees to sign up. Check out our <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-templates/event/\">event landing page templates</a> to get started, or see more <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/webinar-landing-page-examples/\">webinar landing page examples and best practices for 2020</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Evento-Template.png\" alt=\"Landing Page Template for Virtual Events and Webinars\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    The \n    <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/evento/\">Evento landing page template</a> would work perfectly for an online event or webinar series.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<h2 id=\"Tip5\">5. Promote the Event to Create Buzz</h2> \n<p>Now that you’ve got your speakers on board and your registration landing page set up, it’s time to start promoting your webinar. You’ll want to build in at least <strong>one month of lead time</strong> for your promo efforts in order to give visitors enough chances to sign up.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Send Out Promo</strong> <strong>Emails</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Screen-Shot-2020-07-13-at-8.41.14-AM.png\" alt=\"A Webinar Promo Email Example\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    You can send out promo emails like this one to build anticipation for your webinar or online event.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Here at Unbounce, we’ve found emails to be the single most effective way to promote webinars. Open rates and click-through rates tend to be higher here than any other channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Try to split out some segments of your list you think would be particularly interested in the subject matter, and send out <strong>a series of three</strong> <strong>promotional emails</strong> inviting them to attend.</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Email One</strong> <strong>(“The Invitation Email”)</strong> – Send this one out about a month before your online event. This is the big unveiling of your event, so you’ll want to treat it with the right level of fanfare to get recipients excited. Focus on the customer-centric benefits of your theme, and the big reasons they’ll want to attend.</li>\n <li><strong>Email Two (“The Speaker Email”) </strong>– A week or two later, send a follow-up email that goes into a bit more detail about who will be speaking at the event. This is where you can do some name-dropping and get into more specifics about different topics on the agenda.</li>\n <li><strong>Email Three (“The Last Chance Email”) </strong>– This one should go out a day or two before the event, and really lean on the FOMO of your audience. It would be a shame if they missed out on this event that so many of their peers will be attending.</li>\n</ul> \n<p><strong>Build Anticipation on Social Media</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/MozCon-Twitter.png\" alt=\"How to Promote Your Online Event on Social Media\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"480\" height=\"244\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    Use social media to raise awareness and get more attendees excited for your event.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Posting about your event on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn can help build buzz for your target audience and make them more likely to attend. That’s because <a href=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/42323/advertising-marketing-messages-effective-frequency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the more times someone sees an ad, the more likely they will be to take action</a>. If it seems like everybody is talking about your webinar on social media, that will help convince some of these folks to get curious enough to attend.</p> \n<p>In the weeks leading up to the big day, try sprinkling in more and more posts about the event. Ramp up the frequency as you get closer to create more “buzz” on the timeline and encourage other attendees to post about it as well.</p> \n<p><strong>Ask Speakers to Promote Your Event</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Speaker-Promo.png\" alt=\"Speakers Can Help You Promote Your Webinar on Social Media\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"480\" height=\"244\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    Ask speakers to promote your event to help bring in new audiences.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Your speakers want the webinar to be as successful as possible too, because their name is attached to the event. So why not tap into their networks and ask them for help with promotion?</p> \n<p>This can be a great strategy to bring in new leads who you might not otherwise reach on your own. Because almost everybody has an audience—whether that’s through a blog, an email list, or on social media. And even a simple retweet from the right speaker could provide a significant attendance boost to your online event.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Make sure to ask speakers early on to get their buy-in, and consider offering some sort of lead share (as we talked about earlier) to give them even more of a promotional incentive. </p> \n<p><strong>Use Popups and Sticky Bars on Your Website</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Sticky-Bar-Template-Set-a-Reminder.png\" alt=\"The Set a Reminder Sticky Bar Template for Webinars\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    Use a sticky bar on your website to let visitors know about your virtual event.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>You can set up a <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/popups-and-sticky-bars/\">popup or sticky bar</a> to appear on your website and promote the event. This is a great way to turn any relevant or high-traffic page into a vehicle for getting visitors to your webinar registration page. You could even place one on your website homepage if you’re serious about driving more registrations.</p> \n<p>Personally, I’m a big fan of the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-template/set-a-reminder/\">Set a Reminder sticky bar template</a>—the ticking countdown clock gets the attention of folks scrolling, but it doesn’t intrude too much on the page itself.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Tip6\">6. Perform Dry-Runs</h2> \n<p>What’s the biggest thing that separates a ho-hum webinar from an amazing online experience? Practice. (Sorry—that’s like a way less funny version of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/nyregion/29fyi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">famous Carnegie Hall joke</a>.)</p> \n<p>Sure, you can put your faith in your speakers and just <em>hope</em> they do a great job on the big day. But if you want to elevate your virtual event and really make it seem polished for attendees like an in-person event, <strong>we would highly recommend doing a dry run with each speaker first</strong>.</p> \n<p>Set up times with all your speakers a week or two before the event, and ask them to go through their presentation as they would when they’re live. While they’re going through, you should look for opportunities and areas of improvement around…</p> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Content Flow</strong> – Are they making clear points? Can you follow the flow of the presentation? Do they spend too long on one slide and not enough time somewhere else? Are there any holes or obvious questions they can address?</li>\n <li><strong>Delivery</strong> – Not everyone is a natural-born speaker. Look for opportunities to improve their delivery, and make recommendations based on how they perform the dry-run. If someone’s delivery seems off, you may want to ask them to continue practicing and schedule another dry-run before going live.</li>\n <li><strong>Visuals</strong> – To give your event a cohesive feel, try giving each speaker a slide deck template to use. Look for any style inconsistencies or visuals that could be improved during the dry-runs. (E.g., blurry photos, hard-to-read fonts, etc.) You should also check each speaker’s background to make sure the lighting is easy on the eyes, their microphone is clear, and their connection is stable. (For inspiration, check out some of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-at-mozcon-virtual\" target=\"_blank\">behind-the-scenes equipment MozCon speakers are using</a> for their presentations this year. <em>Très fancy!</em>)</li>\n <li><strong>Technical Requirements</strong> – Do they need to play a video during their presentation? Is there a web link they want to show? Better to know about these ahead of time than to be surprised live on the day of the webinar.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>You’ll also want to do a run-through with your host, and make sure they know what they’ll be saying before and after each presentation. Go over the pronunciation of each speaker’s name, and hold a mock Q&amp;A session so they get a feel for how they’ll be able to interact with attendees.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Tip7\">7. Make Magic Happen on the Day</h2> \n<p>On the day of your webinar, you’ll want to go above and beyond to bring some of that in-person excitement to attendees. Here are a few of the things you can do to really put the “event” in your “virtual event.”</p> \n<p><strong>Make It Interactive</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Screen-Shot-2020-07-13-at-9.36.24-AM.png\" alt=\"MozCon is encouraging socialization and networking at their virtual event.\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    I love how \n    <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/mozcon\">MozCon</a> is building in virtual networking time into the agenda and encouraging socializing online this year.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>If you’re not planning to have any audience interaction in your webinar, then why not just play a recording? The whole reason you do it live is because you want people to interact and engage with each other.</p> \n<p>This means doing more than just a 15-minute Q&amp;A at the end of each presentation, though. Try incorporating live polls into your webinar to engage with attendees as they’re watching. Get people in the chat room talking by having pre-prepared conversation topics that relate back to the topics you’re covering. Think outside the typical mold of a webinar to get your audience engaged.</p> \n<p><strong>Make It Seamless</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/GoToWebinar-Settings.jpg\" alt=\"The backend of a webinar platform.\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    Use your webinar platform to create a seamless experience for attendees.\n   </figcaption></img>\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>“Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!” In a great webinar or online event, you don’t see all the work that’s going on behind the scenes. Try to make things as seamless as possible for attendees by paying close attention to what their experience looks and feels like.</p> \n<p>Have a welcome message ready for each session, prep your host with some topics of conversation to fill time in between segments, and monitor for audience engagement in the chat and on social media. Depending on the size of your event, you’ll want at least two or three people working in the background to keep things running smoothly.</p> \n<p><strong>Make It Surprising</strong></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n  <img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/call-to-action-conference-2016-high-five-1.jpg\" alt=\"High-fives at CTAConf.\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\">\n   <figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">\n    We go all out for in-person conferences.

It’s usually the stuff that you’re not expecting that sticks out, even years later. A delightful curveball—like when there’s a lineup of over-caffeinated Unbouncers ready to high-five you as you walk into <a href=\"https://calltoactionconference.unbounce.com/\">CTAConf</a>.</p> \n<p>Brainstorm some ways you can surprise attendees and speakers with swag, giveaways, games, or activities. It can be a great way to break up a busy day, and help you go beyond that regular old webinar experience.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Tip8\">8.

No way—there’s still one more important step that would make you smack your forehead if you forgot.</p> \n<p>Because you don’t want the experience to just be over and forgotten by everyone, follow up with attendees (and registrants who couldn’t make it) afterward to provide any relevant materials or webinar recordings. This will give you another opportunity to track who is engaged and interested in this content—and who might fit into an email nurture to eventually become a customer.</p> \n<p>You might also want to consider creating a Facebook Group or a Slack Community Channel to keep the conversation alive between your speakers and attendees. That’s what Thinkific did after their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thinkific.com/thinkincolor2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Think in Color Online Summit</a>—and they now have an additional channel that can reach <strong>over 1,700 members</strong>. (Check out the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/campaign-strategy/thinkific-using-landing-pages-double-saas-growth/\">full customer story</a> for more details on how they got those numbers.)</p> \n<p>Oh, and don’t forget to follow up and thank your speakers too! They can provide valuable feedback on what went well, and what you can improve on for next time.</p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<h2>Your Next Webinar Has So Much Potential</h2> \n<p>You know what needs to happen next.

The fastest way to scale up is to take on more clients and customers. But somehow you have to do that <em>without</em> taking on more expenses or sacrificing on the work you’re already delivering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds impossible, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe not. <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-intelligence/\">Conversion Intelligence</a> is helping to level the playing field for small business owners and savvy marketers alike. You might not have the same resources as those bigger, enterprise companies you’re competing with—but you do have access to AI and machine learning tools that can help you deliver <strong>higher-converting campaigns</strong> with <strong>fewer resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something that Mats Moy, digital marketing consultant and founder of <a href=\"https://matsmoy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moy Consulting</a>, knows from experience. For years, Mats has been helping roofing companies generate online leads and become authorities in their local markets. But as a one-man show, he has had to spend a lot of his time juggling multiple different clients and projects, while also being responsible for the marketing of his own business.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1.png\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" class=\"wp-image-98289\" srcset=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1.png 1364w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-150x110.png 150w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-341x250.png 341w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-80x59.png 80w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-768x563.png 768w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-1000x733.png 1000w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-650x477.png 650w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-300x220.png 300w, https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/large-Blog_SmartTraffic_Portrait_1-160x117.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1364px) 100vw, 1364px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Around November 2019 though, everything changed for Mats. (Dun, dun, dunnn.) Since then, he has seen his business grow <strong>five times larger</strong> with the help of Unbounce landing pages and our AI-powered optimization tool, <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/\">Smart Traffic</a>. And this level of success is something Mats says he’s still coming to terms with&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I haven&#8217;t heard too many people speak about this feeling.

That’s a lot of shingles—er, I mean singles!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When Mats first started his marketing consulting business, he immediately saw the benefit of getting his clients to use landing pages. A typical roof replacement will normally run somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000, which makes every <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/solutions/use-case/ppc/\">PPC ad click</a> incredibly valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Traffic-wise, this is not an industry where you&#8217;ll see thousands of hits a day. Roofing clicks are very expensive, right? Your typical paid ads campaign from Google might be like 10 cents, 30 cents, or maybe a dollar for a click. But in roofing, some [in this industry] are paying like 60 bucks or more per click. So it&#8217;s quite pricey.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>By creating <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/landing-pages/\">landing pages</a> that targeted specific local keywords (e.g., “affordable roofing in Calgary”), Mats was able to help his clients earn more revenue from their ad spends and dominate their local markets. It was a super-effective strategy—he could test and optimize much faster on landing pages and get higher conversion rates compared to competitors who were still sending traffic to their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was a (metaphorical) ceiling that blocked how much Mats could grow this business. He simply couldn’t be everywhere at once, and hiring loads more people wasn’t an option for him at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What were my resources like?

So, he started brainstorming some of the different ways he could generate leads to attract more roofing clients—without giving him a ton of extra work on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Late last year, I set a goal for myself. ‘We&#8217;re going to reach X amount of customers.’ And step by step, I set out to make it happen.

He figured that if they could use a mouse, they could build a landing page in Unbounce.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I needed a tool that would be easy not just for myself, but also for my clients to use.

In exchange, he would earn <strong>20% recurring revenue for every referral</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I launched [the training program] back in November, and that&#8217;s been my sole focus.

Rather than get bogged down in the day-to-day management of each new client, he would be able to set them up with the skills, strategies, and tools to be successful online (and then offer his services to help them keep scaling). Like the old adage says, “Give a roofer a fish, and you feed them for a day. But give a roofer a crash course in landing pages, and you feed them for life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the word out about his new training program, Mats decided to use a series of Facebook Ads that would specifically target roofers. He used long-form storytelling to get their attention, and then routed them to a registration landing page to sign up for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Facebook-Ad-Moy-Consulting.png\" alt=\"An example of a Facebook ad Mats used to attract leads\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\"><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Mats uses long-form storytelling in his Facebook ads to get the attention of roofers.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But Mats wasn’t sending roofers to any old landing page—he was sending them to a landing page powered by <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/\">Unbounce Smart Traffic</a><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. This was key because Mats was still juggling a lot of responsibilities in his role. He had to run the training course <em>and</em> manage his clients, so he didn’t want to be running small-scale A/B tests on his lunch break, too.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"editors-note\">\n    <p><strong>What’s the Smart Traffic advantage?</strong> Using machine learning, Smart Traffic boosts your conversion rates by <em>automagically</em> sending visitors to the landing page variant that&#8217;s most relevant. These split-second routing decisions are more accurate than a human-powered test and eliminate most of the manual hassles—and long wait times—marketers associate with traditional testing. <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/\">Learn more about how Smart Traffic works here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Instead, Mats whipped up a bunch of different variants to test new headlines and imagery on the page. Then, he used the Unbounce machine learning algorithm to automatically route visitors to the version they were most likely to convert on. No muss, no fuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Moy-Consulting-Smart-Traffic-Variants.png\" alt=\"Smart Traffic variants testing different headlines for Moy Consulting\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\"><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Some of the different headlines Mats is testing with Smart Traffic.

If you’re really busy, or you don&#8217;t have that optimization experience, Smart Traffic will be your new best friend. It&#8217;s using machine learning to help you get those better results.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Blowing the Roof Off With 5x Growth in 6 Months</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months later, Mats has gone from having <strong>15 clients to over 80</strong>. And while this type of breakneck growth might have been unsustainable for him before, the lead gen training course has proven to be a reliable source of new leads for his business. He’s netting an 8% conversion rate on the registration landing page and seeing <strong>a conversion lift of over 35% with the help of Smart Traffic</strong>. (In other words, he&#8217;d be getting less than a 6% conversion rate if he were running these variants in a traditional A/B test.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has given Mats the confidence to <strong>grow his team and bring on four other marketers</strong> to assist with Moy Consulting. (Which means he can also finally put away his juggling gloves, because this is no longer a one-man show.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Clients are happy with the program. I have people raving about it. So they&#8217;re seeing leads. It&#8217;s unlike anything that&#8217;s out there. And that&#8217;s the best part, knowing that your success comes from the success of your clients. That’s awesome.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Moy-Consulting-Smart-Traffic-Metrics.png\" alt=\"The Unbounce dashboard showing a Smart Traffic conversion lift\" class=\"wp-image-96526\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\"><figcaption class=\"blog-photo-annotation\">Mats is seeing a conversion lift of over 35% (!!!) with Smart Traffic.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of client success, Mats is also using Smart Traffic on his clients’ roofing pages too. In some cases, he’s been able to bring the cost-per-lead down from <strong>$160 to as low as $40</strong>, and <strong>get conversion rates as high as 19% (with an incredible 70% lift from Smart Traffic)</strong>. That’s well above the 2.6% median for the home improvement industry, according to the <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report/#about_this_report\">2020 Conversion Benchmark Report</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You can hear it in my voice&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty damn proud of some of the metrics that we&#8217;ve been able to gather and get from these campaigns.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For marketers still on the fence about Smart Traffic, Mats says he gets it. These are still early days for machine learning and some folks will need more time to shift their mindsets and come around to this new way of optimizing and testing.&#160;But as a busy marketer with a lot on his plate, Mats has found a ton of value in his new AI sidekick. Smart Traffic is augmenting his natural marketing skills and running in the background to optimize his campaigns with a speed and accuracy humans can’t match.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-photo\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-96860\" src=\"https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Blog_SmartTraffic_Quote_Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Mats Moy, Moy Consulting\" width=\"83\" height=\"83\"/></a></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Smart traffic has given me back so much time on a day-to-day basis, instead of having to constantly split test different landing pages.
