We’ve got lots to look at in today’s article. Mikhail steps in once again for a guest review, this time looking at<em> Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em>. There are a couple of news items to look at, several new releases, and a Mini-View of <em>9th Dawn III</em>. On top of that, there’s a rather robust list of new sales to check out, alongside the outgoing discounts. Let’s check it out!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Pokemon’ Returns to ‘Tetris 99’ in the 17th Maximus Cup</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273062\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th.jpg 1200w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>The second half of the <em>Pokemon Sword/Shield</em> Expansion Pass is hitting next week, and <em>Tetris 99</em> is in the mood to celebrate. The 17th Maximus Cup event is dedicated to <em>Pokemon Sword/Shield</em>, giving you another chance to earn its theme. This time around, you’ll only need 50 points to permanently unlock it. If you already have the theme, there’s nothing new on offer here. Oh well! The event kicks off on Friday, October 16th and runs through October 19th.</p> \n<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch Online ‘Overwatch’ Trial Begins Today</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272823\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial.jpg 1200w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>In case you forgot about it, the free one-week trial of Blizzard’s <em>Overwatch</em> begins today for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.

The game will be discounted in the eShop for a short while after the trial in case you want to pick it up, and your progress from the trial will carry over.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?! ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273019\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7.jpeg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>The original<em> Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> is one of my most played games on iPad. It obviously was designed for PC but it felt perfect on iPad just like <em>FTL</em>. The chaotic time management gameplay and soothing music blended in perfectly. When Vertigo Gaming announced a sequel, I was excited for it. I played and enjoyed <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!</em> but it was lacking when it came to progression like the first game. Thankfully, the core gameplay held up and <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> is finally here on all consoles after an extended early access period on Steam.</p> \n<p>Vertigo Gaming clearly learned from <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!</em> because <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> is an improvement in every aspect and one that has the best of prior games and its own generous serving of delicious new content. <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em>‘s campaign is set in a war torn America where your restaurant has been destroyed. Your aim is to build up your reputation and life with the help of a food truck that takes you all over the place serving various dishes to people. The campaign is playable solo and in co-op. On Nintendo Switch, you can even use a single joy-con each to play it on the go. It works well. You slowly earn things to customize your food truck with as well and unlock the ability to upgrade it early on.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273021\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Barring accessibility options like screen shake and visual tweaks, <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> has a chill mode option. This ensures you can only earn up to a silver medal in each level but gives you infinite time to prepare and serve customers. It is a nice compromise to allow players who find the core gameplay a bit too difficult. I would definitely recommend playing it on standard mode first and only resorting to this if you find yourself struggling.</p> \n<p>If you’ve not played a <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> game before, you need to cook dishes using different ingredients by pressing the face buttons and dealing with timers. Once your dish is ready to be served, you either use the right stick to automatically serve it or prepare it to be served by putting the finishing touches depending on the dish. As you zip between locations in your food truck, you can and should make some things at the holding stations so you save time and can cater to more people quicker. Being able to automatically serve a lot of food while you prepare other food is one of the best new features Vertigo Gaming have brought to this series.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273022\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> is definitely a big step up in production values and this carries over into the art, animations, and more subtle things like visual cues and the interface. The food all looks gorgeous as expected but there are a few minor performance issues on Nintendo Switch. Sometimes, the prepping station or item you need to prepare will take a second or two longer to load in as compared to the PC version which loads up instantly. Compared to <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!</em> on Nintendo Switch, <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> takes a bit longer in some of these situations. Barring those, it is an absolute joy to play on Switch in both portable and docked mode.</p> \n<p><em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> is known for great audio through the sound design for food and the superlative music from Jonathan Greer. His music for<em> Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> is brilliant. This is easily one of my favorite soundtracks of the year with its upbeat tunes. A lot of the tunes also remind me of <em>Katamari Damacy</em>‘s music which is never a bad thing.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273024\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>While<em> Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!</em> and<em> 3?!</em> aren’t on iOS yet, I’m glad that the games have touch controls on Nintendo Switch. It takes a little bit of getting used to but you can play <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> with touch controls on Nintendo Switch. Some of the touch targets are smaller than they should be on a regular Switch. I could barely complete levels on a Switch Lite with touch controls though. Using a stylus might be a better option on that if you’d prefer not using the button controls.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, the button controls work brilliantly. I just struggled a little because I always have trouble moving between Xbox One and Nintendo Switch controllers for games that rely on quick inputs thanks to both controllers having different face button positions.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273025\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B.jpeg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> takes the best of the first two games and brings so much more with better progression, more food, accessibility options, and more to be the ultimate cooking game. I already loved the first <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> game and while the second entry was a step forward in many ways, it also regressed.<em> Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</em> is everything I wanted from this franchise and more. <em>-Mikhail Madnani</em></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4.5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>Mini-Views</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>9th Dawn III ($15.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272796\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>I have a full review of the iOS version of<em> 9th Dawn III</em> that is either up already or soon to be up, and I recommend checking that for details on the game itself. It’s a really awesome follow-up and a great action-RPG to sink tons of time into. This Switch version is also quite good, but its interface is a little harder to work with in places using the controller. It’s also set at a higher price. On the positive side, you can easily get a local co-op game going and that is indeed a hoot. It’s a game I would enthusiastically recommend to any fan of RPGs, but if you have a mobile device capable of playing it and don’t mind playing there, I’d probably be inclined to nudge you towards that version over this one.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 4.5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273063\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>I don’t know, Prinny. <em>Can</em> you? You’ll have to be exceptionally lucky because you are one of one thousand Prinnies and this game is <em>really</em> hard. Making its way over from the PlayStation Portable (and it really shows), <em>Prinny</em> is a tough side-scroller that pays homage to classics like <em>Ghouls ‘n Ghosts</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>. The cheeky sense of humor that <em>Disgaea</em> is known for is here in full force, with the whole purpose of the Prinnies’ adventure being to replace Etna’s dessert that someone stole. To counter the heavy challenge, you’re given a whopping 1000 lives to clear the game with. It’s a pretty fun game and it plays well on the Switch, but there’s a somewhat ugly graphical filter that makes things look blurrier than I’d like.</p> \n<h3><strong>Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood! ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273064\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The first game did well enough that Prinny got a <em>second</em> chance to be the hero. This time around the mission is to recover Etna’s stolen panties from the mysterious Phantom Thief before she loses all patience and transforms the Prinnies into replacement panties. In terms of gameplay not a whole lot has changed here aside from some adjustments to the combo meter. Just a batch of new levels, enemies, and bosses to battle. Like its predecessor, it’s quite tough. Also like its predecessor, this is a relatively bare-bones port from the PSP with a slightly unappealing blur filter slapped over top of everything. I’ll have reviews of both of these in the coming days.</p> \n<h3><strong>Remothered: Broken Porcelain ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273065\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p><em>Resident Evil</em> may well be more popular than it has ever been before at the moment, but some fans pine for the clunkier days of old where movement was more awkward and things were less action-y. It’s that sort that really got into <em>Remothered: Tormented Fathers</em>, a very old-school survival-horror game that offered plenty of spooks and thrills wrapped up in an interesting if somewhat cheesy story. Well friends, <em>Remothered</em> is back. If you enjoyed the first game, you’ll be right at home here. Make careful use of the limited resources you’ll find in the Ashmann Inn to try to uncover its secrets and get out alive. Solve puzzles, absorb the atmosphere, and be careful not to bump into anything you can’t handle. Which, to be frank, covers most things in this game.</p> \n<h3><strong>Robotics;Notes Elite ($34.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273066\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The third main installment in the Science Adventure series of visuals novels best-known for its second chapter <em>Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes</em> comes to us in English for the very first time in this <em>Elite</em> version of the game. You take the role of Kaito Yashio, a member of the school robot club who is inspired to build his own fighting robot. From this simple plot an absolutely wild series of events ensues, though I’m sure those familiar with <em>Steins;Gate</em> won’t be surprised by that. I don’t think this one reaches quite the same heights as <em>Steins;Gate</em>, but it’s still an excellent experience that is worth diving into.</p> \n<h3><strong>Robotics;Notes DaSH ($34.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273067\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>And then there’s <em>DaSH</em>. Look, these follow-up games tend to just be fanservice for people that loved the original story and want to squeeze a bit more out of the characters or setting. As such, they’re almost never up to the standards of the original. How much worse they end up tends to vary. <em>DaSH</em>… is really not where it needs to be. Its plot heavily involves Itaru Hashida (Daru) from<em> Steins;Gate</em> and it uses a similar premise where all heck breaks loose from seemingly innocuous circumstances, but I feel like it ends up undermining the original game’s narrative a bit <em>too</em> much. This one’s really only recommended for super-fans who don’t mind when the follow-ups go off the rails.</p> \n<h3><strong>G.I. Joe: Operation Blackout ($39.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273068\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>When I was a kid, I was totally into <em>G.I. Joe</em>, which is pretty weird if you know me well. Or is it? <em>G.I. Joe</em> may have started as a toy line about soldiers but it turned into a franchise about ridiculous superheroes with terrible aim and awesome vehicles. That feeling is more or less preserved in this game, a third-person team-based shooter featuring twelve characters from both sides of the conflict. There are lots of weapons, extra skins, and even some of those classic vehicles. The campaign can be played solo or in local co-op with a second player, and a variety of multiplayer modes are on offer for up to four players to battle locally. I want to believe this will be the game that breaks Game Mill’s pattern of mediocre offerings, but if knowing is half the battle I refuse to give up my advantage to the enemy.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></p> \n<p>Hey, those are some decent new discounts for a Tuesday. enjoyable adventures like <em>Milkmaid of the Milky Way,</em> nice arcade-style jams like <em>The Bug Butcher</em> and <em>Atomik: RunGunJumpGun</em>, and even some chunkier experiences like <em>Vaporum</em>.

I hope you all have a terrific Tuesday, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:29:02 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th.jpg","linkMd5":"88215a5cd2509d0b40c38ad530007323","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-21-132_47043005f8c6103c.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":675,"sourceBytes":218178,"destBytes":218178,"author":"Shaun Musgrave","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tetris99maximus17th.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-21-132_47043005f8c6103c.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/overwatchtrial.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn47@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-22-857_efca04865a207a96.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/E9C5DFFC-83F2-4FAE-AEBE-0E18D6F0FFF7.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-22-967_9c36f89bd7b3d594.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/78C32B8A-6082-4502-9EFC-90A24FBA6DB3.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn28@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-22-882_127f610883799a63.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/89AFEFC0-3236-418C-B2D7-4B06C8BF2F2F.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-22-856_83da7760d0d2f9d1.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5C79885E-6CD2-483E-A5A9-5C7CD8AD4D41.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn61@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-22-971_08e381dd4936182a.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A7AD34B3-5F9E-4943-ABDA-B2188F29D47B.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn70@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-22-895_1ecb820af496b9f9.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9thdawniii.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn37@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-22-925_23d2a0bd49199027.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinnycanireallybethehero.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn53@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-22-876_8ad44e645c7f1900.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/prinny2dawnofoperation.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn45@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-22-854_d579e44a3b17373f.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/remotheredbrokenporcelain.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn29@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-23-080_b8a8c337a4c7b945.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/robioticsnoteselite.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-23-028_5a1f14d850322a67.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roboticsnotesdash.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn33@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-22-880_885ef7d40cadc507.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gijoeoperationblackout.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn57@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-23-170_95a256645bd861c7.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/milkmaidofthemilkyway.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn49@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-22-895_49cd3b5ff4c5978a.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unboxnewbiesadventure.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-22-890_fec6ba3cb9ed70a0.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/touchdownpinball.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn63@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-45-219_56b0362a26dde03e.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000thduel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn23@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-22-887_e7d98c5f9c2dcf08.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dukenukem3d20thanniversary.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn42@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-22-951_2c10b512696e058e.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/grasscuttermutatedlawns.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn44@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-22-848_0fa00ad462ea1e29.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/packmaster.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-22-859_7237d4ba76d32dd9.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/strikeysisters.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-23-114_08cafde5e7d6f14e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641240259},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:20","title":"‘The Pathless’ Device Requirements Revealed for Apple Arcade Ahead of Release Date","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=273083","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"https://toucharcade.com/games/the-pathless\" style=\"float:left;

It was initially only planned for PS4 and PC platforms but is also coming to Apple Arcade and PS5 at launch. Sony has showcased it a few times as one of the PS5 launch games. A release date was <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/10/01/the-pathless-release-date-ps5-apple-arcade-ps4-pc-giant-squid/\">recently confirmed</a> for <em>The Pathless</em> and the App Store page for <em>The Pathless</em> on Apple Arcade just went live today. This page has revealed how demanding <em>The Pathless</em> is on iOS. While the service gets many exclusives or timed exclusives, <em>The Pathless</em> is a showcase next-generation console launch game that is launching on Apple Arcade at the same time. It is going to be interesting to see if more games like this push people to upgrade their iOS devices sooner. Watch the new release date trailer for <em>The Pathless</em> below:</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/amOG5zk3-DI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p><em>The Pathless</em> will run on the following iOS devices: </p> \n<p>iPhone 7th generation and later<br /> iPhone SE 2nd generation<br /> iPad 6th generation and later<br /> iPad Air 3rd generation and later<br /> iPad Pro 2nd generation and later<br /> iPad mini 5th generation and later<br /> iPod touch 7th generation</p> \n<p>I’m definitely excited to check out <em>The Pathless</em> when it arrives. I’ll play it on iOS and then replay it on PS5 eventually if I enjoy it enough. For Apple Arcade, you can play it in your subscription as usual. Check it out <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/in/app/the-pathless/id1441675155\">here</a> on the App Store for Apple Arcade ahead of its November 12th release date.

When Valorware first brought <em>9th Dawn</em> to mobile a whopping seven years ago, it was an impressive throwback to an era of RPGs where the graphics were limited but the worlds seemed nearly limitless. <em>9th Dawn II</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1076717689?mt=8\">($1.99)</a> arrived a few years later, polishing some rough edges and expanding the possibilities of the world it put in your pocket. Now here in the cursed year of 2020,<em> 9th Dawn III</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1528353612?mt=8\">($9.99)</a> arrives. So many things have changed, but one thing remains the same: the <em>9th Dawn</em> games are <em>really</em> hard to put down once you get into them.</p> \n<p>The quick version, for those who want it. <em>9th Dawn III</em> is the latest in a line of incredibly rich 2D open world action-RPGs. Inspired by classic games like <em>Ultima</em> (and <em>Ultima Online</em> in particular), these games are overflowing with places to explore, things to do, monsters to slay, and treasures to find. While they aren’t the most impressive of games from a visual standpoint, you’d be hard-pressed to find another mobile RPG series that gives you so many pure opportunities for adventure. You will be richly rewarded for wandering off the path. If you feel like spending hours fishing or making a variety of dishes to upgrade your cooking skill, feel free. Want to get into some trouble? Oh yeah. There are lots of ways to do that.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273098\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj.png 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>The combat uses an initially odd but eventually highly intuitive twin-stick system where you move with the left and aim your attacks with the right. There are lots of different weapons to use, plus a wide variety of magic spells. A handy bar allows you to set up your favorite skills, abilities, and items to use at the tap of a button. The overall world is massive, with plenty of towns, dungeons, and other points of interest scattered liberally throughout. The dungeons are often huge, with multiple entrances, exits, and secrets to explore.</p> \n<p>The list of quests is equally impressive, with most towns offering up plenty of ways for the intrepid explorer to make some coin. Just keep an eye on the time, as all of the townspeople have schedules of their own. You won’t be able to buy a sword at three in the morning in most places. Of course, you can always just catch a bit of shut-eye yourself to pass the time. It beats wandering around in the dangerous wilderness in the dark too much. There is a main story to work on as well, naturally. Some business about saving the land, an evil king, and forces of darkness. The usual. It’s not so pressing. Feel free to keep on practicing your soup recipes.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273099\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN.png 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>If you haven’t played the previous game in a while, you might initially struggle to see what is new about<em> 9th Dawn III</em> beyond the new setting. There are some big, obvious changes. No jumping anymore, thankfully. There’s a card game you can play against the denizens of the world, because you have to have one of those these days. You can recruit monster buddies! That’s a fun thing. But the biggest and best improvements are less immediately clear. Things like maps to keep you from getting hopelessly lost. More side activities to engage in. Better guidance for players who are less interested in getting lost.<em> 9th Dawn III</em> is more than happy for you to carve your own tales in its pages, but it’s a lot better about helping those who just want to save the world.</p> \n<p>Still, all of the things that made the previous games so charming are here. Plenty of places where you can imagine what went down if you think about it, but won’t be directly told. A wild amount of optional content for those who push themselves just a little bit further in directions they’re not directed towards. The genuinely strange characters who say the oddest things at times. Even things that seemed rough several years ago, but that I wouldn’t want the series to give up now, like the way characters flip around like <em>Paper Mario</em> or the odd bit of fourth-wall breaking. No, you aren’t going to confuse this for<em> Elder Scrolls</em> or<em> Genshin Impact</em> in terms of its presentation, but I like that it unabashedly feels like the indie production that it is.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcySnX0_voA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Some good news that likely comes partially as a result of its multi-platform status: you can use an MFi controller to play the game. It has its advantages and disadvantages. It can be easier to play with a controller, but many of the functions work better with touch or a mouse. It’s nice to have the option, at least. One thing I wish were here, given the abundance of platforms<em> 9th Dawn III</em> is available on and how much time I’ve invested in playing it, is cross-platform saves. The developer is apparently investigating whether or not something like that is possible, and I’d sure love to see it.</p> \n<p>With several years between the first game and the third one, the <em>9th Dawn</em> series now spans a number of eras in mobile gaming. But it has always been true to what it wanted to offer from the start, which is a world of adventures and memories on your mobile device with no nonsense weighing it down.<em> 9th Dawn III</em> is by leaps and bounds the easiest of the series to get into, and that’s an important step forward as once you get into these games, you won’t get out for a very long time indeed. Just one more quest, one more dive into that crypt, one more round of fishing, one more card game, one more tough monster defeated. And so it goes, until the sun rises on another new day. Don’t miss this one, my RPG-loving friends.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 22:59:03 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1528353612/100x100bb.jpg","linkMd5":"dbb4dd41cc9655344a7f3ef381b3fac6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-21-325_9038b68a12df4fe5.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":100,"sourceBytes":4184,"destBytes":4184,"author":"Shaun Musgrave","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1528353612/100x100bb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-21-325_9038b68a12df4fe5.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yfqujRj.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn26@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-22-972_7c6723a43e28e441.webp","https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Of1jKTN.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-36-056_9e4a43cd1956a633.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641240251},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:20","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:07:20","title":"‘Call of Duty: Mobile’ Season 11 Anniversary Update Is Out Now with a New Battle Pass Coming Soon, New Maps, XP Card Changes, and a Lot More","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=273079","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"https://toucharcade.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1287282214/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/10/04/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-call-of-duty-mobile/\">Call of Duty: Mobile</a></em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1287282214?mt=8\">(Free)</a> from Activision and Tencent has been getting <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/03/02/call-of-duty-mobile-disavowed-battle-pass-season-4-zombies-mode-removed-date-ios-android-free/\">updated regularly</a> since it debuted on iOS and Android with new content and fixes across its various seasons.
